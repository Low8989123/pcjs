title: Running DOS Software from the Command-Line

Recently, I've been working on a command-line utility that uses PCjs machines to run DOS software on modern operating systems, and it's called, aptly enough, `pc.js`.

Let's run through a few examples.  All you need to get started is:

  1. Install [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org)
  2. Clone the [pcjs](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs) repository (eg, `git clone https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs.git`)
  3. CD into `pcjs` and run `npm install`

For the examples below, I'm using Ubuntu Linux (hence the `$` prompt), but I've also tested `pc.js` on **macOS** and **Windows**.  If you run into issues, take a look at the [pc.js](/tools/pc/) page on the [PCjs](https://www.pcjs.org) website.

I also recommend adding the "pcjs/tools/pc" and "pcjs/tools/diskimage" directories to your PATH, so that you can run `pc.js` and `diskimage.js` from any location.  Alternatively, you can always use relative paths, like I've used in the examples.

The first example is a simple use case that doesn't involve any disks, just running some BASIC commands from the original IBM PC's built-in BASIC interpreter.

    $ cd tools/pc
    $ pc.js ibm5150 --nofloppy
    Press CTRL-D to enter command mode, CTRL-C to terminate pc.js

    1LIST   2RUN←   3LOAD"  4SAVE"  5CONT←  6,"LPT1 7TRON←  8TROFF← 9KEY    0SCREEN 
    The IBM Personal Computer Basic

    print 2+2
    4 
    Ok 
    10 for i=1 to 10:print "hello world";i:next i
    list
    10 FOR I=1 TO 10:PRINT "hello world";I:NEXT I                                   
    Ok 
    run
    hello world 1 
    hello world 2 
    hello world 3 
    hello world 4 
    hello world 5 
    hello world 6 
    hello world 7 
    hello world 8 
    hello world 9 
    hello world 10 
    Ok 

So what just happened?  BASICally, `pc.js` started an IBM PC Model 5150 with ROM BASIC, routing all text output to your terminal window and converting all text input into IBM PC keyboard presses, providing a reasonably seamless experience.  That first line of output:

    1LIST   2RUN←   3LOAD"  4SAVE"  5CONT←  6,"LPT1 7TRON←  8TROFF← 9KEY    0SCREEN 

is a list of supported function keys that would *normally* appear on the bottom (25th) row of an IBM PC monitor, but `pc.js` makes no attempt to render characters at specific screen locations -- it simply outputs characters in the same order that the machine displays them.

As for the **Press CTRL-D to enter command mode** message at the beginning, `pc.js` is just letting you know that CTRL-D will allow you to stop the machine and enter what it calls "command mode".  If the machine also includes the PCjs debugger, command mode gives you access to all PCjs debugger commands, too.

From command mode, you can also press **CTRL-C to terminate pc.js** (or use the "quit" command).  If you're not in command mode, then **CTRL-C** just does whatever it's supposed to do inside the machine.  To exit command mode and continue running the machine, use the "g" (go) command.

Getting back to the first example above, let's press CTRL-D for the `pc.js` command mode prompt, and then use the `quit` command to get back to the operating system prompt.

      load [machine] or [drive] [search terms]
      quit
    type "?" for a list of debugger commands (eg, "g" to continue running)
    >> quit
    $

Now let's dive into a much more interesting example.  Imagine we have small collection of DOS files and programs that we'd like to run.  There's a PCjs hard disk image we can use for this demonstration, so let's download and extract it using the PCjs [diskimage.js](/tools/diskimage/) utility:

    $ ../diskimage/diskimage.js --disk https://harddisks.pcjs.org/pcx86/10mb/MSDOS320-C400.json --extract
    DiskImage v3.00
    Copyright © 2012-2023 Jeff Parsons <Jeff@pcjs.org>
    Options: --disk https://harddisks.pcjs.org/pcx86/10mb/MSDOS320-C400.json --extract
    processing: MSDOS320-C400 (10653696 bytes, checksum 3014829503, hash none)
    extracting: CONFIG.SYS
    extracting: COMMAND.COM
    extracting: AUTOEXEC.BAT
    extracting: DOS/ANSI.SYS
    extracting: DOS/APPEND.COM
    extracting: DOS/ASSIGN.COM
    extracting: DOS/ATTRIB.EXE
    extracting: DOS/CHKDSK.EXE
    ...

All the files and folders are extracted into a directory with the same name as the disk image, so let's change to that directory now:

    $ cd MSDOS320-C400
    $ ls
    AUTOEXEC.BAT  COMMAND.COM  CONFIG.SYS  DOS  PUZZLED  TMP  TOOLS
    $ 

To run a program from that folder, such as the DOS `CHKDSK` utility, just run `pc.js` with name of the program, including any arguments it might need:

    $ ../pc.js chkdsk
    Press CTRL-D to enter command mode, CTRL-C to terminate pc.js

    C>ECHO OFF

If the DOS command you want to run includes wildcards (eg, `DIR *.*`), put it in quotes to prevent your shell from expanding them:

    $ ../pc.js "dir *.*"
    Press CTRL-D to enter command mode, CTRL-C to terminate pc.js

    C:\TOOLS\C4DEMO>return
    $

That last command, `return`, runs a special program that `pc.js` automatically includes with the machine, to gracefully return to your own operating system.

And, if you take a peek inside the folder that corresponds to `C:\TOOLS\C4DEMO`, you'll see that all the files created by the Microsoft C Compiler, such as `DEMO.EXE` and `SIEVE.EXE` have been preserved:

    $ ls -l TOOLS/C4DEMO
    total 40
    -rw-rw-r-- 1    419 Jun 27  1986 DEMO.C
    -rw-rw-r-- 1   6402 Jul 15 09:50 DEMO.EXE
    -rw-rw-r-- 1    391 Jul 15 09:50 DEMO.OBJ
    -rw-rw-r-- 1    788 Jun 27  1986 SIEVE.C
    -rw-rw-r-- 1  14662 Jul 15 09:50 SIEVE.EXE
    -rw-rw-r-- 1    494 Jul 15 09:50 SIEVE.OBJ

Whenever you run `pc.js` with a DOS command or program name, it automatically builds a 10Mb hard disk image containing all the files and folder from your current directory, and runs that command or program.  And whenever you terminate `pc.js`, it automatically creates/deletes/updates any files in your current directory that were modified on the 10Mb hard disk.

### Loading Diskettes

`pc.js` includes another special program with the machine (`load`) which makes it easy for you to load any diskette image from the PCjs diskette library into your machine.  The syntax of the `load` command is:

    load [drive] [search terms]

Let's say we want to load "PC-SIG Library Disk #1234" into the machine's A: drive.  Start `pc.js` with any DOS command to automatically build and start a machine (I used the DOS `ver` command this time) and then type `load a: pc-sig 1234` to load the matching diskette into drive A:

    $ ../pc.js ver
    Press CTRL-D to enter command mode, CTRL-C to terminate pc.js

    C>ECHO OFF

    MS-DOS Version 3.20

If your search terms match more than one diskette in the library, a numbered list of matches is displayed, and then you can load the desired diskette by number:

    C:\>load a: pc-sig #123

    2: PC-SIG Library Disk #1231

Any files that you're interested in can be copied to the C: drive, and when you type `return`, those files should be automatically transferred to your current directory.

### More To Come

There's a lot more to cover with the new `pc.js` utility, which is still a "work-in-progress", but hopefully this is enough to get the ball rolling.

Only text-based "standard I/O" DOS programs are usable in this environment, so if you run a program that switches to graphics mode or writes directly to video memory, don't expect to see anything.

There are currently no options to change the default drive type (10Mb) but it is possible to specify alternate machine configurations *and* alternate operating systems to install on the drive.  Run `pc.js --help` from the command-line for some quick guidance, and check the [PC.js](/tools/pc/) page for more detailed information -- both will be updated as the utility evolves.
