Below are documents from the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.ias.edu/)'s [Electronic Computer Project (1946-1954)](https://www.ias.edu/electronic-computer-project),
describing the evolution of an "electronic computing instrument", which would become the first stored-program computer based on the "von Neumann architecture."

Why are these documents here?  Partly because they are historically important, but mostly because we would like to add an ECP simulation to the collection
of PCjs machines -- someday.

A complete list of documents can be found on the Institute's [Libraries and Archives](https://library.ias.edu/ecp) website.  Unfortunately,
the site notes, without explanation, that "[n]ot all of these documents will be scanned."

Let me venture a guess as to why: because other organizations digitized them first, and
despite their "not-for-profit" status, they want to profit from this work.  For example, the paper entitled "Fast Carry Logic for Digital
Computers" by Bruce Gilchrist, James H. Pomerene, and S. Y. Wong, is only available for [purchase](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5219482) from IEEE.
