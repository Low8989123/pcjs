The PCjs Library contains documentation for various hardware and software featured on the website.  Some of it was from my own personal collection, but much of it was obtained from [bitsavers.org](http://bitsavers.org/), with additional hardware resources from [minuszerodegrees.net](http://minuszerodegrees.net/) and assorted software documentation from the [OS/2 Museum](http://www.os2museum.com/wp/) and the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org).

Unfortunately, I did not always do a good job of recording where a given document (or piece of software) came from.  Going forward, I hope to be more conscientious, and in the documentation displayed below, you'll now see that many documents include a link to the original `[Source]`.  However, there's no guarantee that that source is definitive, or the best available, or even still in existence; it is simply where I happened to obtain a copy.

Over the years, I've also added to my personal collection with physical copies of software and documentation from ebay and generous PCjs users, which I've scanned and posted as well.  In those cases, no source link is displayed; internally, the source is recorded as `PCjs`.

For example, I purchased and scanned a complete collection of [PC Tech Journal](/documents/magazines/pctj/) magazines and posted them here; someone else later downloaded those scans and uploaded them to the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/pctechjournal), but their source is still `PCjs`.

## Organization

As you can see from the {% include explorer/link.html %}, each piece of documentation is filed under one of three general areas: **Hardware**, **Software**, or **Documents**.  The idea is to have a single page for a given machine and its manuals, or for a given piece of software and its manuals.  Anything else (ie, any document not created by the manufacturer of a piece of hardware or software featured here) is filed under an appropriate category within **Documents**.

There are a few gray areas.  For example, there are programming books that also came with supplemental software, and in a few cases, I have archived that software supplement as well.  So, because this is primarily a software-driven site, and to keep related materials together as much as possible, such a book will generally be filed with its **Software**, with a reference to the book within **Documents**.

For example, see [Graphics for the IBM PC](/software/pcx86/sw/books/graphics_for_the_ibm_pc/), which is filed under **Software** / **IBM PC** / **Shareware** / **Books**.  However, you will also find the book referenced under **Documents** / **Books** / **Programming**, in the section titled "[Books with Software](/documents/books/programming/#books-with-software)".
