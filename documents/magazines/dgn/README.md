**DosGetNews()** was an internal Microsoft newsletter started in 1988 that helped keep all the
Microsoft employees working on OS/2 up-to-date on the state of the project.

As the first (May 11, 1988) issue explained:

> Welcome to the first edition of the new OS/2-JDA GROUPS Weekly Newsletter: DosGetNews().  We hope
that you will find this publication full of useful (and sometimes entertaining) OS/2-JDA news.
DosGetNews() will be published every Wednesday and will be full of information on OS/2 Base AND
Presentation Manager, future projects, new product discussions, interviews with various personnel and
announcements on a variety of departmental activities.

PCjs has unearthed copies of these newsletters below for your historical enjoyment.
