Microsoft used to provide a [1986-2000 Index](https://web.archive.org/web/20040711061240/http://www.microsoft.com/msj/backissues.aspx)
of Microsoft Systems Journal issues.  Unfortunately, only selected articles (from 1995 to 2000) were made available online, and then at some point in 2018,
Microsoft abandoned the MSDN index altogether -- an unfortunate trend (see "[Corporations Are Crappy Archivists](/blog/2017/10/13/)" for more sadness).

Fortunately, we have a few early Microsoft Systems Journal issues for your out-dated programming enjoyment, including the first issue from October 1986
and the OS/2 Issue from May 1987.
