As of July 2019, this is no longer the *nearly complete* collection -- it is now **complete**, at least as far
as regular issues are concerned.  It took several years of checking eBay and waiting for a few remaining issues to
become available, but my patience (and yours) has now been rewarded.

I may still be missing some *special* issues, similar to the [1987 PC Tech Journal Directory](#pctj-1987-00), but
it's hard to say, since I don't have a complete publication schedule.

I've also created links to all the [Microsoft Languages NewsLetters](/documents/magazines/mln/) that were published
in PC Tech Journal, as well as an assortment of [PC Tech Journal Disks](/software/pcx86/sw/magazines/pctj/) containing
published source code listings and more.
