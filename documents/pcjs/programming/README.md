The first additions to the [PCjs Document Archive](/documents/pcjs/) are some notes I created in 1984,
detailing my early adventures in PC debugging: disassembling and disabling [dBASE III Copy Protection](#dbase-iii-copy-protection).
You can read more about it in my blog post, "[dBASE III Copy Protection Revisited](/blog/2017/08/11/)",
or check out the original [diskettes](/software/pcx86/app/other/dbase3/1.0/).
