Any of the original Lite-Brite images below can be turned on underneath our virtual [Lite-Brite](/machines/led/lite-brite), to help you recreate the image with LEDs.
However, it’s difficult to find decent high-quality images of those original 1967 patterns, and tricky to get them to line up properly, so a little “artistic interpretation” is required.
