[The following information is from a 7-page Intel document titled "[80286(B-2/B-3) Information Sheet, 21 November 1984](/documents/manuals/intel/80286/files/80286_B2_B3_Errata-1984-11-21.pdf)"]

### 80286 B-2/B-3 Steppings

This applies to S-spec #40093 and to S-spec #54012 of the 80286, since they contain a (B-2/B-3) stepping of the 80286.
Their complete parametric specifications are given by the datasheet in the 1984 Intel Microsystem Components Handbook,
order number 230843.

### Errata Items

Below are full descriptions of any problem the 80286(8-2/B-3) is known to have, for your information when using this
powerful processor. These items will be corrected in subsequent versions of the 80286:

#### Pullup Busy and Error Inputs

> The BUSY and ERROR inputs do not have internal pullup resistors. If these inputs are left unconnected,
the 80286 may stop execution or perform interrupt 16 when an ESC or WAIT instruction is executed. This problem
is avoided by connecting 20K pullup resistors from Vee to these inputs. These pullup resistors will assure that
WAIT and ESC instructions are handled properly when an 80287 is not present. This change is compatible with
later versions of the 80286 which will include internal pullups on those two pins.
	
#### Coprocessor Operand Partially Beyond Limit of ERC Segment

> This is a possible minor limit violation involving the 80287 coprocessor that goes undetected by the 80286.
If a coprocessor operand is read from an "executable and readable and conforming" (abbreviated ERC) code segment,
and the coprocessor operand is sufficiently near the segment's limit that the second or subsequent byte lies outside
the limit, no protection exception #9 will be generated. Note that this occurs only when at least the first byte of
the coprocessor's operand lies within a valid ERC code segment. If any other type of segment is involved then
exception #9 is properly generated. If the operand is entirely outside its segment limit, an exception #13 is
properly generated.

#### CLK Input Requirements

> CLK rise and fall times are specified as 7ns maximum, and V(ilc) is specified as 0.4V maximum. Note that 82284's
produced while this stepping of 80286 was in production were tested to meet these temporary requirements of the 286
CLK input.

#### POPF Behavior

> This errata has no effect when interrupts are enabled in either Real Mode or Protected Mode. This errata has no
effect in Protected Mode when CPL > IOPL.

> If the 80286 executes a POPF instruction while interrupts are disabled in either Real Address Mode, or Protected
Mode with CPL < IOPL, then a pending maskable interrupt (INTR pin active) may be improperly recognized after executing
the POPF instruction even if maskable interrupts were disabled before the POPF instruction and the value popped had
IF=0. If the interrupt is improperly recognized, the interrupt is still correctly processed.

> The occurrence of this errata may be slightly affected by the number of wait states during the data-read bus cycle
of the POPF, and by even- or odd-address alignment of stack words. Two additional wait states (after memory-read-data
is valid) added to memory-data-read bus cycles will eliminate the errata, but will incur a performance penalty.

#### Don't Remove Interrupt Signal Early

> When the INTR is activated and external interrupts are enabled, INTR must be held active until the CPU performs the
first INTA bus cycle to process the external interrupt, or else unpredictable CPU behavior could occur. See additional
information [below](./#background-on-early-intr-signal-removal).

#### Nested Interrupts

> When the 80286 is in protected mode, and processes an external interrupt or INT instruction which references an
Interrupt Gate in the IDT, an external interrupt activating the INTR input will be processed if the INTR pin remains
active or goes active anytime between the fifth and tenth bus cycles after the second INTA bus cycle for the first
interrupt. Normally, if an external interrupt references an Interrupt Gate in the IDT, then no further interrupts are
processed, until interrupts are re-enabled within the service routine or by the IRET instruction at the end of the
service routine. Because of this errata, an interrupt routine in protected mode may be interrupted before its first
instruction if the INTR input is active again during the "window" described above.

#### Non-Maskable Interrupt

> When INTR goes active, and then NMI goes active slightly later, exactly during the last internal clock period of the
instruction prior to the INTR being processed, the NMI is not recognized. The probability of this occurring from
asynchronous INTR and NMI events is very unlikely. However, if the same event can activate INTR and NMI, ensure the
NMI pin is activated 10ns before the INTR.

#### Non-Restartable Protection Violations

> The details of this are primarily of interest to an operating system writer.

> The protection violations involved usually indicate a probable software bug and restart is not desired if one of these
violations occurs. In a Protected Mode 80286 system with wait states during any bus cycles, when certain protection
violations are detected by the 80286 component, and the component transfers control to the exception handling routine,
the contents of the CX register may be unreliable. (Whether CX contents are changed is a function of bus activity at the
time internal microcode detects the protection violation.)

> Note that any "not present" exception when a CS, SS, DS or ES segment is "not present" is entirely restartable, for
virtual memory implementation. The protection violations which could lead to unreliable CX contents are below and note
again these violations usually indicate a software bug. Therefore restart is not usually desired after these protection
violations:

> 1. exception #GP(O) from attempted access to data segment or extra segment when the corresponding segment register holds a null selector;
> 2. exception #GP(O) from attempted data read from code segment when code segment has the "execute-only" attribute;
> 3. exception #GP(O) from attempted write to code segment (code segments are not writable), or to data segment or extra segment if the data or extra segment has the "read-only" attribute;
> 4. exception #NP(selector) from attempted load of a selector referencing the local descriptor table into CS, DS, or ES, when the LDT is not present (or exception #SS(selector) if SS);
> 5. exception #GP(O) from attempted input or output instruction when CPL [?] IOPL;
> 6. exception #GP(selector) from attempted access to a descriptor in GDT, LDT, or IDT, beyond the defined limit of the descriptor table;
> 7. exception #GP(O) from attempted read or write (except for "PUSH" onto stack) beyond the defined limit of segment.

> The following protection violation below may also lead to unreliable CX register contents. The following protection violation
is designed to be restartable for dynamically growable stacks, but due to the errata, is not restartable on this stepping in a
system which has wait states in any bus cycles (for example, refresh cycles in system with dynamic memory):

> 8. exception #SS(O) from attempted "PUSH" below the defined limit of the stack segment (restart allows dynamically growable stack segments).

> Notations used above (the value in parentheses indicates the type of error code pushed on exception handler's stack):

> * exception #NP() = exception #11 = Not-Present Fault
> * exception #SS() = exception #12 = Stack Fault
> * exception #GP() = exception #13 = General Protection Fault

#### Loading Null Selector Values Into DS or ES Registers

> This isn't usually a problem, since any of the 4 null selector values are equivalent in purpose. Just be aware of it:
in Protected Mode, when any of the 4 null selector values (the 4 possible null selectors are 0000H, 0001H, 0002H and 0003H)
are loaded into DS or ES registers via a MOV or POP instruction or a task switch, note the 80286 always loads the null
selector 0000H into the corresponding registers. The 80286 will be improved to load all 4 null selector values literally.
In Real Mode all values loaded into DS or ES are of course loaded unaltered.

> ##### Background

> In Protected Mode, the null selector is any selector whose Index bits and Table Indicator bit are all zero. Since the
2-bit RPL field may be 00, 01, 10 or 11, there are 4 possible null selectors. In hex format, the 4 possible null selectors
are 0000H, 0001H, 0002H and 0003H. They all serve as "null" values, and a general protection violation correctly occurs
if software attempts to access the data segment or extra segment when a null selector is in the corresponding segment register.

### Documentation Corrections

> These items are documentation errors to be corrected as soon as possible. Accurate descriptions below are for your information.

#### Single-Stepping The "INT n" Instruction

> To prevent application software from invoking privileged system interrupt routines with the trap flag (single-step flag)
set, the "INT n" instruction disables the Trap Flag if it was previously set. This applies to Real Address mode as well as
Protected Mode, from the B-2 stepping onward. This prevents applications programs from invoking privileged interrupt routines
with the TF set, causing single-stepping of operating system interrupt routines which may be time-critical, for example.
The "INT n" instruction pushes the original flag word (before disabling TF), pushes the CS and IP pointing to the next
instruction, then disables the Trap Flag before executing the interrupt routine. However, debuggers which single-step through
code can still single-step within an interrupt routine called by the "INT n" instruction by recognizing the "INT n" opcode and
emulating the "INT n" function (e.g. push Flags, CS, IP, and set CS:IP per the value found in the nth interrupt vector or
IDT descriptor). Debuggers which emulate the "INT n" are backward compatible to earlier 80286 steppings, to the 80186, and 8086.

#### LOCK Signal During INTA Cycles

> This does not affect the 8259A interrupt controller. From the (B-2) stepping onward, the 286 LOCK signal is active during
both INTA cycles of the Interrupt Acknowledge sequence (on earlier steppings, the LOCK signal was active only on the first
INTA cycle). Internal circuit design necessitated this correction. LOCK asserted means "lock this cycle TO THE NEXT bus cycle."
Therefore the (B-2) and later steppings lock the two INTA cycles to the first stack push of the interrupt processing sequence.
Doing so is no problem. However, custom interrupt controllers may be affected if they use the state of LOCK to distinguish
the first and second INTA cycles. Custom hardware designers note you can deactivate the INTR signal to the 80286 anytime
during either INTA cycle, and the vector may be placed on the data bus during both cycles although the 80286 only reads
the vector during the second INTA cycle.

#### Instructions Longer Than 10 Bytes

> Instructions longer than 10 bytes occur only by using the assembler to intentionally place multiple redundant prefixes
(e.g. multiple lock prefixes and/or segment override prefixes) before valid opcode bytes. On all 80286 components,
in Real Address Mode or Protected Mode, when the 80286 detects an instruction that is illegal solely due to being greater
than 10 bytes in length, it generates an exception #13 (General Protection Exception) rather than exception #6 (Invalid Opcode)
as previously described. Note that undefined opcodes do generate exception #6 (Invalid Opcode) as described.

#### ARPL Instruction

> On any 80286 component, when the second operand of the ARPL instruction is a null selector, the instruction generates
an exception #13. This is not a problem since the RW operand contains the RPL bits used only as a "standard" for comparison,
and the EW operand is the actual selector whose RPL bits are subject to adjustment. Ensure the RW operand does not have all
its bits 15-2 equal to "0", since that makes it a null selector value. This is easy to avoid since only RW bits 0 and 1 are
used for comparison; bits 15-2 can be anything but all zeroes.

### Background on Early INTR Signal Removal

> When the INTR is activated and external interrupts are enabled, INTR must be held active until the CPU performs the first
INTA bus cycle to process the external interrupt. Failure to keep the INTR active until the first INTA cycle occurs could
cause unpredictable CPU behavior. When this errata is corrected, failure to keep the INTR input active will only possibly
prevent the external interrupt from being recognized.

> Some I/O devices may allow their interrupt output output to go inactive after previously signalling an interrupt.
For example, the 8253 or 8254 timer used for real-time clocks can remove the interrupt request if not serviced early enough
(even if the 8259A interrupt controller is in edge-triggered mode).

> When using the 8259A Priority Interrupt controller, below are several cases in which an active 8259A INT output will go
inactive, possibly before the 80286 CPU generates its first INTA cycle to process the interrupt. Both cases below can be
handled if the 80286 interrupts are always disabled before programming the interrupt controller.

> 1. The interrupt request seen by the CPU can also be removed by the 8259A interrupt controller even though the interrupt
> from the I/O device remains active. For example, system software may mask an 8259A interrupt input just after the I/O device
> asserts it. The net effect is an INTR signal at the 80286 that goes active then inactive. (even if the 8259A is in edge-triggered mode);
> 2. The 8259A INT output will go inactive for about the duration of the write pulse when the CPU writes an OCW3
> (operation control word 3) which selects the IRR (interrupt request register),

> The default interrupt function of the 8259A will guarantee a proper vector for IR7, the default interrupt, if at the time INTA
is performed no unmasked interrupt is active. The interrupt handler for IR7 can read ISR7 of the 8259A to tell if this was a real
interrupt on IR7. The ISR7 bit will be 0 if at the time the interrupt was acknowledged, no unmasked IR inputs of the 8259A were
active ("phantom" interrupt).
