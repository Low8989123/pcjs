PCjs uses JavaScript to emulate a small collection of hardware and software that I grew up with in the 1970s and 1980s,
allowing you to experience their slow CPUs, low-resolution displays, and primitive sound effects, all in the comfort and
safety of your desktop or mobile web browser.

Over time, PCjs emulations have expanded to include selected [IBM PC Compatibles](/machines/pcx86/compaq/deskpro386/)
and more classic machines, such as [Minicomputers](/machines/dec/pdp11/), [Programmable Calculators](/machines/ti/ti57/),
[Terminals](/machines/dec/vt100/), and [Arcade Games](/machines/arcade/invaders/).
To learn more or contribute to these very modest preservation efforts, visit the [PCjs]({{ site.github.repository_url }})
open-source project on [GitHub]({{ site.github.owner_url }}).
