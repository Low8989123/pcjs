A PCjs emulation of the Texas Instruments TI-57 Programmable Calculator is shown below.

Above, you'll find a few EC-4000 programs I wrote back in 1978-1979.  These are some of my earliest "computer programs,"
written when I was in high school, so needless to say, they come with no guarantees.  Use at your own risk.
