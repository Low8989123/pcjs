Our TI-57 emulator below is one of the most faithful TI-57 emulations currently available.  It should run at
roughly the same speed as an original device.  That includes calculation speed, display speed, and pause delays.

It is also using an exact copy of an original [TI-57 ROM](/machines/ti/ti57/rom/); no instructions have been patched.
A configuration using a [Revised ROM](../rev1/) is also available.

Special attention has been made to the display as well.  The shape of the digits were taken directly from TI patent
drawings, and the digits are drawn/erased with the same frequency as a real device, so when the display goes blank for
brief periods, you know that a lengthy calculation is being performed.  A few minor display enhancements have been
enabled, since they don't affect the overall authenticity of the simulation, such as
<span class="indTI57">2nd</span>,
<span class="indTI57">INV</span>,
<span class="indTI57">Deg</span>,
<span class="indTI57">Rad</span>, and
<span class="indTI57">Grad</span> indicators.

The TI-57 emulator is also the first PCjs machine to use our new ES6 PCjs Device Classes, so it requires a modern
web browser.  We'll probably add an ES5 fall-back mechanism eventually, but for now, make sure you're using the latest
version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.

If any errors occur during operation, the Diagnostics window should display the last instruction decoded.
The window also accepts a few debugging commands.  Use '?' for help.
