The TI-57 configuration below is identical to our [Original ROM](../rev0/) configuration, except that
it is using a [Revised ROM](/machines/ti/ti57/rom/#revised-rom).

If any errors occur during operation, the Diagnostics window should display the last instruction decoded.
The window also accepts a few debugging commands.  Use '?' for help.
