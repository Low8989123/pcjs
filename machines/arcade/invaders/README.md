This 8080-based PCjs machine emulates the original Space Invaders arcade machine.

Hard-coded key mappings include:

- 1: One Player
- 2: Two Player
- 3: Insert Coin
- A: Move Left
- D: Move Right
- L: Fire Missile

The PCjs debugger, along with a few [Notes](#space-invaders-emulation-notes), are provided below.

### Space Invaders Emulation Notes

For touch-screen devices like the iPhone and iPad, there are "touch regions" across the top of the virtual
monitor that correspond to first three buttons:

- Top Left: One Player
- Top Right: Two Players
- Top Center: Insert Coin

and regions across the bottom that correspond to the last three buttons:

- Left Side: Move Left and Move Right
- Right Side: Fire

This is purely experimental and may only work in portrait mode; landscape and full-screen modes will probably need
more work to make them usable.

Note that, unlike other emulators, PCjs machines have a [Bus](/machines/modules/v3/bus.js) architecture,
allowing components to "plug in" different kinds of memory or memory-mapped devices at different addresses,
and to register specific functions for specific I/O ports.	

For example, Space Invaders has 8Kb of ROM at addresses 0x0000 through 0x1FFF, which means that if any 8080 code
attempts to write to those addresses, nothing should happen.  Unfortunately, most emulators treat the entire address
space as one contiguous array of bytes.  Which means either that the ROM is susceptible to corruption *or* that every
write operation must check the address to determine its validity, which hurts the performance of *all* writes.

In PCjs machines, all writes are equally fast, and all ROMs are fully protected.  An exception is made for the
Debugger, which allows you to use the "e" command to modify ("patch") ROM code on the fly, but that is completely
outside and independent of the 8080 code being emulated.
