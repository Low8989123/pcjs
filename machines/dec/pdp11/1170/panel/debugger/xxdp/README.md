This machine is ready to boot [XXDP+ Diagnostics](/software/dec/pdp11/disks/rl02k/xxdp/) ("BOOT RL0") and run diagnostics
(e.g., "R EKBEE1"):

- [EKBAD0: 11/70 CPU DIAGNOSTIC (PART 1)](/software/dec/pdp11/disks/rl02k/xxdp/ekbad0/)
- [EKBBF0: 11/70 CPU DIAGNOSTIC (PART 2)](/software/dec/pdp11/disks/rl02k/xxdp/ekbbf0/)
- [EKBEE1: 11/70 MEMORY MANAGEMENT DIAGNOSTIC](/software/dec/pdp11/disks/rl02k/xxdp/ekbee1/)

[Instructions](#instructions) for running those diagnostics are provided below.

{% include machine.html id="test1170" %}

### Instructions 

We need to select a drive to load the [RL02K XXDP+ Diagnostics Disk](/software/dec/pdp11/disks/rl02k/xxdp/), and since it is
an RL02K disk, we need to use an RL02 drive.  A typical PDP-11 machine with a single [RL11 Disk Controller](/machines/dec/pdp11/rl11/)
could contain up to four such drives, which we refer to as RL0 through RL3.  And since we want to boot the XXDP
disk, we need to select drive RL0, since the boot code on the disk appears to assume drive 0. 

To automatically boot the [RL02K XXDP+ Diagnostics Disk](/software/dec/pdp11/disks/rl02k/xxdp/) and run the **EKBAD0** diagnostic,
press: {% include machine/command.html type='button' label='Run EKBAD0' machine='test1170' command='runEKBAD0' %}

To test the Front Panel LEDs and the ENABLE/CONT switches,
press: {% include machine/command.html type='button' label='Test Panel' machine='test1170' command='testPanel' %}
