 * Starting with the IBM PC XT, the ROM defined a "Fixed Disk Parameter Table" (FD_TBL) that contained 16 bytes
 * at the following offsets for each of 4 drive types (see IBM 5160 Tech Ref, April 1983, p. A-94):
 *
 *      0: maximum number of cylinders (word)
 *      2: maximum number of heads
 *      3: starting reduced write current cylinder (word)
 *      5: starting write precompensation cylinder (word)
 *      7: maximum ECC data burst length
 *      8: control byte (drive step option)
 *          bit 7: disable disk-access retries
 *          bit 6: disable ECC retries
 *          bits 5-3: zero
 *          bits 2-0: drive option
 *      9: standard time-out value
 *      A: time-out value for format drive
 *      B: time-out value for check drive
 *      C: reserved
 *      D: reserved
 *      E: reserved
 *      F: reserved
 *
 * Notice that there is nothing in the PC XT table to indicate the number of sectors/track; this is because
 * the XT BIOS assumed 17 sectors/track; in fact, the number 17 (0x11) is hard-coded in the BIOS function (0x08)
 * that returns drive parameters.
 *
 * Starting with the IBM PC AT, the ROM defined a "Fixed Disk Parameter Table" (FD_TBL) that contained 16 bytes
 * at the following offsets for each of 47 drive types (see IBM 5170 Tech Ref, March 1986, p. 5-185):
 *
 *      0: maximum number of cylinders (word)
 *      2: maximum number of heads
 *      3: not used
 *      5: starting write precompensation cylinder (word)
 *      7: not used
 *      8: control byte (drive step option)
 *          bit 7: disable retries -OR-
 *          bit 6: disable retries
 *          bit 3: more than 8 heads
 *      9: not used
 *      A: not used
 *      B: not used
 *      C: landing zone (word)
 *      E: number of sectors/track (NOTE: all PC AT drive types specified 17 sectors/track)
 *      F: reserved
 *
 * NOTE: While drive type 0 was a valid type in the PC XT, it was NOT a valid drive type in the PC AT; zero was used
 * to indicate that no hard drive was installed.
 *
 * All of the predefined PC AT drive types still used only 17 sectors/track -- but unlike the PC XT, user-defined drive
 * parameter tables could now specify different values.
 *
 * Of the 47 PC AT drive types, the first 14 (1-E) could be selected by 4 bits in CMOS byte 0x12.  Drive type 15 was not
 * a valid type but rather an indicator that CMOS byte 0x19 (or 0x1A) contained the actual drive type, which technically
 * could contain any value from 0-255, but was documented as being limited to values 16-255.  And in fact, the ROM only
 * contained entries for drive types 1-47, and of those, only drive types 1-14 and 16-23 were valid; the rest (15 and 24-47)
 * were marked "RESERVED" and contained zeros.
 *
 * If a system needed a drive type that wasn't defined by the ROM, it could be placed in RAM, as the ROM explained:
 *
 *      To dynamically define a set of parameters, build a table for up to 15 types and place
 *      the corresponding vector into interrupt 0x41 for drive 0 and interrupt 0x46 for drive 1.
 *
 * To make PCjs easier to configure, we have three drive tables (for XT, AT, and COMPAQ machines), each of which
 * contains DriveArrays for the various DriveTypes supported by each machine.  Each DriveArray contains the following
 * subset of "Fixed Disk Parameter Table" information:
 *
 *      [0]: total cylinders
 *      [1]: total heads
 *      [2]: total sectors/tracks (optional; default is 17)
 *      [3]: total bytes/sector (optional; default is 512)
 *
 * verifyDrive() attempts to confirm that these values agree with the programmed drive characteristics.
 *
 * NOTE: For the record, PCjs considers 1Kb to be 1 kilobyte (1,024 bytes, not 1,000 bytes) and 1Mb to be 1 megabyte
 * (1024*1024 or 1,048,576 bytes, not 1,000,000 bytes).
 *
 * Apparently, in 1998, it was decided that a kilobyte should be 1,000 bytes and a megabyte should be 1,000,000 bytes,
 * and that if you really meant 2^10 (1,024) or 2^20 (1,048,576), you should use "kibibyte" (KiB) or "mebibyte" (MiB)
 * instead.  But since PCjs simulates machines that pre-date 1998, I have chosen to retain the more "traditional"
 * understanding of Kb and Mb; I never use KiB or MiB.

/*
 * Drive type tables differed across IBM controller models (XTC drive types don't match ATC drive types) and across OEMs
 * (e.g., COMPAQ drive types only match a few IBM drive types), so you must use iDeviceType to index the correct table type
 * inside both DRIVE_CTRLS and DRIVE_TYPES.
