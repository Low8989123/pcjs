This directory contains the PCjs machine command-line utility [pc.js](pc.js), which allows you to start a "headless" machine with all TTY (eg, INT 0x10) output redirected to your console.

Load a JSON machine configuration file, such as [ibm5150.json](ibm5150.json) or [compaq386.json](compaq386.json), with the utility's `load` command, either interactively or with the `--load` command-line argument.

For example, this command:

	pc.js --load=ibm5150

or, if your operating system doesn't automatically associate `.js` files with [Node](https://nodejs.org/en), this command:

	node pc.js --load=ibm5150

NOTE: On Windows, the first time you attempt to run a `.js` file from the command-line, Windows may prompt you to associate a program with it (eg, "C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe"), and while this will eliminate the need to type `node`, the association doesn't automatically pass along any command-line arguments.  You may be able to fix this by running `REGEDIT` and appending ` %*` to the default value for "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\node.exe\shell\open\command":

    "C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" "%1" %*

If you don't include a full path to the JSON file, `pc.js` will look for the JSON file in the `/tools/pc` folder.  As a convenience, you can also omit `--load=` option if the JSON file is in your current directory.

Loading [ibm5150.json](ibm5150.json) with the should produce the following output:

    pc.js v3.00
    Copyright Â© 2012-2023 Jeff Parsons <Jeff@pcjs.org>
    Options: --load=ibm5150
    Press CTRL-D to enter debugger, CTRL-C to terminate process

After the machine finishes booting (about 10 seconds), you should see the following output:

    Current date is Tue  1-01-1980
    Enter new date: 

You can begin interacting with the machine OR you can press CTRL-D to enter the PCjs debugger.  For example, if you'd like to dump the machine's video buffer, press CTRL-D and type `D B000:0`:

To destroy the machine, type `quit` (or press CTRL-C) at the debugger prompt.

[pc.js](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs/tree/master/tools/pc) is more general-purpose than its predecessor, [pcx86.js](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs/tree/2ac6e5e62196212bede02f360634f04a9c358ed9/machines/pcx86/bin), and can theoretically load any other machine type listed in [machines.json](/machines/machines.json), but it has only been tested with `pcx86` and `pdp11` machines so far.

This utility is very much a "work in progress" and is intended for development work and testing only.  Also, since it is "headless", you will not see any output from the machine when running any software that writes directly to video memory.

### Support for XML Machine Files

Limited support for XML-based machines now exists; eg:

    pc.js --debug --load=/machines/pcx86/ibm/5170/ega/1024kb/rev3/debugger/machine.xml

loads and runs the same [machine.xml](/machines/pcx86/ibm/5170/ega/1024kb/rev3/debugger/machine.xml) that also exists on the PCjs website.

Here's another example using a `pdp11` [machine.xml](/machines/dec/pdp11/1170/panel/debugger/machine.xml):

    pc.js --debug --load=/machines/dec/pdp11/1170/panel/debugger/machine.xml

The above examples also include `--debug` because those particular machines do *not* automatically start running, and `--debug` provides useful feedback in those situations.

### Access Local Files from MS-DOS

If you run [pc.js](pc.js) with the name of a DOS command or executable in your current directory; eg:

    pc.js pkunzip.exe

it will automatically build a 10Mb MS-DOS hard disk image in the `/tools/pc` folder with copies of all the files/folders in your current local directory, automatically start a [COMPAQ DeskPro 386](compaq386.json) machine with that disk image mounted as drive C, and then run the specified DOS command or executable.

This allows you to run console-based DOS applications on your modern operating system (eg, macOS or Windows), with excellent IBM PC (or in this case, COMPAQ DeskPro 386) compatibility.  The experience currently comes with a number of caveats, and there are some important limitations to be aware of, such as limits on the size and number of files you can have in your current directory (the overall limit is currently 10Mb) and the fact that only console-based DOS applications are usable in this environment.

One of the pre-requisites of this feature is having a copy of the [pcjs-diskettes](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs-diskettes) repository in the `/disks/diskettes` folder of your PCjs repository:

    cd pcjs
    mkdir disks
    cd disks
    git clone https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs-diskettes.git diskettes

This is because [pc.js](pc.js) automatically copies system files from MS-DOS diskettes (eg, [MSDOS320-DISK1](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs-diskettes/blob/master/pcx86/sys/dos/microsoft/3.20/MSDOS320-DISK1.json)) to build a bootable hard disk image.

There are no plans to perform "dynamic" file system updates.  This means if you modify any files on your local file system, those modifications won't show up inside the machine until you restart `pc.js`.  Similarly, any file modifications inside the machine will not show up on your local file system until you terminate `pc.js`.

### Loading Machines and Diskettes

Normally, when you run `pc.js`, a machine is started, either explicitly via `--load`, or implicitly by typing the name of a DOS executable.  Otherwise, you can start a machine from the pc.js `>>` prompt, using the "load" internal command; eg:

    >> load compaq386

Once a machine is running, you can access the `>>` prompt by typing **CTRL-D**.  That will stop the machine until you enter the "g" command.  Any command not recognized by `pc.js` is passed to the machine's built-in debugger.  Type "?" to get a list of debugger commands.

The "load" command is also used to load PCjs diskettes images into the machine's floppy drives, by including a drive letter, as in:

    >> load a: PC DOS

That command will search for all PCjs diskettes with "PC" and "DOS" in the diskette name and list them by number:

      1: COMPAQ PC DOS 3.20 Support
      2: Jeff's PC DOS 1.00 with MASM
      3: PC DOS 0.90
      4: PC DOS 1.00
      5: PC DOS 1.10
      6: PC DOS 2.00 (Disk 1)
      7: PC DOS 2.00 (Disk 2)
      8: PC DOS 2.10 (Disk 1)
      9: PC DOS 2.10 (Disk 2)
     10: PC DOS 3.00 (Disk 1)
     11: PC DOS 3.00 (Disk 2)
     12: PC DOS 3.10 (Disk 1)
     13: PC DOS 3.10 (Disk 2)
     14: PC DOS 3.10 (Patched Disk 1)
     15: PC DOS 3.20 (720K)
     16: PC DOS 3.20 (Disk 1)
     17: PC DOS 3.20 (Disk 2)
     18: PC DOS 3.30 (720K)
     19: PC DOS 3.30 (Disk 1)
     20: PC DOS 3.30 (Disk 2)
     21: PC DOS 3.30 (TechRef)
     22: PC DOS 4.00 (Disk 1)
     23: PC DOS 4.00 (Disk 2)
     24: PC DOS 4.00 (Disk 3)
     25: PC DOS 4.00 (Disk 4)
     26: PC DOS 4.00 (Disk 5)
     27: PC DOS 4.00 (TechRef)
     28: PC DOS 4.01 (Disk 1)
     29: PC DOS 4.01 (Disk 2)
     30: PC DOS 5.00 (Disk 1)
     31: PC DOS 5.00 (Disk 2)
     32: PC DOS 5.00 (Disk 3)
     33: PC DOS 5.02 (Disk 1)
     34: PC DOS 5.02 (Disk 2)
     35: PC DOS 5.02 (Disk 3)
     36: PC DOS 6.10 (Disk 1)
     37: PC DOS 6.10 (Disk 2)
     38: PC DOS 6.10 (Disk 3)
     39: PC DOS 6.10 (Disk 4)
     40: PC DOS 6.30 (Disk 1)
     41: PC DOS 6.30 (Disk 2)
     42: PC DOS 6.30 (Disk 3)
     43: PC DOS 6.30 (Disk 4)
     44: PC DOS 6.30 (Disk 5)
     45: PC DOS 7.00 (1.2M Boot)
     46: PC DOS 7.00 (1.44M Boot)
     47: PC DOS 7.00 (Disk 1)
     48: PC DOS 7.00 (Disk 2)
     49: PC DOS 7.00 (Disk 3)
     50: PC DOS 7.00 (Disk 4)
     51: PC DOS 7.00 (Disk 5)

You can then use a second "load" command to load a diskette by number.  For example, to load "PC DOS 2.00 (Disk 1)":

    >> load a: 6

You can also search for disks containing a specific file name:

    >> load a: --file pkunzip.exe

That command will display the following diskettes:

      1: PKUNZIP.EXE    19080 1980-01-01  "PC-SIG Library Disk #3165"
      2: PKUNZIP.EXE    18208 1989-03-06  "PC-SIG Library Disk #0621"
      3: PKUNZIP.EXE    21440 1989-07-21  "PC-SIG Library Disk #0687"
      4: PKUNZIP.EXE    35258 1989-07-21  "PC-SIG Library Disk #2382"
      5: PKUNZIP.EXE    22022 1989-10-01  "Small Computer Book Club (1990)"
      6: PKUNZIP.EXE    23528 1990-03-15  "Undocumented Windows"
      7: PKUNZIP.EXE    19025 1990-03-15  "PC-SIG Library Disk #2715"
      8: PKUNZIP.EXE    19041 1990-03-15  "PC-SIG Library Disk #3036"
      9: PKUNZIP.EXE    19025 1990-03-15  "PC-SIG Library Disk #3475"
     10: PKUNZIP.EXE    22540 1990-06-01  "PC-SIG Library Disk #0765"
     11: PKUNZIP.EXE    17931 1990-09-07  "PC-SIG Library Disk #1773"
     12: PKUNZIP.EXE    23536 1991-01-16  "PC-SIG Library Disk #2835"
     13: PKUNZIP.EXE    19044 1991-04-03  "PC-SIG Library Disk #2610"
     14: PKUNZIP.EXE    19025 1991-08-01  "PC-SIG Library Disk #3245"
     15: PKUNZIP.EXE    19411 1991-10-15  "PC-SIG Library Disk #3220"
     16: PKUNZIP.EXE    29371 1993-01-25  "PC-SIG Library Disk #4052"
     17: PKUNZIP.EXE    29378 1993-02-01  "PC-SIG Library Disk #3418"
     18: PKUNZIP.EXE     2750 1993-02-01  "PC-SIG Library Disk #3853"

which represent 18 different copies of PKUNZIP.EXE.  Differences are based on the file contents, not file size or timestamp.

Again, to load one of the diskettes listed, specify it by number.  For example, to load the diskette named ""Undocumented Windows", use:

    >> load a: 6

If there were other diskettes with an identical copy of that file that weren't initially listed, they will be listed next:

      1: PKUNZIP.EXE     23528 1990-03-15  "Undocumented Windows"
      2: PKUNZIP.EXE     23528 1990-03-15  "PC-SIG Library Disk #1502"
      3: PKUNZIP.EXE     23528 1990-03-15  "PC-SIG Library Disk #2367"
      4: PKUNZIP.EXE     23528 1990-03-15  "PC-SIG Library Disk #2491"
      5: PKUNZIP.EXE     23528 1990-03-15  "PC-SIG Library Disk #2536"
      6: PKUNZIP.EXE     23528 1990-03-15  "PC-SIG Library Disk #2587"
    ...

If you still want your original selection, use "load a: 1".  You can always give the full diskette name as well:

    >> load a: undocumented windows

The comparison is case-insensitive and the given string need only be a subset of the desired diskette name; however, if the name is not unique, you'll be presented with another list of diskettes to choose from.

Use `--disk` and `--file` to enter a mix of search criteria.  `--disk` is assumed if there are no other criteria, and `--file` is assumed if the string looks like a filename *and* no other criteria has been specified.  For example:

    >> load a: pkunzip.exe

is equivalent to `load a: --file pkunzip.exe`, but `--file` can also be useful for casting a wider search net.  For example:

    >> load a: --file pkunzip

will match any file with `PKUNZIP` in the name (eg, `PKUNZIP.COM`, `PKUNZIP.EXE`), and:

    >> load a: --file pkunzip exe

will match any file with *both* `PKUNZIP` and `EXE` in the name (eg, `PKUNZIP.EXE`, `PKUNZIP2.EXE`).  There is no support for wildcards, since multiple search terms provide largely the same capability.

### Historical Notes

One early use of this utility was running a set of [80386 CPU Tests](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs/blob/master/software/pcx86/test/cpu/80386/test386.asm) as a custom ROM image inside an [80386 Test Machine](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs/blob/master/tools/pc/test386.json), and then comparing the results to [output](/software/pcx86/test/cpu/80386/test386.txt) from real hardware.

The test program ([test386.asm](/software/pcx86/test/cpu/80386/test386.asm)) was carefully designed to be built as a binary (`test386.com`) that could either be run as a DOS program *or* loaded as a ROM image.  See [PCx86 CPU Tests](/software/pcx86/test/cpu/) for more information.
