Check out the [Live Demos](#live-demos) we've created from [Graphics for the IBM PC](https://archive.org/details/graphics-for-the-ibm-pc-1984).

### Live Demos

From Page 46:

> **A KALEIDOSCOPE PROGRAM**

> Let's run a program that will show you some of what
> BASIC can do on the IBM PC. This program produces a
> changing kaleidoscope display and is shown in Listing 2-3.
> Type it precisely as shown. If you make any mistakes, use
> the editing capabilities of BASIC discussed above to make
> corrections. Remember to type NEW to clear any previous
> programs out of memory before typing the new program.
> Enter RUN to execute the program, noting the wide
> range of colors available on the IBM PC. A typical display
> is shown in Fig. 4.
> in the color photograph section. Note that good effects
> can be produced with only a few program
> lines thanks to the power of Advanced BASIC.

> **Medium-Resolution Color Selection**

> Every color available on the PC can be displayed in
> medium-resolution graphics mode, but, unfortunately,
> only in certain combinations. The background color (that
> is, the color to which the screen and border default and
> which graphics are typically set against) can be any of the
> 16 colors available on the PC, as shown in Table 4-1.
> The other three colors available at any one time consist of one
> of two sets. The sets are called palettes because, like
> painters' palettes, each is a group of colors from which the
> PC artist may choose to work.

> Palette number 0 contains green, red, and brown, which
> are colors 1,2, and 3, respectively (Table 4-2). (Many
> monitors will display yellow rather than brown.) These colors
> look excellent on an RGB monitor (see Fig. 5A in the color
> photograph section), but, unfortunately, often tend to look
> rather muddy on a television.

> Palette number 1 contains cyan, magenta, and white,
> which are, respectively, colors 1, 2, and 3 (Table 4-2).
> Cyan is a light blue, and magenta is a light red. These colors
> aren't as vivid on an RGB monitor as those in the other
> palette (See Fig. 5B).
> in the color photograph section), and
> can look somewhat washed out if screen brightness is
> high. However, the colors in palette 1 look just about as
> good on a television as on an RGB monitor, and because
> white appears much sharper on a television than any
> other color, this palette is the palette of choice for television
> work. (The same is true of any composite monitor.)
