                    DR. FORM (tm)  Version 3.0

       --- Terms of Distribution for the Shareware Version ---


NOTE:  DR. FORM went under the name of Quick Forms in earlier versions.
=====  Please replace any version of Quick Forms that you may be
       carrying with DR. FORM.


GENERAL RESTRICTIONS:
=====================

1. DR. FORM must be distributed in its *entirety*, without any
   modifications, deletions or additions.

2. DR. FORM may NOT be distributed by any "for-profit" entity which
   does not disclose the following points in their literature:

     * The fee paid for the evaluation disk is a distribution fee to
       cover the vendors distribution and marketing costs.  It does
       not cover the cost of the program itself.

     * Additional payment to the Author is required if the program is
       used beyond the evaluation period given by the Author.

3. DR. FORM is not to be used as an enticement to purchase another
   product without the explicit consent of the Author.

4. DR. FORM is NOT to be packaged for sale with its reference manual,
   or other supporting documentation pre-printed for the end-user.

5. DR. FORM may not be rented or leased.  It may, however, be GIVEN
   away, as long as it is not represented as "free" or "public domain".



BBS Sysops:
===========

All BBSs are free to carry DR. FORM as long as item #1 in GENERAL
RESTRICTIONS is followed.


Catalog and Disk Vendors:
=========================

All Catalog and Disk Vendors may carry DR. FORM as long as ALL
the requirements in GENERAL RESTRICTIONS are followed.


CD-ROM Vendors:
===============

CD-ROM Vendors may carry DR. FORM as long as ALL the requirements
in GENERAL RESTRICTIONS are followed.


RACK Vendors:
=============

For the purpose of this document, a "RACK Vendor" is one who sells
pre-packaged Shareware in a *RETAIL* environment.  A RETAIL
environment is a *physical* place, such as a store, in which the
customer can "physically" pick up and buy an evaluation copy of a
Shareware product.

Any RACK Vendor who distributes in  5 OR LESS  (physical) RETAIL
environments may carry DR. FORM as long as ALL of the requirements
in GENERAL RESTRICTIONS are followed.

Any RACK Vendor who distributes in  MORE THAN 5  (physical) RETAIL
environments MAY NOT DISTRIBUTE DR. FORM WITHOUT WRITTEN
AUTHORIZATION FROM IRWINWARE.  This requirement affects ONLY RACK
Vendors, and even then, ONLY those who distribute in  MORE THAN 5
(physical) RETAIL environments.


Distribution on 360K disks
==========================

There are 64 files that make up the DR. FORM program.  They will
all fit comfortably on a 720K disk.  If you must divide them up
into two 360K disks, PLEASE divide them at the DISK_2 marker
(DISK_2 will be the 1st file on the 2nd disk).  Also, keep the files
in the order in which they came. This is VERY IMPORTANT!

ALL 64 files MUST be present for the "INSTALL" program to work
correctly (this INCLUDES the marker files DISK_1 and DISK_2).
All the files are described in the file PACKING.LST.

======================================================================
SUGGESTED 1 LINE DESCRIPTION:

Powerful, yet easy to use form designer.

======================================================================

SUGGESTED LONG DESCRIPTION:

Dr. Form 3.0 is a "Major" upgrade to the popular Quick Forms program. 
Full mouse support with a new and improved user interface only top off
the features.

Dr. Form makes forms up to 63 rows by 136 columns.  It includes an
automatic Grid Maker along with features such as Move, Copy and Erase
blocks of text.  Duplicate characters, Draw Lines and Fill in areas.  If
you have a mouse, all this can be done without touching the keyboard.

Dr. Form gives you access to the entire IBM Extended Character Set. 
Track the screen cursor, or the mouse cursor, in Row & Column or Inches. 
There is also both a manual and automatic Time & Date Stamp.  Scroll
through a form by just pushing the mouse in the direction desired.

Create a Master Form and then fill it in with Fill In Mode.  In Fill In
Mode you can print just the filled in portions using "pre-printed" forms,
or print the entire form on blank paper.  You can also toggle the Master
portion of the form to monochrome, while the parts you fill in are still
in color.  This makes it easier on the eyes when filling in a form.

Depending on your printer, Dr. Form will print Normal, Bold, Italic,
Underline, Condensed, Superscript, Subscript, Double Width, Double Height
and in combinations of these.

To make learning Dr. Form easier, it comes with 7 Lessons that load in as
a form and give you "hands on" experience while you are learning.  Just
follow the directions on the screen.
