Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or

recommend a 386 with a VGA monitor.

The brand new PC-SIG World Of Windows is a must-have for Windows users.
In order to produce the best possible Windows collection PC-SIG has made
an alliance with the acclaimed Windows OnLine BBS. So not only do you have
access to the collecting and weeding out efforts for which PC-SIG is
famous, but also the huge volume of fonts and sound files and the in-depth
software reviews of the world's best Windows BBS.

This CD contains every one of the best Windows shareware programs
available, 350+ in all, over 900 TrueType fonts which can be used
without royalties, 429 ATM fonts, over 2,000 sound files in .WAV,
.VOC, .SND, .SOU, .MID format and 2,794 icons! A major computer
catalog is offering a collection of 250 fonts for $49.95. They have
great prices on hardware and software, but this time they can't
touch us.

As if the files aren't enough, we thought you would want to preview
and use these sounds, fonts, icons and programs directly from the CD,
without taking the time and space to unarchive them. So we have
included a font previewer and installed, a sound player and an icon
manager. Over 200 of the programs can be run simply by clicking on
them in the File Manager. Nobody else offers you anything close to
this type of access.

We're not done yet. In add to all the Windows riches described above,
this CD also contains the text and programs from the July-August
issue of Shareware Magazine. This is the second in a six-volume PC-SIG
Encyclopedia of Shareware CD-ROM series (Games was the first). Each
volume includes the programs from a section of the PC-SIG Library plus
all the text and every program from the current issue of Shareware
Magazine. Software reviews for this issue cover over 100 programs
including games, communications, printing, text editors and more. 124
of the programs mentioned in the magazine are included, plus 225
programs updated since the May-June issue.

Hardware Requirements:
----------------------
    MS-DOS operating system
    Microsoft compatible mouse
    VGA graphics (640x480)
    512K of free RAM
    Hard disk (highly recommended)


Starting Note by Note:
----------------------
    The only file needed to run this program is NBN.EXE.  You MUST be
    in the same sub-directory where NBN.EXE is located to run the
    program.  At the DOS prompt, type: NBN and press ENTER.

    When the program starts, you will be in FREE PLAY mode with the
    piano keyboard.  You will notice four buttons on either side of the
    staff paper, as well as a HELP button and an EXIT button at the
    bottom of the screen.  The top three buttons on the left allow you
    to select the piano keyboard, a guitar neck, or a set of letter
    buttons.  The fourth button on the left will toggle the sound on and
    off.  The four buttons on the right allow you to select the playing
    mode.  The top button is FREE PLAY, the second button (with the
    single note) is SINGLE NOTE drill, the third button is THREE NOTE
    drill, and the fourth button (with the 4/4 sign) is RHYTHM drill.
    In this trial version of Note by Note, only FREE PLAY and SINGLE
    NOTE drills are available.





FREE PLAY Mode:
---------------
    Use the mouse to click on a piano key, guitar string, or letter
    button.  The selected note will be displayed on the staff paper, you
    will hear a note from the PC speaker, and the name of the note will
    be displayed in the status box at the bottom center of the screen.
    As you continue to play, the notes will scroll to the left.  Use
    this mode to familiarize yourself with the notes on the staff, as
    well as on your selected instrument.


SINGLE NOTE Drill:
------------------
    When you select SINGLE NOTE drill, a note will be generated by the
    computer and placed on the staff paper.  You must then click on the
    proper piano key, guitar string, or letter button to identify the
    note.  If you are correct on your first try, a new note will appear
    immediately.  If you are wrong, your note will be placed on the
    staff paper to the right of the drill note, and you may continue
    until you find the right note.  The status box will be updated with
    each try.  If you are having trouble finding the correct note, you
    may click on the staff paper and the correct key, string, or button
    will be highlighted.  Clicking on the SINLE NOTE button will reset
    your scores.


THREE NOTE Drill:       (not available in the trial version)
-----------------
    The THREE NOTE drill offers a way to learn how to read music in
    phrases, as opposed to simply identifying notes.  You select a delay
    from 0 to 5 seconds.  Three notes will be placed on the staff and
    will disappear after the selected delay.  You must then play all
    three notes to get a correct score.


RHYTHM Drill:           (not available in the trial version)
-------------
    In the RHYTHM drill, a time bar replaces the instrument.  Two
    measures of notes and rests will appear.  You must then click on the
    proper counts on the time bar, in the order in which the notes
    appear.  When you have finished, the proper counts will be displayed
    so you can see how you did.  This drill is a very effective way to
    learn how to count through measures.









HELP:
-----
    At any time you may click on the HELP button to display context
    sensitive help.  While the help is displayed for the current drill,
    you can also get general help on using the program.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
