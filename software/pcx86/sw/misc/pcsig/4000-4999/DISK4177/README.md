|  If you're like many others, the LAST thing you want to do    |
|  after opening a new software package is read a lengthy       |
|  operations manual.  Consequently, the following instructions,|
|  which work well on most computers, are intended to give you  |
|  a whirlwind tour of SIMPLE SIMON'S PHOTO SCRAMBLE:           |

|  IF YOU RECEIVED THIS PROGRAM ON A FLOPPY DISK                |
|  --  Insert the Program Disk into your floppy disk drive A:   |
|  --  Type INSTALL A: C: and then hit <enter>                  |
|           where A: is your floppy disk designation, and       |
|                 C: is your hard disk.                         |
|           Substitute other drive letters as appropriate.      |
|  --  When the C:\SSPS> prompt appears,                        |
|           type SCRAMBLE and then hit <ENTER>.                 |
|  --  The rest is simple -- just follow the instructions       |

|  --  If your program is archived (i.e., SCRAMB10.ZIP),        |
|      there is no need to use the included INSTALL program.    |
|  --  Instead, just un-archive the files into a subdirectory   |
|      called C:\SSPC.  Then follow the above instructions      |
|      beginning with typing PARENT and hitting <ENTER>.        |

                                        December 20, 1992                 SIMPLE SIMON'S PHOTO SCRAMBLE
                 -----------------------------

OVERVIEW
--------
o    SIMPLE SIMON'S PHOTO SCRAMBLE combines the best features of
     tile puzzles and pattern memorization games into a exciting
     mental challenge. 
o    SIMPLE SIMON'S PHOTO SCRAMBLE can be used by all -- both
     young and old.  There are three separate games in all --
     each with a very different twist, each presenting a
     different test.
o    As you continue to play SIMPLE SIMON's PHOTO SCRAMBLE,
     you'll find that your ability to handle increased puzzle
     complexity and longer pattern sequences will improve.
o    Because SIMPLE SIMON'S PHOTO SCRAMBLE can accommodate puzzle
     scrambles up to 99 moves and pattern sequences up to 30
     moves in length, it will continue to challenge even the move
     demanding player as they continue improving.

GAME ONE: SIMPLE SIMON SCRAMBLE
-------------------------------
o    The objective of this game is to unscramble a photograph
     with pieces that have been scrambled by the computer.
o    Initially, you will be asked to select a photograph and a
     number from 5 to 99.
o    Upon your selection, the photograph you selected will be
     scrambled with that number of moves.
o    Thus, if you select a higher number, the difficulty of
     restoring the photograph to its original configuration will
     be harder than if you select a lower number.
o    You will be allowed to manipulate individual puzzle pieces
     using the keyboard arrow keys -- i.e., up, down, right, and
     left.
o    When the blank square is located along the puzzle edges or
     in the corners, keystrokes that would call in pieces outside
     of the puzzle are disabled.
o    When the photograph has been unscrambled back to its
     original configuration, the computer will notify you that
     the game has been successfully completed.


GAME TWO:  FOLLOW THE LEADER
----------------------------
o    The objective of this game is to move puzzle pieces
     following the same pattern as the computer.
o    Initially, the computer will move only one puzzle piece and
     then turn control over to you.
o    As soon as the puzzle piece is redrawn and the computer
     beeps, move that same piece in the same direction that the
     computer did using the arrow keys -- i.e., up, down, right,
     or left.

                               - 1 -                 SIMPLE SIMON'S PHOTO SCRAMBLE
                 -----------------------------

o    If you move the correct puzzle piece, the computer will add
     another move to its sequence, challenging you again to
     follow its sequence.
o    Thereafter, each time you successfully enter the right
     sequence of puzzle piece moves, the computer will add one
     more to its sequence.
o    If you hit the wrong key (or take more than 10 seconds
     between moves), the computer will display the number of
     moves contained in the last sequence that you successfully
     entered.

GAME THREE:  REVERSE DO AS I DO
-------------------------------
o    The objective of this game is to move back puzzle pieces in
     exactly the reverse order that the computer moves them.
o    Initially, the computer will move only one puzzle piece and
     then turn control over to you.
o    When the puzzle is scrambled and the computer beeps, you
     must return the puzzle piece to its original position using
     the arrow keys -- i.e., up, down, right, or left.
o    If you correctly move the puzzle piece, the computer will
     add another move to its sequence, challenging you to exactly
     reverse its extended sequence.
o    Each time you successfully enter the right reverse
     sequence of moves, the computer will add one more move
     to its sequence.
o    If you hit the wrong key (or take more than 10 seconds
     between moves), the computer will display the number of
     moves contained in the last sequence that you successfully
     entered.

PERSONALIZATION OPTIONS
-----------------------
o    You can insert your own name and home location into the
     beginning of the program by hitting the <N> key at the end
     of the program.
o    The new settings will be kept until you change them.
o    To get a copy of the program with your photograph inserted
     both up front and as a puzzle, you'll need to register your
     game.
o    Registration instructions are contained in this manual or by
     hitting the <ESCAPE> key at the end of the program.

MISCELLANEOUS
-------------
o    Hitting the <ENTER> key repeatedly allows the player to step
     through the early program title screens, if the programmed
     time delays are considered too lengthy.

                 -----------------------------

o    Hitting the <ESCAPE> key during the program allows the
     player to terminate the game before it is completed.
o    Hitting the <F5> key allows the player to toggle sound on
     and off.
