WHITE HARVEST SOFTWARE, INC.

	BIBLE STUDY PROGRAM UPDATE
	SeedMaster/Windows V2.3
	SeedMaster/DOS
	KJS Demo Database

October 5, 1993

Dear Shareware Vendor:

Enclosed is the new Version 2.3 of our Windows and DOS Bible study programs. 
These major releases offer new features and databases. 
Disk Contents:
  \SMWINV23\*.*        SM/Win V2.3 Program/Update Disk
  \SMDOSV23\*.*        SM/DOS V2.3 Program/Update Disk
  \KJSDEMO\*.*         Special KJV Gospel of John Database
Copy directory contents to the root directory of a master floppy disk.
VENDOR.DOC and .DIZ files are in the the program directories.

We also introduced new Bible databases and Resources. Some are Shareware, 
some are copyrighted and must be purchased directly from us or an authorized 
distributor. Please see the enclosed newsletter.

Also, we now support Online Bible V6.0 files. If you also offer these 
databases, our Windows version is an exciting option for these users!

While the new programs run our old KJV databases we strongly recommend you 
use our new KJS database (King James w/ Strong's Support) and STR databases 
(9-360K disks each). They are available on the new Assoc. of Shareware 
Professionals CD-ROM. INSTALL.EXE in the run-time portion of the CD can 
create MASTER diskettes for you. Instructions are on the CD, or please call 
if you need help. The CD-ROM contains Shareware from ASP authors and is 
available from the ASP for about $25. If you have trouble obtaining it, 
please call me.

You can offer our other Shareware Bibles and Resources. We have a CD-ROM 
with all our Shareware materials. Again, INSTALL.EXE lets you create MASTER 
disks. It is available from us for $25. In quantity (should you wish to
resell it), prices range from $10-$15.

IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR WANT ANY HELP, PLEASE CALL!
