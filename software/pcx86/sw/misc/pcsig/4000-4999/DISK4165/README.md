                      ALGEBRA, A SKILL-ORIENTED APPROACH

        SOAV2 is an upgrade to the Shareware version of SOA.

        Algebra, A Skill-Oriented Approach, (or short title, "Skill-
        Oriented Algebra, "SOAV2,") is a teacher-based, two semester,
        computer-generated course in elementary algebra.  It consists
        primarily of printed exercises and tests, formatted for direct
        and immediate student use.  All exercises are random number based
        and no two are precisely alike. The supply is substantially
        unlimited.  SOAV2's software in turn is supported by a curriculum
        guide with addendum, printed word problems, and semester tests,
        (the Manual).  Full documentation, however, can be acquired only
        with REGISTRATION. See below.  The REGISTRATION fee entitles the
        user to a BONUS: "MATHEMATICS, BASIC SKILLS," a compendium of
        exercises on the order of SOA, but in basic arithmetic.  An IBM
        computer or compatible is required for both packages, together with
        a printer having the capability of printing superscripts. A
        monochrome monitor will suffice.
         
        SKILL-ORIENTED ALGEBRA (SOAV2) can be used in three ways: as a
        complete algebra course; as an an inexhaustible supply of algebra
        exercises, each tailored specifically to type and difficulty level;
        or as a "pre-algebra" for use in junior high schools.
         
             As a complete course.  SOAV2 comprises a significant subset
        of the elementary algebra, more than is taught currently in 90
        percent of our public schools.
 
             As an adjunct to the text-based course.  The additional
        exercises cannot help but aid the algebra teacher in providing
        a more effective learning experience.  Within this context,
        wherein SOAV2 may be regarded as a "worksheet generator," the
        exercises are infinitely variable (as to difficulty level), and
        endlessly renewable.	
         
             As a "pre-algebra" given at the junior high school level. 
        SOAV2 will provide excellent preparation for a more 
        conceptualized, text-based course to be given in high school.
         
        Skill-Oriented Algebra has a proven track record.  It is solid 
        and substantial and produces students with well-rounded skills 
        in both algebra and -- surprisingly -- basic arithmetic.  SOAV2
        is teachable.  The material is learnable.  Its scope and content 
        reaches well beyond that which is currently absorbed in our 
        public schools.  With SOAV2, students acquire substantial skills.  
        And since it is sequenced as to levels of arithmetic difficulty 
        (in addition to the algebra), it remediates in that area too.
         
        SOAV2.LZH may be reproduced and distributed freely.  The complete
        one year course is provided.  Only the full documentation is
        missing, although "CAT.DOC," included herein, gives ample gui-
        dance for proper choice by users.  Only registered users will be
        provided the full documentation, (the MANUAL), and "MATHEMATICS,
        BASIC SKILLS," another complete package of printed exercises, 
        but this time in add, subtract, multiply and divide; integers,
        fractions, decimals and percent.  This "skills" package, sold
        originally by the T'Aide Software Company of Arizona for 100
        dollars, is now offered as a BONUS to REGISTERED owners of
        "ALGEBRA, A SKILL-ORIENTED APPROACH."
 
        Run SOAV2.  Photocopy the exercises.  Use them in class.  Note 
        their suitability and variability.  The manual, containing the 
        full documentation, is spiral bound, 8 1/2 X 11 inch in size, 
        primed for reproduction and in-class use.  The cost for 
        registration is only 59.95 dollars.  Contact Alfred D'Attore
        at the address below.
 
                            ************************
                              OPERATING PROCEDURES
                            ************************
         
        When expanded, Skill-Oriented Algebra, (SOAV2), occupies over 
        400,000 bytes. Hereinafter, this README file will assume that 
        you are "in" the directory SOA or some disk containing all the
        files.  Note that in the setups to follow, SOAV2 exercises and
        documentation can be printed to the screen.  The display scrolls 
        by very quickly, but a touch of the space bar will stop the 
        display. Touching it again will recommence the display.  Command
        SOA, and the MENU will appear.
         
        SETUP ONE
        *********
         
        SOAV2 is configured to print using EPSON 2500 printer codes. This 
        is pretty much an industry standard today.  If your printer 
        responds to this standard, and if it is not a laser printer or
        Desk Jet (Ink Jet) type printer, (see below), the operating pro-
        ceedures are very brief:
         
        Use the cursor up/down keys to highlight your choice and hit
        RETURN (ENTER).
         
        To configure the software for printers other than the EPSON 2500
        or compatibles: from the MENU, command PSETUP as described below.
        Also from the MENU, the user can command PRINTER to print out the
        documentation.  In this version, it will only print out the
        three-page SOAV2 catalog, "CAT.DOC."
         
        SETUP TWO
        *********
         
        Wherein the printer is not Epson 2500-compatible, or the user 
        has a laser or "desk jet" type printer.  Command PSETUP, (that
        is, highlight the command and press return).  A listing is
        provided.  If the user's printer is contained therein, or if
        there is one listed that has comparable printer-codes; then
        choose "e," and input the printer filename with or without the
        ".PRN" appendage.  Those with laser or "desk jet" type printers,
        use "HPII-III.PRN," notwithstanding IBM or Epson compatibility.
        The reasons relate to proper spacing in the printed exercises.
        Output will be in accordance with rules for HP PCL 4.  Since
        printer requirements are moderate, this will serve for PCL 5
        types and most non-HP desk jets too.  The user will then be
        returned to the MENU.  Printer configuration is now complete.
        Proceed as above.
         
        SETUP THREE
        ***********
         
        Note SETUP TWO, above.  If your printer is not listed, and if -- 
        further -- there are none with comparable printer codes; command 
        "s," and hit ENTER (RETURN).  Then armed with your printer 
        manual (containing your printer codes), follow directions as
        indicated exactly.  Use base 10 integers only, (no hexidecimal).
        When inputs are complete, you will be asked the name for this
        new printer file.  Use eight characters or less and no
        appendage; this latter will be added automatically.  Afterwhich,
        you will be asked if you want this file transferred to 
        "USERP.PRN," the working file for SOAV2.  If you answer "yes," 
        this will be the printer file through which SOA will output its 
        exercises, tests and documentation.  You will be returned to the 
        MENU.
         
        If you make a mistake, simply exit the software and start 
        again.
         
        Remember, only registered users get the full documentation and
        the very excellent package, "Mathematics, Basic Skills."  Send
        checks or purchase orders to --

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
