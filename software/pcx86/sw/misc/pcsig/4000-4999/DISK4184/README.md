The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We
recommend a 386 with a VGA monitor.

The brand new PC-SIG World Of Windows is a must-have for Windows users.
In order to produce the best possible Windows collection PC-SIG has made
an alliance with the acclaimed Windows OnLine BBS. So not only do you have
access to the collecting and weeding out efforts for which PC-SIG is
famous, but also the huge volume of fonts and sound files and the in-depth
software reviews of the world's best Windows BBS.

This CD contains every one of the best Windows shareware programs
available, 350+ in all, over 900 TrueType fonts which can be used
without royalties, 429 ATM fonts, over 2,000 sound files in .WAV,
.VOC, .SND, .SOU, .MID format and 2,794 icons! A major computer
catalog is offering a collection of 250 fonts for $49.95. They have
great prices on hardware and software, but this time they can't
touch us.

As if the files aren't enough, we thought you would want to preview
and use these sounds, fonts, icons and programs directly from the CD,
without taking the time and space to unarchive them. So we have
included a font previewer and installed, a sound player and an icon
manager. Over 200 of the programs can be run simply by clicking on
them in the File Manager. Nobody else offers you anything close to
this type of access.

We're not done yet. In add to all the Windows riches described above,
this CD also contains the text and programs from the July-August
issue of Shareware Magazine. This is the second in a six-volume PC-SIG
Encyclopedia of Shareware CD-ROM series (Games was the first). Each
volume includes the programs from a section of the PC-SIG Library plus
all the text and every program from the current issue of Shareware
Magazine. Software reviews for this issue cover over 100 programs
including games, communications, printing, text editors and more. 124
of the programs mentioned in the magazine are included, plus 225
programs updated since the May-June issue.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

ABOUT THE WORD LISTS:
Each word list can have up to 100 vocabulary words and related clues.  All
files created by VOCABULARY POWER may be copied and erased using
normal DOS commands.  The word lists can also be copied using the Back
Up selection of the Extra Menu.  Avoid using the & character in a word list
name.  The & character is used in our companion product CROSSWORD
POWER.  Word lists created with VOCABULARY POWER are 100%
compatible for use with CROSSWORD POWER.

ABOUT THE VOCABULARY WORDS (ANSWERS):
Vocabulary words may be up to 17 characters long.  Any character except
the space, comma, asterisk *, double quote ", vertical bar |, and number
sign # can be used in a vocabulary word.  Numbers can also be used to
create math activities.

ABOUT THE CLUES (DEFINITIONS):
Each clue (definition) can be up to 100 characters long.  Long clues are
automatically divided if necessary.  Any character except the double quote
" and comma can be used in a clue.

The F1 function key can be pressed to reveal a help screen to provide more
information about editing the vocabulary words and clues.

MANIPULATING THE WORD LIST:
Vocabulary words and clues can be automatically changed to upper and lower
case letters, capitalize just the first letter of the word or clue, sorted 
by length, alphabetized, and randomized.

WORD AND CLUE FORMATTING:
The words can be changed back and forth between capital and lower case
letters.  It is easier to work with all capital letters.  However, sometimes
lower case letters are necessary.  For example, in chemistry, CO means
Carbon Monoxide and Co means Cobalt.  This program treats capital letters
and lower case letters as two different letters.  This means that words will
not intersect at a common letter if one is a capital letter and the other is
lower case letter.

HINTS:
Placing the longest words into a word list first does not guarantee that more
total words will be placed into a word search.

Each time a word list is randomized, the order of the vocabulary words and
clues is changed.

Teachers can use different activities to stress the same vocabulary words 
with different formats.  The different activities allow for the different 
learning styles of students.

GENERAL INFORMATION:
When any of the Display Single selections are made, the word list that is
displayed on the status line (at the bottom of the screen) is loaded into
memory.  The first activity and appropriate PRINT MENU are displayed.

For example, when WORD SEARCH - DISPLAY SINGLE is selected, a
single word search maze is displayed.  The PRINT WORD SEARCH MENU
is displayed in the upper left corner.  You are given the following options:

<S>TUDENT MAZE PRINTED:
This option prints the student word search with the extra letters.

<T>EACHER MAZE PRINTED:
This option prints the answer key without the extra letters.

<U>NUSED WORDS DISPLAYED:
This option allows you to display and print words from the word list that
were not inserted into the maze.

VOCABULARY POWER                                                    Page 8

<F>LIP STUDENT/TEACHER MAZE:
Student or teacher mazes can be quickly viewed.

<N>EW MAZE DISPLAYED:
The words are randomized again, then a completely new maze is displayed
and available for printing.

<L>EAVE THIS MENU:
This selection is used to return to the regular pull down menus.


When the PRINT MULTIPLE selection is made, two questions will be
asked.  First you will be asked if you want a teacher (answer key) printed
with each student form.  Then you will be asked how many copies of the
activity you want printed.  You can automatically print up to 40 different
activities (Word Searches, Vocabulary Bingo cards, Quizzes, etc.)  when this
selection is made.


WORDSEARCH DETAILS:
The Word Search size is selected on the SETTINGS MENU.  The maze size
can be varied from 3 to 24 columns and from 3 to 20 rows.  Up to 100
words will be placed automatically in each maze.  Words will be arranged
forwards, backwards, horizontal, vertical, and diagonally.  A random spot
is chosen for the first word to be placed into the maze.  Then other words
will attempt to intersect the first word.  When no more word placements can
be made, the WORDSEARCH PRINT MENU is displayed.  


CRYPTOLIST DETAILS:
The word list is randomized before choosing 20 words.  If your word list has
less than 20 words, the entire word list will be used.  Each letter of the
vocabulary word will be substituted by a different letter.  All words on the
list use the same letter substitution.
                      
VOCABULARY POWER                                                   Page 9

For example, the word CELERY could have been randomized as RXJXWM. 
The letter R was substituted for the letter C in celery.  The letter X was
substituted for the letter E.  Since there are two E's in CELERY, there are
two X's, at the second and fourth positions in the word.  Every word of this
print out uses the same letter substitution.  If the word PLANE was also on
this list, the last letter would also have to be an X.  A grid is printed at 
the bottom of the student paper for help.  The substitution key is displayed 
on the screen and printed on the teacher key.

Each additional cryptolist that is displayed and printed uses a different 
group of 20 words and a different letter substitution method.


JUGGLE WORDS DETAILS:
The word list is randomized before choosing 20 words.  If your word list has
less than 20 words, the entire word list will be used.  The letters of the
vocabulary word will be randomized.  Each additional juggle word activity
that is displayed and printed uses 20 different words and a different letter
randomization.


BINGO CARD DETAILS:
Your word list must have at least 25 words to make bingo cards.  When this
selection is made a bingo card is displayed with the PRINT CARD MENU. 
Each vocabulary bingo card fits neatly on a 8 1/2" by 11" piece of paper.

PRINTING MULTIPLE VOCABULARY BINGO CARDS:
This selection allows automatic printing of up to 40 different Vocabulary
Bingo Cards.

FLASH CARDS (OR BINGO CALLING CARDS) DETAILS:
The flash cards used for vocabulary drills can also be used as calling cards
for vocabulary bingo.  When this selection is made, a menu listing 6
different options is displayed.  The calling (flash) cards allow printing
the words and clues on regular 8 1/2" by 11" paper or 3" by 5" cards.  The
words and clues may be printed on the same or opposite sides of the paper.

VOCABULARY POWER                                                  Page 10

When the vocabulary words and clues are printed on opposite sides of the
paper, you will have to turn the paper over to print the back side.

The vocabulary words will be printed in expanded larger print size if an
Epson FX, Epson LQ, IBM Proprinter, or Okidata printer is being used.

Additional menu help can help center the paper in the printer.

ASCII FILE NAMING DETAILS:
If an activity is saved as an ASCII file, the following pattern is used 
to name the file:

The first part of the file name uses the same name as the word list.  The
extension part (the three letters after the period) varies depending on the
activity and if it is the teacher or student copy.  The first letter of the
extension will always be V (for VOCABULARY).  The last letter will either
be a S for STUDENT or T for TEACHER.  The second letter varies with
the activity.

The second letter uses the following pattern Wordsearch = W, Cryptolist =
C, Juggle word = J, Multiple choice quiz = M, and matching Quiz = Q
For example, the file HOMONYMS.VCT uses the HOMONYMS.WL word
list.  The file is (C) Cryptolist of the (T) Teachers activity.  

The original word lists use the extension .WL  The word list files are saved
as ASCII files to make spell checking easier.  If you use the spell checker
of your word processor, and your words are changed, make sure to save the 
word list file in ASCII format.  Many word processors use special formatting 
codes when files are saved the regular way.  Saving of the file in ASCII 
format prevents saving of the formatting codes.

MATCHING QUIZ DETAILS:
Word lists are randomized before choosing 20 words.  If the word list has
less than 20 words, the entire word list will be used.   Clues for these 20
words will be randomized and displayed.  When long clues are displayed, the
first part is displayed with a plus (+) sign to indicate more letters.  Long
clues are automatically wrapped for proper appearance when printed.  A
blank is printed in front of the word number for the student choice.  The
correct response letter is printed in front of the number on the teacher key.

Each additional quiz that is printed uses a different group of 20 words and
a different random answer pattern.  Up to 40 different forms can be printed
automatically.  Making different matching quizzes has never been this easy.

MULTIPLE CHOICE QUIZ DETAILS:
The word list is randomized before choosing 20 words.  If your word list has
less than 20 words, the entire word list will be used.  The clues for these 
20 words will be randomized and displayed.  Then conflicting choices (wrong
answers) will be chosen from all words in the word list.  Then the correct
answer and three conflicting answers are randomized.  Long clues and long
answers are automatically wrapped for proper appearance when printed.  A
blank is printed in front of the word number for the student choice.  The
letter of the correct response is printed in front of the item number on the
teacher key.

Each additional quiz that is printed uses a different group of 20 words and
a different random answer pattern and a different set of conflicting choices. 
Up to 40 different forms can be printed automatically.

When the printer is selected, additional questions will be asked.

SHEET FEEDER <Yes or No>:
You will be asked if a sheet feeder is attached to the printer.

IGNORE PRINTER STATUS <Yes or No>:
VOCABULARY POWER always checks the status of the parallel printer port
before sending any data.  This normally works quite well.  However, if you
map a parallel port to a serial one by the MODE command, or if you have
a non-standard, or very fast computer, you may experience problems. 
VOCABULARY POWER might actually think that your printer port (LPT1:)
is busy when you know it is not.  If you have printer problems like this,
select Y for Yes to ignore the printer status.

SYMBOL SET <Yes or No>:
If a LaserJet or DeskJet printers was selected, you will be asked which
symbol set to use.  Symbol sets 10U PC-8, 11U PC-8 (Danish/Norwegian),
and 12U PC-850 are supported.  These symbol sets include the line drawing
characters needed by the bingo cards.  If your laser compatible printer
can not support one of these three symbol sets, also set the box drawing
selection on the Settings Menu to NO.

BOX DRAWING CHARACTERS:
If your printer prints foreign language characters around the squares on the
BINGO cards, this should be set to NO.  Then dashes and plus signs will be
substituted for the BOX characters

PRINTER PITCH:
Select a printer pitch supported by your printer.

SET PRINTER TO LETTER QUALITY:
Depending on the printer, the work sheets may be printed in either draft of
letter quality mode.

SELECT PRINTER FONT:
LaserJet, DeskJet and Epson LQ printers support different fonts.  
The LaserJet II and DeskJet printers have built-in fixed width 10 and 16.66
(condensed) pitch Courier fonts.  Printing 12 and 15 pitch fonts require
downloaded fixed-width fonts or fixed-width font cartridges.

The EpsonLQ optional font module is also supported giving the user six
additional fonts.  VOCABULARY POWER supports all fonts and pitches
included with the optional font module.

0. Roman         (10,12,15 pitch)          5. OCR-B         (10 pitch)
1. San Serif     (10,12,15 pitch)          6. OCR-A         (10 pitch)
