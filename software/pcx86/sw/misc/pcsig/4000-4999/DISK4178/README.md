The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We
recommend a 386 with a VGA monitor.

The brand new PC-SIG World Of Windows is a must-have for Windows users.
In order to produce the best possible Windows collection PC-SIG has made
an alliance with the acclaimed Windows OnLine BBS. So not only do you have
access to the collecting and weeding out efforts for which PC-SIG is
famous, but also the huge volume of fonts and sound files and the in-depth
software reviews of the world's best Windows BBS.

This CD contains every one of the best Windows shareware programs
available, 350+ in all, over 900 TrueType fonts which can be used
without royalties, 429 ATM fonts, over 2,000 sound files in .WAV,
.VOC, .SND, .SOU, .MID format and 2,794 icons! A major computer
catalog is offering a collection of 250 fonts for $49.95. They have
great prices on hardware and software, but this time they can't
touch us.

As if the files aren't enough, we thought you would want to preview
and use these sounds, fonts, icons and programs directly from the CD,
without taking the time and space to unarchive them. So we have
included a font previewer and installed, a sound player and an icon
manager. Over 200 of the programs can be run simply by clicking on
them in the File Manager. Nobody else offers you anything close to
this type of access.

We're not done yet. In add to all the Windows riches described above,
this CD also contains the text and programs from the July-August
issue of Shareware Magazine. This is the second in a six-volume PC-SIG
Encyclopedia of Shareware CD-ROM series (Games was the first). Each
volume includes the programs from a section of the PC-SIG Library plus
all the text and every program from the current issue of Shareware
Magazine. Software reviews for this issue cover over 100 programs
including games, communications, printing, text editors and more. 124
of the programs mentioned in the magazine are included, plus 225
programs updated since the May-June issue.

## PROBLEMS.DOC

{% raw %}
```
Known problems (and in some cases, fixes):

Not finding EGA in the detection routine:
Some older EGA video cards only have 64K of memory, more
is needed for the high-resolution animation in the FLIX software
__________________________________________________________________

The software must be installed to your hard drive.
When installing the software, be sure to make a directory to put
the software into:
     MD FLIX  (Make a directory called FLIX, for example)
     CD FLIX  (Change to the FLIX directory)
     COPY A:*.* (Copy the floppies to your hard drive)
When running the software, be sure to change to the directory
it has been installed into first (CD FLIX).
You don't have to do the above, but it prevents having a big mess.
__________________________________________________________________

TSR's (Terminate and stay resident programs), that can "pop-up"
while other things are running can lead to unexpected results...
__________________________________________________________________

GRASPRT.EXE is a DOS program (it is the run-time module for the
software).  It is best to run the software under DOS, not WINDOWS.
Depending on your WINDOWS version and configuration, you may
experience problems.  For instance, the sound for "Animated Words"
will be distorted when using the SoundBlaster with Windows 3.1
using multimedia extensions.  The reason for this is primarily that
the high-resolution animation (and digital sound for "Animated
Words") requires ALL of the resources of your PC.
__________________________________________________________________

Some of the software is invoked from a batch (.BAT) file.  
This may cause a problem with some menu programs (control not 
returning to the menu after the FLIX program is run).  
There are two possible fixes for this.  

The easiest is to use the command CALL (which allows control to
return to the calling batch file - your menu) to prefix the
instruction you use in your menu program.  For example: use CALL
SHAPES when running "Animated Shapes" from your menu, not just
SHAPES.

Another solution would be to bypass the .BAT file used to run the
FLIX software by using the contents of the .BAT file instead.  To
see what is in the .BAT file use TYPE SHAPES.BAT (for example).  In
this case it would tell you that SHAPES.BAT says GRASPRT SHAPES. 
So instead of telling your menu program to use SHAPES, tell it to
use GRASPRT SHAPES to run "Animated Shapes".

Some of the programs are run from an .EXE file (AWORDS.EXE), so it
should behave just like any other program with a menu.
__________________________________________________________________

"The Animated Memory Game" is invoked with the AMEM.BAT file, not
AMEN.BAT (AMEM vs. AMEN)
__________________________________________________________________

Digital sound for "Animated Words":

Can't hear the PC speaker very well, or it doesn't sound very good:
Some PC's have very small speakers located deep inside the cabinet
- they won't sound very good.  The ability to play digitized speech
through the PC's speaker was not engineered into the design of
PC's, the ability to do it using RealSound, is going to vary
significantly depending on your hardware.  I licensed RealSound to
get the best commercial-quality program to perform this trick.

What is the Covox Speech Thing?
It is a sound device that runs from the printer port (parallel
port) of your PC.  The Disney Sound Source operates in a similar
manner.  I am licensed to use the Disney Sound Source, but that
support is not available at this time, the GRASP/RealSound sound
drivers used do not support it and I would need to write my own
drivers.  If the demand for that is great, an upgrade may be
implemented.

VPLAY included with the SoundBlaster software conflicts with the
detection and sound routines used in "Animated Words".  Running
TEST-SBC seems to clear it, but it is recommended that your don't
run VPLAY before running AWORDS.  Other sound software may conflict
as well, it is best that you run AWORDS before running any other
SoundBlaster software.

When the program is first run you will be taken through a set-up
process to determine the type of input device you want to use as
well as how the sound will be handled.  Please be accurate when
telling the set-up routine what type of equipment (sound cards
etc.) you have installed.  If you have an AdLib or Sound Blaster
compatible card (but is not a AdLib or Sound Blaster), one or the
other choice may work.  If you experience difficulties, exit to
DOS, type RESET, and try again.  If you need to change your set-up
(if you install a new sound card, for instance), type RESET to tell
the program about it.
__________________________________________________________________

I do extensive Beta-testing, but the DOS world is somewhat
unpredictable, by the time you take a motherboard from manufacturer
A, and combine it with a video card from B, monitor from C, memory
from D, software from E, all the combinations become impossible to
test for....

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
