The brand new PC-SIG World Of Windows is a must-have for Windows users.
In order to produce the best possible Windows collection PC-SIG has made
an alliance with the acclaimed Windows OnLine BBS. So not only do you have
access to the collecting and weeding out efforts for which PC-SIG is
famous, but also the huge volume of fonts and sound files and the in-depth
software reviews of the world's best Windows BBS.

This CD contains every one of the best Windows shareware programs
available, 350+ in all, over 900 TrueType fonts which can be used
without royalties, 429 ATM fonts, over 2,000 sound files in .WAV,
.VOC, .SND, .SOU, .MID format and 2,794 icons! A major computer
catalog is offering a collection of 250 fonts for $49.95. They have
great prices on hardware and software, but this time they can't
touch us.

As if the files aren't enough, we thought you would want to preview
and use these sounds, fonts, icons and programs directly from the CD,
without taking the time and space to unarchive them. So we have
included a font previewer and installed, a sound player and an icon
manager. Over 200 of the programs can be run simply by clicking on
them in the File Manager. Nobody else offers you anything close to
this type of access.

We're not done yet. In add to all the Windows riches described above,
this CD also contains the text and programs from the July-August
issue of Shareware Magazine. This is the second in a six-volume PC-SIG
Encyclopedia of Shareware CD-ROM series (Games was the first). Each
volume includes the programs from a section of the PC-SIG Library plus
all the text and every program from the current issue of Shareware
Magazine. Software reviews for this issue cover over 100 programs
including games, communications, printing, text editors and more. 124
of the programs mentioned in the magazine are included, plus 225
programs updated since the May-June issue.

    for deleting these.)

    Program settings can be changed or customized by pressing ALT-F9
    at the Main Menu.  This includes the ability to view students'
    progress or change levels of difficulty.







                                                                page 1
                 INSTRUCTIONS FOR PARENTS AND TEACHERS
                 -------------------------------------
    GENERAL

    Minimum program requirements: 100% compatible PC, XT, AT with 512K
    RAM, DOS 3.0 or higher, graphics adapter (Hercules mono, EGA, VGA).

    MathCounts 1+2 runs fine from a floppy disk.  Put the disk in the
    drive, and at the A:> (or B:>) prompt type: MC12 <Enter> 

    LEAVE THE FLOPPY DISK IN THE DRIVE until after you exit the program.
    Make backup copies regularly, no matter which drive you use.

    To put the program on a hard drive, first make a directory:

    (example)     MD C:\MC12  <Enter>  

    Then change to the new directory:

    (example)     CD C:\MC12  <Enter>

    Once you are in the new directory, put the MathCounts 1+2 disk in
    drive A and copy ALL MathCounts 1+2 files into the new directory:
    
                  COPY A:\*.*  <Enter>

    To run MathCounts 1+2 from a hard drive, change to the proper    
    directory (MC12:\>) if you haven't yet and type:

                  MC12 <Enter>


    (NOTE: If your disk already has other students' names and records
           stored on it, see instructions below for deleting these
           so that your student(s) will start out with new records.)


    GETTING STARTED

    MathCounts 1+2 is easy to use.  However, at least at first, young
    children will need some guidance.  The program covers four broad areas:

    1.) Counting and Patterns

    2.) Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication

    3.) Telling Time, Fractions

    4.) Word Problems

    Each area includes subsections, with problems at many different levels
    of difficulty.  Beginning students should start out with counting and

                                                                page 2
    addition.  More advanced students can start anywhere (they can always
    go back) if appropriate levels are set on the Student's Activity Graph
    (see details below).

    PROGRAM SPEED

    Program performance on the oldest (slowest) PC's and XT's may be
    sluggish (on XT's be sure to use the fastest turbo setting, and set
    the turbo switch BEFORE loading MathCounts 1+2).


    RECORDS

    MathCounts 1+2 keeps track of how well students are doing. (Students
    do well if given the chance.)  If a student correctly completes at
    least three out of four problems of a given type, MathCounts 1+2
    automatically moves on to harder problem levels. If not, further
    problems of that type will be at the same level of difficulty
    until at least 75% are done correctly.  The primary reason for
    keeping records is to allow the program to change levels properly
    and to progress at different rates in different areas.  However,
    the records can also be used to check the suitability of this
    tutorial for any given student.

    An overview of a student's progress is presented in the Student's
    Activity Graph, accessible by pressing ALT-F9 at the Main Menu.

    The Students Progress Graph should be used with some sensitivity.
    You may find that this graph is consulted often, since it shows at
    a glance how many problems of each kind have been done, which levels
    a student is working at.  The graph is there to help students and
    instructors see what material has been covered.  Many factors can
    affect the information shown on the graph, (e.g. changing difficulty
    levels to repeat problem types) and it is therefore best to use it
    as a general guide only.

    Records are kept in the MC12RECS.DAT file, which must be on the
    floppy disk, or in the directory, from which MathCounts 1+2 is run.


    LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY

    In each area of the tutorial, a student works at a particular level
    of difficulty.  It is possible to go down a level or levels (to
    repeat certain types of problems) or to go up (to do specific
    problems, or for students that are beginning at an advanced level).
    The Student's Activity Graph (ALT-F9 at the Main Menu) shows the
    current difficulty level for each tutorial area.  Use the up-down
    arrow keys to highlight the category level you wish to change,
    and then just follow the prompts.  This is a convenient way to
    go back a level to repeat certain kinds of problems.  


                                                                page 3
    DELETING NAMES

    MathCounts 1+2 will prompt for up to three students' names and keep
    records for them.  You can delete students if you need to (WARNING:
    students' records will be deleted as well).  Be sure you have a
    CURRENT BACKUP copy in case you decide afterward that you have made
    a mistake.  Press <ALT><F9> at the  main menu to show the setting
    choices.  Select number 3) Change Student Names.  Answer the prompts
    to delete any or all names AND RECORDS.  

             
    CHANGING NAMES IN WORD PROBLEMS

    In each word problem, one or more names will be used.  You can    
    change the names that will appear (your children might like to use 
    the names of friends or acquaintances).  To list the names or make 
    changes, press <ALT><F9> at the main menu.  Select number 2) Word 
    Problem Names.  You can use UP TO 10 CHARACTERS for each name. 


    IF YOU NEED ADDITIONAL HELP

    If a problem arises which you cannot solve after carefully reading
    these instructions, and you find that you need to contact Able Art
    Software for technical assistance, please include all relevant    
    information on: your computer system (including CPU, disk drives, 
    video adapter), DOS version, and other system software.  Please 
    also note the details concerning the problem you are having,
    including the exact part of the program you are using, and any
    keystrokes entered just prior to the difficulty.


                                * * * * 

    MathCounts 1+2 is based upon the notion that students, especially
    in their earlier years, need all the help they can get learning to
    use and enjoy mathematics.  Building confidence and a positive out-
    look can sometimes be more important than "mastering" benchmark   
    concepts.  Students are all different; they learn best in different 
    ways and at different rates.  Materials which adapt to such dif-  
    ferences in the most positive way possible are preferable.  If    
    computer programs are to promote learning, they must do more than
    automate the delivery of drill materials. They must begin to provide
    flexible, dynamic, and individualized tools for inquiring minds.

    DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS:

         You are hereby granted permission to distribute MathCounts 1+2
         as long as you:

         1) Clearly explain, in an obvious manner, the shareware concept,
            the need for users to register shareware products they use,
            and that the price the user pays for your disks is a copying
            fee only.

         2) Leave all copyright notices intact and in place.        
  
         3) Have not been asked by us not to distribute it.
           
         4) Only distribute the shareware version of MathCounts 1+2.
            A message at the beginning of the shareware version clearly
            states that "This is an UNREGISTERED shareware copy." Any
            version of MathCounts 1+2 without this message must not
            be distributed. The shareware version is not "crippled" in
            any way; it merely includes shareware messages and
            information which are removed from the registered version.

         5) When listing MathCounts 1+2 in any vendor catalog,
            advertisement, or mailer, call it "MathCounts 1+2"
            and not ANY other name.  

         6) Do not "rent" or "lease" MathCounts 1+2 to others. 



         If you have not already done so, we strongly recommend that 
         you become an ASP approved vendor.  The ASP vendor program 
         provides an important service for both authors and vendors, 
         and gives customers confidence that reasonable standards are 
         met in the distribution of shareware products. Contact:

                            MathCounts 3+4 v1.1 
       copyright (c) 1992-93 Able Art Software - All Rights Reserved.

                        ***** PROGRAM FEATURES *****

         * Graphics-based 3rd and 4th grade math tutorial covering
           +, -, x, /, %, fractions, decimals, word problems, and more.

         * Instructive feedback and remedial work are provided.

         * A simple Menu system, or an automatic Beginner's Mode,     
           can accommodate students with different rates of learning.

         * MathCounts 3+4 keeps track of students' progress: where 
           they are, what they've done, what they're ready to do next.

         * The program can be customized with favorite reinforcing     
           words and phrases, and friends' names in word problems.


    QUICK START SUMMARY (full instructions below give complete details):

    Make a backup copy of your MathCounts 3+4 floppy disk and put it in
    drive A (or B).  Close the drive door and type A: (or B: if using
    the B drive).

    Set Turbo speed to fast if you are using an older PC-XT.

    At the A: (or B:) prompt, type MC34 and press enter.

    LEAVE THE DISK IN THE DRIVE until after you exit MathCounts 3+4.

    When prompted, enter the student's name. (If your disk already has
    other students' names and records on it, see full instructions
    for deleting these.)

    For beginning students of about 3rd grade ability, try choosing
    Beginner's Mode to start with.

    To concentrate on specific problem areas, or for more advanced
    students, choose Menu Mode. (You can switch between Beginner's
    Mode and Menus by restarting the program.)

    Program settings can be changed or customized by pressing ALT-F9
    at the Main Menu.

    To view students' progress or change levels of difficulty, select
    the Students' Progress Graph (Shapes, Sizes, Graph Menu).

                                                                page 1
    
                 INSTRUCTIONS FOR PARENTS AND TEACHERS
                 -------------------------------------
    GENERAL

    Minimum program requirements: 100% compatible PC, XT, AT with 640K
    RAM, DOS 3.0 or higher, graphics adapter (Hercules mono, EGA, VGA).

    MathCounts 3+4 runs fine from a floppy disk.  Put the disk in the
    drive, and at the A:> (or B:>) prompt type: MC34 <Enter> 

    LEAVE THE FLOPPY DISK IN THE DRIVE until after you exit the program.
    Make backup copies regularly, no matter which drive you use.

    To put the program on a hard drive, first make a directory:

    (example)     MD C:\MC34  <Enter>  

    Then change to the new directory:

    (example)     CD C:\MC34  <Enter>

    Once you are in the new directory, put the MathCounts 3+4 disk in
    drive A and copy ALL MathCounts 3+4 files into the new directory:
    
                  COPY A:\*.*  <Enter>

    To run MathCounts 3+4 from a hard drive, change to the proper    
    directory (MC34:\>) if you haven't yet and type:

                  MC34 <Enter>

    (NOTE: If your disk already has other students' names and records
           stored on it, see instructions below for deleting these
           so that your student(s) will start out with new records.)


    GETTING STARTED: BEGINNER'S MODE AND MENUS 

    MathCounts 3+4 covers a lot of material, but is easy to use.  After
    a brief introduction, students should be able to manage largely on
    their own.  

    For beginning students of about 3rd grade level, it may be best to
    start with Beginner's Mode. (Choose this option after the student's
    name has been entered.)  Beginner's Mode will automatically present
    suitable problems in an ordered series.  When a student becomes
    comfortable with the material and presentation, or any time you
    want to concentrate on specific problem areas, you can switch to
    using the Menus.  (Beginner's Mode is available for 7 "lessons",
    after which only the Menu system is active.)
 
  
                                                                page 2 
    All of the program's functions are available through a simple Menu
    system.  Choices on each Menu progress from (1) less to (7) more  
    difficulty.  For most students, a sequential approach starting with
    earlier Menu items and then progressing to later ones will give the
    best results.  But don't wait to finish all the items on one Menu
    before starting on the next Menu.  For example, students should be
    trying easy word problems (item 1 on the Word Problem Menu) by the  
    time they've done some addition and subtraction (items 1 and 2 on  
    the previous Menu).  The program will recognize attempts to do 
    problems that are well beyond the current level of difficulty, and 
    suggest that easier ones be done first (see instructions below for 
    moving up or down difficulty levels).

    To go back to Beginner's Mode after using the Menus, choose to exit
    the program, and then press 'n' when asked if you want to leave   
    MathCounts 3+4. Select student's name, and then 2) Beginner's Mode. 
    If the student has already covered many of the Menu items,        
    Beginner's Mode may seem too easy.


    PROGRAM SPEED

    Program performance on the oldest (slowest) PC's and XT's may be  
    sluggish (on XT's be sure to use the fastest turbo setting).


    RECORDS

    MathCounts 3+4 keeps track of how well students are doing. (Students
    do well if given the chance.)  If a student correctly completes at
    least three out of four problems of a given type, MathCounts 3+4
    automatically moves on to harder problem levels. If not, further
    problems of that type will be at the same level of difficulty
    until at least 75% are done correctly.  The primary reason for
    keeping records is to allow the program to change levels properly
    and to progress at different rates in different areas.  However,
    the records can also be used to check the suitability of this
    tutorial for any given student.

    MathCounts 3+4 will often supply remedial problems in appropriate
    background areas when a student is having some trouble.  On the   
    other hand, if a student jumps ahead to problems at harder levels,
    the program will suggest that background material be covered first.
    (Suggestions can be ignored and over-ridden.)  An overview of a   
    student's progress is presented in the Student's Progress Graph,  
    item 5 on the Shapes, Sizes, Graph Menu.

    The Students Progress Graph should be used with some sensitivity.
    You may find that this graph is consulted often, since it shows at
    a glance how many problems of each kind have been done, which levels
    a student is working at, and the percentage of "correct" responses
    in each area.  The graph is there to help students and instructors

                                                                page 3
    see what material has been covered.  Many factors can affect the  
    information shown on the graph, (e.g. changing difficulty levels
    to repeat problem types) and it is therefore best to use it as a
    general guide only.

    Records are kept in the MCRECORD.DAT file, which must be on the   
    floppy disk, or in the directory, from which MathCounts 3+4 is run.


    LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY

    In each area of the tutorial, a student works at a particular level
    of difficulty.  It is possible to go down a level or levels (to   
    repeat certain types of problems) or to go up (to do specific    
    problems, or for students that are beginning at an advanced level).
    Difficulty levels can be changed in two ways:
   
       1.) Whenever a menu item beyond the current difficulty level   
           is selected, a message will appear suggesting that easier  
           menu items be completed first, but the option will be      
           given to change the difficulty level upward as well.

       2.) The Student's Progress Graph (item 5 on Shapes, Sizes,
           Graph Menu) shows the current difficulty level for each
           tutorial area.  Use the up-down arrow keys to highlight
           the category level you wish to change, and then just
           follow the prompts.  This is a convenient way to go back
           a level to repeat certain kinds of problems.  


    DELETING NAMES

    MathCounts 3+4 will prompt for up to three students' names and keep
    records for them.  You can delete students if you need to (WARNING:
    students' records will be deleted as well).  Be sure you have a
    CURRENT BACKUP copy in case you decide afterward that you have made
    a mistake.  Press <ALT><F9> at the  main menu to show the setting
    choices.  Select number 3) Students & Records.  Answer the prompts
    to delete any or all names and records.  


    CHANGING ENCOURAGEMENT

    Throughout the program, words and phrases of encouragement appear
    when a student does well.  MathCounts 3+4 comes with a list of    
    these, but you may want to change them to better reflect current  
    local usage or personal preference (your children may have favorite 
    phrases, or they may tire of old ones).  To list the phrases or make
    changes, press <ALT><F9> at the main menu.  Select 1) Encouragement.
    You can use UP TO 16 CHARACTERS for each word or phrase. 

   

                                                                page 4
    CHANGING NAMES IN WORD PROBLEMS

    In each word problem, one or more names will be used.  You can    
    change the names that will appear (your children might like to use 
    the names of friends or acquaintances).  To list the names or make 
    changes, press <ALT><F9> at the main menu.  Select number 2) Word 
    Problem Names.  You can use UP TO 10 CHARACTERS for each name. 


    IF YOU NEED ADDITIONAL HELP

    If a problem arises which you cannot solve after carefully reading
    these instructions, and you find that you need to contact Able Art
    Software for technical assistance, please include all relevant    
    information on: your computer system (including CPU, disk drives, 
    video adapter), DOS version, and other system software.  Please 
    also note the details concerning the problem you are having,
    including the exact part of the program you are using, and any
    keystrokes entered just prior to the difficulty.


                                * * * * 

    MathCounts 3+4 is based upon the notion that students, especially
    in their earlier years, need all the help they can get learning to
    use and enjoy mathematics.  Building confidence and a positive out-
    look can sometimes be more important than "mastering" benchmark   
    concepts.  Students are all different; they learn best in different 
    ways and at different rates.  Materials which adapt to such dif-  
    ferences in the most positive way possible are preferable.  If    
    computer programs are to promote learning, they must do more than
    automate the delivery of drill materials. They must begin to provide
    flexible, dynamic, and individualized tools for inquiring minds.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Outside the U.S.A.: Call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer near

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.


To Order, in the U.S.A.: Call 800-245-6717 and ask Customer Service.

Outside the U.S.A.: Call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer near
you.
