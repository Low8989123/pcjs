    They're ugly. They're stupid. They're weak. They're so unfriendly that
they can't even get along with each other. Unfortunately, there are a lot of
them, and they're all out to get you!

    You managed to get stuck in an anti-aircraft bunker in a strategic area,
without any troop reinforcements. You know that the enemy is going to be
coming in droves, so you're glad that you have a huge supply of ammo to
defend yourself.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
    286 required, 386 STRONGLY recommended.
    VGA graphics card.
    640k, with 535k free from the DOS prompt.
    AdLib, Sound Source, and SoundBlaster optional.
    EMS optional.
    Mouse optional.

THE GAME:
    Your bunker is at the bottom of the screen. You control the position of
the gun with either the keyboard (using the left & right arrow keys to move,
and the spacebar to shoot) or the mouse.

    The enemy aircraft will be coming across the top of the screen, dropping
paratroopers as they go. You need to prevent the paratroopers from landing,
because if three of them land, they'll be able to invade your bunker and
overpower you! (Fortunately for you, they bicker amongst themselves so much
that if they land right next to each other, one of them will kill the other.)

    You can shoot the planes. You can shoot the paratroopers. You can shoot
the paratroopers' chutes off, and watch them plummet helplessly to the
ground (killing any paratroopers that happen to be underneath). Basically,
if it moves, shoot it...

    Be extremely careful with the smart bombs - they're deadly!

SCORING:
    Paratroopers are worth 2 points.
    Big planes are worth 5 points.
    Little planes are worth 10 points.
    Smart bombs are worth 10 points.

    Every time you shoot, you lose a point, so be sure to aim carefully.

INTERMISSIONS:
    After you've beaten back enough of the enemy troops, there'll be a chance
for your compatriots to supply a few things to satisfy basic human needs.
Enjoy the reprieve while you can!

SETUP:
    While the demo loop is running, simply press the "SPACE" key. This will
take you into the control panel.

    When in the control panel, use the up and down arrow keys to move between
the selections, and the "SPACE" or "ENTER" keys to make a selection.

    The first selection is the device to use for sound effects. You can
choose to turn off the sound, use the PC speaker, or, if you have one, use a
Sound Source or SoundBlaster.

    If you're using the Sound Source or SoundBlaster, you can choose how
many digital sound effects can happen at once (one, four, or eight). More
sound effects sound better, but will make the game run slower. If your
machine is slower than a 16MHz 386SX, choose "one." If your machine is faster
than a 16MHz 386SX, I'd recommend "eight."

    If you have an AdLib, SoundBlaster, or compatible, you can turn music
on or off with the next selection.

    The next two items depend on whether or not you're currently in a game.
When you first go into the control panel, the choices are:
    o Start game
    o Back to demo

    Once you've started a game, they change to:
    o Stop game
    o Back to game

    No matter what, there will be another item labeled "Quit to DOS," which
allows you to do just that.

CONCLUSION:
    What are you waiting for? Go to it!

## PROBLEMS.TXT

{% raw %}
```
 This file contains a list of problems that you might have with Night Raid,
and what you can do about them.

    Problem: The game hangs on the startup screen.
    Solution: Some of Night Raid's device detection code is conflicting
with something in your system. The following are command line switches that
disable certain attempts at detection. Use use them, start Night Raid by
typing "NITERAID /xxx" ("NTR /xxx" for the shareware version), where "xxx" 
is one of the following:
    GRAPHICS        Disables VGA card detection.
    NOMOUSE         Disables Mouse/mouse driver detection.
    NOADLIB         Disables AdLib and SoundBlaster detection.
    NOSOUNDBLASTER  Disables SoundBlaster detection.
    NOSOUNDSOURCE   Disables Sound Source detection.

    Problem: The game pauses every once and awhile.
    Solution: Night Raid is having a hard time fitting everything it needs
into memory. Try making more memory available to the game by removing any
TSRs you don't need, or using an EMS emulator (such as EMM386.SYS) to make
more memory available to Night Raid. To make Night Raid use the EMS, use
"NITERAID /USEEMS" to start the game.

    Problem: The game hangs during play, or the sounds stop playing.
    Solution: Night Raid can make heavy demands on the system -
simultaneously reading from the disk and playing multiple sound effects from
EMS. Some EMS setups have a difficult time with this. If you're using EMS,
try running Night Raid without it. Some SoundBlaster cards may have
problems with Night Raid's autodetection, or problems may crop up if you
have set your SoundBlaster up in a non-standard way - see the section below
on setting the "BLASTER" environment variable.

	Problem: I'm using OS/2, and Night Raid interferes with printing.
	Solution: This is probably because of the Sound Source autodetection.
Use "NITERAID /NOSOUNDSOURCE" to avoid the autodetection.

    Problem: The colors are really messed up.
    Solution: Some video cards manage to get by Night Raid's test code. Use
"NITERAID /SLOWPALETTE" to start the game.

    Problem: Night Raid doesn't recognize my Sound Source.
    Solution: If you're using your Sound Source with a Tandy machine, use
"NITERAID /SSTANDY". If you're not using a Tandy, try using "NITERAID /SS?",
where the '?' represents the LPT port you have the Sound Source attached to.
For example, if you have your Sound Source attached to LPT2, then you'd use
"NITERAID /SS2". Note that, if you're using a Tandy, and the "/SSTANDY"
switch by itself doesn't work, you'll have to use both "/SSTANDY" AND "/SS?".

    Problem: Night Raid doesn't recognize my AdLib or SoundBlaster card.
    Solution: Night Raid's AdLib detection relies on bus speed, which works
on almost all systems. However, it may not work on some REALLY fast systems.
Start Night Raid with "NITERAID /ADLIB".

    Problem: Night Raid doesn't recognize my SoundBlaster card.
    Solution: Odds are that you have changed the SoundBlaster's settings, so
Night Raid can't find the card. To fix this, you need to tell Night Raid
about the non-default settings.

    You do this by setting the "BLASTER" environment variable up to contain
the appropriate information. To set the enviroment variable up, either
include the following in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file or type it on the command
line before running Night Raid:
SET BLASTER=Axxx Ix Dx

Axxx represents the the address of the SoundBlaster/SB Pro. For the SB, it's
either A210,A220,A230,A240,A250 or A260. For the SB Pro, it's either A220 or
A240. Default is A220.

Ix represents the IRQ number used by the SB/SB Pro. For the SB, it's either
I2, I5, or I7. IRQ 10 (only available on a machine with AT BIOS and the SB
Pro) is not supported. Default is I7.

Dx represents the DMA channel used by the SB/SB Pro. D0, D1, or D3 are
acceptable values. Default is D1.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Outside the U.S.A.: Call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer near
you.
