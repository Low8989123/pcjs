                         * AQUA MAN DIRECTIONS *


           Aqua Man is a New Soleau Software Puzzle game in its continuing
           series of Strategy games.  The objective is to push various
           shaped pipe links to connect the two storage pumps located on
           the game board.


                      *  MOVING AND PUSHING LINKS *

           Aqua Man is controlled by the Arrow Keys (up/dwn/rgt/lft).
           A link can be pushed in any direction by your man as long
           as it has an unobstructed path.  When pushed, a link will
           continue to move in that direction until either it hits
           another object or reaches the side of the game board.


                   * ROCKS / WHIRLPOOLS / STORAGE PUMPS *

           The brown objects located on many puzzle levels are rocks and
           cannot be moved.  There are also occasionally two whirlpools
           that can be used in your objective to connect the two storage
           pumps.  If you push a link into one of the whirlpools, it will
           emerge from the other whirlpool and continue to slide in the
           same direction until it hits another object.  The link will
           be eliminated if it emerges from the whirlpool and is blocked
           by another object.  There are also various links which have
           no pipes on them.  These will not help you connect the two
           storage pumps, but can be placed so that the other links
           can be properly pushed into the correct positions.

           There is at least one solution to each of the 20 puzzles,
           others have several solutions.  There are no monsters, clocks,
           or alien ships to contend with, it's just a pure logic game
           which relies totally on your problem solving abilities.


                               * SCORE CARDS *

           Aqua Man will allow up to five different players with a personal
           score card.  When you solve a puzzle, it will place a <*> after
           the puzzle number showing that you solved that particular puzzle.
           If you seem to be having trouble solving one puzzle, try another
           one and come back to it later.  Any of the 20 puzzles can be
           tried, so you DO NOT need to do them in any particular order.


                              * KEYS / OPTIONS *

           The keys for all the options are located at the bottom of
           the game board.

               <O>ptions     <C>hoose Puzzle     <Q>uit Game

           <C>hoose Puzzle / brings up the score board and allows you to

                             Solutions


                               * SOLUTIONS *

          Aqua Man will show you a solution for the first three puzzles if
          you want him to.  This is a great way to see how the game is
          played.  However, why let him have all the fun?  Try out the
          first few puzzles and if you're really stuck, press the <O>ption
          key and select Solutions.  Aqua Man will then do his thing and
          push the various links so that they connect the two storage pumps.


                              * DELUXE VERSION *

                         40 Puzzles & All Solutions!
