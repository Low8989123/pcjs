The brand new PC-SIG World Of Windows is a must-have for Windows users.
In order to produce the best possible Windows collection PC-SIG has made
an alliance with the acclaimed Windows OnLine BBS. So not only do you have
access to the collecting and weeding out efforts for which PC-SIG is
famous, but also the huge volume of fonts and sound files and the in-depth
software reviews of the world's best Windows BBS.

This CD contains every one of the best Windows shareware programs
available, 350+ in all, over 900 TrueType fonts which can be used
without royalties, 429 ATM fonts, over 2,000 sound files in .WAV,
.VOC, .SND, .SOU, .MID format and 2,794 icons! A major computer
catalog is offering a collection of 250 fonts for $49.95. They have
great prices on hardware and software, but this time they can't
touch us.

As if the files aren't enough, we thought you would want to preview
and use these sounds, fonts, icons and programs directly from the CD,
without taking the time and space to unarchive them. So we have
included a font previewer and installed, a sound player and an icon
manager. Over 200 of the programs can be run simply by clicking on
them in the File Manager. Nobody else offers you anything close to
this type of access.

We're not done yet. In add to all the Windows riches described above,
this CD also contains the text and programs from the July-August

             Version 1.00

             Copyright (C) 1991, BOCC Software


             WELCOME

             Dodgem is a computer game where you try to dodge blocks that
             are heading towards you, while flying close to a planet's
             surface and collecting valuable minerals.  There are seven
             levels, each progressing longer, and with more blocks.
             Either one or two players can play Dodgem.

             Dodgem has three modes of control- keyboard, joystick, and
             mouse.  The game has a novice and expert difficulty
             selector.  Also, there is sound control.


             SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

             In order to use Dodgem, your computer must be equipped with
             the following:

             - an EGA or VGA card, or a compatible card that will display
             EGA graphics
             - 256K or greater system memory
             - MS-DOS version 2.00 or later

             Dodgem supports these optional pieces of equipment:

             - A Microsoft or compatible mouse
             - A standard joystick.


             STARTING DODGEM

             To start Dodgem, start MS-DOS.  Be sure to install your
             mouse driver if you want to use a mouse with Dodgem.  Insert
             your Dodgem disk (Please make a backup copy first -- see
             below), and log onto the disk drive that contains the Dodgem
             disk.  Type DODGEM at the DOS prompt and press ENTER.
             Dodgem should load.

             Please note that Dodgem will not run on a write-protected
             disk.  Remove the write protection from your Dodgem disk.

             Be sure to make a backup copy of Dodgem when you run it for
             the first time.


             AUTOMATIC SPEED SELECTION

             When you start Dodgem for the first time, you will be told
             that Dodgem has not been configured for your computer.
             Simply press the ENTER key, and Dodgem will automatically
             configure itself to run at the correct speed on your
             computer.

             IMPORTANT:  If you run Dodgem on another computer, be sure
             to select the CPU icon on the top of the screen, so that
             Dodgem will reconfigure itself.

        Copyright (C) 1991, BOCC Software
        
        
        WELCOME
        
        Mathtest is a mathematics problem solving game for students or
        anybody who wants to speed up their mental solving skills.  You
        may choose to solve addition, subtraction, multiplication, or
        division problems.  Combinations of the different types of math
        problems may be chosen also.  You may choose four levels of
        difficulty for the math problems, and nine different settings
        for the elapsed time to solve each math problem.  The math
        problems may be displayed in horizontal or vertical formats.
        
        If you answer a math problem correctly, you get to try to blast
        the "TEST".  When you try to blast the "TEST" for the first
        time, you control a rocket placed on the bottom of the screen. 
        The "TEST" speeds across the top of the screen at a random
        speed.  You must launch the rocket and try to make it hit the
        "TEST".  Every time you hit the "TEST", you score a point.
        
        If your score equals ten points, you then get to try to blast
        the "TEST" in a different way.  You control a blaster on a
        hillside.  You try to blast the "TEST" which is wandering all
        over the screen at different directions and speeds.
        
        This creates a "reward system".  It keeps the player interested
        in the game.  When you blast the "TEST" ten times, you have
        reached your goal.  The goal is a set number thast signals when
        the game will be changed.  If your score reaches reaches the
        value of the goal, the goal is increased by ten points and the
        game becomes more difficult.  When your score reaches sixty
        points, you will have won Mathtest.
        
        
        SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
        
        In order to use Mathtest, your computer must be equipped with
        the following:
        
        - a CGA card or a graphics board with CGA emulation, such as EGA
        or VGA
        - 256K or greater system memory
        - MS-DOS version 2.01 or greater
        

                                        1

        STARTING MATHTEST
        
        To start Mathtest, start your DOS disk and press <ENTER> twice. 
        You should see the A> prompt.  Take out your DOS disk and insert
        your Mathtest disk into drive A: (if your computer only has one
        disk drive, then insert Mathtest into that disk drive).  Type in
        at the DOS prompt:
        A:        (press the <ENTER> key)
        MATHTEST  (press the <ENTER> key)
        
        Mathtest should load.
        
        
        DO THIS FIRST
        
        After you get Mathtest loaded, you will need to configure
        Mathtest so that it will operate at the correct speed for your
        system.  To do this, press the <CONTROL-A> key combination when
        you see the Mathtest title screen or the Main Menu (unless it
        has been done automatically after the BOCC Software screen was
        displayed).  A window titled "Automatic Speed Selector" will
        appear.  Simply press the <ENTER> key to start the configuration
        process.  Do not press any key or activate any memory-resident
        programs while Mathtest is configuring itself.  After the
        configuration process is finished, Mathtest will save the
        information to your disk, so you won't have to press <CONTROL-A>
        again.
        
        If you run Mathtest on a different computer, make sure that you
        press <CONTROL-A> when you see the Mathtest title screen or the
        Main Menu.  Different computers operate at different speeds, so
        it is important to do this.
        
        If for some reason the Automatic Speed Selector doesn't work,
        you may want to manually adjust Mathtest's speed.  Do this by
        pressing <CONTROL-P>.  A window with a selector bar will be
        displayed.  Adjust the bar according to the figure below.

        GETTING MORE INFORMATION
        
        It is important to read the Information Screen before you start
        playing Mathtest for the first time.  Do this by pressing the
        <I> key when you see the Mathtest title screen or the Main Menu.
        
        If you get stuck, or you're just curious about what some
        functions do, press the <F1> key while you are using Mathtest. 

                                        2

        The <F1> key will display help on what the current screen does
        and how to use it.  If you press <F1> again while the help
        screen is displayed, help on how to use the help screens will be
        displayed.

        COPYING MATHTEST 2.01
        
        Mathtest version 2.01 is a Shareware product, and you are
        encouraged to copy Mathtest and freely pass the copies on to
        friends for their evaluation.  Here is how to make a copy of

        1.  Start your DOS disk.  When the A> prompt appears, type in A:
        and press the <ENTER> key.  Then, type in DISKCOPY A: A: and
        press the <ENTER> key.
        
        2.  When the computer asks you to insert the SOURCE diskette,
        take out the disk in the disk drive and and replace it
        with the original Mathtest disk and press the <ENTER> key.
        
        3.  When the computer asks you to insert the TARGET diskette,
        replace the original Mathtest disk with a blank disk.  Press
        <ENTER>.
        
        4.  Repeat step 2 and 3 if your computer tells you to insert the
        SOURCE disk again.  Otherwise, answer N to the "Copy
        another?" question.
        
        5.  Make sure your new copy of Mathtest is in the disk drive,
        and type in ERASE MATHTEST.CFG and press <ENTER>.  That will
        make it so that Mathtest will re-configure itself automatically
        when it is started up on another computer.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

****  SUNDAY SCHOOL COLORS  ****
Version 3.7

Dear vendor,
  The file on this disk SUN.EXE is a self extracting one.  I also included
a INSTALL.DOC file to use if you want.


REQUIREMENTS:
      An IBM pc or compatable
      Dos or Windows 
      EGA or VGA graphics
      A mouse
      128K memory
      A hard disk

ALSO SUPPORTS:
      Sound Blaster & compatable music cards

ABOUT SUNDAY SCHOOL COLORS:
  Sunday School Colors is a simple and easy to play coloring game for young
children as well as older children.  For ages 3 - 13, Kids have fun with
coloring and sound effects while learning bible truths.

  Sunday School Colors is a NEW program for children.  The program 
has been designed to be a fun and positive experience in the life
of a child.  Be sure to include SUNDAY SCHOOL COLORS in your plans.
Your customers will appreciate it !!

QUALITY:

  Sunday School Colors has optional Sound Blaster sound.  Flutes, harps,
piano, violins, etc can be heard while coloring.  There are also sound
effects for pc speaker users also.  The pictures are in the high resolution
640 X 350  format !  A professional painting artist drew these original
masterpieces !!

ATTENTION ALL CD ROM VENDORS:

The following statement is not a term or restriction for distribution.

I would like to talk with you about a real life experience that happened
to me last year.  Last year I made a game called KING JAMES QUEST.  It is
a bible ega adventure game.  I uploaded it to a local BBS.  The sysop put
the game in his EGA/VGA games area.  I noticed that there was 6 quick
downloads of the game.  Later on he moved the game to his Bible games area.
There was no more downloads from there.  WHAT AM I SAYING  ???  Just this,

I designed  SUNDAY SCHOOL COLORS to be a fun and positive experience for
all children !  Not just a few good Christians who look at the religous area
on the CD ROM.  Therefore, I request that you put SUNDAY SCHOOL COLORS in
the CHILDRENS EDUCATION or EGA/VGA GAMES area.  Whether or not someone is a
Christian I do not know, but this I know:  That all children big and small
have fun with the sound effects and colors of SUNDAY SCHOOL COLORS !!
Again, if you want to put it in the religous area then GO FOR IT !!
But, I would rather that you not.
