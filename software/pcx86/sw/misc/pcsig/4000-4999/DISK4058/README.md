The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We
recommend a 386 with a VGA monitor.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

==============================================================================
I. DEFINITION OF SHAREWARE (General Information)

Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software before buying
it. If you try a Shareware program and continue using it, you are expected
to register.

Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software, and the
copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific exceptions as stated
below.  Shareware authors are accomplished programmers, just like commercial
authors, and the programs are of comparable quality.  (In both cases, there
are good programs and bad ones!).  The main difference is in the method of
distribution.  The author specifically grants the right to copy and distri-
bute the software, either to all and sundry, or to a specific group.

Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software.  You should
find software that suits your needs and pocketbook, whether it's commercial
or Shareware. The Shareware system makes fitting your needs easier, because
you can try before you buy.  And because the overhead is low, prices are
low also. Shareware has the ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't
use the product, you don't pay for it.

==============================================================================
II. DISCLAIMER - AGREEMENT

USERS OF LINGUAPRO/SPANISH(TM) MUST ACCEPT THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY:
"LINGUAPRO/SPANISH IS SUPPLIED AS IS.  THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES,
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND OF FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.  THE AUTHOR ASSUMES NO
LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES, DIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL, WHICH MAY RESULT FROM THE
USE OF LINGUAPRO/SPANISH".

==============================================================================
III. LINGUAPRO DISTRIBUTION AND REGISTRATION

LinguaPro/SPANISH is a "shareware program" and is provided at no charge
to the user for evaluation.  Feel free to share it with your friends, but
please do not give it away altered or as part of another system.  The
essence of "user-supported" software is to provide personal computer users
with quality software without high prices, and yet to provide incentive
for programmers to continue to develop new products.  If you find this
program useful, and find that you are using LinguaPro/SPANISH after a
30 day trial period, you must make a registration payment of $39.95 to
Schulenberg & Associates, Inc.  The $39.95 registration fee will license
one copy for use on any one computer at any one time.  You must treat this
software just like a book.  An example is that this software may be used
by any number of people and may be freely moved from one computer location
to another, so long as there is no possibility of it being used at one
location while it's being used at another -- just as a book cannot be
read by two different persons at the same time.

Commercial users of LinguaPro/SPANISH must register and pay for their
copies of LinguaPro/SPANISH within 30 days of first use or their license
is withdrawn.  Site-License arrangements may be made by contacting
Schulenberg and Associates, Inc.

Anyone distributing LinguaPro/SPANISH for any kind of remuneration must
first contact Schulenberg and Associates, Inc. at the address below for
authorization.  This authorization will be automatically granted to
distributors recognized by the ASP (Association of Shareware Professionals)
as adhering to its guidelines for shareware distributors, and such
distributors may begin offering LinguaPro/SPANISH immediately (However
Schulenberg and Associates must still be advised so that the distributor
can be kept up-to-date with the latest version of LinguaPro/SPANISH).

You are welcome to pass a copy of LinguaPro/SPANISH along to your friends
for evaluation.  Please encourage them to register their copy if they find
that they can use it.  All registered users will receive a copy of the latest
version of the LinguaPro/SPANISH system, together with all of the additional
vocabulary and verb files described below.

Please complete the registration form REGISTER.DOC that is included with
LinguaPro/SPANISH.  You may pay by check, money order, or by credit card.
Customers outside of the United States should pay by credit card, or by
a postal money order drawn on US dollars.

Thank you.

==============================================================================
IV.  INSTALLATION PROCEDURES

    The SHAREWARE version of Lingua/Pro SPANISH is distributed through
Shareware vendors and computer bulletin board systems as a single compressed
file using PKZIP version 2.04g.  This compressed file exists in two forms:

     LPROSP22.ZIP  (Bulletin Boards)
     LPROSP22.EXE  (Floppy disk)

     If you have downloaded LinguaPro v2.20 from a bulletin board then you must
utilize PKUNZIP (v. 2.04) to expand the files.  PKZIP and PKUNZIP are available
as self-expanding downloadable files on almost all BBS's.

     If you have obtained LinguaPro from a floppy disk then you will have an
EXE file that will self-expand simply by typing "LPROSP22".

     Once expanded, the LPROSP22.ZIP or LPROSP22.EXE files may be deleted to
conserve disk space.  If you pass this software on to your friends to try,
please give them one of these original files, and NOT the internal files.
Since the PKZIP'ed files are self-authentifying, this procedure ensures that
no files are lost and that there is no possibility for the introduction of a
virus.

    After the expansion of the compressed file you will have the following
disk files:

---------------------------- files for vendors/sysops ---------------------

     FILE_ID.DIZ     Special description file used by Bulletin Board SYSOPs
                       to label and catalog uploaded files
     VENDOR.DOC      Information useful to Shareware vendors and BBS Sysops

     LP.LIB          LinguaPro/SPANISH(TM) Library File
     SPANISH.VRB     Database file for VERB Reference Facility containing
                       approximately 300 fully defined and conjugated verbs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------- LinguaPro Data Files --------------------------

     SHARE1.SPA      Spanish Vocabulary File (SHAREWARE version) containing
                       about 1,000 words.
     TVERB1.SPA      Spanish VERB Phrase File containing 76 fully conjugated
                       verbs and verb phrases.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    After LinguaPro has executed for the first time, three additional files
will be generated automatically:

     USORT.BIN      LinguaPro/SPANISH System File
     SPA.BIN        Compression/Decompression File for Spanish
     TVERB1.SPC     File which "remembers" your last choice of verb tenses,
                      verbs, and persons.

NOTE:  On slower PCs the file USORT.BIN may require 5 minutes or so for
generation.  The screen display will keep you advised as to the status of
the construction process.  This is a one-shot operation so please be
patient.

    Once you have gotten familiar enough with the vocabulary file to begin
to "kill" words that have been mastered, then you will also see the following
file:

     KILLED.SPA


NOTE:  Due to the difficulty (and cost) of uploading and downloading large
       files, the Shareware version of LinguaPro/SPANISH has been kept as
       small as possible by reducing the number and sizes of its associated
       data files.  For example, the file SHARE1.SPA contains about 1,000
       words randomly extracted from the 18,000 word vocabulary that is shipped
       with the registered version.  Similarly, the TVERB1.SPA that is
       provided with the Shareware version will drill you on the first 76
       verbs (or verbform variations).  We will ship four additional such
       files, however, when we send you the registered copy.  Finally,
       the 300 or so verbs provided in the SPANISH.VRB file (accessible
       via the 'V' command) is provided solely to illustrate the capability
       of the full-fledged system.  The complete 5,000+ verb file is far
       too large (200,000 bytes) to include in a downloadable version.

==============================================================================
V.  BENEFITS OF REGISTRATION

    The registration fee is only $39.95 plus $5.00 S&H (United States).  You
must add 8.25% Sales Tax if you live in Texas.  The order form is contained
in the file REGISTER.DOC.  Payment methods and shipping/handling information
for international purchasers are described as well.

     When you have registered you will be licensed for the unlimited use of
a single copy of LinguaPro/SPANISH.  You will also receive the following:

    1.  The latest version of LinguaPro/SPANISH.

    2.  Five Vocabulary Files comprising over 18,000 Spanish words:
        LEVEL1.SPA, LEVEL2.SPA, LEVEL3.SPA, LEVEL4.SPA, and LEVEL5.SPA.
        These vocabulary files are graded so that the most common 4,000
        words appear in LEVEL1, and the least common words appear in
        LEVEL5.

    3.  Four additional VERB Phrase Files containing 304 more fully
        conjugated verbs and verb phrases:  TVERB2.SPA, TVERB3.SPA,
        TVERB4.SPA and TVERB5.SPA.  LinguaPro/SPANISH will utilize these
        files to produce a virtually unlimited number of unique sentences
        that will exhibit all important aspects of the key verbs:  all
        major shades of meaning; the conjugation pattern for all tenses
        and persons; the use of the verbs in actual complete sentences;
        and additional vocabulary that naturally goes with the verb.

    4.  Seven VERB Files containing 532 high-frequency Spanish verbs, as
        well as rarer forms, that cover all conjugation patterns.  These
        files do not cause complete sentences to be generated.

    5.  An expanded SPANISH.VRB file for the LinguaPro VERB Reference
        Facility that provides the definitions and complete conjugation
        patterns (for rapid on-line lookup) for over 5,000 Spanish verbs.

    6.  A special vocabulary file called VRBINDEX.SPA which is designed
        to be used in conjunction with the Verb Reference Facility.  It
        contains the definitions for the 5,000 verbs supported by the
        VRF and allows the user to master the definitions of these verbs
        and consult the VRF for the relevant conjugation patterns when
        necessary.

    7.  Future notifications of upgrades, as well as announcements of
        LinguaPro versions for French, German, and Italian.  Upgrades
        will be available to registered owners of LinguaPro/SPANISH at
        a considerably reduced price.

    In addition, registered users of LinguaPro/SPANISH will receive free
support for a period of 3 months following the date of registration.  This
support is available by mail, or via Compuserve Email.  Please see the
UGUIDE.DOC for our phone number, FAX number, and Compuserve ID.

    The registered copy will be shipped within 48 hours of our receipt of your
order.  If for any reason the delivery will be delayed, you will be notified
immediately.  If delivery cannot be made within a reasonable time, your check
or money order will be returned, or credit card orders will be credited back
to your account.

==============================================================================
                   *** FEATURES UNDER DEVELOPMENT ***

     The following features are currently under development for Release
2.3 and 2.4 of LinguaPro/SPANISH.  Registered users of release 2.20 will be
notified by mail of the upcoming release and will be able to obtain, and
register, their upgrade at a greatly reduced price:

    1.  Major enhancements to the FLASHCARD Facility for VERBS
        (the SENTENCE Generator):

        a)  Expanded set of subject noun and pronoun forms.
        b)  Support for Interrogative sentences.
        c)  Expanded treatment of Subjunctive forms.
        d)  Enhancement of the presentation of Conditional forms.
        e)  Additional semantic filters to improve the clarity and
            reasonableness of all synthesized sentences.

    2.  Expansion of the Dictionary Facility to permit the user to
        construct and access an unlimited number of "external",
        specialized vocabulary files.  For example:

            Medical terms
            Legal terms
            Business terms
            Petrochemical terms
            Geological terms
            Golden Age Literature (obsolete and rare words)
            Slang and Vulgarisms
            Regional Vocabulary (e.g., Mexico, Cuba, Chicano, ...)
            ...

        These vocabulary files will be available to the Dictionary
        Facility so that a given word can be "searched" in a particular
        external file, or else ALL assigned external files can be
        searched.

        These vocabulary files, of course, may also be directly loaded
        into LinguaPro/SPANISH so that they are accessible to the
        FLASHCARD facility.

    3.  Additional Vocabulary and VERB Files, e.g.,

            a.  IDIOMS  -- idiomatic expressions
            b.  Verb Phrase Files
            c.  Specialized vocabulary files

    4.  Expansion of the Verb Reference System (VRF) to provide multi-
        screen expanded definitions of verbforms.  This will be divided
        into Transitive and Intransitive usages of the verb, and each
        of these sections will be subdivided based on:

            a.  Field of use (Legal, Industry, Business, Nautical, ...)
            b.  Colloquial/Familiar meanings
            c.  Vulgar/Slang meanings

        and all common phrases illustrating specialized usages of the
        verb form will be included in the appropriate sections.

    5.  An ANNOTATION Facility will be added to LinguaPro that should be
        of special interest to scholars.  The Annotation Facility will
        consist of a data base containing the following:

            a.  Author List -- Names of Spanish authors
            b.  Titles List -- Titles and publication dates of literary
                  works belonging to authors in the Author List
            c.  Sample sentences keyed to a primary word (noun, verb, etc.)
                  and entered by the user.
            d.  User notes.

        The Annotation Facility will allow a user to register an author
        and title when beginning to read (or translate) a work.  Sample
        sentences extracted from the work can be added by the user.  These
        sentences will be keyed both by the author/title and by the primary
        word.  Page numbers can be added as well to pinpoint the occurrence
        of the sentence in the text.

        General notes and comments can be added in a similar manner, again,
        keyed to an author/title/page.

        A report program will be provided that will permit hardcopy listings
        of sample sentences by:

            a.  Author
            b.  Author and Title
            c.  Key word

        NOTE:  The Annotation Facility will be just as useful to persons

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
=====================

video will work, but EGA or VGA is recommended so that accent marks on
Spanish words are more discernible.  The Shareware version of the program
requires 460K of available RAM and 700K available disk space.  The
registered version requires 510K of available RAM and 2 meg. available disk
space.  LinguaPro/SPANISH has been tested with DOS 3.3, 4.01, 5.0, and 6.0,
and should work with earlier versions as well.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
====================
(SHORT)
A multi-faceted program for serious students of Spanish.  Offers an 18,000
word user-modifiable online DICTIONARY, a sophisticated FLASHCARD system
for the mastery of the GRADED 18,000 word supplied vocabulary, and a UNIQUE
VERB flashcard system that teaches Spanish verbs in all tenses and persons
using millions of COMPLETE SENTENCES.  LinguaPro may also be used for the
flashcarding of ENGLISH vocabulary and general QUESTION/ANSWER information.

(MEDIUM)
A multi-faceted program for the more serious students of Spanish.  LinguaPro is
a PROFESSIONAL quality program at a Shareware-level price.  It provides an
extremely fast 18,000 word online DICTIONARY system for word and definition
lookup.  The program provides a GRADED (5 level) vocabulary set and easy-to-
use machinery that lets the user add more words, or create entirely new
vocabulary sets.  LinguaPro provides a sophisticated FLASHCARD system that
will teach the user THOUSANDS (some or all of the 18,000 word starter
dictionary) of Spanish words with a paced introduction of new words, and
continual review of words that are giving trouble.  LinguaPro teaches Spanish
VERB CONJUGATIONS using a UNIQUE approach.  Users may select verbs, desired
tenses, moods, and persons.  LinguaPro utilizes its standard flashcard approach,
but verb forms are presented to the user in MILLIONS of complete, and different,
SENTENCES.  A Verb Reference System provides an authoritative reference for
Spanish verbs including complete definition and conjugation information.
LinguaPro may additionally be used for the construction of ENGLISH vocabulary
sets, or data files containing general QUESTION/ANSWER-type information (e.g.,
historical dates, legal terminology, states and capitols, etc.).  All such files
can be drilled using the LinguaPro flashcard system.

(long)
A multi-faceted program for the more serious students of Spanish.  LinguaPro is
a professional quality program at a Shareware-level price.  It is really a
language learning system that is evolving to satisfy two separate classes of
users.  On the one hand, it is ideal for beginners because its flashcard system
permits the rapid mastery of a large amount of vocabulary, while the verb
conjugation system cuts through the complexity of Spanish verbs by drilling
selected verbs, tenses, and persons utilizing a limitless number of complete,
and interesting, sentences.  At the other extreme, the online dictionary and
verb reference system will be greatly useful to Spanish scholars and trans-
lators that require rapid access to the definitions of Spanish words, the
ability to add their own words (especially words that are, e.g., obsolete,
poetic, provincial, vulgar, regional, etc.), and accurate conjugation infor-
mation for Spanish verbs.  The registered version of LinguaPro/SPANISH
provides an initial set of dictionary files presenting 18,000 high-frequency
Spanish words in 5 graded levels.  The Verb Reference database file contains
the definitions and complete conjugation patterns for over 5,000 Spanish verbs.

The LinguaPro/SPANISH "system" provides 4 major capabilities:  a Flashcard
facility for vocabulary items, a Flashcard facility for verbforms (utilizing
complete, synthesized sentences), an online Dictionary that can be used
for reference or for the construction of vocabulary sets to be "flashcarded",
and a Verb Reference System that provides complete definitions and conjugation
patterms for over 5,000 Spanish verbs.

The Flashcard system for vocabulary provides a "clustering" feature that
guarantees that the user is always given an optimal mix of new words and
previously-missed words.  Users may drill from Spanish to English or English
to Spanish.  Words that have been mastered may be "killed" (removed from the
active file and moved into a special archival file).  This flashcarding
approach is ideal for rapidly learning thousands of words.

The Flashcard system for verbforms works in a similar manner.  The user
selects the tenses and moods (15 in all), a desired set of verbs, the
persons (I, you, we, they, etc.), and may even specify that the user is a
female, or that optional subject pronouns should be suppressed.  The
"flashcarding" process SYNTHESIZES an unlimited number of complete,
grammatical, sentences utilizing the verbs, tenses, etc., specified by the
user.  An optional autoconjugation feature will continually show the complete
conjugation for the verb in the selected tense at the completion of the
entry.

The Online Dictionary supports up to 6 loaded vocabulary files and provides
a total capacity of up to 18,000 words (depending on the amount of memory
available) in "working" files, and an unlimited number in an external
file (the "killed" file containing words already mastered).  Words may be
looked up from Spanish to English or English to Spanish.  On a 486, a lookup
may take less that .05 seconds (to go through 18,000 words).  Users may
move words from one vocabulary file to another, modify words and/or definitions,
or add new words.  All vocabulary files constructed via the Online Dictionary
are available to the Flashcard system.  The Dictionary is especially adaptable
to the needs of translators or avid readers of Spanish literature.

The Verb Reference Facility is integrated both with the Flashcard system
and the Online Dictionary.  It provides almost instantaneous access to the
complete definition and conjugation patterns of over 5,000 verbs (in the
registered version).  This is being expanded to include over 15,000 verb
conjugations and definitions in a future release.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
