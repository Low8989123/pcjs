                     (C) 1993  Adam Pedersen
                 Published by Software Creations



The next generation of puzzle games is here with the addition of
hazardous chemicals, devastator bombs, and missiles!  Maneuver your
pieces to form 'squarez' and stay ahead of your opponent, or race
the clock to practice your skills.  There are three levels of play
to suit your taste:  the plain basic tiles, the normal amount of
special tiles, and the chaotic extreme mode with tons of exploding
tiles and surprises.



                    *************************
                    * HOW TO MASTER SQUAREZ *
                    *************************


     The best way to master Squarez is with practice.  Once you
start playing it's hard to stop, so keep an eye on the time!  The
basic object is to create 3 by 3 squarez out of the pieces you are
given.  In Basic mode, the game is in its simplest form, and it may
be good for practice with figuring out how the pieces go together. 
The faster you place your piece, the more points you get, so speed
does pay off, especially in two player games.  The more pieces you
go through, the better your chances of getting pieces to damage
your opponent.  Another way to get higher scores is to use the
score multiplier.  Every time you complete a square that is 4 by 4
or bigger, your score multiplier will increase.  You can also
increase the score multiplier by activating a tile containing a
plus.  It will go down to zero if you get a minus tile, so be
careful.  The score multiplier gradually resets to 1X with time so
keep working to keep it high!

     The exciting part about Squarez is the pieces you'll find in
the Normal and Extreme modes of play.  Sporadically, bombs, spikes,
acid, missiles, sticky splooge and other bizarre items will appear
in one of your tiles.  Form a square containing one of these
special tiles to activate it.  Some tiles like bombs and missiles
will activate certain other special tiles.  You'll have to
experiment to find out what affects certain tiles.  See page 3 for
descriptions of the special magic tiles.

     Squarez has some beautiful background patterns during
gameplay, but some people don't agree.  If you don't like the
backgrounds, you can start Squarez with the command-line "Squarez
/B".

Score Tile          Description
----- ----          -----------
  1  NORMAL         The basic tile.
  1  CRACKED        These tiles are activated by any nearby
                    occurrence, like an explosion or the forming
                    of a square.
  3  SHIELD         These must be 'Squared' three times to be
                    destroyed, or they can be exploded.
  0  STEEL PYRAMID  This can't be used to create squarez, and it
                    can only be destroyed by an explosion.
0/25 ARROWS         Arrows move the center dividing bar to the
                    left or right.  If the bar moves away from
                    your side, you get the points.
  5  SPLOOGE        Activating this will release a puddle of
                    splooge.
 10  ACID           Activating this will release a pool of acid.
 20  DUMB MISSILE   When activated, this shoots across the screen
                    destroying everything in its path.
 50  DEVASTATOR BOMB When this is activated, it destroys everything
                     in a nearby radius.
  0  SPIKES         These expand to form a large obstruction that
                    can only be destroyed by an explosion.  Try to
                    destroy these with a bomb or missile BEFORE
                    they are released.
100  RELEASER       Releases all enclosed tiles, making them touch
                    activated.
200  ACTIVATOR      Activates every special tile on the screen.
0/50 NOSQUAREZ      When this is activated, the dissolving of
                    squarez stops for many seconds.  Any squarez
                    created in this time will remain.  When time
                    runs out they dissolve.  Points are awarded
                    only if this is activated on the other player.
50   PUNISHMENT BOX This gives a little present to the player
                    whose color it contains.  A ring of shields
                    becomes that players next piece.  Points are
                    awarded to the other player.
---  EMPTY TILE     Move this tile over another tile already on
                    the playfield, and you'll pick it up.
???  QUESTION MARK  When this is activated it could turn into
                    anything.
---  (+/-)          Increases or decreases the score multiplier.

* OTHER STUFF *

     SPLOOGE        Sticky gooey purple stuff.  Move a piece on
                    top of this and the tiles that are touching it
                    will stick to it.
     ACID           Highly corrosive green ick.  Any tiles that
                    touch this stuff are consumed instantly.

      SYSOPS - Read VENDOR.DOC for complete descriptions for your BBS.

    If you are interested in getting quality Shareware for your BBS system,
then become part of the Shareware Distribution Network at Software Creations.
Thousands of Sysops have joined Software Creations and more are joining every
day in setting up file sections on their BBS systems for our Shareware.  We
make all these files FREE downloads, with unlimited time to download on the
Software Creations BBS.

    Once you have a Software Creations file section set up on your BBS, and
have our Shareware in it, just call the HOME BOARD and fill out the script in
door 4 with all the information about your BBS.  Just type OPEN 4 at the main
menu.  If you are already a Shareware release point for one of our other HOME
BOARD companies then just leave me a message to get you added to our list.

    We will carry your name and numbers in our bulletin, letting people know
where they can get our products in your area.  We also hope that getting high
quality software directly from the source brings more callers to your BBS, and
more paying members.

    If downloading is too much of a problem, whole shareware file sections can
be ordered on Software Creations for only the cost of duplication and mailing.

    I wish you luck with your BBS, and hope our shareware brings you lots of 
quality BBS members.

			    * TROUBLESHOOTING *
			    *******************
PROBLEM:
     Not Enough Memory
SOLUTION:
     Try removing TSR's (such as mouse drivers) from your config.sys and
     autoexec.bat files.
     If	you have DOS version 5 or above, include the line:

	  dos=high

     in your config.sys file after "himem.sys" or another memory manager has
     been loaded.


PROBLEM:
     Movement is erratic, or there is no movement
SOLUTION:
     Press [J] to adjust your joystick(s).
     Most systems should work with automatic joystick detection.  If movement
     is still erratic, try disabling joysticks in the command-line with
     "Squarez /J".
     You can also disable the mouse ("Squarez /M").


PROBLEM:
     Sound isn't working correctly, or the game locks up
SOLUTION:
     Use the command-line sound card override.
     Load Jetpack with one of the command-line options:

	  Squarez /S0	 -    No Sound
	  Squarez /S1	 -    PC Speaker
	  Squarez /S2	 -    Adlib or Sound Blaster compatible


Squarez should have come without the configuration file "SQUAREZ.CFG"  If you
can't solve the problems you are having, try erasing this file.  Squarez will
create a new config file based on your system.
