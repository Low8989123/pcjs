      produce an interesting fact containing a large number with an
      accompanying picture. There are options to say, write, and
      form the number. The registered version contains 175 facts.
  Enter any Number - The user may enter (calculator style) any number
      up to 13 digits. There are options to say, write, and form the
      number.
  Enter the Written Number - The computer will "think" of a large
      number and display that number in words, for example - nine
      million two hundred fifty one thousand three hundred seventy
      two. The user must enter the digits to make that number.
  Count By - TNUM can also help your child learn to count (by
      increments of 1 to 10). If the user selects 2 the program will
      begin counting by 2's - 2, 4, 6, 8, etc. until you decide to stop.
