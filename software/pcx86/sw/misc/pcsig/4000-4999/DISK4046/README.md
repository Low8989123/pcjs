                           I. CONCEPT

MENUBAR may be utilized with Microsoft Windows to customize the
user environment by addition of menubars (or toolbars) that specify
a user selected icon/bitmap or text and associate this with
executable programs. MENUBAR provides a capability to define
toolbar controls that augment existing execution methods or create
a complete desktop environment based on the users own preferences. 




              II. Installation/Execution of MENUBAR

This section describes the various options relative to installing
MENUBAR as well the command line functions. Installation (Section
1.0) describes the initial setup process to configure MENUBAR
either as a user program or a program manager replacement shell.
The command line options(Section 2.0) describe the process for
creation, execution and editing of menubars. Detailed dialogue
options (Section 3.0) for creation and editing of menubars are
described, with the additional sections describing font selection
options (Section 4.0) and mouse/key usage (Section 5.0).

1.0 Installation Options

MENUBAR may be installed as a normal program or as a replacement
for program manager.

1.1 Normal Installation

Normal installation is accomplished by dearchiving the disk
contents into a DOS directory. The Directory should be added to
the default path if execution is to be done from other directories.
The directory will contain the MENUBAR program (menubar.exe),
sample menubars (*.mbr), and sample icons (*.ico) as well as
documentation files.

1.2 Program Manager Shell Replacement Option.

MENUBAR may be utilized as a replacement for the Windows Program
Manager if desired. This requires editing of the Windows
"system.ini" file. Be sure to create a backup of this file before
changing any portions of it. Edit it to replace the "shell="
parameter within the [boot] section. The recommend changes are:

	1)	Change the existing "shell=" line to "shellold="
	2)	Add a line of the form "shell=menubar.exe" (Note: Specify
          the full filename of the MENUBAR directory if the
          directory is not in the default path)
This will initiate Windows execution using the MENUBAR program as
shell and a default menubar-MAIN.MBR. A default is provided, which
may be edited or replaced. Removing MENUBAR as the Windows shell
can be accomplished by changing the shellold= and the shell= lines.

CAUTION: Terminating the shell menubar (main.mbr) will terminate
all programs immediately. Insure that updates have been saved prior
to termination.

1.3 Additional Program Shell Options

When using MENUBAR as a program shell, the user may specify other
actions including starting multiple menubars, running or loading
programs. These options are accomplished by specifications in the
menubar initialization file. This file (menubar.ini) must be
located in the Windows directory. It can be created with any edit
program that stores standard text. The file must contain [menubar]
as the first line and any of the following entries as the remaining
lines.

1.3.1 File

The "FILE=xxx" line allows for changing the default menubar file
(main.mbr). "xxx" is the new menubar file.

1.3.2 Menubars

The "MENUBARS=xxx" line specifies additional menubars to
initialize. Multiple menubar file names may be specified separated
by a semicolon(;). For example, the line:

			"menubars=appl1;appl2;time" 

will execute the specified menubars.

1.3.3 Run

The "RUN=xxx" line specifies DOS programs to be executed. Multiple
program file names (and parameters) may be specified separated by
a semicolon(;). For example,the line:

"run=notepad.exe read.me;clock.exe"

will execute the specified programs, displaying the clock and
read.me files.

1.3.4 Load

The "LOAD=xxx" line specifies MSDOS programs to be executed and
displayed in a minimized state. Multiple program file names (and
parameters) may be specified separated by a semicolon(;). For
example, the line:
 "load=winfile" 
will execute the Windows file manager displayed as an icon.

2.0 MENUBAR Command line options

This section discusses the options available by specification of
command line parameters upon execution of the MENUBAR program. 

2.1 Execution of an existing menubar definition.

The user may execute an existing menubar definition by providing
the definition name as the first parameter of the command line.
Note that each menubar definition is stored as a separate DOS file.
The command to execute an existing definition is "MENUBAR xxx",
where "xxx" is the menubar definition name. "xxx" must conform to
the filename portion of the DOS naming conventions. 
If the user does not specify the DOS filename extension, MENUBAR
utilizes the extension ".mbr". 

2.2 Creating a new menu definition.

The user creates a new definition file by entering the MENUBAR
command without any parameters. A Message Box will confirm that
this was the intended action, and a data dialogue will be provided
for entry of the definition name. The detailed definition dialogues
(see Section 3.0) are displayed for specification of the
characteristics.

2.3. Editing an existing definition

The user may edit an existing definition by specifying the "-E"
parameter followed by the definition name. For example,
"MENUBAR -E  menu1" would edit the menu1.mbr file in the current
directory. The detailed dialogues (see section 3.0) are displayed
to allow for changing the current characteristics.

3.0 Detailed dialogues

This Section describes dialogues for definition of the menubar. The
Menubar dialogue provides for specification of all parameters and
selection of individual command sets. The Command Set dialogue
allows for specification of the bitmap/icon file, the command,
associated parameters, and text. The File Open dialogue allows for
selection of a file via browsing.

3.1 Menubar dialogue

4.0 Font Options

MENUBAR attempts to select a small font that is readable at
multiple screen resolutions. The user may override this default
font to generate unique settings for his monitor and usage. The
parameters "fontheight", "fontwidth" and "fontfacename" (font
height, width and facename) are provided to change the font
characteristics. To determine the available font options on your
system, run the Windows Control program and select fonts. To change
the default values, create (or update) the MENUBAR initialization
file (menubar.ini) in the default Windows directory. The first line
of the file should be [menubar] with the remaining lines of the
form "xxx=dddd", where "xxx" is one of the parameters and "yyy" is
the value. 

5.0 Mouse/key Usage

If a title bar exists, the mouse may be utilized to execute system
menu commands, minimize or maximize the menubar window, temporarily
reposition the menubar, or close the menubar.

Regardless of whether a title bar is present, the following mouse
actions are supported. When the mouse (left button) is clicked one
of the following occurs:

	1)	Clicking a command box either selects the command or
          executes the command depending on whether the double-
          click parameter is set for the menubar. 

	2)	Clicking the menubar border (not title bar) or clicking
          with the SHIFT key depressed closes the menubar. 

	3)	Clicking with the CONTROL key depressed minimizes the
          menubar. If the bar is minimized, a double click restores
          it to the original position.

Dragging with the mouse accomplishes two functions:

	1)	Dragging with the shift key depressed from within the
          menubar window will position the menubar to the release
          point. The user will be prompted to save the file upon
          MENUBAR termination. Note that menubars with title bars
          may be moved by dragging the title bar, however the save
          prompt will not be displayed.

	2) 	Execution of a program can be accomplished by dragging
          a file from the file manager and dropping it on a command
          box. The file is a parameter to the program.

If the number of command sets exceeds the number of display boxes,
a scroll bar is displayed that utilizes the mouse to position the
display.

Alternately, the keyboard may be utilized for selection and
execution of commands. The ARROW keys are utilized to select
individual command sets. Entry of a SPACEBAR or ENTER key executes
the selected command. The ESCAPE key terminates MENUBAR.
