The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

## HEXXAGON.DOC

```
                              HEXXAGON

    Welcome to deep space.  What better place than the pristine
reaches of the galaxy to escape and practice the ancient alchemy of
pure logic, changing the very state of matter?  HEXXAGON deigns to
take you there...



                        SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

    To play HEXXAGON, you need:
        o A system with a 286 or better processor.
        o A VGA compatible display card.
        o At least 640k RAM, with about 475k free from the DOS prompt.

    We recommend:
        o A Microsoft(TM) compatible mouse.
        o A SoundBlaster(TM) or compatible sound card.


                              THE GAME

    HEXXAGON is an animated game of strategy, loaded with options,
in which it is your task to take over as much of the vorld, ah,
board as your opponent will allow, whether your opponent is another
mere human or our resident noid of unflinching logic, the dauntless
CRANIAC.

    CRANIAC, represented by a single light bulb, will happily defeat
you in any one of three modes.  Choose your poison, and don't be
taken in by the apparent simplicity of CRANIAC'S lightbulb facade,
his glasses or his bow tie; he'll lure you in and hit you with the
"kill"owatts of brain power that reside in that little icon.

    Cower not -- one of your available options is to actually "see"
how the little twerp thinks.  On the two higher detail levels,
CRANIAC displays his moves before he makes them, showing his options
with flashing neon green and yellow paths.

    On the low detail level, he will counter immediately after you
move -- instantaneous annihilation.  Again, don't be alarmed, the
three modes, "CRANIAC EASY, MEDIUM & HARD," allow you to choose the
level of difficulty you take on.

    Revenge is sweet; you'll have every opportunity for payback,
because when you enter the space next to any of your opponent's
pieces, they are transformed into yours.  From solid to liquid or
liquid to solid, transforming a solid red jewel into a liquid chrome
drop requires heat, and heat you'll get in the form of lightning.
When a liquid is alchemized into a solid, you'll see a frozen stream
of ice particles.



                               MOVES

    There are two ways to complete your mission in HEXXAGON.  You
may move one space, represented by a green neon outline, and your
game piece is duplicated into that space.  When you move two spaces,
represented by a yellow neon glow, your gamepiece "jumps" to that
space, but is not duplicated.

    First click the red or blue arrow that appears each time it is
your turn on the piece you want to move.  HEXXAGON will show you all
of your potential moves for that piece, or any of your pieces you
click on.  The only possible moves are to free spaces, one or two
spaces from your current position.  You may then move the arrow to
one of the allowable spaces indicated by the green and yellow neon
glows and click again to move there.  Any time you move next to one
of your opponent's pieces, enjoy the fireworks!

    If you decide that a move you've made isn't quite what you want,
press the 'U' key to undo the move.  If you've used undo to back up,
and haven't made any moves yet, you can press the 'R' key to redo
the moves.



                           STRATEGY HINTS

    HEXXAGON has been called a "game of edges," in which an overall
strategy might be to try and fill all the edges of the board, while
keeping a solid front flank.  Remember that you will have to venture
into the middle, as your goal here is to control as much of the
field as you can.

    You never want to leave a hole in territory you already dominate
-- CRANIAC will leap at the chance to gain lost ground.  He's
relentless!

    Never jump with a piece if you can replicate to fill the same
opening.  Why give HIM extra chances?

    Beware of false gains -- often there are moves that look more
advantageous than they really are.  It's important to weigh the
number of pieces you'll gain on a given move against the number
CRANIAC can gain by countering.



                              THE MENU

    As in every challenge, victory is all in the way you control the
game.  HEXXAGON offers several different options to give you all the
control you need.

    To get to the menu, press the "ENTER" key from the demonstration
cycle, or (if you're in a game), press the "ESCAPE" key or click on
the "MENU" button.

    In the "Player 1" and "Player 2" boxes you are able to select
whether you are the red jewel piece or the liquid chrome by clicking
on the button labeled "HUMAN." If you are playing a friend, instead
of the terrible CRANIAC, you select "HUMAN" in both boxes and simply
pick who will be what.

    You may play CRANIAC at any of three levels, "CRANIAC EASY,"
"CRANIAC MEDIUM" or "CRANIAC HARD." Logically, each level is
increasingly more challenging.  When you play the EASY level,
CRANIAC is indicated by a lightbulb alone.  On MEDIUM, he dons a
pair of intellectual spectacles, and on HARD, he adds his
professorial bow tie.

    Understandably, as the diffulty level rises, so does the time it
takes CRANIAC to determine his move.

    In the "SOUND" box, you can set the game's sound output to
"OFF," "PC SPEAKER," or (if you have a SoundBlaster or compatible)
you can hear the full digital sound effects by selecting
"SOUNDBLASTER."

    You can also control the detail level of your match.  On "HIGH,"
you'll get the full HEXXAGON treatment, complete with awesome
animation.  On "MEDIUM," the stars disappear from the screen,
CRANIAC moves more quickly, and a few animations don't show up.  On
"LOW," CRANIAC moves in turbo mode and there is no animation during
the game at all.  You will not see the pieces being transformed, it
will happen instantaneously.

    If you are not currently playing a game, you will also find
"START GAME," "RETURN TO DEMO," "CONFIGURE BOARD," and "QUIT TO DOS"
buttons on the screen.

    If you are in the midst of a game, your options are "STOP GAME,"
"RETURN TO GAME," and "QUIT TO DOS."

    "START GAME" begins your match with CRANIAC; "RETURN TO DEMO"
allows you to view sample animated games and the title and credit
pages; "QUIT TO DOS" takes you out of HEXXAGON and back into DOS;
"RETURN TO GAME" allows you to go back to a game in progress and
"STOP GAME" lets you end a current match, but will not take you out
of the program completely.

    The "CONFIGURE BOARD" option allows you to experiment with
varying game board set-ups.  See the next section for a description.

    Power-user note: Most menu items have a single red letter.
Pressing that letter on your keyboard has the same effect as
clicking on the item.



                        BOARD CONFIGURATION

    Selecting the "CONFIGURE BOARD" button from within the menu will
take you to the game board you will be playing on, with a few menu
items added to the screen to assist you in setting the board up.

    In the upper-left hand corner are icons representing a hexagon,
a red jewel, and a blue chrome drop.  By clicking on these icons,
you can choose how you're going to modify the board.

    If you have the hexagon selected, the cursor will be the
standard pointing hand.  By clicking on the hexagons on the board,
you can open a new hole on the board, or fill existing holes in.

    When you select the jewel or chrome drop, the cursor will change
to a red or blue arrow, respectively.  Clicking on the hexagons on
the board will place or remove a jewel or chrome drop.

    As a shortcut, you may use the right mouse button to cycle
through the cursors.

    In the upper-right hand corner there are two items.  The first
is a bar with the numbers '1' through '5' on it.  The second is a
button labeled "RESTORE."

    By clicking on the individual numbers, you can select one of the
five boards available for customization.  Each of the boards can be
completely different - different family members can each have their
own custom board configuration, or you can keep a group of your own
favorites.  The bar indicates which board is currently active.

    If you'd like to reset the current board to the way it was when
you got HEXXAGON, click on the "RESTORE" button, or press the
"ENTER" key.  Clicking on the "RESTORE" button again before you make
any changes to the board brings the board back to the way it was
before you clicked on "RESTORE" the first time.

    To return to the menu, click on the "MENU" button in the
lower-left hand corner, or hit the "ESCAPE" key.  When you are ready
to play using your new setup, just click on "START GAME." Your
custom boards will be saved when you choose "QUIT TO DOS."



                    THE END -- AND THE BEGINNING

    Well, that's it - go have some fun!

TECH-WEENIE STUFF

    Seeing as I (Jason) am usually curious as to how other
programmers go about their projects, I figured that I'd mention some
details related to the production of HEXXAGON.  If you're not a
programmer familiar with how games are written, most (or all) of
this won't make any sense.  This isn't an exhaustive treatise, but
it should give you some idea...

    Tools used: Electronic Arts' Deluxe Paint II Enhanced (DP IIe)
and Deluxe Paint Animator (DA), Borland C++ v3.1 (BC), and some of
my own custom tools (DIFR, DIFRC, VGRAB, and SSED).

    DA was used to do the title page animation, the credits page
animation, the win/lose animations, and the sample move/takeover
animations.  DIFR and DIFRC (a delta-frame generator and compiler,
respectively) were used for all of the fixed location animations
(the title & credits pages, win/lose, etc.).

    DP IIe was used for the still art, and for stripping the cels
from the sample move/takeover animations.

    DP IIe & DA are powerful tools - I recommend them.  They're not
the simplest programs to use, but they more than make up for that in
the power they provide.

    VGRAB (a scripted grabber) was used to pull the chunks of
graphics from the files generated in DP IIe, and compile them where
appropriate.  VGRAB was also used to pull together (and compress)
all of the other files (PC & digital sound, for example) used in the
project.

    VGRAB and DIFRC use (different) optimizing compilers.  VGRAB
uses value ordering to minimize register loads, and string stores to
decrease object size and draw time.  There are some other
optimizations, but those are the more useful ones.  DIFRC uses
string stores for single color runs in the delta data, and uses a
vaguely LZSS-like method to avoid repeatedly storing similar data
into the data segment for a particular frame.  As with VGRAB, there
are other optimizations made, but those seem to be the most useful.

    I wrote the custom utilities mentioned, the core libraries for
the game, the interface stuff, and some higher level structural
code.  Abe wrote the brain, and handled the bulk of the grab
scripting, animation definition, and sound synchronization.

    The game and libraries are written in a mix of C++ (not
object-oriented, just "better C") and assembly.  Most of the
assembly is in the Drawing Manager, but there are bits and pieces
elsewhere, as appropriate.

    Well, enough rambling from me - enjoy the game!

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Outside the U.S.A.: Call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer near

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.


To Order, in the U.S.A.: Call 800-245-6717 and ask Customer Service.

Outside the U.S.A.: Call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer near
you.
