INTRODUCTION
------------
Once upon a time of castles, knights, and dragons, there was a great
adventure. A tricky dragon named Scorch challenged everyone in the
land to a contest known as "Scorch's Castle Match." No one could
beat Scorch.

One day a small, but brave knight came forward. "It's Sir Addalot,"
the people whispered. And so began the greatest challenge of all time.
To this day, the people still tell exciting stories about 
"Sir AddaLot's Math Adventure."

Are you ready to become a knight? If you are brave, if you practice,
and if you keep trying, you can beat Scorch and become the hero of
the land.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
Sir AddaLots "Mini" Math Adventure requires: 
  o 386SX or faster PC compatible
  o 640Kb of memory, with 520Kb free
  o 1.0 Mb of free disk space 
  o VGA graphics
  o Supports mouse, joystick, or keyboard


INSTALLATION
------------
To play Sir AddaLot's "Mini" Math Adventure, you must first install 
the program onto your hard disk or to a high density floppy disk with 
more that 1.0 Mb of available space.  The description below assumes you 
are installing to the C drive.  To run the install type:
       Install C: <enter>
Then follow the on screen instructions.  


STARTING THE GAME
-----------------
After you have installed Sir Addalot's "Mini" Math Adventure, simply change
to the directory (cd \ AddaLotM) and type: 
       AddaLot <enter>

Attention: Make sure you select an appropriate speed and difficulty
level so your child is properly challenged. 


KEYBOARD PLAYERS
----------------
The underlined letters and numbers on each button indicate the 
keyboard keys that can be used to select that button. If you do not
have a mouse, it is recommended that you turn off the mouse in the
options menu so the mouse cursor is not in the way.


SPEED/DIFFICULTY
----------------
Before beginning your adventure, it is important to select the speed
and difficulty to meet your child's needs. After starting the game,
you will find yourself in the control room. Here you can select
equation difficulties ranging from "Pretty Easy" to "Mind Blowing." 
You also select the speed setting which controls how fast the game 
moves.

By controlling speed and difficulty, you can customize the game.
You can make it more fun, or more educational. You can challenge
quiet, timid children as well as fearless ones.


THE LEVEL SCREENS
-----------------
Two levels are provided in the mini-adventure version. The practice
field is also included. To change levels or enter the practice field,
press on the "wooden" signs at the bottom corners of the screen.

The practice field is a good place start since your child can get
used to the game without worrying about Scorch. You wouldn't want
to face Scorch without practicing...would you?


THE PRACTICE FIELD
------------------
Here is a good place to practice moving Sir Addalot and matching 
equations. You move by pressing on a square with the mouse or by
using the arrow keys. Select a square by pressing on the square 
again with the mouse or by pressing the space bar. Now move to 
the matching equation and select it again.

When using a mouse, Sir AddaLot will take the shortest path to the
square you selected. Sometimes it is better to move Sir AddaLot in
small steps to make sure that a fireball doesn't get in your path.
If you use a mouse, check to make sure it is clean and moves
smoothly.

For children new to a mouse, here are some suggestions: 1) Teach your
child how to pick up the mouse and place it in the center of the mouse
pad when it comes to the edge, 2) Watch the child's wrist to insure
they are not trying to point or twist the mouse. Keep the mouse pointed
ahead. Teach your child to move their arm, not their wrist.


PLAYING THE GAME
----------------
After practicing, you are ready to face Scorch. After entering the 
first castle, start matching equations as fast as you can. Watch out
for Scorch. Now and then Scorch will spew out a wandering fireball.
Scorch makes more fireballs as you advance to higher screen levels
or higher speed levels.

Beware of the tricky fireballs that Scorch uses if you make a
mistake. These fireballs will chase you. Don't give up. You can
run faster. Like other fireballs, they will eventually burn out.

If you get caught by a fireball, do't worry. Sir AddaLot always 
carries a shield for protection. The fireball will destroy the
shield, but Sir AddaLot will be saved. Each castle has a place
to hold 2 extra shields. Sir AddaLot will get another shield if
any are left. If no shields are left, Sir AddaLot will leave the
castle and must start again.


THE OPTIONS MENU
----------------
The options menu controls the speed, sound, high score, moat
display, and mouse control. You can get to the options screen
by pressing "Options" on any level screen.

If you are not using a mouse, or prefer to use the arrow keys,
select "mouse OFF" to hide the mouse cursor.

High scores are saved for each level. You can look at or erase
the high scores.

You can turn all sounds ON or OFF.

Finally, you can empty all plants and fish from the moat.

Note: The difficulty level can only be changed at start up of the
game when you are in the Control Room.


THE MOAT
--------
Before Scorch came to town, the moat was a busy place. Plants, fish
and other sea creatures lived in the moat. You can restore the moat
and make it look just as you want.

After completing each level, you can choose an item to place in the 
moat. If the item is a plant, place it carefully where you want it.
If you are placing a fish, you can place it anywhere because it will
start swimming after you let it go.

Each level has different objects. Remember, you can view the moat at 
any time from any Level Screen. You can "empty" the moat from the 
"Options" screen.


QUESTIONS/PROBLEMS
------------------
o Make sure your PC compatible meets the system requirements listed
  above.

o The game may be jumpy or slow on a 286. A 386SX or better is
  required.

o No mouse? Sir AddaLot is fun with or without a mouse. Each button
  has an Underlined character that corresponds to a keyboard button.
  Some buttons have 2 characters such as "F1" which correspond to
  the function keys. On the gameboard, use the arrow keys to move
  the knight. Use the spacebar to highlight the equations and make
  a matching pair.
