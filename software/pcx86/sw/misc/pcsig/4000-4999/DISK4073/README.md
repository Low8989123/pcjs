------------  Math Sampler -- Version 1.00  --------------------
----------  Animated Math Lessons and Games  -------------------

Math Sampler improves on other math games by providing animated 
math lessons as well as arcade-action games. Math Sampler's drag-
and-drop mouse interface gives numbers a hands-on feel. This is 
the best approach yet to multidigit math. It even handles carry 
and borrow. Math Sampler has six games covering counting, 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The kids, 
parents, and teachers who helped test this program love it!

To run Math Sampler go to the drive and directory containing the 
program and type MS1 <Enter>. A mouse, high resolution (640 x 
350) color true EGA or VGA, at least 512k of memory, and DOS 2.1 
or higher are required. We would appreciate any comments or 
suggestions regarding this program. Please send them to:
