thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you

The brand new PC-SIG World Of Windows is a must-have for Windows users.
In order to produce the best possible Windows collection PC-SIG has made
an alliance with the acclaimed Windows OnLine BBS. So not only do you have
access to the collecting and weeding out efforts for which PC-SIG is
famous, but also the huge volume of fonts and sound files and the in-depth
software reviews of the world's best Windows BBS.

This CD contains every one of the best Windows shareware programs
available, 350+ in all, over 900 TrueType fonts which can be used
without royalties, 429 ATM fonts, over 2,000 sound files in .WAV,
.VOC, .SND, .SOU, .MID format and 2,794 icons! A major computer
catalog is offering a collection of 250 fonts for $49.95. They have
great prices on hardware and software, but this time they can't
touch us.

As if the files aren't enough, we thought you would want to preview
and use these sounds, fonts, icons and programs directly from the CD,
without taking the time and space to unarchive them. So we have
included a font previewer and installed, a sound player and an icon
manager. Over 200 of the programs can be run simply by clicking on
them in the File Manager. Nobody else offers you anything close to
this type of access.

We're not done yet. In add to all the Windows riches described above,

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

3     TECHNOLOGY             Technology in the Soviet Union is very limited, or limited to a small set of the population.  Often visitors to the Soviet Union find it hard to believe that a country that can put a man in space and develop nuclear technology does not have more common place technology.  For instance in a small store you will not find a checker with an electronic cash register but a pad and pencil with which they calculate.  In larger stores you may find that the cashier has an abacus.  In the schools children are required to study computer science.  Though that may sound good it will be noted that they don't have computers.  Most agree that it is a real waste of time to study computer science and programming when you don't have a computer to test  your programs on.  It does happen to be one of the most disliked classes by students.
AGRICULTURE          Although the Soviet Union has a vast amount of fertile farmland, for decades it has been unable to feed its own people without food imports.  This is mainly due to the governmental policies which have fostered an agricultural system with labor shortages, managerial problems, and a gross lack of equipment.  For example the 1990 years record harvest has overburdened the inefficient system causing almost one third of the produce to rot before it reaches the table.  Large amounts of grain imports, roughly equal to the Soviet grain wasted, are needed each year to cope with the food shortages.  As a result, the damaged Soviet economy spends billions of rubles needlessly buying overseas food.  Here is an example of some of the problems.  Some tourists have seen such things as combines cutting grain in the rain which causes great loss and rot.  When asked why they would cut in the rain the Soviet combine operators might say it was the day scheduled to do it.  Because no one is paid by what reaches the consumer as in a free market often jobs are bound more to schedule or convenience than to practicality. 
RELIGION             The official religion of the Communist party was atheism.  Lenin, the founder of communism in the Soviet Union, thought religion a great ill of mankind.  Thus religion has basically been, not only frowned upon but at times violently attacked.  There has, however, been those who have strongly stayed faithful to religious beliefs through the many years.  Many of those who continued to go to church were the "old believers", the older people who were raised more religious.  Gradually many of these died and so did support for some churches.  Many church buildings were taken by the state and turned into museums or let fall into disrepair.  Often tourists to the Soviet Union may be surprised to find in an old church that has been left idled or turned into a museum, many beautiful religious works of art that would rival many of the paintings in famous art galleries around the world.  Only now with the greater freedoms have these been able to be seen.  Many great religious art pieces have either been destroyed or fallen into great disrepair.      No official status on church memberships are published but scholars estimate that one-third are Christian.  There are more than 40 religions and religious trends.  The largest is the Russian Orthodox and second is Muslims.  There is beginning to be a great resurgence in religious outpouring among the people.  Some churches have even said this has been almost harmful because of the lack of religious leaders.

                                  INSTALLATION

HARD DISK:
     This program must read data files and if it can be loaded on a hard
disk will run much faster.
   Put the disk number 1 into the drive and from it run INSTALL.  This
program will automatically install the RUSSIAN tutorial to your hard drive. 
Follow the instructions on the disk. FOR MORE ON THE INSTALL PROGRAM SEE
PAGE  23

ONE DISK MACHINE:
     Each program is made to run independently as long as it has the needed
files. If these files are present on a disk then the program can be run
from that disk.  For a list of programs with the files that are needed to
run  see (Programs and needed files P.? ) and RUNNING THE PROGRAM page 10, 
     


You shold set 
FILES=10
BUFFERS=20
in the CONFIG.SYS file.
     To do this use your DOS Edlin editor or any other ASCII type editor
(PC-WRITE LITE will work).
         To use the Edlin editor if DOS is in the path type EDLIN
CONFIG.SYS  .   Once in the editor at the * prompt type L to look at the
file.  If there is a line that has either of the two commands needed just
type the number of that line at the * prompt.  This puts you into edit
mode.  If these have not previously been set, at the * prompt hit I for
insert and type one, hit return and then type the other.  When you are
finished typing hit CTRL-Z  then you will be at the * prompt.  Type E to
exit and save.

                       
                  RUNNING AND SETTING UP THE PROGRAM

                                     SETUP:
     After installing the program, if you have chosen on the install to
create a batch file, you can just type RUSSIAN at the main directory prompt
where the RUSSIAN.BAT file was installed.  If you did not choose to make
a batch file, you can run the program by changing to the directory where
it has been installed and typing RUSMENU. 

SOME OTHER CONSIDERATIONS IN GETTING STARTED ARE:

MONOCHROME TYPE MACHINE:
     If your machine does not have the graphics adapters you can still run
this program but you will need a CGA simulator.  These can be found quite
readily, and there are even many that can be gotten through shareware.  If
your machine does not have the graphics adapters you will need to
initialize every time before you run the program or before you run the
configuration program.
                                 CONFIGURATION:
     If it is the first time you have run the program and you did not run
the configuration program during the INSTALL, or you would like to change
the colors, music, print options, or video mode, you will want to configure
the program.  To do this choose CONFIGURE option in the RUSMENU program or
you can just run the configuration program by typing CONFIGURE .

COLORS:
 MAIN COLORS:  This sets and overall default color.  You will see the
colors for your machine displayed.  By hitting any key other than return
you can see these colors against different backgrounds.  When you find the
background color you like best hit ENTER.  Then you can choose the main
print color from the color numbers.  If you like the color you chose for
the background choose 0.

     WINDOWS:  Next you will be asked to choose the colors for different
windows in the program.  Choose the number next to the color you desire
for:
1) Back ground color (the main default background color is 0).
1A) If this is the Russian Window from which all main windows are based,
you will be asked to choose a second window print color.
2) The window print color.
3) The window border color.

     MUSIC:   You can toggle music on or off by choosing this option.  If
you choose yes you will hear part of the 1812 Overture at the program
opening and also if you do well on the WORD TEST.

 OVERRIDE VIDEO MODE:
Sometimes the video mode chosen by the computer as the best is not the one
desired.  For example, if you like bigger letters and you have an EGA
machine you may want to override the computer's choice and have it run in
CGA mode.Programs in Version 2.0 (nonshareware version)

RUSSIAN MENU PROGRAM 
    All programs in the set are designed to work independently.  You may
run any one without using the menu program RUSMENU.  The menu program is
designed to allow you to switch quickly and efficiently between the
programs without having it play the music or show the opening screen or the
welcome screen. Each program can be put on a disk by itself and run
independently as long as the files that are needed for it are put with it.
 All programs are connected to this menu program. 


RUSSIAN EDITOR: Program name: RUSEDIT 
    The editing program for the main database files for customizing
vocabulary lists for lessons including  the creation and deletion of words, 
correcting spelling, adding verb  conjugation, noun endings, adjective 
endings, and pronoun forms.   

 
TEST:           Program name: RUSTEST  
    This is the testing feature.  This test is easily customizable by a
teacher or anyone desiring to create a test. The test files can be changed
to PC-WRITE LITE format (see: ? ) and then tests can be entered.  The
creation of the test allows each test to be set up with a different number
of questions, with each question having it's own point total, the time
allotted for the question and the penalty if too much time was taken.  For
more on customizing the test  
see  ?, ?. 
 
CONVERSION:     Program name: RUSCONV 
    This is the program that switches files between the formats of the
RUSSIAN TUTORIAL and PC-WRITE LITE.  This allows you to customize the
tutorial to your own specifications.FILES:          Program name: RUSCPY
        This program copies files from disk to the directory where the
program is.  The main importance for this is in backing up files before
use, especially the database before editing.  For that reason this program
can also be run from the editor menu.  This program will make sure that all
files belonging to a database are copied with it as long as the disk space
is sufficient.

LITE:            Program name: LITE
        This is the PC-WRITE LITE 1.02 program.  This file, remember, is
shareware and if it is used a lot you should register it with QUICKSOFT,
the company that makes it.  By running this program you can see the adress
and phone number of QUICKSOFT.     RUSSIAN TUTORIAL MAIN SCREEN OPTIONS

G) OUTPUT TO FILE 
    Toggling on this option brings some other items onto the screen
(depending on what the defaults were when chosen in the configuration
program (see: ? )).   
The other items are: 

1) PRINTER TYPE    This defines printers to  be of one of the three
supported types: EPSON graphic type, HP LASERJET type, or HP DESKJET type. 
2) PRINT FILE ON COMPLETION   If this is  chosen and PC-WRITE LITE has been
loaded properly, the tutorial will use it to print the file upon completion
of compiling the word list. 
3) DELETE FILE    This option is only available if you choose to print the
file upon completion of compiling of the word list.  This will delete the
file from you disk after it is printed so you do not have a lot of file
accumulate on 
your disk.
(output to file continued on next page)(list options continued)

4) DOWNLOAD FONTS  This option is only available if you choose to print the
file upon completion of compiling of the word list and if the printer type
is either HP LASER type or HP DESKJET type that needs the download fonts. 
Fonts only need to be downloaded once in a session.  If you have not
downloaded some other fonts or shut of the printer since they were last
downloaded you should not need to do it again. 

J) CONTINUE 
    Choosing this takes you to the next 
screen.  On the next screen you will choose the lesson(s) to compile the
word lists from.
     CHOOSING THE LESSONS FOR THE WORD LIST:   You will be asked the
beginning lesson for the word list.  You will then  be asked the ending
lesson for the word  list.  For example, if you put in lesson  5 for the
beginning lesson and lesson 8  for the ending lesson it will compile a list
of words (depending on what was chosen) of the words in lessons 5,6,7, and
8. 

K) GO TO MAIN MENU 
    Choose this option if you do not want to continue and compile the word
list.

E) SENTENCE TRANSLATIONS
SENTENCE TRANSLATIONS
          This option is to give you practice translating Russian to
English and English to Russian.  You can choose which you want to come up
and you will type the other.  You then choose the lesson to test
translations on.  The sentence is displayed and you type your translation. 
Then when you hit RETURN (ENTER) the computer translation will come up so
you can compare your translation to the one given.
     Note that just because they may be different does not mean yours is
wrong.
     To get the next sentence just hit any key.  When you have gone through
all sentences provided, it will automatically take you back to the main
menu or you can hit F10 at any point to exit early.F) TOPIC HELP
TOPIC HELP
     This is a help section with important points by topic instead of by
lesson.  This has a built in help section to help you through it.

CHOOSING TOPICS:
     The topics can be chosen by using the arrow keys to light the desired
topic.  If you are at the right or left edge and hit the arrow key to
advance you one space beyond it will take you back to the opposite edge. 
The same is true if you try to advance beyond the top or bottom.
     Once you are on the desired topic hit the return key to bring it into
the viewing window.

READING TOPICS:
     In order to be able to use the arrow keys to move around the light bar
menu and yet have easy access to keys for reading we make use of the
numeric keypad.  By hitting numlock to lock on the numbers, the keys on the
keypad that correspond to cursor or page movement scroll through the
document.  Thus for example the number 2 will scroll one line down.  Other
keys have also been provided for convenience.  Once the topic has been
loaded into the viewing window the following keys will scroll it:

     PAGE UP or 9:         Scrolls screen up                         one
screen at a                           time.

(continued on next page)     PAGE DOWN or 3:       Scrolls screen                            down
one screen                           at a time.

     CTRL-PAGE UP or 8:    Scrolls one line                          up.

 CTRL-PAGE DOWN or 2:  Scrolls one line                        down.

     HOME or 7:            Jump to first line                        of the
topic.

     END or 1:             Jump to end of the                        
topic.

     The viewing window will automatically clear when you hit the arrow
keys to choose a new topic.

RETURNING TO THE PREVIOUS MENU:
     ESC returns you to the position in the program from which you came to
the topic section.

     To create your own topic helps see CONVERSION - CUSTOMIZE   P ?.
G) PROGRAM HELP

C) GET RULES

D) CONTINUE Continue and choose lessons to test on and do the quiz.  
       You must choose the beginning lesson and choose the ending lesson
to test through.

This segment is made to be a game and you score according to speed and
correctnes.  This has its own help section to describe it more in detail. 

RULES:
     The word will come up in English or Russian (which ever you chose the
computer to display) and you type the other.  A clock will start timing you
the second the word appears and will stop the second you hit return after
typing your response.  The clock will start over again only after you have
had the computer put the next word into the window.

POINTS FOR GETTING THE WORD RIGHT: 
     If you get the word on the first pass you will get 10 points, 8 on the
second pass, 6 on the third, 4 on the 4th, and any beyond that will give
you 2 points.

TIME:
     If you are on the first pass you will  get 1 point for every second
under 15 that it takes, .75 for every second under 15 on the second pass,
.5 on the third, .25 on the 4th, and 0 on any pass greater than 4.

KEYS If you can't remember where the corresponding letters are on the
keyboard choose F7 to get a layout of the keyboard.MUSIC:
     If you get a score equal to or greater than 95% of the words with 20
points it will say you have done well and (if you have the music turned on
in your config file) play part of the 1812 overture.       



       GOOD LUCK!!!   

I) CHANGE FONT
     This is to change between the BLOCK (TYPED) and CURSIVE (HANDWRITTEN)
fonts.  This is to give you a chance to learn both.  
  The next two pages show an example of each font.
     Once the font is changed it stays that font at any level of the
program until changed again.
     It is good practice to try and get used to learning both and not just
the block font.  Most speakers of Russian, just like any other language,
seldom print and it is important for a person to be able to read hand
writing.

J) TO END      
     To exit the program just hit J (zero). 

WORD SEARCH IN ENGLISH
     This screen has many subfeatures.

WORD SEARCH:
     The main feature is the ability to type a word in English and get the
Russian "equivalent".  The database is opened according to the English
alphabet and thus as you type in letters it will move down the alphabet as
you would in the English language.  For example if you type in "p" it will
jump to the first English word that starts with "p".  Then if you type in
"a" it will have "pa" in the type in screen and will move accordingly to
the closest English word with "pa".  Thus you don't necessarily have to
type the whole word to have it displayed.
     You must realize the words are case sensitive and thus only words that
start phrases or are proper names are capitalized.


ARROWS
     UP ARROW: The up arrow moves you back alphabetically one word in the
English alphabetical order.
     DOWN ARROW: The down arrow moves you forward one word in the English
alphabetical order.

          This can be useful if you can't remember how to spell a word. 
You can get as close as possible and then move back and forth through the
words in the list

CONFIGURATION PROGRAM
   This program sets up options in many of the different modules.  It will
allow you to set up the main screen colors, the window colors, the lightbar
colors, turn the music on or off, turn the insert disk reminder on or off,
and set up the default print options.  Each item is explained below.

A) SET MAIN COLORS
  Choosing this option allows you to go to a screen which has the main
colors of your computer.  You can see these against the given background
by hitting any key other than the return key.  When you have decided the
background color you like these on the best, hit the enter key.  Then you
will be asked to choose the color for printing that you like best.  Choose
the number next to the color you like best as the main print color.

B) SET WINDOW COLORS
     This option allows you to set 5 window colors for the 
   A) RUSSIAN WINDOW
   B) ENGLISH WINDOW
   C) PRONOUNCE WINDOW 
   D) TYPE-IN WINDOW
   E) HELP WINDOW 
 You will see the colors on the screen and will be asked to choose the
background color, the printing color, and the border color.  The Russian
screen has two print colors that you must choose.  In all places throughout
the program the Russian window color is the main one.  Any screen that has
only one window will use these colors.  
     The colors that you may choose from also include color 0, the color
chosen for the background. This will not show up on the screen because of
the background.  After you have set the color for a window you will see a
demonstration of a window with the colors chosen and you will be asked if
it is good.  If you choose Y it will take you back to the option to set
another window color.  If you hit any other key you will be asked to enter
the colors again.  
   Note that if you choose a print color and a background color that is
close to the same color you will not be able to read easily.

C) SET LIGHTBAR COLORS   
     This option allows you to choose the lightbar colors you prefer.  The
colors are given in the normal color and also what you will see in reverse
video.  If you are having trouble reading the lightbar menus in any program
you may need to reset these.

D) MUSIC   
      This option turns the music on or off.  The music consists of the
1812 OVERTURE played at the opening screen or at the WORD TEST in the
RUSSIAN TUTORIAL if you do well.

E) TEXT COLOR OPTIONS 
      This option is to choose the default color for running segments of
the program that are in text mode.

F) WINDOW STYLE
     This option is to determine the type of window opening style you would
like.  The program will only toggle between two types.  The one style will
open out and looks a little prettier.  The other style is a quicker,
instantaneous opening style.  If your machine is a slower model you will
probably want the second type.LISTING OF FILES USEFUL FOR CUSTOMIZATION
for information on how to customize these see GENERAL CUSTOMIZATION P. 23

Version 1.0 does not have the tools necessary for customization.  Version
2.0 allows customization of the keyboard, lesson files, vocabulary ,etc.

CUSTOMIZING
   Many files in the Russian programs can be changed to customize the
programs to your own specifications.  Each of these plays a certain role
within the program it is used.   In order to customize these they first
must be converted from the format of the RUSSIAN TUTORIAL to the format of
the word processor PC-WRITE LITE 1.02.  To do this requires the RUSCONV
program and the RUSEDIT programs.

                                 OTHER PROGRAMS
        The only other program in the set written by HOWARD SOFTWARE  is
the INSTALL program.  This program is made to help you install the tutorial
to the hard disk.  It will automatically check your graphics device, load
the appropriate files.  It will also load PC-WRITE LITE 1.02 for printing
if you desire.  The INSTALL program is easy to use.  Just put in the disk
drive, change to that drive and type install.
USING THE RELATED SHAREWARE PROGRAMS
     The programs by HOWARD SOFTWARE are not shareware and may not be used
with out being purchased.  The Russian programs do make use of certain
shareware programs.  The programs, if used and not just tested, should be
registered to give the authors what is rightfully theirs.  The prices and
where to send the money can be seen by running the programs.  The programs
are as follows:

CGA simulators
     A CGA simulator is required to be run first for those with a  HERCULES
MONOCHROME GRAPHICS card.  This is put into the batch file to initialize
the graphics.
RUNNING PROGRAMS SEPARATELY
     Each of the major programs can be run separately.  Therefore, if you
have a computer that has only a single disk system you can still run the
different programs by making sure the files that are needed for the program
are on the disk.  Each file uses certain programs to boot up and then it
will only need the data files.
     Below is a list of the important files and there purpose.  Following
that is a list of the major programs with the files and related programs
needed to run independently.

ADJECT.DB - Adjective database file. 
ALPHA.DOC - Keyboard correspondance file.
CGA.DAT - Default CGA file that can be copied to config.dat if something
is wrong.

The following files are graphics files.  If you want to run any program
from the tutorial set except RUSCONV.EXE or RUSCPY.EXE you will need the
one appropriate to your machine.  If you decide to override the default for
your machine (in CONFIG.EXE) you will need to copy the appropriate file
first.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
