The brand new PC-SIG World Of Windows is a must-have for Windows users.
In order to produce the best possible Windows collection PC-SIG has made
an alliance with the acclaimed Windows OnLine BBS. So not only do you have
access to the collecting and weeding out efforts for which PC-SIG is
famous, but also the huge volume of fonts and sound files and the in-depth
software reviews of the world's best Windows BBS.

This CD contains every one of the best Windows shareware programs
available, 350+ in all, over 900 TrueType fonts which can be used
without royalties, 429 ATM fonts, over 2,000 sound files in .WAV,
.VOC, .SND, .SOU, .MID format and 2,794 icons! A major computer
catalog is offering a collection of 250 fonts for $49.95. They have
great prices on hardware and software, but this time they can't
touch us.

As if the files aren't enough, we thought you would want to preview
and use these sounds, fonts, icons and programs directly from the CD,
without taking the time and space to unarchive them. So we have
included a font previewer and installed, a sound player and an icon
manager. Over 200 of the programs can be run simply by clicking on
them in the File Manager. Nobody else offers you anything close to
this type of access.

We're not done yet. In add to all the Windows riches described above,
this CD also contains the text and programs from the July-August
issue of Shareware Magazine. This is the second in a six-volume PC-SIG
Encyclopedia of Shareware CD-ROM series (Games was the first). Each
volume includes the programs from a section of the PC-SIG Library plus

Magazine. Software reviews for this issue cover over 100 programs

     PART 1.  INTRODUCTION

     DayCare is a program designed to assist you in the day-to-day
     management of information needed to run a day care facility. The
     program also allows you to print many of the forms needed for such an
     activity, thus reducing the need to stockpile expensive printed forms.

     The program will run on any computer system that operates using
     DOS 2.x or higher, has 300k of available memory and a color monitor.
     Support is provided for both Epson FX/IBM Graphic compatible dot
     matrix printers and HP LaserJet compatible laser printers.

     All of the information concerning the facility, the staff, and the
     clients are maintained in files that are created and can be updated by
     the program. New or changed files are rewritten to disk whenever you
     exit from the program or when you select a different file.


     1.1   STARTING DayCare

     The DayCare distribution diskette contains the executable program
     (DAYCARE.COM) which can be run directly on diskette or copied to a
     hard disk.

     DayCare reads and writes data files on the current default drive and
     directory. The program itself may be resident on any directory as long
     as DOS can find it or you include the pathname in the command line.
     To start DayCare you must log on to the drive and directory where the
     DayCare data files are to be stored and, at the DOS prompt, enter  the
     command    "DayCare"

     The program first looks for a file called DAYCARE.ORG on the current
     directory. If it is not present, a new file will be created and you
     will be taken automatically through the functions described below for
     entering Organization and Personnel information.

     You will then see a display from which you must select a group file by
     entering a number (see para. 4.3 SELECT A DIFFERENT GROUP) -- if you
     do not the program terminates.

     NOTE: In this manual a letter inside angle brackets is used to
     indicate a single key press -- the shift key need not be held down.

     The Function Menu is then displayed. Pressing a letter key will invoke
     the named function. When you exit from a function you will be returned
     to the Function Menu. If you press the <X> key at the Function Menu
     display, the following message will appear:  Exit from DayCare (Y/N) ?

     Pressing the <Y> key will exit from DayCare to the DOS prompt. Pressing
     any other key will return you to the Function Menu.

     If you have not yet registered your copy of DayCare you will be given
     the opportunity to print a regisistration form for your use.

     2                       DayCare Version 1.0

     1.2   USING THE KEYBOARD

     Each activity in DayCare requires a specific entry from the keyboard.
     The type of entry, and the specific limits for each entry, are shown
     in the Dialog Box at the bottom of the screen. A blinking cursor
     appears. The instructions use the following terminology.

     "Press" means you need press only a single key, either a letter or a
     number. The key list refers to the highlighted characters in the
     window display. The Shift Key should not be held down.

     If you press a key not listed in the instruction, an error message
     will be displayed and you will be taken back to the prompt.

     "Return" refers to a key that may be labeled RET or ENTER.

     "Edit" indicates that you can change individual characters in the
     highlighted area directly on the screen. Typing a character replaces
     the one at the cursor.

     During editing the <INS> key inserts one blank space at the cursor,
     the <DEL> key deletes the character at the cursor, the <BackSpace> key
     deletes the character before the cursor.

     The left and right arrow keys move the cursor one character at a time.
     For multi-line areas, the up and down arrow keys let you move to a
     different line.

     The <HOME> key moves the cursor to the beginning of the area, the
     <END> key to the end of the area.

     To save the changed area press Return. Pressing the <ESC> key exits
     from editing without saving the changes.

     "Enter" means you are expected to either type a number or a new
     character type entry (see "Edit"). For numbers use the backspace key
     to make corrections. Press the Return key when you have completed your
     entry.

     When entering a number pressing Return alone (not ESC) causes no
     change to be made. Entering a 0 (zero) causes that value to be stored
     where appropriate. The value zero is displayed as either a blank or a
     "0" on the screen. An error message will appear if your entry exceeds
     the limits of a number.

     After every addition or change, you will be given the opportunity to
     correct the information before it is saved on the permanent file.

     Every instruction in DayCare gives you an opportunity to "back out" of
     the routine, or continue on, without making a change in the displayed
     values. Pressing only the Return key, or the letter "X" where
     specified, will take you back to the previous instruction or display.

     1.3  SCREEN DISPLAYS

     DayCare uses 80 x 25 text displays for group selection, menus, and
     data entry functions. For example, the Function Menu looks like this:

     The top two lines on the screen are the "Banner". Line one of the
     Banner shows the system name and version number, the current active
     group title and starting date, and the current time and date. Line two
     shows the number of children enrolled in the group or the name of the
     individual whose information is being displayed.

     The middle part of the screen is the "Window" which is used to display
     the name of the current activity and menus, lists, information from
     files, messages, special instructions, etc.

     The bottom two lines are the "Dialog Box". These lines carry the
     instructions for pressing a key or entering the other information,
     accept input from the keyboard, and display error messages.


     1.4  THE FUNCTION MENU

     The functions available in DayCare are listed under three major
     headings. Each function is described in detail below. Pressing the
     highlighted letter key will invoke the named function. When you exit
     from a function you will be returned to the Function Menu.

     PART 3. PRINT REPORTS

     When you press one of the keys designated as a report on the function
     menu, you may be prompted to enter one or more parameters that define
     the report to be printed (child numbers, month, form name, etc.).
     Then, a message in the dialog box will remind you to set the selected
     type of printer "on line". If you have a printer buffer attached, make
     sure it too is turned on.

     NOTE: The Printer Type can be set on the Organization Information menu
     -- see paragraph 2.1. above.

     The printouts from DayCare use 9 inches per page. To center the top
     and bottom margins on a dot matrix printer, the paper should be set so
     that the first line will print one-half to one inch down from the top
     of a new page. The margins for a laser printer are set automatically.

     Press <P> when you are ready, or <X> to abort the printing.

     If the printer is still not ready to print, you will see a second
     prompt that reminds you to make it ready or to exit without printing.

     If you have not reigistered this copy of DayCare a reminder will be
     printed at the bottom of each page of every printed form.

     PART 4. OTHER FUNCTIONS

     4.1 LOG DAILY ATTENDANCE

     This function, initiated by pressing <L> at the function menu, allows
     you to record the amount of time (in hours and tenths of hours) that
     each member of the group was present at the facility for a specified
     day.

     You will first be prompted to select the day. At the prompt enter the
     month number as 1 or 2 digits, a slash (/), and the the day of the
     month as 1 or 2 digits. The program will calculate the year based on
     the starting date for the group and the day of the week.

     You will then be presented, one at a time, with each member's number,
     name, and amount of time currently on record for that day (if any).

     Enter the amount of time for the child as hours, a decimal point
     (period) and tenths (if any) -- for example, for 7 1/2 hours you would
     enter "7.5". The display will reflect the entry you made and go on to
     prompt you for the next member's time.

     When you have completed 10 entries, or reached the end of the group
     list, you will be given the opportunity to make any changes needed
     before the information is placed in the group file.

     After you have finished the entries for the selected day, you will be
     returned to the date prompt. Press only return to go back to the
     function menu.


     4.2 EDIT ATTENDANCE RECORD

     You may also change the attendance information on an individual
     child's record by pressing <E> at the function menu. You must then
     select the child from a list of group members, and then select the
     month you wish to edit.

     You will see a display of the hours recorded for the child for each
     day of the selected month. To change information, enter the day number
     and then, when prompted, the new number of hours and tenths.

     When you are finished (press Return only), you will be taken back to
     the month select list, then the member select list, and finally to the
     Function menu.

     4.3 SELECT A DIFFERENT GROUP

     This function will be invoked when you first start DayCare and may
     also be accessed by pressing <S> at the Function Menu display.

     A numbered list of the Group names and starting dates in the files on
     the current directory will be displayed. Type the number of the
     DayCare Group you want to work with, then press the Return key.

     If you press Return without typing a number, you will be returned to
     the Function Menu with the current file still active.

     To create a new group file, enter a "+" sign. The program will check
     to see if there is room on the current drive and directory for a new
     full size file (100k) -- if not a warning message will be displayed.

     NOTE: A directory may contain up to 30 DayCare group files.

     If there is room for a new file, or if there is no group file on the
     current directory, one will be created whose name has the format
     YMddhhmm.DCG  where:

               Y = a letter designating the current year (A=1990, etc.)
               M = a letter designating the current month (A=Jan. etc.)
               dd = 2 digits for current day of the month
               hh = 2 digits for current hours (24 hour clock)
               mm = 2 digits for current minute

     The file extension .DCG  indicates that this is a DayCare Group file
     and therefore may not be changed.

     All new group files will be given the group name "--New Group-" and
     the current date as the stating date. You will then be taken
     automatically through the items on the Group Information display (see
     para. 2.3). When you are finished, the function menu will be
     displayed.


     4.4 DATE CHECK

     This is a utility routine that let's you determine the day of the week
     and the number of the day of the year for any date from Jan. 1, 1990
     through Dec. 31, 2050 (no records are affected).

     At the prompt enter the month number as 1 or 2 digits, a slash (/),
     the day of the month as 1 or 2 digits, a slash, and the last 2 digits
     of the year  (90-99 = 19yy, 00-50 = 20yy).

     The information will be displayed in a 15 line list in the window (the
     16th entry starts over again at the top of the list.

     When you are finished, press Return alone and you will be returned to
     the Function menu.

                             DayCare ver 1.0

                      Release date: January 1, 1993

Description:
------------

Full Day Care Center system for information recording and reporting.
Handles attendance, health, and permissions records. Suitable for use by
home, business, or corporate in-house day care centers.

Features that make DayCare stand out are:

- Compact system written in Assembler. It will run on ANY MS-DOS computer.
  A single floppy and a printer is all that is required.

- Complete. The American Red Cross's own courses were used as a basis for
  the reports. These also conform to the state of Texas' Department of
  Public Health standards (we have not yet confirmed that they conform to
  all states' recordkeeping requirements).

- Easy to learn and quick to use. The menuing is geared toward the
  natural way that non-computer users expect. Data entry is intuitive and
  is designed for quick entry from the normal attendance sheets found in
  commercial or corporate day care centers.

- Unique. Quite simply put, this is the ONLY system available in the
  shareware marketplace aimed at the day care center.

- Supported. The publisher, Bob Ostrander, has been on the shareware scene
  since 1983. Any problems you may find will be corrected or your money
  back, guaranteed.

Software Co-op was started by Bob Ostrander not only as a company to
distribute his software, but also to give representation to other authors.
Bob Ostrander has been in the computer business since 1970 and active in
the shareware market since 1983. He was the founder and president of
Public Brand Software and is an active member of the Association of
Shareware Professionals.

          related to each object in each room. These can be used for
          capital goods or fixed assets inventory. This data may be
          exported via comma-delimited files.

          Look for LAYOUT.ZIP on BBSs. $20 registration fee. $35 with

          vertically (good for filling in forms) or the vertical aspect
          can be shrunk by 10% to accommodate the LaserJet's 10-inch page.

          DMPLAS can also be used in stand-alone mode to translate and
          print pre-formatted output.

          A set of optional HP LaserJet soft fonts are included that can
          produce more accurate results on printers that do not have a
          full range of fonts. Included are normal, bold, italic, and
          italic bold fonts as well as a full set of proportional Courier
          fonts.

          DOWNLOAD by Elfring Soft Fonts is also included in the font set.

          other programs.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Outside the U.S.A.: Call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer near

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.


To Order, in the U.S.A.: Call 800-245-6717 and ask Customer Service.
