                            INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE
                      SPANISH LANGUAGE LEARNER PROGRAM 


                                 SHAREWARE

	This program is not free. It is shareware. This means that you 
	may try it out before you decide whether or not to buy it. After 
	you have tried it out for one or two weeks, if you intend to 
	keep using it you must register by sending $12.00 to 

			Arthur Wells, Jr.
			1171 Cragmont Ave.
			Berkeley, CA  94708

	You can use the registration form, but it's not required.

	When you register you will be put on my list for notice about
	new versions, new programs, etc.

	You may not sell the program, but you may distribute it as
	shareware, making a small charge for the disk and mailing. You
        may not use the program for any commercial purpose without my
        written permission.

	You may give the program to as many people as you wish. When you 
	do so, you must transfer all the files on the disk. Each user 
	must send in $12.00 unless they are members of the same household 
	or family as someone who has registered.

	If the program is going to be used by a school, business or
	other entity, please contact me to negotiate a license fee.

	I receive no other income from my programming. Equipment costs,
	supplies, mailings and BBS upload time are all paid out of
	my pocket. Therefore, if you use and enjoy the program, please
	SEND THE REGISTRATION FEE. And remember, if you don't register
	I will find you in the middle of the night when you are sleeping. 


				THE PROGRAM

	With this program you can use your computer to study vocabulary 
  	words, idioms and sentences from any textbook, study guide, 
  	story, newspaper or article. If you are studying from a textbook 
  	you can make a separate file for each chapter. You can enter all 
 	of the different verb forms, regular and irregular. You can enter 
  	idioms and other expressions.

	You can run the program from a floppy disk or copy it to a 
  	hard disk if you have one. The files created and used by program 
  	must be in the same directory or on the same floppy disk as the 
	program. These files have a ".DAT" extension in their name. 
	If your floppy gets full you can either delete files or copy 
	the program files to a new floppy and continue to make new data 
	files. 

  	Under normal circumstances, you will make data files before 
  	you use the test option. However, everyone is usually 
  	interested in seeing how the test option works first, so I 
  	have included vocabulary files made with the program so 
  	that you can immediately see how the test option works if you 
  	want to.                                                   

  	For the following instructions, type the word or symbol between 
  	the "< >" marks, but not the "< >" symbols.                    

  	If you have only a floppy drive, insert the disk into it. At 
  	the prompt, follow the instructions below.

  	If you have a hard drive you should use it for the program as 
  	it loads much faster from a hard drive. Insert the disk into the
  	floppy disk drive. At the DOS prompt type <MD\SPANISH>. Then 
  	type <CD\SPANISH>. Then type <COPY [disk drive letter]:*.*>. 
  	You are now ready to follow the instructions below.


	                     THE UTILITIES

	The program is very straight forward. To start it choose
	option <3> from the RUNME menu or by typing <SPANISH> at the
	DOS prompt and pressing <Enter>. You will see the title
	page. Press <Enter> for the main menu.

	If you select option <2> from the main menu you will see the
	maintenance utilities. Using these utilities you can create, 
	change, print and look at files of the words and phrases on 
	which you will test yourself. 

  	Select one of the choices. (Choice <5> is easiest.) You will 
	then be asked for a file number. No matter which choice you 
	selected you can call up a directory of the Spanish vocabulary 
	files by pressing <F1>. They all have a "SPAN" prefix and a 
	"DAT" suffix, but you only have to type in the number, which
	can be from 1 to 999. If you choose to create a file, using 
	option <1>, the program will check if a file exists with the 
	number of the file you have chosen to create. If so, you will 
	be given the option of overwriting the existing file or choosing 
	another number for your new file. If you choose creating or 
	adding to an existing file you will be asked to type in an 
	English word or expression. Do so and press <Enter>. You will 
	then be asked for the Spanish word or expression. 

  	The bottom of the screen will tell you which function keys to 
  	press to print the characters which are not on the keyboard. 
  	After typing the Spanish word or expression press <Enter> again. 
  	You will be asked to confirm your entry. When you are finished
  	with the file press <Esc>.

  	If you choose to edit a file, the computer will show you the 
  	current entries one by one. The bottom of the screen tells you 
  	what to do.

  	You can enter phrases up to 32 characters long. This means that 
  	you can also include multiple meanings of a word by separating 
  	them with a semicolon.
       
  	The print file option works automatically once you have selected
	a file number. 

	The file display option prompts you to press <Enter> if there 
	is more than one page of words and expressions in a file.

  	Pressing <Esc> one or two times always takes you to the main 
  	menu.


                             TESTING YOURSELF

	Back at the main menu choose option <1>.

  	You will see four choices on the screen and will choose choice <1>. 
  	After you select choice 1 you will be asked which files you want 
  	to be tested on. First type in the smallest file number you want 
  	and press <Enter>. You will then be asked for the ending file 
  	number. If you want to be tested on only one file then type in 
  	the same number. If you want to do two or more consecutively 
  	numbered files then type in the last numbered file you want. You 
  	can only do more than one file at a time if the files are 
  	consecutively numbered. In any event, press <Enter>.

  	You can do up to 200 words at a time, but I recommend you do
	one file at a time.

  	By this time you will have learned that somewhere on the screen, 
  	in the middle of the screen or on the bottom, you are told what 
  	you can do next.

  	The next menu lets you select two different types of tests, 
  	multiple choice or fill in. Multiple choice lets you get 
  	acquainted with the vocabulary. Fill in really tests your 
  	knowledge of the vocabulary.

  	The next menu lets you select the direction of the translation 
  	test. Your choices are obvious.

  	Taking the test is also obvious. If you have chosen the multiple 
  	choice test then press the number of the answer you select. For a 
  	fill in test, type your answer and press <Enter>. When you have 
  	to fill in an answer in Spanish, the bottom of the screen will tell
  	you which function keys to press to print the characters that are
  	not on the keyboard.

  	Pressing <Esc> always takes you to the next previous menu. You 
  	can change the type of test or the direction of translation at 
  	any time. While you can switch back and forth, the program will 
  	test you on all words and phrases in both directions. When you 
  	are finished with all the vocabulary in one direction the program 
  	will change to the other direction, having  told you about this 
  	change at the bottom of your screen.

  	After you have finished the test, the program will take you back 
  	to the first test menu. You can select another file for testing, 
	look at your results, or retest yourself on wrong answers. Unless 
	you have a perfect score, press <2>. You can look at your results 
	on the screen, print the results, or do both.

  	Either before or after you look at the results you can retest
  	yourself. Of course, the retest option only tests you on the 
  	words and phrases that you missed. Other than that the retest 
  	option works just like the test option.

			        PRINTING

  	Choose a printer. If you have an HP or Epson printer or a 
	compatible which is capable of printing the IBM symbol set
	you can use it to print letters with proper accent marks 
	already in place.  

                	PRINTING THE INSTRUCTIONS

  	If you want to print out these instructions, select option <2> 
	from the RUNME menu or type the following at the DOS prompt: 

                        TYPE SPANISH.DOC > PRN 

	Then press <Enter>.


				WINDOWS

	If you want to run the programs under Windows, do the following:

	1.)  Enter Windows.
	2.)  From Program Manager, open the File Menu.
	3.)  Choose "New". You will then see a box called "New Program
	     Object".
	4.)  Choose "Program Group". Click "OK".
	5.)  Next you will see a box called "Program Group Properties". 
	     In the "Description" box type <Languages>. Click "OK". Don't
	     worry about the "Group File" box; leave it blank.
	6.)  You will now see that you have a group called "Languages."
	7.)  Open the File Menu again. Choose "New" again. The "New 
	     Program Object" box will appear again.
	8.)  Choose "Program Item". Click "OK".
	9.)  The "Program Item Properties" box will appear. In the
	     "Description" box type <Spanish>. Press the <Tab> key.
	10.) In the "Command Line" box type <C:\Spanish\Spanish.exe>. 
	     (If you are using a different drive or directory, then make
	     the appropriate substitutions.) Press the <Tab> key again.
	11.) In the "Working Directory" box type <C:\Spanish> (or other
	     appropriate directory.) Click "OK".
	12.) You should see a DOS icon with the word "Spanish" underneath.
	     Double click it to run the Spanish program.

                                SHAREWARE

	This program is not free. It is shareware. This means that you 
	may try it out before you decide whether or not to buy it. After 
	you have tried it out for one or two weeks, if you intend to 
	keep using it you must register by sending $15.00 to 

			Arthur Wells, Jr.
			1171 Cragmont Ave.
			Berkeley, CA  94708

	You can use the registration form, but it's not required.

	When you register you will be put on my list for notice about
	new versions, new programs, etc.

	You may give the program to as many people as you wish. When you 
	do so, you must transfer all the files on the disk. Each user 
	must send in $15.00 unless they are members of the same household 
	or family as someone who has registered.

	You may not sell the program, but you can distribute it as
	shareware, charging a small sum for the disk and mailing. You
        may not make any commercial use of the program without my
        written permission.
	
	If the program is going to be used by a school, business or
	other entity, please contact me to negotiate a license fee.

	I receive no other income from my programming. Equipment costs,
	supplies, mailings and BBS upload time are all paid out of
	my pocket. Therefore, if you use and enjoy the program, please
	SEND THE REGISTRATION FEE. And remember, if you don't register
	I will find you in the middle of the night when you are sleeping. 


				THE PROGRAM

	With this program you can use your computer to study vocabulary 
  	words, idioms and sentences from any textbook, study guide, 
  	story, newspaper or article. If you are studying from a textbook 
  	you can make a separate file for each chapter. You can enter all 
 	of the different verb forms, regular and irregular. You can enter 
  	idioms and other expressions.

	You can run the program from a floppy disk or copy it to a 
  	hard disk if you have one. The files created and used by program 
  	must be in the same directory or on the same floppy disk as the 
	program. These files have a ".DAT" extension in their name. 
	If your floppy gets full you can either delete files or copy 
	the program files to a new floppy and continue to make new data 
	files. 

  	Under normal circumstances, you will make data files before 
  	you use the test option. However, everyone is usually 
  	interested in seeing how the test option works first, so I 
  	have included vocabulary files made with the program so 
  	that you can immediately see how the test option works if you 
  	want to.                                                   

  	For the following instructions, type the word or symbol between 
  	the "< >" marks, but not the "< >" symbols.                    

  	If you have only a floppy drive, insert the disk into it. At 
  	the prompt, follow the instructions below.

  	If you have a hard drive you should use it for the program as 
  	it loads much faster from a hard drive. Insert the disk into the
  	floppy disk drive. At the DOS prompt type <MD\EURO9>. Then 
  	type <CD\EURO9>. Then type <COPY [disk drive letter]:*.*>. 
  	You are now ready to follow the instructions below.


	                     THE UTILITIES

	The program is very straight forward. To start it choose
	option <3> from the RUNME menu or by typing <EURO9> at the
	DOS prompt and pressing <Enter>. You will see the title
	page. Press <Enter> for the main menu.

	If you select option <2> from the main menu you will see the
	maintenance utilities. Using these utilities you can create, 
	change, print and look at files of the words and phrases on 
	which you will test yourself. 

  	Select one of the choices. (Choice <5> is easiest.) You will 
	then be asked for a file number. No matter which choice you 
	selected you can call up a directory of the vocabulary 
	files for the chosen language by pressing <F1>. They all have 
        a prefix identifying the language and a "DAT" suffix, but you 
        only have to type in the number, which can be from 1 to 999. 
        If you choose to create a file, using option <1>, the program 
        will check if a file exists with the number of the file you 
        have chosen to create. If so, you will be given the option of 
        overwriting the existing file or choosing another number for 
        your new file. If you choose creating or adding to an existing 
        file you will be asked to type in an English word or expression. 
        Do so and press <Enter>. You will then be asked for the foreign 
        language word or expression. 

  	The bottom of the screen will tell you which function keys to 
  	press to print the characters which are not on the keyboard. 
  	After typing the foreign language word or expression press 
        <Enter> again. You will be asked to confirm your entry. When 
        you are finished with the file press <Esc>.

  	If you choose to edit a file, the computer will show you the 
  	current entries one by one. The bottom of the screen tells you 
  	what to do.

  	You can enter phrases up to 32 characters long. This means that 
  	you can also include multiple meanings of a word by separating 
  	them with a semicolon.
       
  	The print file option works automatically once you have selected
	a file number. 

	The file display option prompts you to press <Enter> if there 
	is more than one page of words and expressions in a file.

  	Pressing <Esc> one or two times always takes you to the main 
  	menu.


                             TESTING YOURSELF

	Back at the main menu choose option <1>.

  	You will see four choices on the screen and will choose choice <1>. 
  	After you select choice 1 you will be asked which files you want 
  	to be tested on. First type in the smallest file number you want 
  	and press <Enter>. You will then be asked for the ending file 
  	number. If you want to be tested on only one file then type in 
  	the same number. If you want to do two or more consecutively 
  	numbered files then type in the last numbered file you want. You 
  	can only do more than one file at a time if the files are 
  	consecutively numbered. In any event, press <Enter>.

  	You can do up to 200 words at a time, but I recommend you do
	one file at a time.

  	By this time you will have learned that somewhere on the screen, 
  	in the middle of the screen or on the bottom, you are told what 
  	you can do next.

  	The next menu lets you select two different types of tests, 
  	multiple choice or fill in. Multiple choice lets you get 
  	acquainted with the vocabulary. Fill in really tests your 
  	knowledge of the vocabulary.

  	The next menu lets you select the direction of the translation 
  	test. Your choices are obvious.

  	Taking the test is also obvious. If you have chosen the multiple 
  	choice test then press the number of the answer you select. For a 
  	fill in test, type your answer and press <Enter>. When you have 
  	to fill in an answer in French, the bottom of the screen will tell
  	you which function keys to press to print the characters that are
  	not on the keyboard.

  	Pressing <Esc> always takes you to the next previous menu. You 
  	can change the type of test or the direction of translation at 
  	any time. While you can switch back and forth, the program will 
  	test you on all words and phrases in both directions. When you 
  	are finished with all the vocabulary in one direction the program 
  	will change to the other direction, having  told you about this 
  	change at the bottom of your screen.

  	After you have finished the test, the program will take you back 
  	to the first test menu. You can select another file for testing, 
	look at your results, or retest yourself on wrong answers. Unless 
	you have a perfect score, press <2>. You can look at your results 
	on the screen, print the results, or do both.

  	Either before or after you look at the results you can retest
  	yourself. Of course, the retest option only tests you on the 
  	words and phrases that you missed. Other than that the retest 
  	option works just like the test option.

			        PRINTING

  	Choose a printer. If you have an HP or Epson printer or a 
	compatible which is capable of printing the IBM symbol set
	you can use it to print letters with proper accent marks 
	already in place, if you are printing a list for Danish,
        Dutch, Finnish, Norwegian or Swedish. For the other 
        languages you will have to add your own accent marks. 

                	PRINTING THE INSTRUCTIONS

  	If you want to print out these instructions, select option <2> 
	from the RUNME menu or type the following at the DOS prompt: 

                        TYPE EURO9.DOC > PRN 

	Then press <Enter>.


				WINDOWS

	If you want to run the programs under Windows, do the following:

	1.)  Enter Windows.
	2.)  From Program Manager, open the File Menu.
	3.)  Choose "New". You will then see a box called "New Program
	     Object".
	4.)  Choose "Program Group". Click "OK".
	5.)  Next you will see a box called "Program Group Properties". 
	     In the "Description" box type <Languages>. Click "OK". Don't
	     worry about the "Group File" box; leave it blank.
	6.)  You will now see that you have a group called "Languages."
	7.)  Open the File Menu again. Choose "New" again. The "New 
	     Program Object" box will appear again.
	8.)  Choose "Program Item". Click "OK".
	9.)  The "Program Item Properties" box will appear. In the
	     "Description" box type <EURO9>. Press the <Tab> key.
	10.) In the "Command Line" box type <C:\EURO9\EURO9.exe>. 
	     (If you are using a different drive or directory, then make
	     the appropriate substitutions.) Press the <Tab> key again.
	11.) In the "Working Directory" box type <C:\EURO9> (or other
	     appropriate directory.) Click "OK".
	12.) You should see a DOS icon with the word "EURO9" underneath.
	     Double click it to run the EURO9 program.

                                SHAREWARE

	These programs are not free. They are shareware. This means
	that you may try them out before you decide whether or not 
	to buy them. After you have tried them out for one or two 
	weeks, if you intend to keep using them you must register

	You can use the registration form, but it's not required.

	When you register you will be put on my list for notice about
	new versions, new programs, etc.

	You may give the programs to as many people as you wish. When
	you do so, you must transfer all the files on the disk. Each
	user must send in $12.00 unless they are members of the same
	household or family as someone who has registered.

	You may not sell the program, but you may distribute it as
	shareware, making a small charge for the disk and mailing. You
        may not use the programs for any commercial purpose without
        my written permission.

	If the programs are going to be used by a school, business or
	other entity, please contact me to negotiate a license fee.

	I receive no other income from my programming. Equipment costs,
	supplies, mailings and BBS upload time are all paid out of
	my pocket. Therefore, if you use and enjoy the programs, please
	SEND THE REGISTRATION FEE. And remember, if you don't register
	I will find you in the middle of the night when you are sleeping. 


				THE PROGRAMS

	With these programs you can use your computer to study vocabulary 
  	words, idioms and sentences from any textbook, study guide, 
  	story, newspaper or article. If you are studying from a textbook 
  	you can make a separate file for each chapter. You can enter all 
 	of the different verb forms, regular and irregular. You can enter 
  	idioms and other expressions.

	You can run the programs from a floppy disk or copy them to a 
  	hard disk if you have one. The files created by the Utility program 
  	and used by the Learner program must be in the same directory or on 
  	the same floppy disk as the Utility and Learner programs. These 
  	files have a ".DAT" extension in their name. If your floppy gets 
  	full you can either delete files or copy the program files to a 
	new floppy and continue to make new data files. 

  	Under normal circumstances, you will use the Utility program before 
  	you use the Learner program. However, everyone is usually 
  	interested in seeing how the Learner program works first, so I 
  	have included vocabulary files made so that you can immediately 
	see how the Learner program works if you want to.                                                   

  	For the following instructions, type the word or symbol between 
  	the "< >" marks, but not the "< >" symbols.                    

  	If you have only a floppy drive, insert the disk into it. At 
  	the prompt, follow the instructions below.

  	If you have a hard drive you should use it for these programs as 
  	they load much faster from a hard drive. Insert the disk into the
  	floppy disk drive. At the DOS prompt type <MD\RUSSIAN>. Then 
  	type <CD\RUSSIAN>. Then type <COPY [disk drive letter]:*.*>. 
  	You are now ready to follow the instructions below.


				  RUNME

	If you haven't discovered it already, RUNME is a shell from which
	you can run  the programs, as well as do other necessary 
	chores. Just type <RUNME> and press <Enter>.


                            THE UTILITY PROGRAM

  	The Utility program is the program with which you create, change, 
	edit and look at files of the words and phrases on which you will 
	test yourself. The program is very straightforward. Start the program 
  	by choosing option <3> from the RUNME menu or by typing <RUSSUTIL> 
	at the DOS prompt. You will see the title page. Press <Enter> 
	for the main menu.

  	Select one of the choices. (Choice <4> is easiest.) You will 
	then be asked for a file number. No matter which choice you 
	selected you can call up a directory of the Russian vocabulary 
	files by pressing <F1>. They all have a "RUSS" prefix and a 
	"DAT" suffix, but you only have to type in the number, which
	can be from 1 to 999. If you choose to create a file, using 
	option <1>, the program will check if a file exists with the 
	number of the file you have chosen to create. If so, you will 
	be given the option of overwriting the existing file or choosing 
	another number for your new file. If you choose creating or 
	adding to an existing file you will be asked to type in an 
	English word or expression. Do so and press <Enter>. You will 
	then be asked for the Russian word or expression. 

  	The bottom of the screen will tell you which function keys to 
  	press to print the characters which are not on the keyboard. 
  	After typing the Russian word or expression press <Enter> again. 
  	You will be asked to confirm your entry. When you are finished
  	with the file press <Esc>.

  	If you choose to edit a file, the program will show you the 
  	current entries one by one. The bottom of the screen tells you 
  	what to do.

  	You can enter phrases up to 32 characters long. This means that 
  	you can also include multiple meanings of a word by separating 
  	them with a semicolon.
       
	The file display option prompts you to press <Enter> if there 
	is more than one page of words and expressions in a file.

  	Pressing <Esc> one or two times always takes you to the main 
  	menu.


                           THE LEARNER PROGRAM           

  	Start the program by choosing option <4> from the RUNME menu
	or by typing <RUSSTEST> at the prompt sign. You will see a 
	title page. Press <Enter> for the main menu. 

  	You will see four choices on the screen and will choose choice <1>. 
  	After you select choice 1 you will be asked which files you want 
  	to be tested on. First type in the smallest file number you want 
  	and press <Enter>. You will then be asked for the ending file 
  	number. If you want to be tested on only one file then type in 
  	the same number. If you want to do two or more consecutively 
  	numbered files then type in the last numbered file you want. You 
  	can only do more than one file at a time if the files are 
  	consecutively numbered. In any event, press <Enter>.

  	You can do up to 200 words at a time, but I recommend you do
	one file at a time.

  	By this time you will have learned that somewhere on the screen, 
  	in the middle of the screen or on the bottom, you are told what 
  	you can do next.

  	The next menu lets you select two different types of tests, 
  	multiple choice or fill in. Multiple choice lets you get 
  	acquainted with the vocabulary. Fill in really tests your 
  	knowledge of the vocabulary.

  	The next menu lets you select the direction of the translation 
  	test. Your choices are obvious.

  	Taking the test is also obvious. If you have chosen the multiple 
  	choice test then press the number of the answer you select. For a 
  	fill in test, type your answer and press <Enter>. When you have 
  	to fill in an answer in Russian, the bottom of the screen will tell
  	you which keys to press to print the characters that are
  	not on the keyboard. The template at the bottom of the screen refers
	to the function keys and to the symbol and number keys just below
	them. Don't worry. You will quickly learn where the Russian letters
	are.

  	Pressing <Esc> always takes you to the next previous menu. You 
  	can change the type of test or the direction of translation at 
  	any time. While you can switch back and forth, the program will 
  	test you on all words and phrases in both directions. When you 
  	are finished with all the vocabulary in one direction the program 
  	will change to the other direction, having  told you about this 
  	change at the bottom of your screen.

  	After you have finished the test, the program will take you back 
  	to the main menu. You can select another file for testing, look 
	at your results, or retest yourself on wrong answers. Unless you
	have a perfect score, press <2> to see your results. 

  	Either before or after you look at the results you can retest
  	yourself. Of course, the retest option only tests you on the 
  	words and phrases that you missed. Other than that the retest 
  	option works just like the test option.

  	If you want to print out these instructions, select option <2> 
	from the RUNME menu or type the following at the DOS prompt: 

                        TYPE RUSSIAN.DOC > PRN 

	Then press <Enter>.


				WINDOWS

	If you want to run the programs under Windows, do the following:

	1.)  Enter Windows.
	2.)  From Program Manager, open the File Menu.
	3.)  Choose "New". You will then see a box called "New Program
	     Object".
	4.)  Choose "Program Group". Click "OK".
	5.)  Next you will see a box called "Program Group Properties". 
	     In the "Description" box type <Languages>. Click "OK". Don't
	     worry about the "Group File" box; leave it blank.
	6.)  You will now see that you have a group called "Languages."
	7.)  Open the File Menu again. Choose "New" again. The "New 
	     Program Object" box will appear again.
	8.)  Choose "Program Item". Click "OK".
	9.)  The "Program Item Properties" box will appear. In the
	     "Description" box type <Russian Utility>. Press the <Tab> key.
	10.) In the "Command Line" box type <C:\Russian\Russutil.exe>. 
	     (If you are using a different drive or directory, then make
	     the appropriate substitutions.) Press the <Tab> key again.
	11.) In the "Working Directory" box type <C:\Russian> (or other
	     appropriate directory.) Click "OK".
	12.) Now repeat steps 7 through 11. But in the description box
	     type <Russian Learner>  and on the command line type
	     <C:\Russian\Russtest.exe>.
	12.) You should see DOS icons with the words "Russian Utility"
	     and "Russian Learner"  underneath.
	13.) Double click the icons to run the programs.
