               listed in the PACKING.LST text file, or the PACKING.LST file

               distribution is forbidden. Please contact us to obtain a
               complete package suitable for distribution.

               The BIBLOGIC package - including all related program files

          REGISTRATION PROCEDURE:

               BIBLOGIC is a "shareware program" and is provided at no
               charge to the user for evaluation. Feel free to share it
               with your friends, but please do not give it away altered or
               as part of another system. The essence of "user-supported"
               software is to provide personal computer users with quality
               software without high prices, and yet provide incentive for
               programmers to continue to develop new products. If you find
               this program useful and find that you are using BIBLOGIC and
               continue to use BIBLOGIC after a reasonable trial period,
               you must make a registration payment of US$47.00 to Biblogic
               Computer Services at:

                            Biblogic Computer Services

                            CA 91358-0424
                            U.S.A.

               Please make check or money order payable to "Biblogic
               Computer Services". RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA MUST ADD SALES
               TAX. Checks should be in US dollars and drawn on a US bank.

               Special note: We can now accept checks (or cheques!) in
               Pounds Sterling drawn on a UK bank or Australian Dollars
               drawn on an Australian bank. Please use prevailing exchange
               rates to calculate the correct equivalent of US$47.00.







               The $47.00 registration fee will license one copy for use on
               any one computer at any one time. You must treat this
               software just like a book. Specifically, this software may
               be used by any number of people and may be freely moved from
               one computer location to another, so long as there is no
               possibility of it being used at one location while it's
               being used at another. Just as a book cannot be read by two
               different persons at the same time.

               You are encouraged to pass a copy of BIBLOGIC along to your
               friends for evaluation. Please encourage them to register
               their copy if they find that they can use it.

               Registered users receive the right to support via fax or
               mail. They are also eligible to receive low-cost updates and
               are able to disable the registration reminder screen which
               is displayed when the program is run.

          README.DOC

               This file contains details of the latest changes to the
               program, that were made since the instruction manual was
               last revised.

               It also contains instructions on installing BIBLOGIC.




          VERSION 3.01

               BIBLOGIC is distributed in two forms:

               1)   DISTRIBUTION DISKS. The program package is supplied on
                    two 360k floppy disks. An installation program is
                    supplied to simplify decompression and installation on
                    a hard disk. Follow the instructions below.

               2)   BULLETIN BOARD FILES. The program is supplied in the
                    form of two compressed files. Together, these files
                    contain all of the files on the distribution disks
                    except the installation program, which is not required.
                    Follow the instructions below.




          QUICK START INSTRUCTIONS - DISTRIBUTION DISKS

               To install BIBLOGIC from distribution disks into
               C:\BIBLOGIC, put the first distribution disk in drive a: and
               type:

                                   A:INSTALL

               then press <Enter>. Follow the on-screen instructions. When
               prompted, insert the second disk.

               It is recommended that you run the demo program included in
               the distribution package. The installation program gives
               instructions.







          QUICK START INSTRUCTIONS - BULLETIN BOARD FILES

               To install BIBLOGIC from BBS files, do the following:

               1)   Create a directory on your hard disk called "BIBLOGIC".

                    NOTE: It is possible, but not as straightforward, to
                    install BIBLOGIC in a subdirectory with a name other
                    than "BIBLOGIC". To run BIBLOGIC successfully, you will
                    need to read the appendices in the manual.

               2)   Decompress both of the distribution files into the
                    BIBLOGIC directory.

               3)   Check that the CONFIG.SYS file on your boot drive has
                    at least FILES=20 and BUFFERS=15. Reboot your system if
                    you change CONFIG.SYS.

               It is recommended that you run the demo program included in
               the distribution package. After uncompressing the files, go
               to the BIBLOGIC directory and type DEMO<Enter>.




          UPDATING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION OF BIBLOGIC

               If you are updating from a previous version, you need only
               the following files:

               DEMO.BAT
               BIBLOGIC.DBD
               *.EXE
               *.OVL
               Any new .PFF files you wish to use.

               The easiest way to update the system is to install the new
               system in a temporary directory (other than where the old
               system is installed) and then copy over the files you need.

               It is strongly recommended that you make a complete backup
               of your existing BIBLOGIC installation before attempting to
               update to the latest version.

               It is recommended that you run the demo program included in
               the distribution package. After updating, go to the new
               BIBLOGIC directory and type DEMO<Enter>.







          MANUALS

               MANUAL.DOC contains the BIBLOGIC instruction manual.
               SUPPL.DOC contains a supplement to the manual.
               README.DOC is this file.

               All of these files are in raw ASCII form and may be printed
               on any ASCII printer with 80 or more columns and 66 or more
               lines per page. The files contain form-feed characters
               between pages and use back-space characters for underlining
               and bold.

               To print these files, copy them directly to your ASCII
               printer or use the DOS print utility. For example:

               COPY *.DOC LPT1:
               or
               PRINT *.DOC

                    with the package".








               The BIBLOGIC package is defined as containing all the
               material listed in the PACKING.LST text file. If any files
               listed in the PACKING.LST text file, or the PACKING.LST file
               itself, are missing, then the package is not complete and
               distribution is forbidden. Please contact us to obtain a
               complete package suitable for distribution.

               The BIBLOGIC package (including all related program files,
               documentation files, and demonstration files) CANNOT be
               modified in any way other than as described in the following
               paragraph. The BIBLOGIC package must be distributed as a
               complete package, other than as described in the following
               paragraph. The PACKING.LST text file contains a list of all
               files that are part of the BIBLOGIC package.

               Small additions to the package, such as the introductory or
               installation batch files used by many shareware disk
               vendors, are acceptable. The addition of a small text file
               to each compressed file or a short message which will
               display when the file is decompressed is also acceptable.
               These methods of promoting your BBS or services may only be
               used provided that the program and documentation is
               otherwise unmodified and complete. For BBS distribution, the
               part of the package (as described in the PACKING.LST file)
               containing the demonstration program may be posted for
               downloading without the remainder of the package, providing
               that the recipient is given equal access to the remainder of
               the package.

               No price or other compensation may be charged for the
               BIBLOGIC package. A distribution fee may be charged for the
               cost of the diskette, shipping and handling. Such charges
               must not exceed a total of US$18.00 in the U.S. and Canada,
               or US$25.00 internationally.

          DISK SETS & CD-ROMs:

               The BIBLOGIC package CANNOT be sold as part of some other
               inclusive package. Nor can it be included in any commercial
               software packaging offer, without prior written agreement
               from Stephen Champion, Biblogic Computer Services.

               ASP Approved Vendors who wish to distribute the BIBLOGIC
               package as part of a collection or a CD-ROM package may do
               so provided that all the other restrictions are met.

               Vendors (non-ASP Vendor Members) who wish to distribute the
               BIBLOGIC package as part of a collection or a CD-ROM package
               must obtain authorization from Stephen Champion, Biblogic
               Computer Services PRIOR TO COMMENCEMENT OF DISTRIBUTION.

               research/writing tool which allows the user to store,
               retrieve and print bibliographic information and associated
               remarks. The program can generate selected reference lists
               in many styles to satisfy the requirements of different
               publishing bodies. It also allows users to organize their
               own notes on references. The comments on a particular
               concept may then be selectively combined into a single
               document for further word-processing. BIBLOGIC is compatible
               with most word-processors. Hardware: IBM-PC running DOS 2.11
               or better, 640k memory, Hard Disk. Cost of registration:

          LONG DESCRIPTION:

               The BIBLOGIC bibliographic database program is a
               research/writing tool which allows the user to store,
               retrieve and print bibliographic information and associated
               remarks. The program can generate selected reference lists

               with most word-processors.

               The program was initially written to meet the needs of PhD
               candidates who found that existing programs fell short of
               their requirements. Since the first version of this program
               was released, it has been refined to incorporate many
               suggestions from its users. The program is currently being
               used in universities, hospitals and government departments,
               by researchers in a wide range of disciplines.

               Hardware: IBM-PC running DOS 2.11 or better, 640k memory,
               Hard Disk.
