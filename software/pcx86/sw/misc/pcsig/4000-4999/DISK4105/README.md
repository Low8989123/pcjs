The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We
recommend a 386 with a VGA monitor.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

INTRODUCTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------
      vgaRender is an 'object-oriented' illustration program
for 'desktop publishing' and/or creation of VGA bitmap artwork.
'Object-oriented' drawing programs differ from 'bitmap paint'
programs in that output to hardcopy devices is not at fixed resolution,
but prints at the hardcopy device's FINEST resolution. Object-oriented
drawing programs also possess a strong advantage in that every
component of an illustration is entirely REUSABLE. Any object
in an illustration can be copied and inserted into a new illustration,
where it can be enlarged or reduced without any loss of resolution
or image quality.
      vgaRender lets you trace perfect lines and curves using
a background bitmap image as a template, or draw your own designs
freehand. Text may also be added with PostScript Type 1 fonts.
As an illustration progresses it is easy to experiment and try
new colors for objects, and to also stretch, clone, rotate, and
layer parts of an illustration. 
      Finished illustrations can be accurately previewed on your
VGA monitor and then outputted to your own hardcopy devices.
Ilustrations can also be SAVED on DISK and outputted at local
'desktop publishing service bureaus' where LaserWriters and
PostScript typesetting machines give professional high resolution
results, suitable for press.
      These are some of the OUTPUT options with vgaRender:
	 * prints from LaserWriters using PostScript page
	      description language
         * black and white halftone negatives from PostScript
	      typesetting machines
	 * negatives from typesetting machines for 4-color
	      process printing
	 * spotcolor separations from typesetting machines
	      for silkscreen printing
	 * Encapsulated PostScript files(EPS) for insertion
	      to other PostScript documents
         * Canon Color Laser prints from PostScript color copiers
	 * black and white proofs from Epson compatible dot matrix
	      printers
         * a bitmap image file(.pcx) for display or insertion
	      to other graphics programs



HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    vgaRender runs on any PC compatible system with at least
512 kilobytes of memory and a standard VGA display card running
MS DOS/PC DOS 2.0 or higher. A hard drive is strongly recommended,
especially if you plan to trace off bitmap images.
    You will also need a Microsoft compatible mouse. Have
your 'mouse DRIVER' loaded before you run this software. The
'mouse driver' is usually installed by running MOUSE.COM
(usually located in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, but can also be
run from the DOS prompt). The 'mouse driver' may also be
installed by having MOUSE.SYS in your CONFIG.SYS file(usually:
'device=c:\mouse\mouse.sys' ). If when you try to run vREND.exe
you get the mouse error message, get the manual for your
'Microsoft compatible mouse' and find how to install the mouse
(many times just typing 'MOUSE <enter>' will run MOUSE.COM and
install the mouse).
    You should have received the following files:
	README       -  Tells how to install vgaRender.
	vREND.EXE    -  The illustration program itself.
	vRENDER.DOC  -  The disk manual.
	SAMPLE1.RDR  -  Sample 'spot color' illustration file for silkscreen.
	SAMPLE2.RDR  -  Sample 'grayscale' illustration file.
	SAMPLE3.RDR  -  Sample illustration file for .pcx output.
	TITR____.PFB -  PostScript font file "TimeToRoam"(similar
				  a well known industry standard).


    It is highly recommended that you PRINT OUT this DOCUMENT
so you can refer to it while learning how to run vgaRend. First
step through the TUTORIAL to get a hands on feel for the basics
of the program. If you feel a little lost by some of the new
terminology, don't hesitate to refer to the GLOSSARY of TERMS
in this document. New terms are surrounded in single quotes
(ex: 'new term'). After the tutorial you should go through the
TOOLBAR SUMMARY and MENU SUMMARY, trying each command as you
read. When you register for the program you will receive a
printed manual that is more thorough. vgaRender is a powerful
TOOL, not a toy. Therefore it demands a small amount of study
to release it's power.

QUICK TUTORIAL
---------------------------------------------------------------------
     To see a vgaRender illustration, first start up the program
by typing "vRend" at the DOS prompt. Use your mouse to open
the 'FILE' menu and select 'LOAD' (and 'ILLUSTRATION'  from the
submenu). In the 'Load Illustration' dialog box, TYPE in the file
name "sample1.rdr" into the 'File' input box, and then left mouse
click on the 'LOAD' box. You may edit any text in a 'INPUT BOX'
by first clicking on the 'input box' with the left mouse button and
use the 'cursor' keys(arrows) along with 'delete', 'backspace' and
of course alphanumeric keys.
     Either window may be ACTIVATED by a mouse button click in
the window's area. Once 'activated' a window displays a 'black bar'
at its upper border and can respond to menu commands. 'Activate'
the other window and go to the 'WINDOW' menu to select 'WinCommands',
and 'ReRender' from it's submenu. See how the illustration is
rendered from many individual PATHS(a single shape's outline).
One window is a 'DRAW' window that shows 'path' OUTLINES(and
can also hold bitmap images). The other window is a 'FINAL'
window and shows the FINISHED illustration with its FILLED and
STROKED paths. The faster rendering 'Draw' window is where you
will build and edit paths. The slower rendering 'Final' window
is where the illustration is occasionally re-rendered to check
fill colors, stroking, and object layering.  
      Now go to the TOOLBAR, and click on the ZOOM Tool(the third
tool and looks like a magnifying glass). Click in the active
window with the LEFT mouse button to zoom-UP, and use the RIGHT
mouse button to zoom-DOWN. Try zooming in each window. You can
zoom-up in three magnifications, or zoom-down in three reductions.
If you loose the image from the window area you can select the
menu command 'Window>WinCommands>FitInWindow' to recover your
position.
      Go back to the 'toolbar' and click on the ARROW Tool(the
first tool that looks like an arrow). Activate the 'Draw window'
(the one with line drawing), and with the arrow, point to and LEFT
mouse click in the MIDDLE of any line segment. See how the path's
points are highlighted with hollow little squares, circles, and
triangles. A path is said to be 'SHOWN'(important term) when
its little cube and circle CUES are HOLLOW.  Move the cursor
arrow's pointer inside a point's square, HOLD DOWN the left mouse
button, and with the mouse drag the point's square an inch or
so. See how the path's shape is changed by the mouse's 'CLICK
and DRAG' on any of the path's various points. Go to the toolbar
and LEFT mouse click on the little box labeled 'Rd'('Render').
This re-renders your 'shape change' in the 'Final' window.
RIGHT mouse clicking on the 'Rd' box will re-render any 'Draw'
windows. Now 'Click and Drag' on any curve's TRIANGLE's to change
the shape of the curve.
      Next we will TRANSFORM some of the paths. First 'activate'
the Draw window and go to the toolbar and click on the ARROW
Tool. Go back to the Draw window and point the cursor arrow
to the MIDDLE of a paths line segment(NOT a point). Now CLICK
with the mouse's RIGHT button in the MIDDLE of a line segment.
See how the path's segment points are highlighted with little
SOLID CUBES. The SOLID cube cues mean that the path has been
'SELECTED'(remember this term), and can now receive 'Transforms'
and many other menu commands.(To 'UN-select' a shape,  mouse
click on any empty spot within the active window.) While the
path is 'selected' go to the MODIFY menu and pick TRANSFORM and
MOVE from the submenu. A box forms about the path, and you should
LEFT mouse click once in the box to free the path. The path now
'moves' with the cursor. Place the path it where you like and hit
LEFT mouse again to freeze the new position(hitting the SPACEBAR
is the same as a LEFT mouse CLICK). Now try another 'Transforms'
command like 'Scale'. Again 'SELECT' a path, and get 'Transforms>
Scale' from the Modify menu. Click once near one of the box's
corners to start the sizing, move the mouse outward to expand the
shape, and then click again to hold your change. The other
transform commands are explained in detail in the 'MENU SUMMARY'
section of this document.
      By 'SELECTING' you can also change the 'fill' color of
any path(s). First 'activate' the Final window. Select any
path(highlight with SOLID cubes), and go to the toolbar palette
and pick a new color. FILL colors are picked by LEFT clicking
on the little color squares at the bottom of the toolbar. Your
'fill color' choice should show in the larger toolbar rectangle
at the right (STROKE colors are picked by RIGHT mouse clicking).
Now that you have SELECTED a path and have chosen a new fill
color, go to the toolbar and LEFT click on the box labeled
'Cl'(Color). In the Final window you can see your path change
color(a RIGHT click on 'Cl' will cause the path's STROKE to change
to the 'current stroke color' and 'line-weight'). The 'Cl' is a
SHORTCUT command to quickly preview a path's color, and IGNORES
the layering of paths. To see the FINAL LAYERING of the
illustration, click on the toolbar's 'Rd'(Render) button.
      Next we will show how to LAYER paths on top of each other,
and how to COPY and PASTE paths.  First get the 'Arrow Tool'
from the toolbar, go to the 'Draw' window and 'select' any path.
Go to the 'Modify' menu and do 'ToStorage' and 'Cut' from the
submenu. The path's outline disappears. Now 'select' a neighboring
path that intersects the path that you cut. Go to the 'Modify'
menu and do 'Paste' and either 'in Front of' or 'in Back of' from
the submenu. Now 'left click' on the toolbar's 'Rd' box. See how the
path that you cut can be LAYERED directly 'in front', or 'in back'
of the SECOND path selected.
      Finally we will show how to draw a NEW path using straight
and curved segments. If you want your new path to be FILLED and/or
STROKED, make sure the 'AutoFillInsert'(or AutoStrokeInsert)
button is 'CHECKED' in the 'FillDialog' box (or respectively
StrokeDialog box). You can open either of the 'StrokeDialog' or
'FillDialog' boxes from the OPTIONS menu. Make sure the
'Auto___Insert' and current fill/stroke color is set BEFORE you
place the FIRST POINT. First 'Activate' the 'Draw' window. Go to
the 'File' menu and select 'New', and 'continue' from the dialog box.
This erases the current illustration and lets you start a new one.
See how the mouse cursor has changed to the PLOT TOOL(a cross), but
a little hollow cube is upon the Plot Tool's cross. This means you
are about to place the FIRST point in a NEW PATH. Go to the 'Draw
window' and left mouse button click once.  This is your first point
in the path. Now LEFT CLICK again. This draws a STRAIGHT  segment,
starting from the first point, to the new point you created with
the second click. Now RIGHT click. You have drawn a CURVED segment.
A curved segment has two little hollow TRIANGLE cues(DIRECTION
POINTS) when the path is 'SHOWN'. Now go the tool box and get
the 'Arrow Tool' and LEFT CLICK and DRAG inside one of the curve's
DIRECTION points(triangles). See how you can adjust the shape
of a curve with the 'direction points'. To start a NEW path,
go back to the toolbar and AGAIN click on the PLOT Tool. When
the Plot Tool's cursor has a little cube upon it, then you are
STARTING a new path. If it has NO CUBE, the you are continuing
drawing on the 'current path'. If you want to continue drawing
on another path, first get the 'Arrow Tool' from the toolbar.
Now RIGHT mouse click on the furthest end of the path. See how
just ONE SOLID CUBE forms on the path(this is called 'selecting
a POINT', as opposed to 'selecting a PATH'). Now go back to the
toolbar and pick the Plot Tool. Inside the active window click
left and right,as you choose, to continue drawing from the 'POINT
SELECTED'. Do NOT allow a path to CROSS over ITSELF (like a figure
eight, "8"), or the output will not match the screen. If you
wish to ADD or DELETE segments, or toggle from straight to curve
segments, use the Knife Tool(see MENU SUMMARY below). 
      The toolbar also has an 'Oval Tool' and 'Rectangle Tool'
for geometric forms(see TOOLBAR SUMMARY below). This how the
PRIMARY SHAPES(paths) of an illustration are built with vgaRender.
Then you will LAYER and adjust these shapes while occasionally
previewing the final result in the 'Final' window.


 
TOOLBAR SUMMARY
---------------------------------------------------------------------
     1) ARROW Tool:   Position the mouse cursor's arrow point
on the desired path, and click with the LEFT mouse button to
'SHOW' the path, highlighting path's points with HOLLOW 'cues'(little
cubes, circles, and triangles). Clicking with the RIGHT mouse
button will 'SELECT' the path, but now highlighting path's points
with SOLID 'cues'.
    When a path is 'SHOWN', it's hollow CUBE points may be repositioned
by LEFT mouse button 'CLICK and DRAG'(HOLDING DOWN left mouse
button while moving the mouse) upon the point's 'cue'. When a
CURVE SEGMENT is 'shown', it has little triangles(DIRECTION POINTS)
attached to levers. By 'click and dragging' the DIRECTION POINTS,
the curve's shape is changed.
    When a path is 'SELECTED' (it's points now have SOLID cube
cues), it can respond to MODIFY MENU commands like 'Transforms',
'ToStorage'(Cut and Copy), and 'Paste'. Left mouse clicking on
an empty area will UN-SELECT any paths.

     2) PUSHPIN Tool:   The Pushpin Tool does the job of scrolling
the picture within the window. Click once with the left mouse
button to grab a handle on the picture, and now click a SECOND
time in a NEW window POSITION to show where to SHIFT the illustration's
position to.

     3) ZOOM Tool(looks like a magnifying glass):    Click with
the LEFT mouse button upon the part of the illustration that
you want magnified. This will ENLARGE the view of the picture.
Clicking with the RIGHT mouse button will SHRINK the picture.

     4) PLOT Tool(looks like a cross):    Use only on DRAW windows.
Clicking with the LEFT mouse button adds a STRAIGHT segment to
a path. Clicking with the RIGHT mouse button adds a CURVED segment
to a path. To END a path and then start a NEW path, go back to
the toolbar and AGAIN left click on the PLOT tool. The mouse
cursor will now have a little HOLLOW CUBE on it's cross... this
means you are about to "plot the FIRST point in a NEW path".
If you want your path to be 'filled' and/or 'stroked', make sure
you have FIRST set the 'AutoFillInsert' or 'AutoStrokeInsert'
switches in FillDialog or StrokeDialog boxes BEFORE you plot
your first point of the path. You can access the 'FillDialog'
box or 'StrokeDialog' box from the OPTIONS MENU. Also set your
palette FILL and/or STROKE colors BEFORE plotting the first
point. Never attempt to build a path with NEITHER the
'AutoFillInsert' NOR the 'AutoStrokeInsert' checked.

     5) KNIFE Tool:     Use only on DRAW windows. The knife tool
holds many miscellaneous functions that operate on a path that
has been 'SHOWN'(it's points have HOLLOW cubes, from the Arrow
Tool left click). Clicking LEFT mouse on a POINT's cube will
DELETE the point. Clicking LEFT mouse on the MIDDLE of a segment
will ADD a NEW point. Clicking RIGHT mouse in the MIDDLE of a
segment will toggle the segment from a curve to a straight, or
vice-versa from a straight to a curve. Clicking RIGHT mouse on
an POINT will toggle the point to either a 'SHARP point'(has
a CUBE cue) or to a 'SMOOTH point'(has a CIRCLE cue). SMOOTH
points force connecting CURVES to 'smoothly' join to either straight
or curve segments. SHARP points can let paths have 'sharp turns'
between curves and straight segments, or straight and straight
segments. Also if the Knife Tool is LEFT mouse clicked on an
UN-SHOWN path, it will SHOW the path's HOLLOW CUBE points for
it's commands.
     
     6) OVAL Tool:     Use only on DRAW windows. Once the tool
is selected, 'LEFT CLICK and DRAG'(hold left button down while
sliding mouse), and a FILLED and/or STROKED oval will be drawn
after the button is released. Holding down the left ALT key while
moving the mouse will cause a perfect circle to be drawn.

     7) RECTANGLE Tool:     Use only on DRAW windows. 'LEFT CLICK
and DRAG', and a FILLED and/or STROKED rectangle will be drawn
after the button is released. Holding down the left ALT key while
moving the mouse will cause a perfect square to be drawn.

     8) TEXT Tool(looks like a capital "I" ):     Use only on
DRAW windows. Click with the LEFT mouse button on the spot where
you wish to add a line of text. After you click a 'dialog box'
will appear and you may specify the PostScript font '.PFB' file
you wish to use(there exist many shareware PostScript font files,
as well as commercial ones). Clicking on 'FindFontName' will let
you know if your '.PFB' font file exists where you say it is, and
what it's font NAME is. Then click on Size or Text 'INPUT BOXES'
to enter the text size and your line of text. Use 'cursor'(arrow),
'backspace', and 'delete' keys to edit any of the dialog box's
'INPUT BOXES'.

     
   ** COLOR PALETTE selection:    LEFT mouse clicking on any
of the little COLOR SQUARES at the toolbar bottom will change the
current 'FILL' color (and color the larger color swatch rectangle
at the right). RIGHT clicking on any of the color squares will
set the current STROKE color (and color the SMALLER color swatch
rectangle UNDER the 'fill color rectangle').

   ** FOUR COMMAND BUTTONS( at Toolbar right ):
	 Rd('Render'):   LEFT mouse click will re-render any FINAL
	   windows. RIGHT clicking will re-render any DRAW windows.
  
	 Cl('Color'):    First 'SELECT' a path on either a FINAL
	   or DRAW window. Clicking LEFT mouse button will re-color
	   the FILL of the path to the 'current fill color'. Clicking
	   on the RIGHT button will change the path's STROKE
           characteristics (change stroke color, line weight, line join,
	   line cap). The change can be viewed on a 'Final' window.

	 Mt('Match'):    First LEFT click on 'Mt' button, then
	   LEFT click on any colored area on the display. This will
	   set the 'current FILL color' to that color. If you first
	   RIGHT click on 'Mt' button and then RIGHT click on any
	   color, this will set the 'current STROKE color'.

	 Ud('Undo'):     NOT IMPLEMENTED yet( in future release this
	   will undo the last command's affect).



MENU SUMMARY
---------------------------------------------------------------------
     'FILE'  MENU
	  1) 'About' : Displays registration and legal notice.
	  2) 'New'   : Erases current illustration and starts
			 a new illustration.
	  3) 'Open'  : Erases current submenu type, and LOADS
			 a new file from disk.
		  a) 'Illustration':    The working description
of your current illustration and page size. Note that only '.RDR'
files(those used for 'Illustration' and 'Storage') may be RELOADED,
not PostScript files.
		  b) 'Storage':  The illustration OBJECT you
cut or copied with the 'ToStorage' command. This is also has
a '.RDR' extension.
		  c) 'Bitmap':  A  '.PCX'  bitmap image to show
in a 'DRAW window' as a template to trace by.
	  4) 'Save' : Saves the following submenu types to disk.
		  a) 'Illustration':    Always save your current
illustration with this command so it may be later RELOADED.
		  b) 'Storage':  Saves your last 'Cut' or 'Copy'
				 'Storage' object to disk(.RDR file).
		  c) 'Window' :  Saves 'active window' as a .PCX
				 bitmap file.
		  d) 'FullDisplay':   Re-renders entire image
on full display and saves as a 640x480 sixteen color .PCX bitmap
file.
	  5) 'BitmapConvert' :  Converts a black and white .TIFF
bitmap file to a FAST loading .PCX file for 'File>Open>Bitmap'
menu command.
	  6) 'Output' : Saves current illustration as a PostScript
disk file. This will give high resolution hardcopy when printed on
a LaserWriter or typesetter(PostScript files can NOT be reloaded).
When you execute the Output command on the File menu, you will
get the 'Output Options' dialog box. On the dialog box check your
page size. The 'FEED' options are important. For Laserwriters
that hold TRAYS of cut paper, select the 'Tray' feed. Typesetting
machines and ImageSetters use internal ROLLS of paper, so select
'Roll' for the feed option. If you have difficulties, try the
'Default' feed option.
		  a) 'Gray PScript' : When in 'Grayscale BuildMode'
this gives a halftone image from PostScript black and white
PostScript printers.
		  b) 'Color PScript' : When in 'SpotColor BuildMode'
this gives a color print from color PostScript printers and laser
copiers.
                  c) 'ProcessSeps' : When in 'SpotColor BuildMode'
the color illustration is saved as 4 process color halftone
separations(yellow, magenta, cyan, black) for 4-color printing.
		  d) 'SpotSeps' : Used mainly for silkscreen
printing. When in 'SpotColor BuildMode' the color illustration
is saved in as many separations('plates' for target colors) as
colors that were used in the illustration. The separations use
SOLID BLACK for the separation's target color, not halftone grays.
		  e) 'EPS' : This is an Encapsulated PostScript
file that may be inserted into another PostScript document, via
another desktop publishing program.
	  7) 'Print' : Opens the Print 'dialog box' and
lets you pick the parallel port and the printer driver you desire
to print the current illustration. Optionally you can make a disk
file by selecting 'prtfile.lpt'.
	  8) 'Quit'  : Stops the program and returns to DOS.

     'OPTIONS'  MENU
	  1) 'FillDialog'  : Opens the Fill 'dialog box'
which allows the insertion of fills to paths in creating
PAINTED shapes. 'AutoFillInsert' must be checked for NEW paths
to receive fills. In 'Grayscale BuildMode', the dialog box also
allows the insertion of GRADIENT fills to currently SELECTED
paths. A gradient fill is BLEND of two colors(the current 'Fill'
color and the current 'Stroke' color).
	  2) 'StrokeDialog'  : Opens the Stroke dialog box
and set the stroke characteristics for further created paths.
'AutoStrokeInsert' must be checked for NEW paths to receive strokes.
	  3) 'Restrict'   : Restricts the mouse cursor to invisible
grid locations, or holds the cursor to the same horizontal
or vertical value as the previous point. You must hold down the
'ALT' key while moving the mouse to TRIGGER the restriction .
		  a) 'SetValues' :  Open the 'Restrict' dialog
box and set values. 'GridSnap Distance' will also tell the CURSOR
(arrow) KEYS how far to move the mouse cursor on a ARROW KEY press.
		  b) 'XYAxis'    :  Holds cursor it to the
same horizontal-vertical value as the LAST created point, or
the last SELECTED point( 'select' a point with the RIGHT mouse
button click over the point's hollow cube cue).
		  c) 'GridSnap'  :   Set it's value in Restrict
dialog box, and force the cursor to the blocks of an 'invisible
piece of graph paper'.
	  4) 'ToolBar' :
		  a) 'ChngPaltColor'  : Opens the 'Change Palette
Color's RGB' dialog box. In SpotColor buildmode, the current
color can have it's hue and darkness changed. 'Click and Drag'
on the slider's white button to change the color's RGB value.
Your new CUSTOM palette is saved with the current illustration,
for whatever palette colors you used in the illustration.
		  b) 'ShowCoords'  :  Setting this causes the
current mouse cursor's PAGE position to be displayed in 'points'
(72 points equal one inch).
	  5) 'BuildMode'  : This toggles the two work environments.
		  a) 'SpotColor' : Uses a custom 12 color
palette(user adjusted) along with 4 'system grays'(non-adjustable).
		  b) 'Grayscale' : Uses a 16 color grayscale
to represent PostScript illustrations which will show SMOOTHER
gradient fills on printing devices. Not only solid fills, but
'GRADIENT blended fills' are also possible here.
	  6) 'PageSetup' : This opens a dialog box where image
and page values are be specified. You should set these at the
START of an illustration. The 'Draw window' shows the Image Area
as a gray rectangle. The 'Final window' shows the Image Area
as a white rectangle and the Page Size as a gray rectangle. Be
careful NOT to have your Image Size bigger than your Page Size.
	  7) 'Display':
		  a) 'Rebuild'  : You can redraw the entire
			 display, in case of DOS message damage.
		  b) 'FullRender'  : Renders the current illustration
to the full VGA screen in FINAL mode. Clicking any mouse button,
or hitting the spacebar will return the display to the normal
working mode.

     'WINDOW'  MENU
	  1) 'WinCommands'  : Miscellaneous window commands.
		  a) 'ReRender' : Redraws the current 'ACTIVE
			  window'(the one with the BLACK upper bar).
		  b) 'ShowStorage' : Whatever you just 'Cut'
or 'Copy' ('Modify>ToStorage' on the menu) is rendered in the
'active window'.
		  c) 'FitInWindow' : Magnifies the illustration
as big as it can fit in the active window.
	  2) 'RenderScope'  : Active window 'ReRenders'
	      will only show the following objects:
		  a) 'Illustration' : Re-renders the entire illustration.
		  b) 'LastGroup' : To speed up re-rendering
time, we temporarily tell the window to only draw the 'last group'
that was 'selected' while we adjust it.
		  c) 'LastPath' : Tell the window to only
		       draw the 'last path' that was 'selected'.
	  3) 'Mode'  : These settings control the current ACTIVE
window's characteristics. There are different submenus for 'DRAW'
and 'FINAL' windows.
	       (DRAW window:)
		  a) 'Bitmap&Line' : Shows the illustration's
outline as well as the previously loaded .PCX bitmap used as
a tracing template.
		  b) 'LineOnly'   : Only shows the illustration's
				    outline.
		  c) 'BitmapOnly' : Only shows the previously
				    loaded .PCX bitmap.
	       (FINAL window, in 'Grayscale buildmode':)
		  a) 'OutputFills' : Set this to show what the
			 ACTUAL color OUTPUT will look like.
		  b) 'FlatFills' : Temporarily set this to
speed up the rendering process and ignore 'gradient fills'. Beware,
this is NOT what the final OUTPUT will look like.
		  c) 'BilevFills' : In Grayscale BuildMode
temporarily set this to see how the illustration will dither
on a printer that prints only black and white(bilevel dithering).
		  d) 'CellSize 1' : Set this to see finest
dithering of 'gradient fills' and bilevel rendering.
		  e) 'CellSize 2' :   For 'gradient fills' and
'BilevFills', the larger(than 1) CellSize setting can temporarily
speed up rendering while you adjust your illustration. The final
OUTPUT will NOT have these coarse cells.
		  f) 'CellSize 4' : Still faster TEMPORARY rendering.
		  g) 'CellSize 8' : This setting provides the
			 fastest rendering of dither filling.
	  4) 'Type' : The submenus below will toggle the
                      window's mode.
		  a) 'Draw' : Only path OUTLINES are shown.
Bitmaps for tracing can also be viewed. Path building and modifying
are done in this faster rendering window mode.
		  b) 'Final' : The FINAL output illustration
is viewed with colored fills and stroked paths, however rendering
time is slower than a 'Draw window'.

     'MODIFY'  MENU
	  1) 'ModCommands' : Miscellaneous modify commands.
		  a) 'SelectParent' : For COMPOUND GROUPS(groups
containing other groups), select one 'child' path and use this
command to climb HIGHER into the grouping hierarchy and select
the larger encompassing group.
		  b) 'SelectChild' : For 'compound groups', after
having selected the 'parent group', this command allows you to
climb back DOWN the hierarchy to the child group where you started.
		  c) 'Group' : First select MULTIPLE paths(and/or
other groups) by holding down the 'CTRL KEY' as you right mouse
button click. Then pick this command and the paths will be internally
ORGANIZED into a GROUP(unit) that can be SINGULARLY 'selected'
and modified. To 'select' a group, first 'select' one of the
paths. Then pick the 'SelectParent' menu command and see how the
whole group becomes selected. If a group is contained WITHIN
a COMPOUND GROUP, pick 'SelectParent' again and rise to the larger
CONTAINING group. Organizing paths into 'groups'(objects) and
'compound groups'(groups containing groups) is similar to the
way we maintain directories and sub-directories on our hard disks
for easier access to files. Unlike other object-oriented illustration
programs, any path in a group can be modified WITHOUT ungrouping.
		  d) 'UnGroup' :   Select a group(multiple paths)
or 'compound group' and pick this command. The group will be
broken down to SEPARATE paths.
	  2) 'Transforms'  : First select either a
path(s) or 'group' and pick any of the submenu commands below.
Most of the commands will require two left mouse clicks to execute.
A box will surround the path, then make your first left mouse click
to get a handle on the object. Then move the mouse to the desired
position and make your second click to freeze your result. Hitting
the SPACEBAR produces the same result as a LEFT mouse button
click. This is very useful if it is difficult to hold the mouse
STEADY enough for a second click. Also the CURSOR(arrow) KEYS
will move the cursor the same way the mouse does, only with more
precision. The 'Transform' commands are to be executed in 'DRAW
windows' only, not 'FINAL windows'.
		  a) 'Move' : A box forms about the selected
path(s). Left mouse click once to release the path, move it where
you want, and click AGAIN to freeze your new position.
		  b) 'Clone' : Select the path(s) and pick this
command to see the new clone with the mouse move. Click again
to set into position.
		  c) 'Scale' : A box forms about the selected
path(s). Click at one of the box's CORNERS to get a handle. Move
the mouse and click again.
		  d) 'Rotate' : First left click to establish
the AXIS of rotation. Move the mouse and click a second time.
		  e) 'Skew' : Click at one of the box's four
SIDES to get the handle. Move mouse and click a second time.
		  f) 'Mirror' : Click a little DISTANCE FROM
one of the box's four sides to get the axis of reflection.
                  g) 'RepeatTrans' : First clone a path, and
additionally 'Transform' it(Scale, Rotate, Move, etc.). Now pick
this 'RepeatTrans' command and see all of your steps repeated in
cloning a new path. And still again select this command to see the
process repeated on a second clone. This is useful in creating
PATTERNED objects.
	  3) 'Points' : Points are SELECTED differently than
paths. To select a point, RIGHT mouse button click with the
'Arrow Tool' directly on the segment's endpoint. The path should
NOT be 'shown' (having its point's hollow cube cues exposed).
A selected point has just ONE SOLID cue cube on a path(remember
that PATHS are selected by clicking in the MIDDLE of a line
segment, NOT at a segment's point).
		  a) 'Join' : Used to CLOSE an open path, or
to SPLICE two open paths together. Just select each ENDPOINT
at the path's ENDS, and execute this command.
		  b) 'Split' :   Used to OPEN a closed path,
or to BREAK an open path into two paths. Just 'select an POINT'
 in the middle of a path and pick this command.
	 4) 'ToStorage' : 'Storage' is a temporary holding
place for 'Cut' or 'Copy' paths (or groups). Just 'select' a
path and pick the following commands.
		  a) 'Copy' : Copies to the storage area, and
leaves the source path(s) or group(s) in the illustration.
		  b) 'Cut' : Copies to the storage area, but
REMOVES the selected path(s) or group(s) from the illustration.
This is also how paths and groups are DELETED from an illustration.
	 5) 'Paste' : Previously 'Cut' or 'Copy'
a path to the storage area. Now select a path(or group) in the
illustration, and pick one of the below commands.
		  a) 'in Front of' : Pastes the 'storage path' directly
			 IN FRONT OF the selected object.
		  b) 'in Back of' : Pastes the 'storage path' directly
			 IN BACK OF the selected object.



TIPS
---------------------------------------------------------------------
      - Hitting the SPACEBAR is the same as CLICKing the LEFT
mouse button. When moving or 'Transforming' large objects it is
difficult to hold the mouse steady for the second click. This way
you take your hand off the mouse, and then hit the spacebar.

      - Using the CURSOR KEYS(arrows) is the same as moving the
mouse. The size of the 'move' that the cursor takes on each key
press is determined by the 'Gridsnap Distance'(OPTION menu and
Restrict>SetValues). This is more precise when moving or
'Transforming' paths or groups.

      - A path, group, or point can be UN-SELECTED by LEFT mouse
clicking on an empty area in the active window.

      - To 'select' multiple paths, hold down the 'CTRL KEY'
while RIGHT mouse clicking. Multiple paths can respond to any
command, the same as a single path.

      - Do NOT allow a FILLED path to CROSS over ITSELF (like a
figure eight, "8"), or the printer output may NOT match the screen.

      - If you want a straight segment to SMOOTHLY connect to
a curve(or a curve to a curve),  use the 'KnifeTool' (see TOOLBAR
SUMMARY in this document).

      - All measurements are in 'points'(72 points equal an inch).

      - In 'Spotcolor buildmode', if you want to SAVE a CUSTOM
palette, first create an illustration with just 12 rectangles.
Fill each of the rectangles with your 12 new user-defined palette
colors (OPTIONS menu, Toolbar>ChngPalColor), and save the
illustration. When you want to make a NEW illustration with this
palette, just load the 'palette-illustration' you saved, and then
start a new illustration.

      - If you want to trace over a background image, load a
.pcx bitmap file. If your file is a .tiff bitmap, your can convert
it with the 'BitmapConvert' menu command. If your bitmap is in
another file format, you should acquire the shareware program,
"Graphic Workshop(ver 6.1)" by Alchemy Mindworks(Beeton, Ontario).
It is an excellent utility to convert and PRINT bitmap files.
If your dot matrix printer is not supported by vgaRender you
could save your illustration as a 'FullDisplay' bitmap and print
through Graphic Workshop. Launch vRend.exe from a HARD DISK
directory for FASTER bitmap display(a temp file is created in
the current directory that must be continually accessed).

      - If you want high resolution prints (or negatives) for
press reproduction, consider taking your PostScript(.ps) files
to your local 'desktop publishing service bureau' or 'laser parlor'.
There they can be 'DOWN-LOADED' to PostScript LaserWriters or
typesetting machines(ImageSetters). To create such a PostScript
file, load your illustration and save to disk with the 'OUTPUT'
command on the 'File' menu. The 'Grayscale' submenu option will
create black and white prints on LaserWriters. When your get to
the bureau, log onto a DOS machine hooked up to a LaserWriter
(or ImageSetter). If the Laserwriter is hooked up to the first
parallel port, you can download your file with the DOS 'copy'
command (ex: at the DOS prompt type  "copy  yourfile.ps  lpt1:" ).
When you execute the OUTPUT command on the File menu, you will
get the 'Output Options' dialog box. On the dialog box check your
page size. The 'FEED' options are important. For Laserwriters
that hold TRAYS of cut paper, select 'Tray' feed. Typesetting
machines and ImageSetters use internal ROLLS of paper, so select
'Roll' for the feed option. If you have difficulties, try the
'Default' feed option.

	       a curve segment.
      'draw window' :  A window that only displays OUTLINES of
	       'paths'. It also may hold 'tracing bitmaps' to guide
	       your drawing. The bitmaps do NOT print.

	       the 'path', measured in points(72 points equal an inch).
      'open path' :  A path whose first and last points are NOT
	       connected. When 'stroked' it paints a line.
      'path' : A collection of many points that form straight
	       segments and curve segments. If a path is 'open'
	       it is stroked to form a line. If a path is 'closed'
	       it is filled to form a shape(and may also be stroked).
      'point' : The smallest element of the drawing. Two points
	       can define either a straight segment or a curve
	       segment.
      'restrict' :  To constrain the movement of the mouse cursor
	       to either horizontal/vertical movement, or to an

      'shape' :  A 'closed path' and may be filled and or stroked.
      'sharp point' :  A joining point between segments and allows
	       a 'sharp' connection. When 'selected' it has a little
	       CUBE cue. Also see 'smooth point'.
      'shown' :  A path or group that has been LEFT mouse clicked

	       has a little CIRCLE cue. Also see 'sharp point'.
      'snap' :   When dragging the cursor, the cursor moves sharply
	       to a horizontal or vertical, or to an invisable grid,
	       dependant on the 'Restrict' settings.
      'spotcolor buildmode' :  A work environment that allows
	       12 user-defined colors and 4 fixed system grays.

DEFINITION OF SHAREWARE
---------------------------------------------------------------------
      Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software
before buying it. If you try a Shareware program and continue
using it, you are expected to register. Copyright laws apply to
both Shareware and commercial software, and the copyright holder
retains all rights, with a few specific exceptions. Shareware
authors are accomplished programmers, just like commercial
authors, and the programs are of comparable quality.
     Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software.
You should find software that suits your needs and pocketbook,
whether it's commercial or Shareware. The Shareware system makes
fitting your needs easier, because you can try before you buy.
And because the overhead is low, prices are low also. Shareware
has the ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the
product, you don't pay for it.
     vgaRender is a "shareware program" and is provided at no
charge to the user for evaluation. Feel free to share it with
your friends, but please do NOT give it away ALTERED or as part
of another system. The essence of "user-supported" software is
to provide personal computer users with quality software without
high prices, and yet to provide incentive for programmers to
continue to develop new products. If you find this program
useful and find that you are using vgaRender and continue to
use vgaRender after a reasonable trial period, you must make a
registration payment to Carousel Graphics. The registration fee
