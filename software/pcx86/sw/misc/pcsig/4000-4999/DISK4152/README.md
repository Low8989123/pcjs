                    =================================================
                    Free Bonus described at the end of this document!
                    =================================================

          --------------------------------------------------------------------

                                    Introduction to

                              My Little Realm/the system

          My Little Realm gives non-technical PC owners the chance to use 
          PC computers to easily maintain and balance their checking account; 
          track credit card expenses; create a phone/address book; print 
          labels; address envelopes; track savings instruments; create a 
          library of their personal books, tapes, cd's, etc.; monitor public 
          library withdrawals; create "memory" records that let the computer 
          remember where important documents (like wills, passports, etc.) 
          are kept; track business expenses and incomes for part-time jobs; 
          easily backup and retrieve files; encourage young readers to visit 
          their local libraries; and still more.  MLR is self-installing, 
          comes with online help files, and users need know nothing about 
          DOS, accounting, or file maintenance to make use of the entire 
          system.  Requires 2 MB of hard disk space.

          Most of My Little Realm's programs may be purchased separately.  
          These stand-alone modules can be run from either a floppy disk or 
          a hard disk.  The stand-alone programs even make great gifts!  
          They'll run on almost any kind of IBM compatible PC.

          --------------------------------------------------------------------
          
                      The Stand-alone Programs of My Little Realm
          
          * Calling Cards.
          Calling Cards lets you access your phone/address database as if it 
          were your own personal Yellow Pages.  If you need a plumber, just 
          tell Calling Cards to get you the number of your plumber.  And if 
          you need labels, Calling Cards lets you put your records in either 
          of two categories such as "Friends" and "Clients".  All you have to
          do is put fanfold labels in your printer and tell Calling Cards 
          which category you want.  If you're expecting RSVP's, you can print
          a checklist for either group so you can check off who responds to 
          your wedding invitations, client queries, whatever.  You can also 
          print from one to 999 labels of any name and address currently 
          displayed using any of the Viewing functions, and you can even 
          address envelopes.

          * Charging (aka The Credit Card Program).
          If you're the "typical" American family you have seven credit 
          cards.  Have you ever wondered where you stood with all of those 
          cards?  How much is out on this one or that one?  Or all of them?  
          The press of a single key in Charging will answer those questions.
          Many credit card companies offer great benefits, from earning 
          small rebates on what you purchase (like Discover) to large savings
          on cars and pickup trucks (like Ford and GM).  Make maximum use of 
          the credit cards that pay you back by charging what you normally 
          purchase with cash or check (groceries, gasoline, and medicine), 
          and let Charging keep track of your expenditures for you.

          * Checking.
          Checking makes checkbook maintenance a breeze.  You create the 
          records of your checks, deposits, autowithdrawals, and so on with a 
          minimum of data entry.  A degree in accounting is definitely not 
          required.  Checking automatically balances your checking account 
          and tracks your personal income tax deductions (or whatever else 
          you tell it to keep track of).  

          * Private Library.
          Private Library gives you the opportunity to put all of your 
          personal volumes (books, cd's, video tapes, etc.) online.  You can 
          sort, search, view and print your records in a variety of ways.

          * Public Library.
          Tired of paying overdue fines at your local library?  Public 
          Library remembers when books are due, and it maintains a historical
          file of everything you borrow.  That makes it great for high school
          and college students who want an easy way to keep track of their 
          research materials.

          * Read More.
          Read More encourages young readers to make use of their public 
          libraries.  Kids frequently complain that they can't find anything 
          to read.  The titles that come with Read More are fun reading.  
          Read More encourages young readers by showing them a wide variety 
          of new authors and works that they would enjoy reading.  Kids can 
          check off the books they read to have Read More display smiley 
          faces next to them.  Kids love to watch the smiley faces add up.  
          Books are listed by age groups.  For ages 6 months through young 
          adult.

          * Records of the Realm.
          "Memory" records created by Records of the Realm help locate 
          important documents in short order.  This program can also save you
          a lot of trouble and headaches should you ever lose one or more of 
          your credit cards.  It will automatically generate a list of phone 
          numbers for your credit card issuers so you can:  quickly make the 
          necessary calls to stop payments; print letters to those same 
          issuers (required by most credit card issuers); and print labels 
          for the envelopes.

          * Savings.
          Savings lets you keep track of all of your savings instruments ... 
          certificates of deposit, passbook savings, Keough plans, IRA's, and 
          so on.  Thinking about buying a new home or refinancing the one you
          have now?  Print your savings portfolio and bring it with you when
          you visit your loan representative.  It'll save you tons of time.

          --------------------------------------------------------------------

                               My Little Realm/The System

          You can purchase the entire My Little Realm system which comes with
          all of the above stand-alone programs plus, at no extra cost:

          1  Main Menu.  You can easily change color modes, shell out to DOS,
                         check your computer's resources, and invoke MLR's 
                         ScreenSaver ... all at the touch of a button.  It 
                         also gives you easy, single-key access to all of the
                         MLR programs described above.

          2  Utilities.  MLR comes with its own backup and retrieval 
                         utilities.  You can back up all of your files with 
                         the press of a single key.  And you can retrieve 
                         backed up files by simply telling Retrieve which MLR
                         program has a bad file.  Retrieve will do the rest.
                         You don't have to know a thing about DOS!

          3  Documentation.  The System comes with its own documentation 
                         viewer so you can refer to your help files without 
                         leaving the system.

          4  Common interface.  MLR's programs are easy to learn, and once 
                         you learn how to use one, you'll know how to use 
                         them all because they all work the same way.

          5  Review Programs.  Two review programs let you access your 
                         checking and charging files to see how you've been 
                         spending your hard-earned money.  Both allow you to 
                         peruse your files in a scrollable window, query your
                         records, and search them as well.  You can even 
                         generate a year-to-date summary.

          Note:  The MLR system must be run from the hard disk and requires 
                 2 MB of hard disk space.

                                  Public Library

                         Installing the Evaluation Version

          --------------------------------------------------------------------

                         - Hardware and software requirements -

                    IBM or compatible PC with 512K RAM
                    Requires 267 Kb of disk space
                    Public Library can be run from a hard or a floppy disk
                    DOS version 3.3 or later

          --------------------------------------------------------------------
                             
                                      Installation

          Put the distribution disk in the A: drive and type:

                                         a:install

          (If you put it in the B: drive, type "b:install".)

          Install will ask for one or two items:

                      1   the target drive, and
                      2   the target directory (if copying to a hard disk)

          If you install Public Library to a floppy disk, you will not be 
          asked for a target directory.

          After specifying the drive (and directory, in the event you're
          installing to a hard drive), Install will ask if you need to make 
          any changes.  If you need to change an entry, press <Y> or the up
          arrow.

                                ---------------------------

          Install offers \MYREALM as the default directory.  You can change 
          it to your liking of course, but it is recommended that all of My 
          Little Realm's programs be put in the same directory.

          If you give Install the name of a directory that already exists, it
          will put Public Library into that existing directory.  

          Warning:  You should only put Public Library into a directory with 
          other My Little Realm programs.  They are made to interact 
          properly.  If Public Library is your first MLR program, you should
          put it into its own directory.

          --------------------------------------------------------------------
                              
                              Printing the Documentation

          To print Public Library's documentation, go to the Public Library 
          directory (MYREALM is used as an example) and direct the printout 
          of PUBLIC.TXT to the printer using the "> PRN" option as shown 
          below.  Be sure your printer is on.

            ---------------------------------------------------------------
            Step | English directions      | DOS commands
            ---------------------------------------------------------------
             1   | go to MYREALM directory | CD\MYREALM             <enter>

          -------------------------------------------------------------------

                                Printing an Order Form

          To print an order form, go to the Public Library directory and 
          direct the printout of REGISTER.TXT to the printer using the 
          "> PRN" option as shown below.  Be sure your printer is on.

            ---------------------------------------------------------------
            Step | English directions      | DOS commands
            ---------------------------------------------------------------

                                     Introduction

          Public Library is really two programs in one.  It keeps track of 
          the outstanding books, magazines, videos, etc., that you borrow 
          from your public library on the one hand, and it also maintains a
          historical file of your borrowings so that you can see what you and 
          your realm members have been reading over the years.

          The Historical Mode contains a powerful Search function that lets
          you find records with specific information in a given field.  For
          example, if you wanted to see what one member of the realm has been
          reading, simply invoke the Search function, select the Reader field 
          to search on, and then enter the reader's Quickey.  Public Library
          will display all of the works that that reader has borrowed over 
          the years.  You can even print the results, if you like.

          Public Library is a great way to keep track of research material,
          too, especially for high school and college students who tend to be
          somewhat less than organized.  It also helps minimize the book and
          video fines (in some areas 25 cents and a dollar, respectively) 
          that can add up so quickly.

          To find out what you have outstanding at any point in time, just
          run Public Library and press 2 in the Options Window.  It's that
          easy.
          ____________________________________________________________________

                                      Overview

          Interface.

          Public Library's screen consists of three types of windows:  a 
          Working Window, a Viewing Window, and an Options Window.  If you 
          are using a color monitor the Viewing Window is always green, the
          Working Window red and the Options Window blue.  Enter the pound
          sign, <#>, in the Options Window to install the color mode.

          You select processes (like adding, updating, or deleting records)
          in the Options Window.  In general, you create records in the 
          Working Window, and you view your records in the Viewing Window.

                             ----------------------------

          Extended processing options.
          
          Several processing tasks, called extended processing options or 
          EPO's, are not listed in the Options Windows, because they are 
          functions that only occasionally need to be performed.  EPO's are
          used to "extend" a program's power and functionality.  One EPO you
          should be aware of initially is the Change Quickeys function.  You
          invoke it by pressing the backslash in the Options Window.

          To find out what EPO commands are employed by Public Library, 
          enter <?> (the question mark) in the Options Window.  The EPO's of 
          Public Library are defined at the end of this document.

                             ----------------------------

          Quickeys.

          There are two types of Quickey lists in the Public Library Routine.  
          The first is for the names of the readers of your realm, or, more 
          precisely, for their initials.  The second group of Quickeys is for
          your libraries.  To enter your Quickey names, press <\> in the
          Options Window.

          The Quickeys in Public Library give you single key access to the 
          names of the readers in your realm and to the libraries you
          frequent.  Enter them once, and you'll never have to enter them 
          again.  See the section "Extended Processing Options" for full 
          details.

                                   Getting Started

          Note:  If you have a color monitor, press the pound sign in the 
          Options Window to install the color mode.  If portions of the 
          screen appear garbled, press <#> again to return to the monochrome
          mode.

          The very first thing you'll want to do with Public Library is make 
          the program uniquely yours.  To do that, you will have to enter the
          names of the readers in your realm and the libraries you visit.  
          The Change Quickeys function is invoked by the backslash key (\)
          entered in the Options Window.

          Public Library will ask which Reader Quickey you want to change.
          The reader entry can be up to three letters long; initials are 
          usually used although any string combination is acceptable.  Public 
          Library keeps up to six readers' initials.

          After you've entered all of your readers' initials, press <esc>.
          Public Library will then ask for the names of the libraries you 
          frequent.  You can enter up to four, and the names can be up to ten
          characters in length.  After you enter the names of your libraries,
          press <esc> once more to return to the Options Window.

          Recommended reading:  Please take a few moments to peruse this
          document.  While Public Library is not difficult to learn, it
          can do a great deal more than simply remind you which books are
          out, who borrowed them, and when they're due.
          
          Exiting Public Library.
          If you've made changes to your data file, Public Library will so 
          notify you when you attempt to return to your operating system and 
          ask if you want to save the changes.  You will almost always 
          respond with <Y> or <enter> to save the changes.  If, for some 
          reason, you do not want to save the changes, press <N>.  Following 
          either response, you'll be returned to DOS.  If you press <esc>, 
          Public Library will instead return you to the Options Window from 
          where you can resume processing.

          Why would you ever want to not save changes?  Home programs must
          take into account the unwanted help of children who occasionally
          get into a program and wreak havoc.  Should you find that someone
          you love is "helping you" with Public Library, don't get angry.  
          Just exit the program and don't save the changes.

                              ++   The Outstanding Mode   ++
          
          The Public Library works in two modes:  Outstanding and Historical.
          To switch between the two modes press <enter> in the Options 
          Window.  You'll see the options in the Options Window change as 
          shown above, and the title box alternately displays "Outstanding 
          Mode" and "Historical Mode", so you'll always know which mode 
          you're in.
          
          The first mode deals with the books that are currently due at your 
          libraries.  In other words, if you've just taken a book out of one
          of your local libraries or returned one, use the Outstanding Mode 
          to make or update the necessary records.
          
          Note:  Public Library always starts in the Outstanding Mode.

          The second mode is the Historical mode which maintains a list of 
          all of the works you've ever borrowed and returned.  It is 
          described later in this document.
          ______________________________________________________________________

          Option # 1, entering your books.

          Press 1 in the Options Window.  Your cursor will go into the 
          Working Window where you'll enter the title, author, and other
          information about the books you've taken out of your library.  If
          you need to back up through the fields, press the up arrow.  To
          advance through the fields, press the down arrow key or <enter>.

                                  ~ Field Definitions ~

          - Title field (35, required).

          Leading prepositions and articles should be placed at the end of 
          the title so that sorting takes place on the first key word.

                                   Title:  Tontine, The
                                   ____________________

          - Author field (30 total, optional).

          In the Public Library program, an author's name is entered with the
          last name first, as in the following example:

                                   Author:  Stone, Irving

          To skip the author entry, press <enter>. 
                                   ____________________

          - Date field (required).

          This field is constructed along the manner of the American date 
          format of mm/dd/yy.  On the first record it displays a date two 
          weeks in the future.  Make the necessary changes, if any, and press
          <enter>.  Public Library then echoes that date in the subsequent 
          records you create, making it very easy to enter a lot of books.

          Public Library will accept dates that are up to one year in the 
          future (remember, these are due dates), and it will accept records 
          with dates from the current and previous months, just in case you 
          don't get the books logged promptly.
                                   ____________________

          - Library Quickey field (single character entry, optional).

          Only Quickeys are accepted in this field.  You cannot manually 
          enter a library name.  So if you want to enter a library name for 
          a given record you must do it using the Quickeys.  To skip this 
          field simply press <enter>.  

          Public Library will display the libraries you listed in your 
          library Quickey file (up to four are allowed) in the box on the 
          lower right side of your screen.  
                                   ____________________

          - Reader Quickey field (3, optional).

          Enter one of the six Quickeys in this field.   The Reader Quickeys 
          are displayed in the box in the lower right part of your screen.
                                   ____________________

          Echoic entries:  Date, Library and Reader fields.

          The Date, Library and Reader fields are echoic entries.  That is to
          say, once a record has been entered, each of these fields will echo 
          its previous value to the screen in subsequent records until you
          alter its value or exit the Enter New Books function.  If the 
          echoed value is the entry you want, just press <enter>.  

          For example, if you borrow six magazines from your local library 
          and all of them have the same due date, you only have to enter the
          date for the first record.  After that, Public Library will echo 
          that date and all you have to do is press <enter> to accept it.  
          The same procedure holds for the library and reader entries.  

          Should you wish to change an echoed value for the Reader or Library
          entries, merely pretend the echoed name isn't there and enter what 
          you would have had the echo not been displayed.
                                   ____________________

          Backing up through the fields.

          You can back up through the input fields by pressing the up arrow.
          You can advance through the fields by pressing the down arrow; it
          acts as the enter key in this respect.  The only time you cannot 
          advance through a field without entering something is when you're 
          in a field that requires an entry, such as the Title field.
          ______________________________________________________________________

          Option # 2, returning your books.

          At a glance, the Public Library's Return function can tell you:

                       the titles of the works currently borrowed
                       the authors of each
                       the dates each work is due
                       the borrowers, and
                       the libraries to which each must be returned

          Public Library automatically displays your outstanding books in the 
          Viewing Window and asks for the record number of the book you have 
          returned.  (The record numbers are displayed on the left side of 
          the Viewing Window.)  

          Enter the record number of each of the works you have returned, and
          Public Library will highlight them.  After you've highlighted all 
          of those returned, press <enter> or <esc> without entering a record
          number.  (If you inadvertently highlight the wrong record, reenter 
          that record number to turn off the highlight.)
          
          After you press <enter> or <esc>, Public Library will check to see 
          if you have highlighted any of the records in the Books Due file. 
          If you haven't, Public Library automatically returns to the Options
          Window.  If you've highlighted any of the works, Public Library 
          will display the following confirmation prompt:
                      
                      ____________________________________________
                     |                                            |
                     |   Press:  1   To confirm your updates.     |
                     |           2   To ignore your updates.      |
                     |           3   To recheck your updates.     |
                     |____________________________________________|

          
          More elaborately, the three options allow you to:  Press 1 to tell
          Public Library to go ahead and update the Books Due file; press 2 
          to leave the Return function without updating the Books Due file; 
          or press 3 to go back to the beginning of the Return function and 
          make some last minute changes (like highlighting another record or 
          turning off a highlighted record).

          Note:  Public Library does not remove the records marked returned
          from the Outstanding file and append them to the Historical file
          until you exit the Public Library program.  This means that if you 
          mark several works returned and then decide to view the Historical 
          file, you won't find your recently returned records at the end of 
          that file.  All of the file changes are made when you exit the 
          program.  Hence, the returned works can still be viewed by invoking 
          the Return function.  On the next occasion you use Public Library, 
          you'll find those returned books in the Historical file.

          Note:  If you mark a book returned, you can change it to 
          outstanding again in either of two ways:  One, use the Update 
          function and highlight the incorrect record.  Don't forget to 
          confirm the update.  Two, use the Change function before exiting 
          the Public Library program.  Public Library will display a sub-menu
          of the fields you can change.  Select <6> (Returned).

                                   ___________________

          You can use the Update function to view your Books Due file 
          (properly called the Outstanding file).  If you have more than one 
          screenful of books, you can use the up and down directional keys to 
          view the others.  When you've finished, press <esc>.  

          Note:  If you are merely viewing your records, remember that you 
          should not highlight them in this function.  If you do, they will 
          be considered "returned", and Public Library will display the 
          confirmation prompt shown above.  If you should happen to forget,
          simply press <esc> when the confirmation prompt is displayed and
          Public Library will ignore your highlighted records and return to
          the Options Window.

          Important:  You should ensure that all entries are correct while 
          the records are in the Books Due file.  Once a record is marked 
          returned, it is moved to the Historical file and cannot be 
          modified.
          ______________________________________________________________________

          Option # 3, correcting and viewing records.

          You can change any of the fields in the Books Due file.
          
          Public Library will want to know the record number.  The record
          numbers appear on the left side of the Viewing Window.  To return 
          to the Options Window, press <enter> (without entering a record 
          number) or press <esc>.

          After you enter a record number, Public Library displays a sub-menu
          of the fields that you can change in the Working Window and 
          highlights the record in the Viewing Window so you'll know which 
          record's data you're changing.  Be sure you have the correct one.
          To turn off the highlight (i.e., to avoid making changes to the 
          highlighted record), press <enter> (nothing else) or press <esc>.

          When the sub-menu is displayed showing the six fields you can 
          change, select the appropriate field's hotkey, and Public Library 
          asks for the new field value.  If you enter the wrong hotkey press 
          <esc>, and Public Library will restore the original value, even if
          you've already typed in something.

          If the menu number you chose was <6> (return status), you can undo 
          the change by simply entering <6> again.  Since the return status 
          is either yes or no, all you do to change the status is to select 
          menu number <6>.  The instant you select <6> the return status is 
          changed to the opposite value.  To change it back, you simply press
          <6> again.

          This function is also handy if you simply want to peruse your Books
          Due file.  If you have more than a screenful, you can use the 
          scrolling keys to view those records not on screen.

          Important:  You should ensure that all entries are correct while 
          the records are in the Books Due file.  Once a record is marked 
          returned, it is moved to the Historical file and cannot be 
          modified.
          ______________________________________________________________________

          Option # 4, deleting your records.

          Public Library will ask for the record number of the record you 
          want to delete.  It will then highlight that record and ask you if 
          you are sure you want that record deleted.  Verify the contents of 
          the record before you respond.  If you respond <Y>, the record is
          deleted.  If you press <esc>, <N>, or <enter>, Public Library will
          turn off the highlight.

          After you respond yes or no, Public Library will ask for the record
          number of the next record you want to delete.  Give it the next 
          record number if you want to delete another record or press <esc> 
          (or <enter> without entering a record number) to leave the Delete 
          function and return to the Options Window.  If you delete the last 
          record in your Books Due file, you will automatically be returned 
          to the Options Window.
          ______________________________________________________________________
          ______________________________________________________________________

                             ++   The Historical Mode   ++

          When you press <enter> in the Options Window, Public Library
          switches between the Outstanding Mode and the Historical mode.  If
          Public Library is in the Outstanding Mode, simply press <enter> to 
          access your Historical file.  Public Library displays "Historical 
          Mode" in the title box on the upper right of your screen.

          The Historical mode of the Public Library Routine allows you a 
          unique perspective on your realm members' reading habits over the 
          years.  There might also be times when you want to go back and 
          re-read an unusual work you had read years before but can't quite 
          recall the name of the work or the author.  
          
          The historical log also allows you to keep detailed records of your 
          research.  And if friends ask what the children of the realm were 
          reading when they were such and such an age, you'll be able to look 
          up the answer quickly and easily using Public Library's Search
          function.
          
          Note:  The records of the works declared returned in the 
          Outstanding Mode are added to the Historical file when you exit 
          the Public Library program.  Public Library puts those returned 
          records at the end of the Historical file, maintaining a nearly 
          chronological account of your borrowings.  This structure of the 
          Historical file is not altered by Public Library's Sort function.
          ______________________________________________________________________

          Option <A>, viewing the historical records.

          Use the directional keys to browse.  You can have Public Library 
          highlight specific records by entering the record numbers of those 
          you want to focus on.  To turn off a record's highlight, reenter 
          that record's record number.

          To return to the Options Window, press <enter> (without entering a
          record number) or press <esc>.
          ______________________________________________________________________

          Option <B>, sorting the historical records.

          You may sort by title, author or reader.  If you wish to print your
          records in a sorted order, run the sort first and then run the 
          Print function (option <C>).
          ______________________________________________________________________

          Option <C>, printing the historical records.

          Public Library prints the title, author, date (due), library, and 
          the reader.  If you want your listing in a sorted order, run the 
          sort first, then invoke the Print function.
          ______________________________________________________________________

          Option <D>, searching the historical records.

          You can tell Public Library to search on any of four fields:  the 
          Title field, the Author field, the Date field, or the Reader field.  
          Give Public Library the string (called a keyword) that you're 
          looking for, and it will search the specified field in every record 
          for any occurrence of the keyword.

          When a search is performed on the date field in Public Library, you
          must enter the search date in the format mm/dd/yy.  You can use
          the question mark as a wild card.  A single wild card in either 
          position of the month, day or year makes that segment wild.  That
          is to say, if you entered 1?/?2/93, both the month and the day
          segments would be considered wild, and Public Library would only
          look for records that had been created in 93.  Both the month 
          segment and the day segment have been declared wild with the 
          inclusion of the question marks.  If you entered 10/1?/91, Public 
          Library would retrieve those records that had been created in 
          October of 1991.
          ______________________________________________________________________

          Option <E>, deleting the historical records.

          This Delete function is a little different from the one in the 
          Outstanding Mode.  In the Outstanding Mode, you delete one record 
          at a time.  In the Historical mode, you select all of the records 
          you want to delete, and then have Public Library delete them all at 
          one time.  Confirmation is required before the deletions are 
          performed.

          Use the directional keys to find the records you want to delete, 
          and enter their record numbers.  Public Library will highlight your
          selections.  After you've highlighted all of the records you want 
          to delete, press <esc> or <enter> (without entering a record 
          number).
          
          If you highlight a record and then change your mind, enter that 
          record number again, and Public Library will turn off the 
          highlight.  Only highlighted records are deleted.

          If you've highlighted any records, Public Library will tell you how 
          many records you've marked for deletion and display the following
          sub-menu.
          
                      ____________________________________________
                     |                                            |
                     |   Press:  1   To confirm your deletes.     |
                     |           2   To ignore your deletes.      |
                     |           3   To recheck your deletes.     |
                     |____________________________________________|
          
          
          If you've changed your mind at this point, you can press <3> to 
          look over the deletions you're making and add others or turn the 
          highlight off any that you've decided to keep.  If you simply want
          to abandon the Delete function, press <2> or <esc>.  To carry out 
          the deletes, press <1>.

          Special note:  If you have sorted your records before running the
          Delete function, Public Library will tell you that it will restore 
          the Historical array to its original structure before it continues 
          with the Delete function.  If you have more work to do using the 
          sorted structure, you might want to finish that work first before 
          you delete any records.

                                On reading . . .
                   
          Americans deny themselves a valuable resource when they ignore 
          their public libraries.  A chance to read is a chance to explore 
          ... the world around us, the world inside us.  It enhances lives 
          by enlarging the worlds we perceive physically, spiritually, 
          metaphysically, and metaphorically.

          Like looking through different lenses on a sophisticated camera,
          reading allows you to view your world with whole new perspectives.
          The works you read don't have to be revolutionary to make you
          think.  Nor do they have to be written by Nobel Prize winning 
          authors to have impact.  And they certainly don't have to appear on 
          the best selling lists to entertain.  But they do have to be read 
          to be enjoyed.

          Do yourself a favor.  Keep a library book around the realm, even 
          if you're not sure you'll have time to finish it.  There's no rule 
          that says you have to read it cover to cover.  And if, at a later 
          date, you decide you really do want to finish that book but you 
          can't recall the name of the author or the title, don't worry about 
          it ... My Little Realm's Public Library will remember for you.

          Retail software vis a vis Shareware software.

          Shareware is a marketing concept developed by software authors who
          were tired of the "buy it and like it" attitude of retail software
          distributors.  With Shareware, you can actually try out a program
          before you pay for it ... right on your own computer, with your own
          computer system, just to make sure it meets your exact needs.  If 
          it does, you send the purchase price to the author/company that 
          wrote it.  If the Shareware program doesn't meet your needs, you 
          simply delete it from your system.  All you've spent is a little 
          time testing it and the modest cost charged by the Shareware 
          vendor.

                        My Little Realm Version 2.5

                 Eight Great Updates ... One New Program!

                        ASP Mailing for August 1993

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          To all disk vendors and BBS Sysops:

          All programs are zipped to save space.
          
          The following eight programs come with their own installation 
          procedure, and each fits neatly on a 360 Kb floppy disk after 
          expansion.

                         Calling Cards. . . MLRCC25.ZIP
                         Charging . . . . . MLRCRG25.ZIP
                         Checking . . . . . MLRCHK25.ZIP
                         Private Library. . MLRPRI25.ZIP
                         Public Library . . MLRPUB25.ZIP
                         Read More. . . . . MLRRM25.ZIP
                         Records. . . . . . MLRROR25.ZIP
                         Savings. . . . . . MLRSAV25.ZIP
          
          BBS Sysops:  The Checking program's ZIP file contains an sfxfile 
          called EXPAND1.EXE.  If you do not want an sfxfile in the archive, 
          expand EXPAND1.EXE to get CHECKING.EXE.  Delete EXPAND1.EXE, then 
          rezip the package.

                               _________________________

          The last program included is a utility program for Shareware 
          software developers.  It does not come with its own installation
          program.  It is a DIZ editor, and is extremely useful for 
          programmers who distribute their work on today's BBS's.  It checks
          for the required hyphen, maximum length, etc.

                         DizzE . . . . . . MLRDIZ10.ZIP

                               _________________________

          Notes to all vendors and BBS Sysops:

          All of the information you need can be found in the VENDOR.TXT
          files located in each of the archives.
          
          ZIP names may be shortened if you need to rename them by dropping 
          the version number that appears in the base name ("25" in the case 
          of the new releases and "10" for the new program).

          All programs are for DOS and IBM compatible computers.

          For your convenience, each compressed file includes its own 
          FILE_ID.DIZ.

          Note:  These ZIP files were created using PKZIP version 2.04g.
          You may rearchive these ZIP files in a different format, if 
          necessary.

                              Vendor Information
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:     The term "vendor" is used to refer to any person, company or group
          distributing the evaluation version of My Little Realm's Public
          Library program by any means for profit or for any other purpose.

          The distribution license agreements are immediately below.  

          The required contents of the distribution disk and ZIP file are 
          listed near line 52 of this document.  The .ZIP file ID is 
          MLRPUB25.ZIP.

          You'll find my name, address and phone number, along with user
          benefits and descriptions of Public Library, at the end of this 
          document.

          The registration price is $20 (USA).  The benefits are listed at
          the end of this document near the descriptions.  Possible product 
          categories would be General Household, Home and Hobby, Personal
          Organizers.  Public Library not only helps you save time, but it 
          helps you save money.  With overdue books costing 25 cents/day and
          overdue video tapes costing as much as a dollar/day, Public Library
