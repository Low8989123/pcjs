The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We
recommend a 386 with a VGA monitor.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

The brand new PC-SIG World Of Windows is a must-have for Windows users.
In order to produce the best possible Windows collection PC-SIG has made
an alliance with the acclaimed Windows OnLine BBS. So not only do you have
access to the collecting and weeding out efforts for which PC-SIG is
famous, but also the huge volume of fonts and sound files and the in-depth
software reviews of the world's best Windows BBS.

This CD contains every one of the best Windows shareware programs
available, 350+ in all, over 900 TrueType fonts which can be used
without royalties, 429 ATM fonts, over 2,000 sound files in .WAV,
.VOC, .SND, .SOU, .MID format and 2,794 icons! A major computer
catalog is offering a collection of 250 fonts for $49.95. They have
great prices on hardware and software, but this time they can't
touch us.

As if the files aren't enough, we thought you would want to preview
and use these sounds, fonts, icons and programs directly from the CD,
without taking the time and space to unarchive them. So we have
included a font previewer and installed, a sound player and an icon
manager. Over 200 of the programs can be run simply by clicking on
them in the File Manager. Nobody else offers you anything close to
this type of access.

We're not done yet. In add to all the Windows riches described above,
this CD also contains the text and programs from the July-August
issue of Shareware Magazine. This is the second in a six-volume PC-SIG
Encyclopedia of Shareware CD-ROM series (Games was the first). Each
volume includes the programs from a section of the PC-SIG Library plus
all the text and every program from the current issue of Shareware
Magazine. Software reviews for this issue cover over 100 programs
including games, communications, printing, text editors and more. 124
of the programs mentioned in the magazine are included, plus 225
programs updated since the May-June issue.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

CMP                                                   Version 1.0





        CMP

        CMP is a file compression program.  It is intended to work with
        the "On This Day" events database program, but can be used as a
        general purpose compression program, nonetheless.  To get the
        original file back from a compressed program, use the UCMP
        program.

        We are NOT attempting in any way to compete with existing general
        purpose compression programs.  ARC, LHARC, PKZIP, etc. are all
        fine products and deserve your support if you are looking for a
        fast and optimal compression program.  CMP was developed to
        provide the ability to keep databases for "On This Day" in a
        compressed form so as to minimize disk usage, yet not have to be
        uncompressed before OTD was run.

        For our databases, we have found that we can achieve roughly a
        33% reduction in size.

        The syntax of the command line is:

                CMP <original file> <compressed file>

        <original file> and <compressed file> may not be the same name.

        Please note that CMP is NOT to be shared with other users.  It is
        not distributed under the Shareware concept and remains under the
        strictest copyright limitations.  It is provided as one benefit
        of having registered OTD.

Short Description:
------------------

   On This Day for Windows is a program and collection of databases
   to answer the question "What Happened On This Day In History?"
   The databases contain thousands of birthdays, events, religious
   holidays, etc.  The program supports dates in the Gregorian,
   Hebrew, Islamic, and Julian calendars and calculates a limited
   number of astronomical events.  Requires Microsoft Windows 3.0 or
   better.


Long Description:
-----------------

   Did you know that Children's Day is the second Sunday in June?  Or
   that November is Aviation History Month?  How about that Willard
   Scott (NBC's "birthday boy") was born on March 7th 1934?
   Confuscious was born August 27th, 551 BC?  On This Day can tell
   you all this and much more.

   On This Day for Windows is an event database printing program.
   Click on the date in which you are interested (keyboard commands
   also work) and the program will do the rest.  It will search a
   group of databases (supplied) and print the data for the date
   you specified.  On This Day for Windows will search an extra,
   personal, file so all your personal events need not be mixed with
   the data in the provided files.

   Since the databases are ordinary text files and the format is
   completely documented, you can make changes and additions using
   your favorite text editor or word processor.

   On This Day for Windows supports dates in the Gregorian (the one
   many of us use daily), Hebrew, Islamic, and Julian calendars.  On
   This Day for Windows can also determine the day of the week on
   which a requested date falls.  Thus, you can specify dates like
   Memorial Day (the last Monday in May).

   On This Day for Windows calculates the date of Easter in the
   requested year, allowing specification of all Christian holidays.
   On This Day for Windows also calculates the phases of the moon
   (flagging eclipses), solstices, and equinoxes.

   Possibly best of all, On This Day for Windows comes with a
   collection of databases ready to use with the program.
   Registered users are provided with databases containing roughly
   15,000 events, holidays, and birthdays!  Registered users are
   also supplied with a few other utilities that we've found useful
   in maintaining changes in the larger databases and a database of
   quotations that is ONLY available to registered users.
   
   Note that we also have a version which will run outside the
   Windows environment.  See PRODUCTS.DOC for descriptions of all
   our offerings.


Registration Information:
-------------------------

   Registration costs $25 (US funds).  Massachusetts residents please
   include 5% sales tax.

   Registered users get:

       o Latest version of On This Day for Windows.
       o A collection of HUGE databases ready to use.
       o A few utilities useful to maintaining such large databases.
       o A database of quotations.
       o Notification of future updates (via our quarterly
         newsletter).

Limited Distribution License:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As the exclusive copyright holder for On This Day for Windows, The
Software Construction Co. authorizes on-line distribution only in
accordance with the following restrictions.  Disk Vendors and
Distributors should refer to the VENDOR.DOC text file for complete
license information.

On This Day for Windows is defined as containing all the material
listed in the PACKING.LST text file.  If any files listed in the
PACKING.LST text file, or the PACKING.LST file itself, are missing,
then the package is not complete and distribution is forbidden.
Please contact us to obtain a complete package suitable for
distribution.

    o  On This Day for Windows - including all related program files
       and documentation files - CANNOT be modified in any way (other
       than that mentioned in the following paragraph) and must be
       distributed as a complete package, without exception.  The
       PACKING.LST text file contains a list of all files that are
       part of On This Day for Windows.

    o  Many BBSs customarily add a small text file (advertisement) to
       each archived file.  This text file describes the BBS and
       tells people that the file was downloaded from that particular
       BBS.  Other BBSs add a small one-line message with their BBS
       name and phone number into the compressed file, which will
       display when the file is uncompressed.  Either of these
       methods of mentioning your BBS are acceptable and may be used,
       provided the program and documentation is otherwise unmodified
       and complete.

    o  The Software Construction Co. prohibits the distribution of
       outdated versions of On This Day for Windows, without written
       permission from The Software Construction Co.  If the version
       you have obtained is over twelve (12) months old, please
       contact us to ensure that you have the most current version.

    o  Licensee shall not use, copy, rent, lease, sell, modify,
       decompile, disassemble, otherwise reverse engineer, or
       transfer the licensed program except as provided in this
       agreement.  Any such unauthorized use shall result in
       immediate and automatic termination of this license.

    o  U.S. Government Information:  Use, duplication, or disclosure
       by the U.S. Government of the computer software and
       documentation in this package shall be subject to the
       restricted rights applicable to commercial computer software
       as set forth in subdivision (b)(3)(ii) of the Rights in

CMP                                                   Version 1.0





        UCMP

        UCMP is a file decompression program.  It is intended to work
        with the compression program (CMP) distributed with the "On This
        Day" events database program.

        We are NOT attempting in any way to compete with existing general
        purpose compression programs.  ARC, LHARC, PKZIP, etc. are all
        fine products and deserve your support if you are looking for a
        fast and optimal compression program.  CMP was developed to
        provide the ability to keep databases for "On This Day" in a
        compressed form so as to minimize disk usage, yet not have to be
        uncompressed before OTD was run.

        For our databases, we have found that we can achieve roughly a
        33% reduction in size.

        The syntax of the command line is:

                UCMP <compressed file> <uncompressed file>

        <uncompressed file> and <compressed file> may not be the same
        name.

        Please note that neither CMP nor UCMP is to be shared with other
        users.  It is not distributed under the Shareware concept and
        remains under the strictest copyright limitations.  It is
        provided as one benefit of having registered OTD.

        More information about this program, "On This Day," and other
        programs may be obtained by writing to:

On This Day for Windows is defined as containing all the material
listed in the PACKING.LST text file.  If any files listed in the

   Small additions to the package, such as the introductory or
   installation batch files used by many shareware disk vendors, are
   acceptable.

No price or other compensation may be charged for On This Day for
Windows.  A distribution fee may be charged for the cost of the
