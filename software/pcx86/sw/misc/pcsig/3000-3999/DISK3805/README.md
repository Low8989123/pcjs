Short Description:
------------------

AutoKey is a Windows program which periodically sends a single keystroke or
menu command to other programs.  Usually, this command is File/Save.  Once you
set it up, AutoKey is nearly invisible, but every now and then you'll see the
program you're using write its data to disk.  AutoKey keeps track of your
keyboard and mouse activity as well as the passage of time.  There are
numerous streamlining features to keep AutoKey out of your way while it's
backing you up.

Long Description:
-----------------

Now you can LAUGH at power failures, snicker at UAE's.  Or take the buffoon
who kicked your power cord to coffee, without "accidentally" dumping a cup of
steamin' jo in the klutz's lap.

And even when USER ERROR rears its ugly head, potentially destroying four
hours of your otherwise brilliant work, you can breathe a sigh of relief...

Because you had the foresight to run AutoKey.

Windows applications are becoming increasingly powerful, and let even
neophytes do wonderful things with information.  But the more complex a
system, the more opportunities for things to go wrong, and Windows is no
exception.  Even with recent improvements in reliability, some unfortunate
Windows users will rarely see the day when their system doesn't hang up.  And
of course no system hangs until immediately BEFORE you were going to save your
data, or AFTER you've completed an excruciatingly painstaking addition to your
work.

AutoKey protects the data in every Windows application you're working with, by
periodically instructing the other applications to save their data.  Even if
you're frequently switching between applications, AutoKey will protect the
data in ALL your Windows applications.

To use AutoKey, you just tell it the applications you wish to protect and
when, minimize it, and forget it.  At the pre-defined intervals, AutoKey
examines the Windows desktop, and if any of the protected applications are
active, sends the keystrokes you request to all the applications, just as if
you typed the keys yourself.  AutoKey even protects the data in multiple
running copies of a program.

You can even tell AutoKey to send non-saving keystrokes, causing an
application to perform special functions at the intervals you set up.  For
example, if you're a CIA analyst, tell AutoKey to tell your news reader to
download the latest news from CryptoNet every hour, then automatically search
for such terms as "Japanese Ministry of Trade" or "terrorist attack on New
York City."  Or as a stockbroker you might want to get quotes for Ice Cubes,
Ltd. automatically throughout the day.  And if you're a weather caster in
Tornado Alley, you can have AutoKey instruct your analysis program to download
satellite radar images of your area every hour.

Significant features of AutoKey include:

   *	Keystroke control by way of menu commands or through keyboard 
        accelerators.
   *	Execution of nested menu commands, up to five levels of nesting.
   *	Time, keystroke or mouse click intervals.
   *	The ability to "screen out" applications if they contain untitled 
        works.
   *	A handy notification of pending keystrokes or menu commands.
   *	A defer keystroke, which allows you to intercept and skip a pending 
        keystroke/menu command.

             - AutoKey, Version 2.0 - Packing List -


                          A U T O K E Y
                         ---------------

                           Version 2.0
                          -------------

             M O D I F I C A T I O N   H I S T O R Y
            -----------------------------------------


*	Version 1.0.  March 1992.  Initial release on CompuServe
        and a few other places.

*	Version 2.0.  September 1992.  Fancied up the Main
        Window, added a .INI file capability, improved help file
        access (don't have to put AutoKey in \AUTOKEY directory
        to get help), removed the redundant Turn On/Off button.
        Released lots of places.

Things to look for in the future:

*	Much cleaner user interface.  No more typing; AutoKey
        will learn what you want it to do by recording your
        actions.

*	More glitz.

*	Complete application configuration through the user
        interface.  You should be able to edit the application
        name, window title or EXE file name without disturbing
        other parameters.  (You can get around this now by
        directly editing the AUTOKEY.INI file.)
        
*	Shortcut keystroke macros.  "Schiz" magically becomes
        "Schizophrenia", etc.  The advantage of having AutoKey do
        this is it would happen in every application you use,
        without requiring a macro for each application, or a search-
        and replace operation in your word processor.

*	Enhanced interval control.  Instead of every x minutes,
        you could dispatch autokeys once a day, every hour, once
        a year, after certain keys are typed, etc.

*	Auto-pilot mode.  AutoKey will sit in the background and
        watch what you're doing.  When it sees you telling an
        application (any application) to "File/Save", it'll
        remember that program, and automagically repeat that
        File/Save at some master interval.

*	Expanded application control.  Instead of simple
        keystrokes or menu commands, AutoKey could become a
        full-fledged macro recorder, and it could also execute
        other applications or terminate them at user-specified
        times.

At Simple Software, we love to listen to users.  If you have
suggestions of your own, or if one of the above enhancements
interests you, feel free to let us know.

          Some Definitions:
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          You've probably heard the terms "public domain", "freeware",
          "shareware", and others like them.  Your favorite BBS or disk
          vendor probably has many programs described by one or more of
          these words.  There's a lot of confusion about and between these
          terms, but they actually have specific meanings and implications.
          Once you understand them, you will have a much easier time
          navigating the maze of programs available to you, and
          understanding what your obligations are, or aren't, with each
          type of program.

          Let's start with some basic definitions.

          "Public domain" has a very specific legal meaning.  It means that
          the creator of a work (in this case, software), who had legal
          ownership of that work, has given up ownership and dedicated the
          work "to the public domain".  Once something is in the public
          domain, anyone can use it in any way they choose, and the author
          has no control over the use and cannot demand payment for it.

          If you find a program which the author has explicitly put into
          the public domain, you are free to use it however you see fit
          without paying for the right to use it.  But use care - due to
          the confusion over the meaning of the words, programs are often
          described by authors as being "public domain" when, in fact, they
          are shareware or free, copyrighted software.  To be sure a
          program is public domain, you should look for an explicit
          statement from the author to that effect.

          "Copyrighted" is the opposite of public domain.  A copyrighted
          program is one where the author has asserted his or her legal
          right to control the program's use and distribution by placing
          the legally required copyright notices in the program and
          documentation.  The law gives copyright owners broad rights to
          restrict how their work is distributed, and provides for
          penalties for those who violate these restrictions.  When you
          find a program which is copyrighted, you must use it in
          accordance with the copyright owner's restrictions regarding
          distribution and payment.  Usually, these are clearly stated in
          the program documentation.

          Maintaining a copyright does not necessarily imply charging a
          fee, so it is perfectly possible and legal to have copyrighted
          programs which are distributed free of charge.  The fact that a
          program is free, however, does not mean it is in the public
          domain - though this is a common confusion.

          "Shareware" is copyrighted software which is distributed by
          authors through bulletin boards, on-line services, disk vendors,
          and copies passed among friends.  It is commercial software which
          you are allowed to use and evaluate before paying for it.  This
          makes shareware the ultimate in money back guarantees.

          The Shareware Concept:
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          Most money back guarantees work like this:  You pay for the
          product and then have some period of time to try it out and see
          whether or not you like it.  If you don't like it or find that it
          doesn't do what you need, you return it (undamaged) and at some
          point - which might take months - you get your money back.  Some
          software companies won't even let you try their product!  In
          order to qualify for a refund, the diskette envelope must have an
          unbroken seal.  With these "licensing" agreements, you only

          Simple Software                                      SHR-WARE.DOC


          qualify for your money back if you haven't tried the product.
          How absurd!

          Shareware is very different.  With shareware you get to use it
          for a limited time, without spending a penny.  You are able to
          use the software on your own system(s), in your own special work
          environment, with no sales people looking over your shoulder.  If
          you decide not to continue using it, you throw it away and forget
          all about it.  No paperwork, phone calls, or correspondence to
          waste your valuable time.  If you do continue using it, then -
          and only then - do you pay for it.

          Shareware is a distribution method, NOT a type of software.
          Shareware is produced by accomplished programmers, just like
          retail software.  There is good and bad shareware, just as there
          is good and bad retail software.  The primary difference between
          shareware and retail software is that with shareware you know if
          it's good or bad BEFORE you pay for it.

          As a software user, you benefit because you get to use the
          software to determine whether it meets your needs before you pay
          for it, and authors benefit because they are able to get their
          products into your hands without the hundreds of thousands of
          dollars in expenses it takes to launch a traditional retail
          software product.  There are many programs on the market today
          which would never have become available without the shareware
          marketing method.

          The shareware system and the continued availability of quality
          shareware products depend on your willingness to register and pay
          for the shareware you use.  It's the registration fees you pay
          which allow us to support and continue to develop our products.

          Please show your support for shareware by registering those
          programs you actually use and by passing them on to others.

          Shareware is kept alive by YOUR support!

          The Virus Problem:
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          We've all heard the horror stories about computer viruses.
          Unfortunately, we have also heard lots of conflicting statistics
          and opinions.  When it comes to the virus problem there is a lot
          of confusion among users and even developers.

          The sad truth is that some unscrupulous publishers of anti-virus
          products are using half-truths, overdramatizations, and outright
          fabrication to promote sales of their products.  They delight in
          manipulating statistics to support their marketing efforts.
          While not illegal, these snake-oil tactics are certainly not
          ethical.

          Simple Software                                      SHR-WARE.DOC


          To make matters worse, the media has frequently promoted the
          misinformation promulgated by these unscrupulous individuals
          rather than the straight facts.  While the misinformation may be
          more interesting than the actual facts, the media is not doing
          the computer industry any favors by spreading inaccurate
          information.  To be fair, many newspapers, magazines, and news
          networks are beginning to realize which "virus experts" are
          reliable and which "experts" say whatever is in their own best
          interest.

          One of the most interesting myths that has been promulgated by
          these snake-oil salesmen is that BBSs (Bulletin Board Systems)
          and shareware programs are a major source of virus infections.
          Some corporations are now afraid of shareware and BBS activity
          because of this misinformation.

          In the October 11, 1988 issue of PC Magazine, publisher Bill
          Machrone's editorial was entitled "Shareware or Scareware?".  In
          his article, Bill Machrone points out "The truth is that all
          major viruses to date were transmitted by commercial [retail]
          packages and private mail systems."  That sounds a little
          different than the claims being made by less knowledgeable
          journalists.

          Let's consider for a moment, the distribution differences between
          retail software and shareware software.  Company XYZ releases a
          new version of its retail software product.  At the same time
          company XYZ ships tens of thousands of copies to its retail
          distribution channels, it also ships 30,000 updates to loyal
          users.  Most of those loyal users will receive the update within
          a few days of each other.  This can be a big problem if the
          update happened to be infected with a virus.

          "Not likely", you say?  It has already happened!  Several times!
          There have been seventeen (17) major incidents of virus and
          trojan horse problems in retail software.  Some of these
          incidents affected tens of thousands of users.

          What about shareware?  To date there has been one case of a
          shareware author shipping an infected product.  The virus was
          detected by the disk vendors and the problem was corrected
          immediately.  No users were infected.

          "But it makes sense that programs which are passed around have a
          greater chance of virus infections, doesn't it?"  Think about it.
          Who has the most to lose if viruses were spread by BBSs and
          shareware programs?  The BBS operators, shareware disk vendors
          and the shareware authors, of course.  Because of this, reputable
          BBS operators, disk vendors and shareware authors are very
          careful with the programs they handle.



          Shareware and the ASP                                Page 4 of 10


          Simple Software                                      SHR-WARE.DOC


          Think about it.  Hundreds (even thousands) of BBS operators and
          disk vendors are carefully examining the programs they receive
          and distribute.  Their business depends on it.  This means that
          any given shareware program can go through hundreds (even
          thousands) of checkpoints where the program is carefully
          examined.  If a problem is found, word spreads incredibly fast.
          News travels "on the wires" even faster than the proverbial small
          town gossip.  Programs have disappeared almost overnight as a
          result of this highly efficient communication network.

          If a shareware program has been around for a few months, it has
          been checked for virii and trojan horses many more times than any
          retail software could hope to be checked.  Retail distributors
          don't check the disks they sell.  Even if the publisher checks
          their masters for virii (few do), this is still far less than the
          scrutiny to which shareware programs are subjected.

          There's something else to consider.  Most retail distributors
          have a return policy.  What do they do with packages that are
          returned?  They shrink-wrap them and resell them, of course.  How
          can you be sure that you are the first person to purchase the
          package you just bought at your friendly neighborhood computer
          store?  You can't.  On the other hand, most shareware authors
          erase, reformat, and reduplicate the disks that are returned to
          them.  Which do you think is safer?

          Bill Machrone's article in PC Magazine goes on to say "It's time
          to recognize that there's nothing to fear in shareware.  As a
          distribution medium, it saves you money and helps you try out new
          genres of software with minimum risk."

          Does this mean that we should all start buying shareware instead
          of retail software?  Not at all (although few shareware authors
          would object).  Let's face it, more data has been lost to power
          failures and spilled cups of coffee than all virii, trojan
          horses, and worms combined!  An even bigger threat is plain old
          human error, a mistake, a wrong key press, turning off the power
          while files are open, and so forth.  Accurate information and
          common sense (regular backups) are the best defenses against lost
          data.

          Sure, the virus problem is real.  Virii exist.  But shunning
          shareware is not the answer.  Shareware and BBSs are, quite
          simply, NOT a major source of virus infections.  Some
          corporations have even banned shareware entirely because of fear
          of infections.  This is not only unreasonable, it is also
          expensive.  Think how much they could save in software costs if
          they would only try software before they buy it!

          Is there anything you can do to help protect yourself from virus
          infections?  Absolutely!  Fortunately, the best preventive
          measures are also the least expensive!

          If you need informative, accurate and practical information,
          please read the treatise on "Computer Virus Myths" written by Rob
          Rosenberger and Ross M. Greenberg.  This treatise is available as
          a text file on many BBSs and online services.  It not only gives
          you the facts, it also provides the best overall strategy for
          protecting your computer system.

          As a service to our users, Simple Software includes a copy of
          "Computer Virus Myths" with every registered version we ship.

          Don't let fear stop you from saving money on software.  Don't let
          fear prevent you from trying some of the best software available.
          Shareware is an important market for software.  Take advantage of
          it.  You'll be glad you did!

          The Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP):
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          In the early days of shareware there were no real standards.
          Independent authors had no efficient way to learn from each other
          or to work together to improve the overall image of shareware.
          There was no system in place to ensure that users were treated
          fairly and professionally.  There was no way for users to find an
          address for an author who had moved.  In short, the shareware
          community was disorganized and each author did things the way he
          or she thought was best.  It was clear that if shareware was ever
          to become a viable and respected marketing alternative, there had
          to be some standardization.  There had to be some guidelines to
          best serve the users.

          In 1987 a handful of shareware authors founded the Association of
          Shareware Professionals (ASP).  In forming this industry
          association, these shareware authors had several primary goals in
          mind, including:

              o  To inform users about shareware programs and about
                 shareware as a method of distributing and marketing
                 software.

              o  To foster a high degree of professionalism among shareware
                 authors by setting programming, marketing, and support
                 standards for ASP members to follow.

              o  To encourage broader distribution of shareware through
                 user groups and disk dealers who agree to identify and
                 explain the nature of shareware.

              o  To assist members in marketing their software.

          Simple Software                                      SHR-WARE.DOC


              o  To provide a forum through which ASP members may
                 communicate, share ideas, and learn from each other.

          The newly formed Association of Shareware Professionals worked
          together to draft a code of ethics for all present and future
          members.  This code of ethics included several requirements that
          soon became very popular among users (customers), including:

              o  A member's program (evaluation version) could not be
                 limited (crippled) in any way.  In the true spirit of
                 Try-Before-You-Buy, users must be able to evaluate all the
                 features in a program before paying the registration fee.

              o  Members must respond to every registration.  At the very
                 least they must send a receipt for the payment.

              o  Members must provide technical support for their products
                 for at least 90 days from the date of registration.

          A new system was put in place to help ensure that users were
          treated fairly and professionally.  If a user was unable to
          resolve a problem with a member author then the user could
          contact the ASP Ombudsman with their complaint.  The Ombudsman
          would then try to help resolve the dispute.  For more complete
          details regarding the Ombudsman, please refer to the "ASP
          Ombudsman Statement" below (page 8).

          As of September, 1992, the ASP had over 300 author members and almost
          200 vendor members, with new members joining every week.

          Contacting ASP Members Via CompuServe:
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          There is an easy and convenient way to speak directly to many ASP
          Members (both authors and vendors).  Visit the shareware forum on
          CompuServe.  Simply type "GO SHAREWARE", "GO SHARE", or "GO
          ASPFORUM" from any CompuServe ! prompt.

          Here you will be able to talk to the authors of your favorite
          shareware programs, learn about other programs, ask questions,
          make suggestions, and much more.  We'd love to meet you online,
          please come visit us today!

          Author Address Changes:
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          People move.  Forwarding orders expire.  What can you do?

             "I got a copy of a shareware program written by an ASP Member.
             I sent in the registration fee and the post office returned my
             letter saying that it was undeliverable.  Now what do I do?"

          If the author has moved then chances are very good that you have
          an old version of the program.  This is another situation that
          the ASP can help you to resolve.  ASP Members are required to
          keep the ASP informed of address changes.  If you need to obtain
          the current address for a member, simply write to the following
          address:

             ASP Executive Director
             545 Grover Road
             Muskegon, MI  49442-9427
             U.S.A.

          or send a CompuServe message via CompuServe MAIL to ASP Executive
          Director 72050,1433.  You may also FAX your request to the ASP

          Dr. File Finder's Guide to Shareware:
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          By Mike Callahan and Nick Anis.  Foreword by John C. Dvorak.

             "[Mike's] book distills thousands of hours of his online
             search for the crown jewels of Shareware into one usable
             guide.  As such, it may be the most valuable computer book
             you'll ever buy."
                --Jack Rickard, Publisher, Boardwatch Magazine

             "No one combines Dr. File Finder's comprehensive knowledge of
             the Shareware genre with his good taste in software. This is
             sure to be the definitive place to look for insight and
             program information."
                --Barry Simon, Former President of the Association of
                Shareware Professionals, PC Magazine Columnist, and

             "GREAT!  Every PC user will find something of value within
             these pages.  This book will save you a bundle."

             it."

          Shareware:  "Try Before You Buy" Software:
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          Perhaps you've read Rob Rosenberger's well known and highly
          acclaimed treatise on the computer virus problem.  If you liked
          that article then you'll love his excellent book on Shareware.
          This book is a must for anyone who is interested in Shareware,
          what to look for (and look out for), and where to find it.  In
          this book, shareware author and writer Rob Rosenberger delves
          into the very heart of Shareware, telling you who developed the
          concept and why.

          You'll know why these programs:  * undercut the price of retail
          software * helped bring down the use of copy protection schemes *
          receive numerous editorial and reader survey awards * generate
          more sales than retail software in some cases * make retail OS/2
          software developers so nervous * are falsely accused of spreading
          computer "viruses".

          Rob shows you where you can find good Shareware.  You'll learn to
          beware of companies that make money by abusing the "try before
          you buy" concept.  And you'll discover where Shareware is heading
          in the near future.

             "A lot of good books devote just one or two chapters to the
             concept and history of Shareware.  I'm pleased to say there is
             finally a reference book on the subject."
                --Jim Button, cofounder of the Shareware concept

             "It's filled with accurate information for anyone who wants to
             learn about one of the most significant sources of high-
             quality software."
                --Edward Mendelson, contributing editor, PC Magazine

          What is a site license?  A site license is an inexpensive way for
          more than one person to legally use one copy of a program on more
          than one computer at a time.  Site licenses are designed for
          companies, offices or workgroups where more than one person in
          the organization needs to use a product, but does not need
          additional manuals or disks.  Site licensing enables companies,
          departments, government agencies, etc., to equip their personnel
          with the tools they need at a minimal cost.

          Here's the gist of how it works:  The company purchasing a site
          license (the licensee) provides a single point of contact for
          shipping, technical support, upgrades, etc., and we (the
          licensor) provide a "golden master" of the diskettes, manual, and
          any other parts of the package.

          The following chart gives a breakdown of the cost of site
          licensing and how much you save per site licensed.  For instance,
          if you purchased a site license for 11 users (sites) your cost
          would be $608.30, which saves you $260.70 of the cost of 11
          separate purchases.  The more sites you license, the more you
          save.

          this agreement or the breach thereof shall be settled by
          arbitration in accordance with the commercial rules of the

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We
recommend a 386 with a VGA monitor.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

periodically.  AutoKey can also send other keystrokes or menu commands.

internal and cosmetic.

Please read the PACKING.LST file to confirm that the archive you received

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
