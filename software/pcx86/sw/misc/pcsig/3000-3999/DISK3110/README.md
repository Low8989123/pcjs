	- Network Computing 


The Problem 

If you're like most people, you know how important it is to
regularly back up your hard disk.  But like most people, you
probably don't.  Why?  Because back up is a chore.  It's 
non-productive and traditional backup software - although fast-
requires too much effort, making backup easy to ignore.   
 
Even if you backup once a week or month, all of the files you
have created or changed since your last backup are still exposed.
These files are usually the most important at the time and if 
lost causes the greatest productivity loss.  
 
The Solution 

Its SitBack, a memory resident backup program that keeps your
most recently created and changed files backed up automatically,
in the background, without lifting a finger or exiting the 
programs you are working with.   
 
You remain 100% productive and at the same time 100% protected.   
 
Its perfect for professionals who have more important things
to worry about than the usual hassle involved with other backup
programs, but who's data is critical and time sensitive. 
 
How It Works 

SitBack works when your not by backing up your newly created and
changed files each time your computer is just sitting idle for
an amount of time you can specify.  So your hard disk is kept 
currently backed up throughout the day... automatically and in
the back-ground. 
 
Or you can schedule backups at specific times of the day or week.  
 
Either way it's the perfect utility for those who want complete
peace of mind, without the hassle. 
 
Easy To Use/Setup 

SitBack is easy to install and setup.  Just tell SitBack which
drives, directories or files to backup, how frequently and to 
where.  Once it's setup, the rest is left to SitBack.
You probably won't even know its there.   
 
Major Uses 

It's the perfect companion even if you already own but only
periodically use another backup program or tape drive. 
	 
- Hard disk to floppy, floptical, optical, Bernoulli and Syquest
  drives. 
- Workstation to server 
- Server to server or workstation
