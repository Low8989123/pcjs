The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We
recommend a 386 with a VGA monitor.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

                            WnBrowse 3.2
                            ============

                        A Windows File Browser
                        ======================

                                 By
                                 ==

                           Nigel G. Thomas
                           ===============


Introduction
============

The standard method of viewing files under Windows is to use the provided
accessory program Notepad. As a file viewer however, Notepad has a number
of limitations. It can only be used for relatively small files (less than
53K), and can only view text files. When you view a file using an editor,
you also run the risk of inadvertently modifying the file.

WnBrowse removes these limitations, and in addition provides MANY more
facilities to make file viewing faster and easier.

Some of the highlights of WnBrowse 3.2 are :

  * Support for files of up to 12 megabytes in size
  * Files may be viewed in a text or hex format
  * Text can be selected and copied to the clipboard
  * The file or a selected portion can be printed with optional user
    defined running headers/footers.
  * Font selection capability
  * Selectable colour schemes
  * Drag and Drop file support.
  * One-click operation via the Button-Bar
  * Online Help
  * Optional File Manager Extension.
  * Can list the contents of a ZIP file.

WnBrowse will ONLY run in the standard and Enhanced mode of Windows, it
will NOT run in real mode. 

  **********************************************************************
  * WINDOWS 3.0 USERS - PLEASE NOTE !                                  *
  *                                                                    *
  * As shipped, WnBrowse 3.2 ONLY works with Windows 3.1 and above, it *
  * will NOT work with Windows 3.0 unless you have a copy of the       *
  * Windows 3.1 common dialog DLL COMMDLG.DLL. To save space, this DLL *
  * is not included with WnBrowse. This also applies to the 2.0 level  *
  * of OS/2 (2.1 supports Windows 3.1)                                 *
  **********************************************************************

A 32 bit version of WnBrowse for use under the Windows NT system is under
development. 

Installing WnBrowse
===================

WnBrowse is distributed as six files :

   WNBROWSE.EXE  - The WnBrowse program file
   WNBROWSE.HLP  - The on-line help file
   WNBROWSE.TXT  - Program documentation and registration details.
   WBFXTEN.DLL   - WnBrowse File Manager extension (Windows 3.1 only)
   BWCC.DLL      - The Borland Window Control Class DLL.
   README.NOW    - Information about latest release.

(WnBrowse may also be distributed as a compressed ZIP file (WINBRW.ZIP) in
which case you should use PKUNZIP to expand the file before proceeding).

1. Install the WnBrowse files

   The two WnBrowse files (EXE and HLP) should be copied to a suitable
   directory on your hard disk. You should then define WnBrowse in a
   suitable Program Manager group (refer to your Windows documentation
   for assistance on this procedure). If you are going to use the File
   Manager extension, you should also copy WBFXTEN.DLL to your hard disk.

   Note : In order for Windows to find the WnBrowse help file, it should be
          copied to a file referenced in your DOS PATH statement.

2. Install the Borland DLL.

   The BWCC.DLL file contains a number of routines used by WnBrowse to
   produce better looking dialog boxes. You may already have a copy of this
   file on your system, particularly if you use Borland products. If you
   have, you can continue to use your current copy, otherwise you must copy
   BWCC.DLL to one of the following directories :

     * The directory that contains WNBROWSE.EXE
     * Your Windows directory (usually C:\WINDOWS)
     * Your Windows system directory (usually C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM)
     * Any directory contained in your DOS PATH statement.

3. Install the WnBrowse File Manager Extension (Windows 3.1 only).

   The WnBrowse package includes an optional extension to the Windows
   File Manager that makes browsing files even easier than drag and drop.
   If you wish to install this feature, you must copy the file WBFXTEN.DLL
   to your hard disk and update the File Manager control file WINFILE.INI
   in your Windows directory (usually C:\WINDOWS) to contain the following
   two lines.

   [AddOns]
   WnBrowse=C:\wnbrowse\wbfxten.dll

   Note : (1) The path name (after the '=') must specify the full path
              where WBFXTEN.DLL was copied in step 1.

          (2) If you already have a File Manager extension installed, then
              there will already be an [AddOns] section. In this case,
              simply add the second line after the existing [AddOns].

          (3) If you are not confident about making this change, I suggest
              you save a copy of WINFILE.INI first, or better still get
              the local Windows expert to help.

   When you have updated WINFILE.INI as above, you must stop and restart
   the File Manager for the change to take effect.

    
===========
Please Note
===========

WnBrowse is not freeware or in the public domain, it is Shareware. You may
use WnBrowse without charge for a reasonable period of time to evaluate the
product. If after that time you wish to continue using WnBrowse you must
register your copy using the procedure detailed at the end of this file. 

However, WnBrowse 3.2 is 100% functional and contains no limitations or 
'Nag' boxes.

Procedures
==========

   Selecting Files
   ---------------

   There are four ways of selecting files for browsing with WnBrowse.

   1. Open command
    
      By selecting "Open" from the File menu or by clicking the open 
      button, a dialog box is presented from which a single file can be
      selected. WnBrowse also saves the names of all files contained in
      the file listbox, these can be browsed by selecting the Previous or
      Next file command in the File menu.

   2. Drag and Drop

      When WnBrowse is executed under Windows 3.1 (or higher), the Drag
      and Drop feature can be used to select files. One or more files can
      be dragged from the File Manager and dropped onto the WnBrowse Window
      or the WnBrowse ICON. To facilitate easy drag and dropping, the 
      WnBrowse ICON can be kept on constant display by selecting 'Keep ICON
      on top' from the WnBrowse system menu. 

   3. Command Line

      The name of the file to be browsed can be specified on the WnBrowse
      command line. More than one file can be selected by using the DOS
      wildcards '?' and '*'.

            WNBROWSE.EXE C:\DOCS\*.TXT

      Would select all files in the DOCS directory with a file type of TXT.

   4. WnBrowse File Manager Extension.

      If you installed the optional WnBrowse File Manager Extension for
      Windows 3.1, you can browse files directly from a new File Manager
      menu. The extension adds an extra menu (Browse) to the File Manager
      menu bar. To browse a file (or files), simply select the files in
      the usual way, and select 'Browse Selected File(s)' from the Browse
      menu. The Browse menu option works from both the directory window
      and the search results window.

      If a copy of WnBrowse is not running when the Browse option is
      selected, the WnBrowse File Manager extension attempts to start a 
      copy. For this to work, a copy of WNBROWSE.EXE must be in a directory
      contained in the DOS PATH statement.

      
  Selecting Text
  --------------

  The mouse is used to select text from the file being browsed. The
  selected text is displayed in a different colour to distinguish it
  from unselected text. Selected text can be copied to the Windows
  clipboard (for pasting into other applications), can be printed, or
  can be save to a file.

  Text is selected in the usual way by clicking the mouse at the start or
  end of the required text, and dragging the mouse over the required text.
  If the mouse is dragged outside the boundaries of the WnBrowse window, 
  the file will be scrolled and selected.

  To speed up text selected, the keyboard can be used. For example, click
  and hold the mouse at the start of the required text, then use the
  Page-Down key to scroll through the file, selecting as you go.

  Note : In text mode, selection is done character by character, in hex
         view mode selection is line by line.


  Printing 
  --------

  The File menu contains two commands used to control printing, the first
  'Printer Setup' is used to select the required printer, and to set
  printer options, such as page size. The actual options available will
  vary according to the type of printer being used.

  The second print command 'Print' is used to display a dialog box from
  which file printing is controlled (you can also click on the printer
  button).

  The following options are available :

    * Print full file or only selected text
    * Set the size of the left, top and bottom margins
    * Print with or without user defined headers and footers.

  If the header/footer check box is clicked, the print dialog box is
  expanded to allow the entry of a header and footer line to be printed at
  the top and bottom of each page. Along with the text required in these 
  lines, you may also include the following codes :

      &d - Prints the current date
      &t - Prints the current time
      &f - Prints the name of the file being printed
      &p - Prints the current page number

  Note: The exact format of the time and date is dependant on the current
        control panel settings.

  The slash character '/' can be used to left justify, right justify, or
  centre text within the headers and footers.

  for example :

     &f/&d/Page &p

  would result in :

    wnbrowse.txt                28/08/92                    Page 1

  Page Ejects
  -----------

  When printing a text file, if any line contains a new-page ASCII character
  in position one (hex '0C'), WnBrowse will start a new page before printing
  that line. When printing files that contain new-page characters, you 
  should ensure that the page margins are set to appropriate values.

  Mouse control
  -------------

  While most WnBrowse functions can be controlled by either the mouse
  or the keyboard, some functions are only available via the mouse. One,
  text selection, has already been covered, below are the rest :


     Popup File selection
     --------------------

       When multiple files are available for browsing, a single right
       click of the mouse in the WnBrowse window will produce a popup
       dialog box allowing quick file selection.

     Mouse File positioning
     ----------------------

       If the left mouse button is double clicked on a text line two
       things take place :

         1. The line is scrolled to the top of the window.
         2. The new file position is remembered by WnBrowse.

       If the right mouse button is subsequently double clicked anywhere
       within the WnBrowse text window, the file is repositioned at the
       point saved above. A second right button double click returns to
       the previous position.

     Selecting text to search for
     ----------------------------

       You can quickly find other occurrences of a text string within a
       file by selecting the text you want to search for before clicking
       the Find button or selecting Find from the Search menu. The selected 
       text will be used as the initial string to be searched for.       

     Launch Button
     -------------

       When browsing a file that has an associated program defined, you can
       launch that program by clicking on the Launch button. For example,
       if you click the Launch button while browsing a BMP file, the
       Windows paint brush program will be launched. The associations
       used by WnBrowse are defined using the Windows File Manager.

  
  Keyboard Usage
  --------------

            Key                         Usage    
       ===============  =======================================

        F1              Displays the Help Index 
        F3              Performs a Find Next 
        ESC             Closes the file and iconizes 
 
        ctrl-T          Selects text view mode 
        ctrl-H          Selects hex view mode 
 
        ctrl-M          Toggles the display of the menu 
        ctrl-S          Saves the currently selected options

        Right Arrow     Scrolls right 8 characters 
        Home            Scrolls to the top of the file 
        End             Scrolls to the bottom of the file. 
   

  Saving Options
  --------------

  A large number of WnBrowse options can be changed to match your exact
  requirements, these include the colour scheme, default font etc. To
  avoid having to reset these settings each time you start WnBrowse,
  you can save these settings by using the 'Save Settings' command on
  the Options menu. WnBrowse saves all the settings in a private INI file
  in the Windows directory as WNBROWSE.INI. No changes are made to any of 
  the Windows INI files.

  Named Saved Options
  -------------------

  WnBrowse also allows you to save options as named configurations, 
  allowing you to specify the named configuration at run time.
  To do this you must tell WnBrowse the name of the INI configuration to
  use at startup. This is done by passing the required name as a command
  line parameter.

         WNBROWSE.EXE -Iname

  The dash character indicates a WnBrowse parameter, the 'I' specifies that
  an INI configuration name follows, 'name' can be any name you like (less
  than 20 characters).

  Customizing  File Open Filters
  ------------------------------

  When you select the File open command (or click the open button), the
  common Windows file open dialog box is displayed. Included is a list
  box (List files of type) containing file filters. You can use your
  own list of filters by adding a parameter to the WnBrowse options
  file (WNBROWSE.INI).

  The filter string should consist of one or more pairs of strings
  separated and terminated by a unique character. For example to allow
  for the selection of TXT files or INI files you would code :

    FilterSpec=Text Files (*.TXT)|*.TXT|INI Files (*.INI)|*.INI|

  You may also combine filters into a single selection by separating them
  with a semicolon, for example :

    FilterSpec=Text Files (*.TXT;*.DOC)|*.TXT;*.DOC|

  The First filter in the list is used as the default. The default 
  filter used by WnBrowse is :

    All Files (*.*)|*.*|Text Files (*.TXT)|*.TXT|INI Files (*.INI)|*.INI|
  
  Note : WnBrowse does not perform any sanity checks on the supplied
         string. Failure to provide a valid string will produce
         unpredictable results.   

  Removing WnBrowse from your system
  ----------------------------------

  If after evaluating WnBrowse you decide not to register it, you must
  remove it from your system. To do this delete the following files :

           WNBROWSE.EXE
           WNBROWSE.HLP
           WBFXTEN.DLL
           WNBROWSE.TXT
           
  If you also copied the BWCC.DLL file to your hard disk, this file should
  also be deleted. DON'T delete this file if you had a copy before WnBrowse
  was installed ! 

  If you saved the WnBrowse settings, delete the file WNBROWSE.INI from
  your Windows directory (usually C:\WINDOWS).

  If you installed the WnBrowse File Manager extension, you should remove
  the appropriate line from the [Addons] section of WINFILE.INI.

Techi stuff + Thanks
--------------------

   WnBrowse was developed on an IBM PS/2 model 70 under Windows 3.0 and
   a Dell 466/T under Windows 3.1. It was written in the C language and
   was compiled using the Borland C++ compiler version 3.1. 

   The ICON was provided by Arthur. Thanks Arthur !

   A number of people have contributed to the design of WnBrowse by 
   providing constructive criticism and suggestions for improvements.
   Thanks to all, but particularly to Tom and Jack.
