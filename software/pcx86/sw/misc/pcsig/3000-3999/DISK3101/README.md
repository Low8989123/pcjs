PC-SIG UPDATES PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM

For Immediate Release


PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM UPDATED TO INCLUDE A NEW USER INTERFACE AND MORE
THAN 800 MB OF PROGRAMS June 21, 1992, SUNNYVALE, CALIF. - PC-SIG, Inc.
today announced availability of The Eleventh Edition of the PC-SIG Library
on CD-ROM.  The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM contains over 800 megabytes of
shareware and includes more than 300 new programs, 550 updated programs,
and the addition of 75 megabytes of Windows 3.x shareware.  The
user-interface has been completely re-engineered to take advantage of the
HyperWriter! hypermedia and multimedia authoring system from NTERGAID, Inc.

The implementation of HyperWriter! provides significant performance and
ease of use enhancements.  Programs can access and download much faster
than with previous editions.  Programs have been reorganized and indexed
for better referencing.  Users just c lick with a mouse, or point with the
cursor, on a program name to see a complete description of the program.
Downloading or copying a program is handled automatically by HyperWriter!
Addition of a preview option is especially important for anyone who uses
images, icons, or fonts.  "You can preview the whole library of images to
find the right one," according to Bruce Kent, product development manager.
"This CD finally makes it possi ble to conserve your disk space and paper,
yet still have all the information you need to make an informed decision,"
said Kent.

All new and updated programs have been reviewed and tested by PC-SIG. Every
program goes through extensive virus checking using the most recent version
of VIRUSCAN from McAfee Associates, and other anti-virus software.
According to Kent, "In the ten ye ars we've distributed shareware, we have
never had a confirmed report of a virus on any of our distributed programs
or CD-ROMs."

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, Eleventh Edition has a list price of $179.

Upgrades from previous editions are available for $99.

Users of PC-SIG's Essential Home & Business Collection CD-ROM can upgrade
for $120.

supports one of the world's largest collections of shareware for IBM PCs
and compatible systems.  PC-SIG also publishes Shareware Magazine, which is

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

This file contains information regarding Vision Edit version 3.3
================================================================

IMPORTANT NOTES:
================
If you used any of the older versions of Vision Edit, make sure you have
removed ved.opt and all ved.dsk files. The new options and desktop files are
not compatible with the old ones. If you do not remove the old ved.opt and
ved.dsk warning messages will be displayed: "Error reading Options file."
and "Error reading Desktop file.".
A new file COMMANDS.TXT has been created for your convenience which contains
a list of all Vision Edit commands. You can use it when modifying hotkeys.


LATEST ENHANCEMENTS:
===================
- new KeyCmds menu item now makes it easy for new users to learn all editting
  hot-key commands (Box Commands, Block Commands, Insert/Delete Commands,
  Cursor Movement Commands, Miscellaneous Commands, Set Marker, and GoTo
  Marker);
- new Config menu lets you customize your system:
  - foreign languages support (keyboard redefinition & edit direction): you
    can assign other ASCII codes e.g. other language characters to selected
    keys; you can even edit text from right to left (Hebrew and Arabic
    languages);
  - you can remap most Vision Edit commands (Config|Commands) e.g. you can
    make Vision Edit behave like another editor with commands of which you
    are familiar;
- Block Operations (block selection, copy, cut & paste) in column mode;
- Dragging a selected block both in column and line mode (using a mouse or
  arrow keys);
- drawing boxes with a mouse: just select a drawing style from KeyCmds|Box
  Commands submenu, move the mouse cursor to the desired location, and mark
  two opposite corners of a box by clicking (left mouse button);
- more Options in the Options|Preferences Menu:
  - <Enter> key options (Unix files can be edited);
  - Block Indent options;
  - Show Page Breaks;
- print a file or a selected block directly from a window (Ctrl-K P);
- headers and footers now can be easily created (Print|Header, Print|Footer);
- more Print|Options:
  - Top & Bottom Margins;
  - Use Headers/Footers;
  - Printer Initialization String;
- Search & Replace dialog boxes now display a current word (on which the
  cursor is positioned) as "Text to find" - you do not have to retype the
  word if it already exists in your text file;
- all dialog boxes now have a Help Button
- modified Delete Word (Ctrl-T) function - now works like that in Borland's
  Turbo Pascal IDE;
- File|Dos Shell command now gives you almost all memory available below
  640KB (it can vary between 500-600KB depending on the system configuration);
  this is achieved by swapping contents of RAM memory to either Expanded
  Memory (if available), what gives a very fast performance, or to a temporary
  VED.SWP file which is created on your drive c:;
- new File|Run Program command allows you to run external programs or execute
  DOS external commands from within Vision Edit;
- new File|Save All and File|Close File menu commands;
- the ability to edit Hidden and Read-Only Files;
- increased number of files that can be opened simultaneously;
- hints for menu items (displayed on the Status Line);
- new Windows|List of Files menu function (Alt-0)
- some fixes and internal improvements;

============
The following Macro-Demo files have been provided with Vision Edit:
DEMO.MAC, DEMO1.MAC, DEMO2.MAC, DEMO3.MAC, DEMO4.MAC, DEMO5.MAC.
In order to use any macro-file you have to add it to a list of macros using
a function Read Macro from the Macro menu. After the file have been added
to a macro-list you can run it by selecting it from the list (in Macro menu).


ENTERING ASCII CODES:
=====================
You can enter ASCII codes directly from the keyboard - hold down Alt key,
enter ASCII code from the numeric keypad and release Alt key.
ASCII codes can be entered both into active window and into Search/Replace
dialog boxes.
You can also send ASCII codes to the edit window from the Ascii Table.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

This file contains information regarding Vision Edit version 3.3
================================================================

IMPORTANT NOTES:
================
If you used any of the older versions of Vision Edit, make sure you have
removed ved.opt and all ved.dsk files. The new options and desktop files are
not compatible with the old ones. If you do not remove the old ved.opt and
ved.dsk warning messages will be displayed: "Error reading Options file."
and "Error reading Desktop file.".
A new file COMMANDS.TXT has been created for your convenience which contains
a list of all Vision Edit commands. You can use it when modifying hotkeys.


LATEST ENHANCEMENTS:
===================
- new KeyCmds menu item now makes it easy for new users to learn all editting
  hot-key commands (Box Commands, Block Commands, Insert/Delete Commands,
  Cursor Movement Commands, Miscellaneous Commands, Set Marker, and GoTo
  Marker);
- new Config menu lets you customize your system:
  - foreign languages support (keyboard redefinition & edit direction): you
    can assign other ASCII codes e.g. other language characters to selected
    keys; you can even edit text from right to left (Hebrew and Arabic
    languages);
  - you can remap most Vision Edit commands (Config|Commands) e.g. you can
    make Vision Edit behave like another editor with commands of which you
    are familiar;
- Block Operations (block selection, copy, cut & paste) in column mode;
- Dragging a selected block both in column and line mode (using a mouse or
  arrow keys);
- drawing boxes with a mouse: just select a drawing style from KeyCmds|Box
  Commands submenu, move the mouse cursor to the desired location, and mark
  two opposite corners of a box by clicking (left mouse button);
- more Options in the Options|Preferences Menu:
  - <Enter> key options (Unix files can be edited);
  - Block Indent options;
  - Show Page Breaks;
- print a file or a selected block directly from a window (Ctrl-K P);
- headers and footers now can be easily created (Print|Header, Print|Footer);
- more Print|Options:
  - Top & Bottom Margins;
  - Use Headers/Footers;
  - Printer Initialization String;
- Search & Replace dialog boxes now display a current word (on which the
  cursor is positioned) as "Text to find" - you do not have to retype the
  word if it already exists in your text file;
- all dialog boxes now have a Help Button
- modified Delete Word (Ctrl-T) function - now works like that in Borland's
  Turbo Pascal IDE;
- File|Dos Shell command now gives you almost all memory available below
  640KB (it can vary between 500-600KB depending on the system configuration);
  this is achieved by swapping contents of RAM memory to either Expanded
  Memory (if available), what gives a very fast performance, or to a temporary
  VED.SWP file which is created on your drive c:;
- new File|Run Program command allows you to run external programs or execute
  DOS external commands from within Vision Edit;
- new File|Save All and File|Close File menu commands;
- the ability to edit Hidden and Read-Only Files;
- increased number of files that can be opened simultaneously;
- hints for menu items (displayed on the Status Line);
- new Windows|List of Files menu function (Alt-0)
- some fixes and internal improvements;


MACRO DEMOS:
============
The following Macro-Demo files have been provided with Vision Edit:
DEMO.MAC, DEMO1.MAC, DEMO2.MAC, DEMO3.MAC, DEMO4.MAC, DEMO5.MAC.
In order to use any macro-file you have to add it to a list of macros using
a function Read Macro from the Macro menu. After the file have been added
to a macro-list you can run it by selecting it from the list (in Macro menu).


ENTERING ASCII CODES:
=====================
You can enter ASCII codes directly from the keyboard - hold down Alt key,
enter ASCII code from the numeric keypad and release Alt key.
ASCII codes can be entered both into active window and into Search/Replace
dialog boxes.
You can also send ASCII codes to the edit window from the Ascii Table.


NAMING CONVENTIONS:
===================
- vedNNN.zip :unregistered, regular VED, version number is NNN;
- vedNNNr.zip :registered, regular VED, version number is NNN;
- vedNNNa.zip :registered, 286 version of VED, version number is NNN;
