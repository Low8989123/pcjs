    Short Description:

               Contains 4 great Win3.1 Screen Savers, TrueType Fonts, and icons!
                              
       For BBS file descriptions that can handle larger blurbs:
 
               This is a package containing 4 original Windows 3.1 animated
               Screen Savers, 2 TrueType fonts, and over 100 icons!  Comes 
               complete with a quick and easy "setup" program.  Simply run 
               "setup" and then activate these Win3.1 screen saver add-ons 
               and Fonts via the Windows Control Panel.
               
    Long Description:
    -----------------

       With the advent of Windows 3.1, Windows now offers built-in support
       for animated, graphical screen savers, impressive TrueType fonts, and
       of course icons.  
       
       A screen saver is a program that will animate the computer
       display after a certain "timeout" period to keep a moving image
       on the screen so that the computer screen won't become burned-in.
       "Burn in" can result from having a computer screen displaying the
       same image for long periods of time, and ruins a monitor
       necessitating it's replacement.  Screen burn-in is NOT uncommon.
    
       By installing WinPak#1, users can select from 4 new screen savers
       that offer a variety of advanced, entertaining screen animations.
       Each of these screen savers allow the option of setting a custom
       timeout value and an optional security password.
       
       These screen savers can be used to save screens, to provide 
       entertaining animation sequences, and to provide for password
       security while away from the computer.

       The fonts in this package are original, unique fonts that will spruce
       up any document, and provide the appropriate look for professional
       quality documents.
       
       Please refer to the documentation for more details on this handy, 
       easy to use package.

       Hello and welcome  to  the  WinPak#1  software package from Rhode
       Island Soft Systems, Inc.!  
   
       This package contains four unique, custom designed  screen  saver
       modules, two TrueType fonts, and over 100 icons, all for use with
       Windows  3.1.   This  package  contains an automated installation
       utility that should be used  to install the screen saver modules.
       It should be noted that registered users of WinPak#1 receive  the
       full  "Deluxe"  version  of WinPak#1 which contains everything in
       this shareware version PLUS 2 more screen savers, 2 more TrueType
       fonts, and over 100 more icons!
       
       Most of the files in  this  package  are compressed using the DOS
       "COMPRESS" and "EXPAND" utilities.  The compressed files end with
       an   underscore   on   the   distribution   diskette,   such   as
       "WINPAK1A.SC_".   The  installation  program  will  automatically
       uncompress these files.
       
       This package must be installed in  the  main  Windows  directory,
       such  as  "C:\WINDOWS",  or  whatever  that  directory is on your
       particular computer.  The installation  program will ask for this
       directory upon start-up.  The documentation and  other  ancillary
       files  will be placed in a sub-directory called "WINPAK#1", below
       the main Windows directory.  If  you specify "C:\WINDOWS" as your
       Windows directory, then the documentation files will be copied to
       "C:\WINDOWS\WINPAK#1" for example.

       The  following  information will guide you through installing the
       WINPAK#1 files.  Once installed, the  SETUP program will create a
       program group and install  icons  for  the  documentation  files,
       which you can read by clicking on the document's icon.
   
   

                             VERIFICATION OF FILES 
                             ---------------------
                             
       At this point, please look  for  all  of the files that belong to
       the WinPak#1 package.  All of the files are listed  in  the  file
       PACKING.TXT If the PACKING.TXT file or any of the files listed in
       PACKING.TXT  are  missing, please contact us for an official copy
       of WinPak#1 -- it would not  be  fair to either the user or Rhode
       Island Soft Systems, Inc.  to have a user evaluate an  incomplete
       package.

                              INSTALLING WINPAK#1
                              -------------------
                               
       WinPak#1  is shipped with a comprehensive installation program to
       automate traditional installation.  To install WinPak#1, you must
       be in the Windows environment.   To  install WinPak#1 we will use
       the SETUP program supplied as part of the package.
       
       From Program Manager's main window,  select  "File".   This  will
       cause  a menu to drop down.  Next, select "Run...".  A dialog box
       will pop up requesting a "Command Line".
       
       If the WinPak#1 files are  on  a floppy disk, insert the diskette
       into  the  A:  or  B:  drive,  as  appropriate  and  type  either
       "A:\SETUP" or "B:\SETUP",  respectively.   We  must  execute  the
       "SETUP" program that is located on the floppy disk.
       
       If  the  WinPak#1 files are in a directory on a hard drive, enter
       the full drive and directory path to where the WinPak#1 files are
       located, such as: "C:\DOWNLOAD\TEMP\SETUP".
       
       Please note that these are just examples -- the directories names
       and  drives  will  certainly  be  different  for  each individual
       computer.  The above examples are for illustrative purposes only.

       After entering the command to execute SETUP, press the ENTER  key
       or click on the "OK" button.

       At this point SETUP will handle the entire process of installing
       the WinPak#1 files.  
       
       To activate the screen savers, we must first  select  the  "Main"
       group in Program Manager.  Next, select the "Control Panel" icon.
       Finally,  within  Control  Panel, select the "Desktop" icon.  The
       "Screen Saver" portion of  the  dialog  box  will now contain the
       WinPak#1 modules in  the  list  of  Screen  Saver  "Names".   The
       WinPak#1  modules  can  be  easily identified as they are labeled
       with "WP1=>".

       To  install  the TrueType fonts, enter the Control Panel from the
       Main Program Manager Group.   Select  the "Fonts" icon in Control
       Panel.  Next, select "Add" to add  the  fonts  in  this  package.
       Choose  "Select  All"  and then click on the "OK" button.  That's
       all there is to do -- the fonts are now installed!

       To use the icons, simply specify the file "WP1ICON1.DLL" any time
       you  want  to  specify an icon, and select any of the icons  that
       are presented.

       The icons  in  the  WP1ICON1.DLL  file  are  included courtesy of
       Software Co-Op and are part of a larger  package  of  1700  icons
       published  by Villa Crespo Software.  Look for LexIcon in a store
       near you!

       o  Many BBSs customarily add a small text file                        
          (advertisement) to each archived file.  This text file             
          describes the BBS and tells people that the file was               
          downloaded from that particular BBS.  Other BBSs add a             
          small one-line message with their BBS name and phone               
          number into the compressed file, which will display when           
          the file is uncompressed.  Either of these methods of              
          mentioning your BBS are acceptable and may be used,                
          provided the program and documentation is otherwise                
          unmodified and complete.                                           

       o  Small additions to the package, such as the introductory
          or installation batch files used by many shareware disk
          vendors, are acceptable so long as they identify themselves
          as being added by the distributor, and not part of WinPak#1.
          The files may be archived into a single distribution file
          in accordance with the restrictions listed in DESCRIBE.TXT
          (ie. archive's filename).
                                                                                       
       o  No price or other compensation may be charged for the WinPak#1
          package.  A distribution fee may be charged for the cost of the
          diskette, shipping, and handling, as long as the total (per disk)
          does not exceed US$8.00 in the U.S. and Canada, or US$12.00
          Internationally.
          
       o  In order to maximize resources, Vendors often provide several 
          different programs/packages on a single disk -- this is perfectly 
          acceptable to Rhode Island Soft Systems, Inc.  We require that
          the WinPak#1 files be bundled in such a way as to be presented 
          as distinct and separate from those of other packages.  Archiving
          our distribution files into a single file (in accordance with 
          guidelines set forth in DESCRIBE.TXT) is a suggested method of 
          accomplishing this goal.
       
       o  Rhode Island Soft Systems prohibits the distribution of            
          outdated versions of the WinPak#1 package, without written         
          permission from Rhode Island Soft Systems.  If the version         
          you have obtained is over nine (9) months old, please            
          contact us to ensure that you have the most current                
          version. Please see the release date at the top of this file.  
                                                                             
       o  Distributors carrying WinPak#1 must inform Rhode Island
          Soft Systems, Inc. of the intent to distribute WinPak#1 (a
          post card will suffice) and must cease distribution immediately
          upon receipt of a written request from Rhode Island Soft 
          Systems, Inc. (should we request cessation of distribution).
          
       o  The PRINTED User's Guide may not be reproduced in whole or in 
          part, using any means, without the written permission of Rhode 
          Island Soft Systems.  In other words, the disk-based documentation 
          may not be distributed in PRINTED (hardcopy) form.

          Shareware is "Try-Before-You-Buy" software, it is not free.

       o  The WinPak#1 package CANNOT be sold as part of some other inclusive

   CD-ROM and/or "Rack" Vendors:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
      o   Any distributor who wishes to include WinPak#1 on a CD-ROM
          must contact Rhode Island Soft Systems, Inc. for explicit,
          individual permission prior to any such inclusion.
          
      o   Any distributor wishing to package WinPak#1 on disks(s) for
          sale in retail establishments ("Rack" Vendors), or on any other
          such "point of purchase" display,  must contact Rhode Island Soft 
          Systems, Inc. for explicit, individual permission prior to any 
          such distribution.
          
      o   It is the policy of Rhode Island Soft Systems, Inc. to require
          royalty payments for sales of products containing WinPak#1 by
          CD-ROM and "Rack" vendors.
          
      o   CD-ROM and "Rack" Vendors must adhere to all items in the 
          previous section.
