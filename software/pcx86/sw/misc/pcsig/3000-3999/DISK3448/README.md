This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
900 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'INSTALL' at
the DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy
access to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.  All the programs are logically divided into thirteen
major categories with subcategories, making it easier to find just the
right software.

All of the programs have been scanned for viruses.  There are also three
online virus utilities that can be run from the CD-ROM which will scan,
screen and clean viruses.  Not only does this save hard disk space, but
also gives every user added security from viruses.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

Winner of the Optical Publishing Assn's Best Consumer Product Award.

Shareware for every imaginable need: Accounting Chemistry Educational
Engineering Games Hypertext Networks Programming Spreadsheets Utilities
Word Processing

Additional BBS file descriptions are available from PC-SIG so that the
CD-ROM can be set up quickly on a bulletin board.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 530K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
a graphics monitor (Hercules/EGA/VGA/SVGA).  A mouse is optional.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.


                      The PC-SIG Games CD-ROM
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now you can play a game a day fo over a year.  This CD-ROM is jammed
with over 380 shareware games of all types, designed to appeal to the
new generation of CD-ROM users out for fun.  The CD incorporates a
hypermedia interface and allows 250 of the games to be played directly
from the CD-ROM.

The hottest games in shareware are on this disk, including the
action/arcade games "Jill of the Jungle" and "Wolfenstein 3D," which
rival or surpass commercial PC and Nintendo for use of animation,
SoundBlaster audio, and VGA graphics.  There are also games designed to
teach children mathematics, spelling and even ecology.  All these games
for less than a dime each!

Over 250 of the games can be played directly from the CD without copying
them to a floppy or a hard drive.  Being able to run from the CD means
that users can explore games without using up valuable hard disk space
or spending time downloading and deleting files.  The hypermedia
interface makes it easy to browse the titles, read a one line
description or full review, and copy or start a game by clicking the
mouse or using the keyboard.

==========================================================
Description:
============
InfoTag is a utility for attaching a one line, up to 255
characters, to any file. You simply drag a file from the
Windows File Manager and drop it on the InfoTag icon to
tag(store) or view a description for any given file.

==========================================================
Requirements:
=============
InfoTag was designed in Microsoft Visual Basic v2.0 and therefore
requires that you have the VBRUN200.DLL file in your Windows
directory. This .DLL file is required by ALL programs designed
in Visual Basic. This file is not included with this program
since most people have it already and it adds another 357k to
the size of the ZIP that you will be downloading. If you do
not have this file, you can download it from Compuserve or
just about any other BBS system you can get access to. If all
else fails, the file is available for downloading via my BBS
which is listed above.

In order to take advantage of the Drag'n'Drop feature, you
must be running Microsoft Windows version 3.1 or later.

===========================================================
GETTING STARTED:
================

Installing InfoTag
==================

1) UNZIP the file INFOTAG.ZIP and run the INSTALL.EXE program.
   This will install the InfoTag files to a specified directory.
   The install does not currently setup InfoTag as an icon on your
   desktop, I'm working on that so it will in the next version.

2) Setup an Icon for InfoTag in one of your Program Manager
   Groups. Select/Open the group that you wish to place the
   InfoTag icon in. Pulldown the FILE menu and then select
   NEW. Select PROGRAM ITEM and then select OK. You may enter
   your own description or just put InfoTag as the DESCRIPTION.
   Under COMMAND LINE, enter the program name and path that you
   installed the files to. The executable is INFOTAG.EXE.

   Select OK.

   This will create an icon in your Program Manager group for
   the InfoTag program.

3) To run InfoTag, simply double-click on the icon.



Using InfoTag
=============

   Using InfoTag is extremely easy! Simply run InfoTag, it will
load and run minimized. There are 3 ways to use InfoTag:

1) Drag any file from File Manager and Drop it on the InfoTag icon.

2) Maximize the InfoTag program and use the various controls to
   navigate through your drives, directories and files.
   Click on the desired file in InfoTag's file list box.

3) Maximize the InfoTag program and manually type in the name of
   the desired program in the InfoTag filename input box. No path
   is required to be specified, just the filename and extension.
   Then press <ENTER>.


After performing any of the above methods, InfoTag will scan its
lists and attempt to ID the selected file. If InfoTag cannot ID
the selected file, the text box at the bottom of the InfoTag window
will show '<<< No Description Found >>>'. If InfoTag was successful
in IDing the selected file, the description will be displayed in the
text box. If you wish to enter a description or change an existing
one, simply select the bottom text box and start typing. When InfoTag
detects a change in this text box, the SAVE DESCRIPTION button will
become enabled. When done typing, select the SAVE DESCRIPTION button
or press <ENTER> to store the description and associate it with the
selected file.


Thats it! Thats all she wrote!


PACKING LIST
============
Make sure the following files are in the ZIP.

INFOTAG.EXE      The InfoTag program.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
