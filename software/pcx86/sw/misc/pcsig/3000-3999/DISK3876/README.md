The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We
recommend a 386 with a VGA monitor.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

Documentation for ZK-SHELL.SMM macro

This macro will run ZK-Shell.  After looking up the Zip Code or City 
& State, click on "Paste and Minimize" and this macro will then paste 
the contents of the clipboard at the current cursor postion in your 
Ami-Pro document.

The line in the macro that includes the exec command to run ZK-Shell 
must be the correct path for zk-shell.exe. The default is:
    exec("c:\zipkey\zk-shell.exe "," /) 
If ZK-Shell does not function properly, then you will need to modify 
the macro to specify the full path name for ZK-Shell.

To make things really easy, enter a shortcut key for this macro. If 
you use it often, then modify the icon bar under "View", "Display 
Preferences, "Icons" and add an icon for the shortcut key for this

          1  Introduction


          What is ZK-Shell?  ZK-Shell is a shell program that will allow
          you to use the popular DOS  memory resident program ZIPKEY in
          Microsoft Windows.

          ZIPKEY is required to use this program.  If you do not have a
          copy of ZIPKEY you can obtain an  evaluation copy from your
          favorite shareware disk vendor, BBS or by calling 1-800-IBM-DISK
          and asking for the ZIPKEY shareware disk.  This number is for the
          Public Brand Software  shareware vendor in Indianapolis, Indiana.

          ZIPKEY may also be purchased directly from:

          Eric Isaacson Software
          416 E. University Avenue
          Bloomington, Indiana 47401-4739

          This program will allow you to enter a known ZIP code, call
          ZIPKEY to look up the city and state  and then type the City,
          State and ZIP code into your word processor.  If you need to look
          up a  ZIP code, you can enter the two letter state abbreviation
          and the city name and ZK-Shell will  have ZIPKEY look up the ZIP
          code for you.


          2  How To Install ZK-Shell


          You must have a copy of ZIPKEY to use the ZK-Shell program.  If
          you do not have this program contact your favorite shareware dis-
          tributor or search out a copy on your favorite BBS system. See
          above in the introduction.

              o  Copy the ZK-Shell Files

                 Copy the two ZK-Shell files into the directory that you
                 have ZIPKEY installed.  The two files are ZK-SHELL.EXE and
                 ZK-SHELL.HLP.  ZK-SHELL.HLP is necessary if you want to be
                 able to access the help system from within ZK-Shell.

              o  Start Windows

              o  Open the Program Manager Window
                 Add a program item to a group you want to add the ZK-Shell
                 icon.

                     -  Open the group window for the group you want to add
                        the icon. This might be your word processing group
                        or possibly your utilities group.

                     -  Choose "New" from the "File" menu.
                        The 'New Program Object" dialog box appears.


                                        - 2 -


                     -  Select "Program Item" and choose "OK".

                     -  Type the description you want to be displayed under
                        the icon.

                        Example:

                                ZK-Shell

                     -  Type the path and file name of the ZK-Shell
                        program.  This is the path that you copied the ZK-
                        Shell program files into above.

                        Example:

                                C:\ZIPKEY\ZK-SHELL.EXE

                     -  Choose "OK"
                        The dialog box disappears and your icon is
                        displayed in the group box.


          3  Setup


          In order to use ZK-Shell to paste the City, State and ZIP code
          into your word processor, you  must tell ZK-Shell the format to
          use.  There are three formats:

          The normal letter format:
                  St. Petersburg, Florida 33712-5631

          The letter using two letter state abbreviation:
                  St. Petersburg, FL 33712-5631

          The US post office desired method:
                  ST. PETERSBURG  FL  33712-5631

          In order to use ZK-Shell, you must first have the ZIPKEY program
          loaded into memory before  starting Windows.  This may be ac-
          complished by adding the loading of ZIPKEY into your
          AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  If you do not have ZIPKEY loaded, ZK-Shell
          will give you an error  message to let you know that it's not
          loaded.

          ZIPKEY is a memory resident program for looking up ZIP codes from
          supplied state and city  names or city and state names from
          supplied ZIP codes.  ZIPKEY is a trademark of Eric  Isaacson
          Software.

          4  Look in ZIPKEY


          First a little about moving around ZK-Shell.  The Tab key will
          move the cursor from field to field  and button to button.  The
          Shift+Tab will reverse this movement.  You may also select the
          buttons with the Alt+[the underlined character] in the buttons.

          The area just below the "Enter ZIP Code" and above the list box
          is where the city, state and ZIP  will be displayed for pasting
          into your word processor.  The Paste and Minimize button will
          perform the paste function for you.  We have provided macros for
          the popular word processors  making this as seamless as possible.
          See the text file README.1ST for pointers to the various  macros.

          As you type the state and city in ZK-Shell, the list box will
          display possible cities and ZIP codes.  You can double click a
          line in the list box to select it or use the keyboard by tabbing
          to the list box, using the up and down keys to mark an entry and
          press enter to select.

          If you look up a ZIP code and want to do another, you should use
          the Clear and Start Again  button to start over.

          There are several ways to use ZK-Shell to interface with ZIPKEY.

          A general need is to look up a ZIP code for a city and state that
          is known.  The ZK-Shell program  window has three data entry
          areas.  Two of these areas are "Enter State" and "Enter City".
          To  look up a ZIP code, you would type in the two letter state
          abbreviation in the Enter State field and  then the full city
          name in the Enter City field.  In  cases of multiple ZIP cities,
          a list of ZIP codes will be displayed in the list box.  If there
          are more  than can be displayed in the on screen box, a scroll
          bar will allow access to the overflow.  Don't  forget to use the
          Clear and Start Again button to do additional searches.

          If you have the ZIP code but are unsure about how to spell a City
          name, you can use the feature  to look up the city and state and
          paste it into your word processor.  In this case, you would enter
          the ZIP code in the "Enter ZIP Code" field of the program and
          press the Paste  and Minimize button.  Remember, you can also use
          the underlined shortcut keys by pressing Alt  plus the underlined
          key on the button.


          5  Paste and Minimize


          The Paste and Minimize button will minimize the ZK-Shell appli-
          cation to an Icon and paste the  City, State and ZIP code as
          displayed on the screen into the clip board for passing to your
          word  processor.  We have supplied macros to make this a seamless
          paste into your word processors.


                                        - 4 -


          6  Clear and Start Again


          This button should be used if you are going to look up more than
          one ZIP code or City and State.   Use it after each lookup is
          complete.


          7  Exit


          Believe it or not, Exit needs a little explanation.  You may exit
          this program using several different  methods, by your choice.
          The Exit button, or selecting the File, Exit selection, by
          pressing Alt+X  or double clicking on the close button at the top
          of the window.  No matter which one you chose,  they all still
          just close the application and exit to the state prior to
          entering ZK-Shell.


          8  Legal Stuff and Shareware


          Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software
          before buying it. If you try a Shareware program and continue
          using it, you are expected to register. Individual programs
          differ on details -- some request registration while others
          require it, some specify a maximum trial period. With regis-
          tration, you get anything from the simple right to continue using
          the software to an updated program with printed manual.

          Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software,
          and the copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific
          exceptions as stated below. Shareware authors are accomplished
          programmers, just like commercial authors, and the programs are
          of comparable quality. (In both cases, there are good programs
          and bad ones!) The main difference is in the method of distri-
          bution. The author specifically grants the right to copy and
          distribute the software, either to all and sundry or to a
          specific group. For example, some authors require written per-
          mission before a commercial disk vendor may copy their Shareware.

          Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. You
          should find software that suits your needs and pocketbook,
          whether it's commercial or Shareware. The Shareware system makes
          fitting your needs easier, because you can try before you buy.
          And because the overhead is low, prices are low also. Shareware
          has the ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the
          product, you don't pay for it.

                               DISCLAIMER - AGREEMENT

          Users of ZK-Shell must accept this disclaimer of warranty: "ZK-
          Shell is supplied as is.  The author disclaims all warranties,


                                        - 5 -


          expressed or implied, including, without limitation, the war-
          ranties of merchantability and of fitness for any purpose.  The
          author assumes no liability for damages, direct or consequential,
          which may result from the use of ZK-Shell."

          ZK-Shell is a "shareware program" and is provided at no charge to
          the user for evaluation.  Feel free to share it with your
          friends, but please do not give it away altered or as part of
          another system.  The essence of "user-supported" software is to
          provide personal computer users with quality software without
          high prices, and yet to provide incentive for programmers to
          continue to develop new products.  If you find this program
          useful and find that you are using ZK-Shell and continue to use
          ZK-Shell after a reasonable trial period, you must make a regis-
          tration payment of $20.00 to ZPAY Payroll Systems, Inc.  The
          $20.00 registration fee will license one copy for use on any one
          computer at any one time.  You must treat this software just like
          a book.  An example is that this software may be used by any
          number of people and may be freely moved from one computer
          location to another, so long as there is no possibility of it
          being used at one location while it's being used at another.
          Just as a book cannot be read by two different persons at the
          same time.

          Commercial users of ZK-Shell must register and pay for their
          copies of ZK-Shell within 30 days of first use or their license
          is withdrawn.  Site-License arrangements may be made by con-
          tacting ZPAY Payroll Systems, Inc.

          Anyone distributing ZK-Shell for any kind of remuneration must
          first contact ZPAY Payroll Systems, Inc. at the address above for
          authorization.  This authorization will be automatically granted
          to distributors recognized by the (ASP) as adhering to its guide-
          lines for shareware distributors, and such distributors may begin
          offering ZK-Shell immediately (However ZPAY Payroll Systems, Inc.
          must still be advised so that the distributor can be kept up-to-
          date with the latest version of ZK-Shell.).

          You are encouraged to pass a copy of ZK-Shell along to your
          friends for evaluation.  Please encourage them to register their
          copy if they find that they can use it.  All registered users
          will receive the code to turn off the registration reminder
          screen.

                 Member ASP (Association of Shareware Professionals)

          Paul Mayer is a Member of The Association of Shareware Profes-
          sionals (ASP).  ASP has established stringent standards for its
          members.  ASP wants to make sure that the shareware principle
          works for you.  If you are unable to resolve a problem with an
          ASP member (other than technical support), ASP may be able to
          help.  Please write to the ASP Ombudsman at 545 Grover Road,
