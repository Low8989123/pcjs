                               README FILE FOR
                      THE INSIDE SECRETS OF CREDIT REPAIR

       INTRODUCTION

       Thank you for trying The Inside Secrets  of  Credit  Repair.  The
       program is designed to provide you with the knowledge  and  tools
       to perform   credit  repair  using  the  rights  granted  to  all
       consumers by Congress in the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

       If you are not  familiar  with  the  process  of  credit  repair,
       perhaps a brief explanation will help.


       INTRODUCTION TO CREDIT REPAIR

       Companies whom you have (or  had)  accounts  where  payments  are
       being made to  pay  for  merchandise  or  services  (installments
       loans, revolving charge accounts, etc.) can report to one or more
       credit bureaus the history or current status of your account.


       These reports may be positive (account in good standing, paid off
       as agreed, etc.) or they  may  be  negative  (payment  past  due,
       account charged off, etc.). While no  harm  is  done  to  you  by
       positive reports, negative reports are potentially  damaging.  In
       most cases  these  negative  reports  are  accurate,  i.e.,  they
       reflect actual past due  payments  or  other  problems  with  the
       account. Therefore, being accurate, you cannot have them  removed
       from your credit report simply by asking.

       However, you have the right to question the validity or  accuracy
       of any entry. The Fair Credit Reporting Act specified the  rights
       of an individual in making sure that the  credit  bureaus  report
       factual and verifiable credit related information about them. The
       Fair Credit Reporting Act, therefore, gave  individuals  a  great
       deal of power to insure that what is being reported about them is
       accurate.

       The ability to question entries in  your  credit  report  is  the
       foundation of credit  repair.  If,  upon  questioning  the  entry
       (called disputing the entry) the credit  bureau  finds  that  the
       information is not accurate, it must be  changed  promptly.  This
       will often lead to changing a negative entry to a positive entry.
       And, as most people have learned, negative entries often lead  to
       credit denial because the creditor to whom you are  applying  may
       assume that your poor credit history indicates that you will  not
       pay your debt with them as agreed. Whether this is fair or not is
       not really the issue. Unfortunately,  creditors  don't  have  too
       many other alternatives to determine if you will  pay  your  debt
       before they loan you the money or sell you their  merchandise  on
       credit.

       If the credit bureau can't get verification of the  entry  within
       45 days of your dispute, the entry in question  must  be  deleted
       from your credit report, accurate or not. Not being able  to  get
       verification is frequently the case. Companies go out of business
       or can't produce the records on you (or can't be bothered). Thus,
       credit repair is partly a  process  of  seeking  verification  of
       information reported about you. If  the  originator  of  negative
       information can't back up their claim upon your request to do so,
       such claim should be removed and no mention made of it again.

       Your right to dispute entries in your credit report gives you the
       ability to monitor, and possible change, what is  being  reported
       about you concerning your credit history. As long as you are  not
       frivolous (discussed in the  program)  the  results  of  properly
       using  your right  to  dispute  credit  report  entries  can   be
       rewarding.

       Of course, there is much more to be learned about  credit  repair
       using the Inside Secrets of Credit Repair. This has only  been  a
       short introduction. Not only will you learn about  credit  repair
       with the program, but you  will  find  many  valuable  tools  for
       credit repair.


       PROGRAM FEATURES

       An example of the credit repair tools included  in  this  program
       are  credit  report  request  letters.  By  entering  information
       specific to you, these  prewritten  letters  will  allow  you  to
       request your credit report from the three  main  credit  bureaus.
       There are many other prewritten letters included to make the task
       of credit repair easy and effective.

       In addition to many prewritten letters, you will find other tools
       such as complete definitions of the codes  used  in  your  credit
       report, sample dispute statements  you  can  use,  the  full  and
       unmodified Fair Credit Report Act and  a  Case  Study  of  credit
       repair. In addition to these  tools,  the  program  has  powerful
       features such as on-line help, word searching and book marking to
       help make credit repair an easy and rewarding task.

       
                   DISCLAIMERS, NOTICES AND RIGHTS OF PARTIES

       read selected sections that apply to them.


       Before we get  you started with the program, you are requested to
       read the following information  if  it  applies  to  you.  It  is
       imperative that you  understand what this program  intends  to do
       for you and what your rights and  obligations  are  pertaining to
       the use of this program.

       techniques of credit repair.


       DISTRIBUTION AND REPRODUCTION RIGHTS
       Read this section only if you intend to distribute this program.

       This evaluation copy of The Inside Secrets of Credit  Repair  may
       be sold as shareware by Distributors whose  primary  business  is
       the selling of shareware. No specific permission is required  for
       a shareware Distributor to copy and sell this program as long  as
       they abide by  the  restrictions  contained  herein.  However,  a
       Distributor must discontinue the sale and  distribution  of  this
       program when notified by InfoTek in writing to  discontinue  such
       sale and distribution.

       Distributors may freely copy this evaluation copy of  The  Inside
       Secrets of Credit Repair for purposes of selling it through their
       normal channel of shareware distribution as long as  the  program
       is copied in its entirety and reasonable  care  is  exercised  to
       avoid contamination by computer and software viruses. The  author
       prefers that this program not be combined on  a  single  disk  or
       hard  drive  with  other  shareware  programs.  However,  if  the
       Distributor feels that the other programs do not impact the value
       and usability of this program, and they copy it as  a  compressed
       file or place the uncompressed files into its own directory, they
       may combine this program with other shareware programs  at  their
       discretion.

       Shareware Distributors may add value to this program by including
       user instructions, automated installation  batch  files,  and  so
       forth. But, they must in no way  modify  the  actual  program  to
       accomplish this or modify or replace  program  related  files  or
       otherwise impact the intended functionality of this  program  and
       its related files.



       Distributors may charge a fee that is consistent  with  the  fees
       they charge for other shareware programs they distribute, but  in
       no case shall the fee charged for  this  evaluation  copy  exceed
       $10.00. Shareware Distributors are encouraged to offer  a  prompt
       and unconditional  money  back  guarantee,  but  this  is  not  a
       requirement for selling this program.

       Distributors  may  request,  in   writing   on   their   business
       letterhead, the latest revision of this program.  Unless  InfoTek
       or the author feel that the requesting party is not a  legitimate
       Shareware Distributor, a new or higher revision  of  the  program
       will be promptly mailed at no cost. If a higher revision  is  not
       available at the time of request, notice will  be  sent  by  mail
       that the revision in the possession of the Distributor is current
       and no disk will be sent.

       These shareware Distributor restrictions and policies  have  been
       designed to protect users from obtaining a  damaged  or  impaired
       program and to insure that the price charged for this program  is
       consistent with other  shareware  programs  sold  for  evaluation
       purposes. In all cases, shareware  Distributors  are  responsible
       for their own conduct as it pertains to the sale of this program.
 
       NOTICE TO PURCHASERS

       Purchasers of this shareware program  are  requested  to  contact
       their shareware Distributor to resolve any  conflicts  pertaining
       to  the  sale  of  the  evaluation  copy  of  this  program.   If
       satisfaction is not obtained with  the  Distributor,  or  if  any
       violation of the distributor restrictions herein  are  suspected,
       the user  is  requested  to  notify  InfoTek  at  50  Lake  Road,
       Woodbury, CT 06798. InfoTek will not  arbitrate  the  dispute  or
       refund the purchase price  on  the  behalf  of  the  Distributor,
       rather will supply the user with a replacement evaluation copy of
       this program for a flat fee of $5.00, inclusive of  shipping  and
       handling. Distributors are encouraged to offer  an  unconditional
       money back guarantee. However, this is at the discretion  of  the
       Distributor.

       Those other than shareware  Distributors  may  freely  copy  this
       evaluation copy of the program to allow others  to  evaluate  the
       program, but must keep  the  program  and  all  associated  files
       intact and unmodified.  Non-distributors  may  charge  an  amount
       consistent with the cost of the disk used to convey the program.
 
       FOR USE IN U.S.A. ONLY

       These credit repair  techniques  are  applicable  to  the  United
       States  only.  Distributors  are  requested  to   confine   their
       distribution of this program to the  United  States.  If  a  user
       acquires this program outside of the U.S.A., they are advised  to
       not use the program unless they had residence in the  U.S.A.  and
       need to repair their credit with credit bureaus within the U.S.A.


       RIGHT OF USAGE PRIOR TO REGISTRATION

       You may use the program to prepare letters to request your credit
       reports from the various credit bureaus without any obligation to
       register with the author as  a  user.  If  upon  review  of  your
       reports, with the aid of this program to decipher the meanings of
       the codes used in the reports, you decide to pursue credit repair
       using this program, you are required to register with the  author
       to continue using this program for credit repair.


       The  author  is  confident  that  you  will  find  this   program
       invaluable if you need to repair your credit report.  If  you  do
       not need to perform credit  repair,  you  may  wish  to  register
       anyway so that you will continue to receive update notices as new
       revisions are made available. This will also insure that you have
       the program ready for use at a later date  should  you  need  it.
       Full details about registration and what it includes is  provided
       from within the program. Just select "HOW TO REGISTER" at the top

       NOTICE TO ALL USERS

       Nothing in this program ever suggests stepping outside   of  your
       legal rights as granted to you by the Federal  Trade  Commission.
       You will not be advised to use unethical or questionable tactics.
       If you engage in activities that extend beyond your legal  rights

       WARRANTY

       NO WARRANTY IS EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED THAT, BY USE OF THESE  CREDIT
       REPAIR TECHNIQUES, YOU WILL REMOVE  NEGATIVE  CREDIT  ENTRIES  IN
       YOUR CREDIT PROFILE. THE ACTUAL REMOVAL PROCESS  IS  BETWEEN  YOU
       AND THE CREDIT BUREAU IN CONJUNCTION  WITH  YOUR  CREDITORS  WHEN
       APPLICABLE, AND IS SUBJECT TO A WIDE RANGE OF VARIABLES OF  WHICH
       THE AUTHOR HAS NO  CONTROL.  YOUR  ACTUAL  REMOVAL  SUCCESS  WILL

       INSIDE SECRETS OF CREDIT  REPAIR  IS  PROVIDED  'AS  IS'  WITHOUT

       RATHER,  THIS  PROGRAM  PRESENTS  GENERAL  GUIDELINES,  TIPS  AND
       POINTERS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THAT, WHEN APPLIED PROPERLY, HAVE
       BEEN SHOWN TO WORK AS THEY  PERTAIN  TO  OPTIMIZATION  OF  CREDIT
       PROFILES.
 
       INTENDED USE

       These techniques are intended for personal use only. They are not
       to be used to repair the credit profile of a  business  (many  of
       the legal rights of an individual consumer are not extended to  a
       business). Also, this program is not to be used as the basis  for
       a professional credit repair service.

       The   development  of  programs  to  address   credit  repair for
       businesses  and  a  professional  repairers   version  are  under
       consideration  by the author. Please contact  InfoTek to  inquire
       about the availability of these programs.
 
       ENDORSEMENTS

       This program is not endorsed by any Federal agency  or  body,  by
       any credit bureau or affiliate  or  by  any  professional  credit
       repair person or organization.  Such  endorsement  has  not  been
       pursued by the author since these techniques  are  based  on  the
       rights of the consumer as stated in  the  Fair  Credit  Reporting
       Act, and therefore need no further endorsement.

            4. EGA or VGA color monitor.
               (Note: Monochrome monitors work but important  color
                      coding is lost).
            5. 360 kilobytes of free hard drive space
               (If you elect to install this program on a hard drive)
            6. DOS 3.3 or above.
   
       OPTIONAL ACCESSORIES

       1. A mouse is recommended (Microsoft  is preferable).  However  a
          mouse is not required to use the program.

          other information directly from the program.
       3. A Word processor may be  used to  modify and  print the Letter
          Templates (provided as ASCII text) if you so desire.

            
                                GETTING STARTED

       Thank you for reviewing the above.  You  are  now  ready  to  get
       started with the program.

       Your disk should include the following files:

            GO.BAT    The batch file used to start the program.
        CREDIT.HCM    The hyper text file containing the information.
      HYPSHELL.CFG    Start up configuration file.
         INDEX.HIX    The hyper text file's index.
            HL.EXE    The program needed to read the hypertext file.
       RESTART.HSF    A file used to store running information.
       LETTERS.ASC    The letters used in the program in ASCII text format.
        README.TXT    This readme file.
             *.ADD    Files containing credit bureau addresses.
             *.DTA    Files used to store information you provide from
                      within the program.

                      DO NOT ATTEMPT TO MODIFY ANY FILE.


       NOTE:

       If you  were  given  an  incomplete disk, you  should  notify the 
       Distributor or person  who  sold (or gave)  you  the disk. If you 
       cannot get a new and  complete  disk, send your name and  address  
       with  $5.00 to InfoTek,  50 Lake Road, Woodbury CT 06798. Request 
       an  evaluation  copy of The  Inside Secrets  of Credit Repair and 
       specify the disk size. If you  purchased  the incomplete  program 
       from a Shareware Distributor,  please advise  us of the  name and  
       address  of the Distributor, we will  insure that the Distributor  
       receives  a complete disk.










       INSTALLATION

       To speed up the program, it is recommended that you copy  all  of
       these files to  your  hard  drive.  To  do  this  simply  do  the
       following from DOS:

                          (Don't type in the ' marks.)

       Step 1.   Go to the root directory by entering 'C:\' and pressing
                 enter.

       Step 2.   Type in 'MD CREDIT'  and  press  enter to  make  a  new
                 directory called "CREDIT".

                 If you want to put the files on  hard drive other  than
                 the C drive or in a directory other than CREDIT, simply
                 substitute the drive and  directory specifications with
                 your own.

       Step 4.   Change  to  the  new  CREDIT  directory  by  typing  in
                 'CD\CREDIT' and pressing enter.

       Step 5.   With the program disk in drive A, type in 'COPY  A:\*.*'
                 and  press  enter.  All  files  on the  disk in drive A
                 will be  copied to the CREDIT directory on your C hard.
                 drive.

       Step 6.   Remaining in  the  C:\CREDIT  directory,  type 'GO' and
                 press enter. The program will start.

       Once you are in the program, just press the  space  bar to  begin
       moving through the screens. Follow the  directions  presented  to
       you from within the  program.  Make  sure  to  spend  ample  time
       learning the basic commands and functions of  the  program.  This
       will insure that you receive the most value from the program.  If
       you are unfamiliar with hypertext, make  sure  you  review  ABOUT
       HYPERTEXT and USING HYPERTEXT which you select from the START  UP
       MENU.

       Once again, thank you for trying The  Inside  Secrets  of  Credit
       Repair. We are confident that you will  find  the  principles  of
       credit repair interesting and, when  used  properly,  will  prove
       rewarding.



       Remember, the right to  monitor your credit report and to dispute
       inaccurate entries on your credit report is your legal right. Use
       those rights properly and they  will prove  to be as  valuable to
       you as a good credit status.
