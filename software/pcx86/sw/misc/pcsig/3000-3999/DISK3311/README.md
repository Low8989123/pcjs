                           Distribution Requirements
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Individuals who wish to distribute PUZZY to friends or associates may do so
  in accord with the restrictions stated in the PREADME.1ST and PMANUAL.DOC
  files provided on the distribution disk.  Computer Clubs and User Groups
  wishing to add PUZZY to their disk library may do so in accordance with the
  Distribution Restrictions listed below.
  
  Limited Distribution License:
  -----------------------------
  
  ASP Approved Vendors are hereby given permission to distribute PUZZY.
  
  Non-ASP member vendors must request permission prior to distributing PUZZY.
  
  Hawkeye Softworks is a member of the Association of Shareware Professionals
  (ASP) and expects vendors to abide by ASP guidelines for distributing its
  shareware products.
  
  All vendors are expected to inform Hawkeye Softworks that they intend to
  distribute PUZZY and, unless costs are prohibitive, to supply Hawkeye
  Softworks with a complimentary copy of any catalog in which PUZZY is
  listed.
  
  "PUZZY" is defined as all the files supplied by Hawkeye Softworks for
  shareware distribution, including the main program file (PUZZY.EXE), its
  resource file (PUZZY.RSC), a set of six (6) picture files (with .PZY
  extensions), a user manual (PMANUAL.DOC), an installation program
  (MAKEPZY.EXE), and a file containing installation instructions, named
  (PREADME.1ST).
  
  As supplied by Hawkeye Softworks, the PUZZY program, its subsidiary .RSC
  and .PZY files, along with PMANUAL.DOC are compressed in an archive file,
  PZYARC.BCF, which was created with BUILDER (tm) from Hyperkinetics, Inc.,
  18001 Irvine Blvd. Suite H, Tustin, CA 92680.  The MAKEPZY.EXE install
  program was also created with BUILDER.
  
  As the exclusive copyright holder for PUZZY, Hawkeye Softworks authorizes
  distribution only in accord with the following restrictions.
   
     The PUZZY program and all its subsidiary files must be distributed in
     unaltered form; file names may not changed; copyright notices may not be
     removed; registration and ordering information may not be altered or
     removed; and references to ASP and the ASP Ombudsman may not be altered
     or removed.  Specifically, no changes may be made to the files called
     PUZZY.EXE, PUZZY.RSC, and PMANUAL.DOC, nor to any of the six (6) picture
     files identified by .PZY extensions.
  
     Un-archiving and re-archiving with alternative software is not, per se,
     considered as file alteration.  Vendors who prefer to un-archive and re-
     compress PUZZY with software other than that used by Hawkeye Softworks
     may do so, provided that all files specified in the preceding paragraph
     are distributed together in unaltered form.  The installation program,
     MAKEPZY.EXE may be, and should be, replaced with an alternative install-
     ation or decompression program or self-extracting archive, and the text
     file called README.1ST need not be included.
  
  Vendors may distribute PUZZY in one of the following forms:
  
      1) A disk containing the files called README.1ST, MAKEPZY.EXE, and
         PZYARC.BCF all of which must be distributed in unaltered form.
  
      2) A disk containing PUZZY.EXE, PUZZY.RSC, PMANUAL.DOC, and the six (6)
         .PZY picture files, all of which must be distributed in unaltered
         form, except, at the distributor's option, for compression into an
         archive file.  If the PUZZY files are compressed, the user must be
         supplied with instructions for de-compressing them, and if they are
         not compressed in a self-extracting .EXE archive, users must be
         supplied with the software required to de-compress them.
  
  Small additions to distribution disks, such as the introductory or
  installation batch files used by many shareware vendors, are acceptable.
  However, if another shareware program is to be included on the same disk
  with PUZZY, the vendor must first contact Hawkeye Softworks for approval to
  do so.
  
  Disk Sets & CD-ROMs:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  PUZZY MAY NOT be sold as part of some other inclusive package, nor included
  in any commercial software packaging offer, without a written agreement
  from Hawkeye Softworks.
  
  ASP Approved Vendors who wish to distribute PUZZY as part of a collection
  (such as PsL's MegaDisk set, or a CD-ROM package) may do so provided that
  all the other restrictions are met.
  
  Non-ASP Vendor Members who wish to distribute PUZZY as part of a collection
  (such as PsL's MegaDisk set, or a CD-ROM package) must obtain permission
  from Hawkeye Softworks prior to beginning such a distribution.
  
  If you wish to add PUZZY to a CD-ROM or other collection, please check the
  release date of the version you have.  If the version is over twelve (12)
  months old, please contact Hawkeye Softworks to ensure that you have the
  most current version.
  
  Disk-of-the-Month (or Subscription) Distribution:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  If PUZZY is to be distributed as a Disk-of-the-Month, or as part of a
  subscription or monthly service, then the following restrictions apply:
  
     ASP Vendor Members are hereby given permission to distribute PUZZY
     the Disk-of-the-Month distribution method.
  
     Others (non-ASP Members) must contact us in advance to ensure that they
     have the most current version of the software.
  
     Disk-of-the-Month distribution may not be used merely to exhaust a
     vendor's inventory of superseded versions: only the current version of
     PUZZY may be shipped as a Disk-of-the-Month.
  
  Other Restrictions
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  A PRINTED User's Guide for PUZZY may not be reproduced in whole or in part,
  using any means, without written permission from Hawkeye Softworks.
  
  PUZZY may not be described in advertisements, catalogs, or other literature
  as "FREE SOFTWARE".  PUZZY is SHAREWARE, it is not free.
  
  Licensee shall not use, copy, rent, lease, sell, modify, decompile,
  disassemble, otherwise reverse engineer, or transfer the licensed program
  except as provided in this agreement.  Any such unauthorized use shall
  result in immediate and automatic termination of this license.
  
  U.S. Government Information:  Use, duplication, or disclosure by the U.S.
  Government of the computer software and documentation in this package shall
  be subject to the restricted rights applicable to commercial computer
  software as set forth in subdivision (b)(3)(ii) of the Rights in Technical
  Data and Computer Software clause at 252.227-7013 (DFARS 52.227-7013).  The
  Contractor/manufacturer is:
                             Hawkeye Softworks
