A note for Vendors/Consultants/Distributers.

AMS is also available as a commercial software package to re-sellers.

A number of vendors have expressed interest in the Shareware Version of the 
software, and have forwarded it to clients. If however you have a number of 
prospective customers and would prefer to sell the commercial version to them, 
please fax us or contact us via CompuServe for our generous discount rates 
and terms and conditions.

The commercial package has a re-compiled version of the software, without 
Order AMS and Register AMS options, and is packaged with manuals and user 
guides. Documentation has no references to the AMS shareware version.

A demonstration version is available. If you have a CompuServe address, 
please include this on the fax, for a prompt EMail delivery.
