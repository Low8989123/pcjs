		   GETTING STARTED WITH VBLASTER V1.1
		 (C) 1991 Copyright by Mark E Cowan
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
■ Introduction

Thank you for acquiring this product.  VBLASTER.EXE is a quality
program that provides an easy to use 'Windows' like operator interface.
Being nearly CUA (Common User Access) compliant, this program was
intended to provide you with the capabilities to create SoundBlaster
voice files, and to Play both SoundBlaster voice and CMF music files.
With List boxes, radio buttons, and scroll bars, even the novice with
no knowledge of DOS can run this program.

Voice Blaster will record RAW Voice files, but can play both RAW and
Creative Labs Compressed Voice files.  If you register for this 
product, you will receive notices of updates and enhancements of
Voice Blaster which will include file compression, more voice file
editting capabilities, and a 'WINDOWS 3.0' application version!
To find out how to register after running this program, simply select
the 'HELP' pull down menu and choose 'REGISTER'!

On-line help is provided to accelerate learning the various menues and
dialog boxes.  Press F1 anytime to receive help.

NOTE: VOICE BLASTER V1.1

This version has been released to fix some minor bugs in the program.
Here is a summary:

	1) Files in the root directory can now be selected to Play

	2) Program checks for proper file name when entering filename
	   to record. 

	3) When card status is selected, the Creative Labs Voice 
	   driver version is also displayed


■ Installation

Simply copy the following files into the same directory:

	VBLASTER.EXE     The main program
	BLASTM.HLP      Help file for the main program functions
	BLASTR.HLP      Help file for the Record dialog box
	BLASTP.HLP      Help file for the Play dialog box
	REGISTER.TXT    Text file describing how to register this product

The directory you chose can be any directory.  If you chose a current
directory that is on the DOS path, then you can then run VBLASTER from
any directory without having to type the full path name.

You can also create a new directory for the new files and launch this
program from other applications such as Pctools or Windows.

For those of you not familiar with DOS, here is an example for setting
up VBLASTER.EXE to run after downloading this program into the
directory c:\pcplus\dwn

	c:
	md c:\blast
	cd \blast
	copy c:\pcplus\dwn\vblaster.exe
	copy c:\pcplus\dwn\*.hlp
	copy c:\pcplus\dwn register.txt

■ Running

To run this program, simply type VBLASTER anytime at the DOS prompt if
the files were copied into a directory which was on the path.  
Otherwise, type the full path name such as \blast\VBLASTER to run.

You can also create a batch file which would call this program with the
path if the directory used is not on the DOS path.

■ Registering

Please send in your registration if you decide you like VBLASTER.  It
will enable me to continue to upgrade and enhance the program with new
functions and to support bug fixes.  Also, you will receive notices of
new program releases I am currently working on that use the 
SoundBlaster card. 

Read the file Register.txt to find out how to register this product, 
and how to contact the author.
