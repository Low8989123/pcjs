The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We
recommend a 386 with a VGA monitor.

compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

CEO's major features include:

*Create subfolders (subgroups) within folders, allowing you to create
a tree structure of folders and subfolders.

*Move or copy items between folders with a simple drag/drop 
interface.  Select a single item to be moved or copied or select 
multiple items and move or copy all at once.

*Display items in folders as icons, text (as in File Manager) or as 
buttons (as in a toolbar).

*Password protection provided for individual folders or can be used 
to lock people out of Windows completely.

*History menu which tracks the last twelve applications launched 
from any folder.  This allows you to quickly re-launch an 
application you wish to use again after closing it.

*Background color used by a folder can be set on a per folder 
basis.  This allows for color-coding of folders.

*Link to directory capability which allows you to link a folder to 
a directory.  Once linked, the folder will automatically add and 
delete items from the folder as files are created or deleted in the 
directory.  This eliminates the need to manually add new items or 
delete old items.

*Add items to folders by dragging files from the File Manager.  
Launch programs by dropping data files on program icons where 
the icons may either be icons in a folder or icons on the desktop.
Print files by dropping them on Print Manager.

*Multi-select capability provided when adding or deleting items.  
Add multiple items at once or delete multiple items using two 
different delete capabilities.

*Use any folder as a startup folder when starting Windows.  
This allows you to start Windows with different startup 
configurations by just using a command line parameter when 
starting Windows.

*Launch multiple applications with a single action.  All items in 
a folder may be launched at once or only selected items may be 
launched by just hitting the enter key.

*Includes run command with browse button.  The last twelve 
commands entered are stored with no duplications for easy access.

*Customizable popup run menu provided for quick access to 
programs accessible from any folder or from the desktop.  Easy to 
use menu editor included for building and maintaining run menu.  
Menu items may be set to run minimized or maximized.  Also, 
hotkeys may be assigned to menu items.

*Easy to use icon selection dialog displays all icons in the specified 
file in a listbox.  Scroll back and forth through the icons until you 
find the one you desire, then double-click on it and the selected item 
is immediately changed to the icon selected from the listbox.

*Assign hotkeys to items for quick launching.  In addition, 
programs can be set to automatically inquire for a data file upon 
execution. 

*Assign icons to file extensions allowing for automatic use of the 
specified icon whenever a file with that extension is added to a 
folder.  For example, assign a document icon to the extension 
DOC.  Any file added with a DOC extension will automatically 
appear with the document icon.

*Includes associate command similar to File Manager's, but CEO's 
allows multiple programs to be assigned to a single extension.  
Executing a folder item with multiple programs assigned to it will 
cause a listbox to appear from which the desired program to be run 
may be selected.

*Global options dialog provides for customizing various aspects 
of the CEO system.  Various confirmation, display and start up 
options may be set.

*The install program included automatically builds folders from 
your Program Manager groups and places them in CEO making 
for quick and easy setup.

include in the Control Panel dialogs.  Easily change the colors used
by the Windows help engine in displaying hypertext, the alignment of 
drop down menus, the vertical spacing between icons, the font used to 
display icon titles plus many other settings.  Also, an easy to use 
ini file editor is included as part of More Control.

Now includes CP Add-In.  This CP module allows you to add any program
you want to the Control Panel dialog.

INSTALLATION:

1. Copy the files morecon.cpl, cpaddin.cpl and mcspin.dll to your 
   Windows SYSTEM directory.  Note that both More Control and CP
   Add-In are independent programs.

2. Copy the files morecon.hlp and setfont.exe to your Windows directory.

That's it.  From now on, when you run the Control Panel you should 
have an additional icon in the Control Panel window labeled More Control 
which will allow you to access the program.  You will also have an icon
for the CP Add-In program.  The online help gives full details on both
programs operation.

For more information on the Windows settings affected by More Control
see the files winini.wri and sysini.wri in your Windows directory.  Also,
refer to the Windows Resource Kit available from Microsoft.

To uninstall More Control simply delete the files mentioned above.  Note 
that uninstalling More Control will NOT return your system settings to 
their state before using More Control.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.


To Order, in the U.S.A.: Call 800-245-6717 and ask Customer Service.

Outside the U.S.A.: Call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer near
