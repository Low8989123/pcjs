The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We
recommend a 386 with a VGA monitor.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

INSTALLATION
I.  If you downloaded Hi, Finance! in compressed form:

    1.  Copy the files ("HIFI2A.XXX" and "HIFI2B.XXX" or 
	("HIFI218A.XXX" and "HIFI218B.XXX" --"XXX" may 
	represent EXE, ZIP, or other extensions) into a 
	temporary directory.

    2.  If the files have an ".EXE" file extension, they should
	be self-extracting: type the file name to decompress.  

	File sets with "ZIP" extensions require the use of 
	PKUNZIP or compatible decompression utilities.  These 
	should be available on the BBS where you downloaded 
	Hi, Finance!  Make sure you unzip all the files to the 
	same temporary directory (which can be deleted after 
	installation is complete.)

    3.  Run Windows.  There are several ways to start Setup. From 
	Program Manager, select "File" and then "Run".  This 
	should pop up a dialog box.  In the entry box, type 
	"<dir>:setup.exe", where <dir> is the directory where the 
	Hi, Finance! files are located.  

		For example:	c:\temp\setup.exe

	From the File Manager, you may use an similar process, 
	although you may skip the path information ("c:\temp\") 
	if you're already in that directory.  The easiest way is 
	to use "File" "Open" on the setup.exe file using the 
	graphical directory management of File Manager, or simply 
	double-click on "setup.exe".

    4.  The installation program will propose C:\HIFINANC as the 
	default directory.  You may change the drive and 
	directory.  Setup will also create a subdirectory off 
	the main Windows directory in which it will place 
	runtime files.  This location should not be changed!  
	Follow screen prompts.

    5.  The program will create a Program Manager group and place 
	icons for Hi, Finance! and related files in it.  

    6.  You may now start Hi, Finance! by double-clicking on its 
	icon or by selecting HIFINANC.EXE in File Manager.


II.  If you received Hi, Finance! on 360K diskettes (2) or a 
1.2MB or 720KB diskette:

    1.  Place Diskette 1 in the appropriate floppy drive.	

    2.  Proceed with installation as outlined in steps 3-6 in 
	part I, changing diskettes if prompted.
	

III.  Manual installation:

    1.  The following files are distributed by Brightridge 
	Solutions, Inc. in compressed form:  "HIFINANC.EXE", 
	"HIFINANC.HLP", "HIFINANC.WRI", "RLZRUN10.RTS", 
	"CCLIB1.EXE", and "STANDARD.EXE".  If you need to extract 
	these files outside of the supplied setup utility, use 
	the "EXPAND.EXE" program supplied with Microsoft Windows 
	3.0 and 3.1, using this syntax:

		 EXPAND source destination

    2.  The application's executable file, HIFINANC.EXE, may be 
	installed anywhere accessible to Windows.  Install 
	FINDLL.DLL in the same directory.

    3.  The runtime files, RLZRUN10.RTS, STANDARD.EXE, CCLIB1.EXE,
	and SHADE3D.EXE should be in the \RLZRUN10 subdirectory 
	off the main Windows subdirectory.  

    4.  To use online help, HIFINANC.HLP should be copied to the 
	same directory as HIFINANC.EXE or the Windows directory.

    5.  Other files included in the package are not (absolutely) 
	necessary to the operation of Hi, Finance!:

	a.  HIFINANC.TXT -- This file.  Keep it!

        b.  HIFINANC.WRI -- Hi, Finance! User's Guide, in 
	    Windows Write (.WRI) format.  If you're a registered 
	    user, you have this in printed form.

	c.  Sample files (EXAMPLE1.*).

	d.  SHAREWRE.TXT -- explains the shareware concept.

	e.  VENDOR.DOC -- Addressed to disk vendors, BBS 
	    Sysops, and distributors.  Explains distribution 
	    policies permitted under license.

        f.  REGISTER.TXT -- Registration form.  You may print 
	    this ASCII file, fill it out, and send it with 
	    your registration fee, or you may wish to use the 
	    form included in the program.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
