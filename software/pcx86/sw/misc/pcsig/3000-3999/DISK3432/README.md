This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
700 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'GO' at the
DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy access
to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.

The Narc utility, newly instituted with the tenth edition, allows you to
look directly at all the compressed program files on the CD without
having to download the program to your hard disk.  So if you want to
look at the programmer's notes or on-line documentation before using
valuable hard disk space, you can.

The PC-SIG Encyclopedia of Shareware is included on the disk, and a
printed copy of the book is included so you can peruse the available
programs from the comfort of your favorite chair.  All the programs are
logically divided into one-hundred twenty categories making it easier to
find just the right software.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

Winner of the Optical Publishing Assn's Best Consumer Product Award.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed

by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word in the program
description.  A new utility, Narc, is implemented so you can look at the
program files and the author's on-line documentation without having to
first copy the program to your hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and
Narc, you can quickly find the program you want and review it to be
sure, without ever having to run it from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

 NEW CITIES / TIME ZONES
 ========================

 ** Mouse DblClick on City Area in Main Window or in separate clock windows:
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     (City of local clock is fixed to local time zone)

    
     1.)  In SETUP Window:

        - Select location from location list  
 
 
     2.)  In Location List Editor :

        - Insert new / change / delete location from location file XCLOCK.DAT
 
          Xclock uses only 14 characters for clock displays
          and cuts all inside of brackets 

        - Select standard time difference in hours (opt. minutes)
          to Greenwich Mean Time

   
        - for Daylight Savings Time select:

        - None  if no DST is required 

        - US Standard  if  DST begins at first Sunday in April and
                               ends at last Sunday in October 

        - European Standard  if  DST starts on last Sunday in March and
                                     ends on last Sunday in September

         For US and Europ. Standard XCLOCK calculates start / end of DST         
         
        - Special  to select  DST interval 
        
             - month and first day of DST
             - month and last day of DST
             - DST time difference in hours (opt. minutes)
               to Greenwich Mean Time 

       
    !!!   Xclock automatically reflects summer time settings for each location
          at 02:00 of first day and at 03:00 of last day
 
 
    You must know the time difference / time zone if you choose others 
    than defaults. (see Help in Location List Editor)
   
    For an unregistered copy of XCLOCK you have to look for those time zones. 
    Registered users of XCLOCK will receive XCLOCK.DAT with about 150 entries
    of cities in different countries.

 
   "Add new entry"  saves new entry to XCLOCK.DAT.
   
   "Change entry"   saves changes to XCLOCK.DAT

   "Delete entry"   deletes selected entry from pulldown list and data file. 



 DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME
 =======================

 XCLOCK is designed for power users to handle appointments, transactions,
 communications etc. world-wide exactly.

 Besides settings of your PC clock and time zone it is most important to
 set daylight savings time. For many European countries and most US-Staates
 dst setup is easy, Xclock calculates dst time periods for any year.
 There are many irregular dst time periods in different countries of the
 world, but you have to edit this only once in a year for some locations
 you are really interested in ("Special" DST setup in Location List Editor).

 This is why Xclock gives you access to all settings of any location. Time
 zones and DST settings are shown in Setup Window, there is no hidden and 
 undocumented setup inside of Xclock. 

 XCLOCK is able to change your PC system time when DST starts or ends,
 this feature is enabled if AUTOCHANGE is checked in SETTINGS.
 If AUTOCHANGE is not checked, please set PC time and date manually 
 if DST changes for your local time zone.
 
 XCLOCK saves last local DST ( "yes" or "no" in Save Setup ) on exit.
 Next start Xclock checks for DST change. If DST has changed, there is 
 a warning in main window. If AUTOCHANGE is enabled, Xclock has already
 changed internal system clock for 1 hour, otherwise set your PC clock
 using Windows Control Panel (= SETTINGS / Set System Time in Xclock menu)
 to new time.

 When XCLOCK is running and DST changes, you will get that warning
 immediately.
 
 !!!  XCLOCK changes time from 02:00:00 to 03:00:00 on first day of DST
       and from 03:00:00 to 02:00:00 on last day of DST (24 hour clock)
       in any time zone with DST settings            
  


 TIME DISPLAY AT ICON
 ====================

 * Mouse Click on City area and minimize Xclock to icon shows city 
   and related time at icon. City and time display are saved on exit (if conf.)
 
   Windows 3.0 (3.1)
   Run XCLOCK automatically when Windows starts : 
   edit WIN.INI file using notepad or sysedit: 

    run=c:\windows\utils\xclock.exe 

    (if you have xclock.exe in a subdirectory "utils" 
     of the windows directory on drive C:)
 

   Windows 3.1
   Move or copy (press CTRL while dragging) XCLOCK icon into autostart group 
   to run XCLOCK at start of Windows
 

 !!! Xclock did not start as an icon
     Xclock restores the configuration of last session 
     To start Xclock iconized next time make shure that Xclock is iconized 
     when you end Windows session.
