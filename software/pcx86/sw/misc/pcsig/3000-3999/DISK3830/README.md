The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The

FontManager for Windows - User's Guide

	FontManager automates the task of changing softfont entries in the
PostScript application sections of WIN.INI. It was primarily written for
users with more type 1 postscript fonts than can be contained in WIN.INI at
one time. It will allow you to create pre-built FontPaks or font sets which
can be quickly swapped into the desired PostScript printer section of Win.ini.
It alleviates the common kludges of having multiple win.ini files that are
activated as necessary. You may put more than one FontPak on a printer port,
add individual fonts and save the contents of a printer port as a FontPak file.
Thus, in addition to being able to build fontpaks in advance, you can modify
the installed fonts on a port and save that setup to a FontPak for later use.
You will still have to live with the Windows limit of approximately 150
installed soft fonts on a port, however.
	FontManager only manages .PFB and .PFM Postscript type 1 font files.
It does not recognize nor deal with .AFM type files or other than Type 1
postscript fonts.
	Any time you modify the installed font set on a postscript port, the
changes become effective in windows immediately. Unfortunately, most programs
I've tried such as Page Maker and Word for Windows won't update their font
resources when they receive the wm_WININICHANGE message from windows. They
must be closed and re-opened.

WHAT FONTMANAGER DOES TO WIN.INI

	Quite simply, it just creates the necessary soft font lines to
identify installed soft fonts. The lines have the following format:

;FONTPAKINSTALLED=[pakname] 
SOFTFONTS=XX
SOFTFONTYY=[drive]:\[path]\[filename].PFM
(or)
SOFTFONTYY=[drive]:\[path]\[filename].PFM,[drive]:\[path]\[filename].PFB

The paths for .PFM and .PFB files may be as deep as you like and there is no
need for any relationship between .PFM and .PFB directories. There is a limit
of 40 characters for a files path string.

FontManager also creates a dummy application section in WIN.INI with the
following lines:

	[FONTMANAGER]
	FontManager=Installed

This section is used by the WriteProfileString windows API call that forces
Windows to re-read WIN.INI. Without this section, the API call places
"[],=" at the end of Win.ini. This doesn't create any problems, but it can
be confusing for anyone looking at WIN.INI.

INSTALLING FONTMANAGER

	There are four basic files you will need to use FontManager:

	1. FONTMGR.EXE	This is the main executable file. It may be placed
			anywhere you like, but I would suggest creating a
			directory on the same drive as your windows directory
			named [drive]:\FONT_MGR. If you don't create this
			directory, the initial setup routine will create it
			as this is where all Fontpaks will be stored.
			
	2. HUGEARR.DLL	This is a windows Dynamic Link Library that handles
			huge array processing. It must be placed in the main
			windows directory unless you want to add the
			\FONT_MGR directory to your path and we know you
			dont want to do that. If you don't have it, it is
 			available on CIS, MSLANG, Lib 6, "HUGARR.ZIP"

	3. PSETUP.DLL	This is a very small DLL library file which also must
			be placed in the Windows main directory. It handles
			all the printer setup routines.	It is the work of
			Costas Kitsos, and it is included with this upload.

	4. VBRUN100.DLL	This is the main Visual Basic run time Dynamic Link
			Library (DLL) file. It, too, must be located in your
			windows directory. This file is also on CIS, MSLANG,
			Lib 6, as VBRUN.ZIP

	Simply place these files in the correct directories, fire up windows
and run FONTMGR.EXE. The first time you run FontMgr.EXE, only one menu item
will be active - FILES/INITIAL SETUP. Simply click on the FILES menu and then
INITIAL SETUP - it's the only one available. You will be asked what drives
you want searched for font files to catalog, and then sit back and enjoy.
This process may take a few minutes on machines with huge hard drives and/or
a very large number of fonts. When testing on a 386/33 with hyperdisk and a
total of 1823 PFM and 1823 PFB files, it took about 3 minutes to search, build
indexs, sort, and create the master file.

FONTMANAGER LIMITATIONS

	FontManager is capable of managing up to 2048 type 1 postscript fonts.
As with most PC programs, this limit has its roots in the "Sector" format of
DOS memory. Handling more than this number of fonts would require foregoing
some very fast binary string processing, or in short, it would slow things
down a bunch.
	Further, FontManager is limited to 6 installed PostScript ports in
WIN.INI. If you have more than six, FontManger will only work with the first
six it finds.
	FontManager has not been designed for or tested in any network
environments.

WHAT INITIAL SETUP DOES

	First it searches the drives you indicate for all .PFM and .PFB files
and catalogs them. It then matches up .PFM and .PFB files for the same font.
Missing .PFB files are no problem and will be normal for users with fonts
stored on a printer's hard disk. It will list any .PFB files it finds without
a matching .PFM file, however. Fonts with a .PFM file but no .PFB file are
forced to a PRINTER RESIDENT status when creating FontPaks and adding these
fonts to a port regardless of how you set the resident/not resident option at
that time.
	Initial setup will ceate the directory [windows drive]:\FONT_MGR if it
does not already exist. It will place the master font library file
(LIBRARY.FNT) in this directory. This file along with all FontPak files must
be in this directory for FontManager to find them. Maybe I'll get tricky in a
later version and allow you to designate your own directory name like the
shrink wraps, but for now, you'll have to live  with a directory named
FONT_MGR. 
	Once you have run the initial setup, all the other menu options will
be activated, and the INITIAL SETUP menu will be disabled. The only way you
can run INITIAL SETUP again is to manually delete the LIBRARY.FNT file from
the \FONT_MGR directory.

	To get a printed listing of your Font Library, simply use the PRINT
MASTER LIBRARY menu under the FILES menu. This listing will be needed if you
opt to use Font ID numbers for creating fontpaks. It's also a good reference
of all the Type 1 postscript fonts you have on your system.

LIBRARY.FNT MASTER FILE

	This file is created when the initial setup is run. It is a random
access file with information on all the fonts Initial Setup and subsequent
Updates find on user selected logical disk drives. If this file is ever
deleted and re-created using Initial Setup, ALL EXISTING FONTPAK FILES WILL
BE INVALID AND MUST BE DELETED. I STRONGLY SUGGEST MANUALLY MAKING A BACKUP
COPY OF THIS FILE AFTER INITIAL INSTALLATION AND ANY TIME IT IS UPDATED WITH
THE UPDATE PROCEDURE.

UPDATE MASTER FILE

	This routine again searches selected drives for all .PFM and .PFB
files. This time, however, it will simply add any new files to the master
library file. You may run this routine as often as you like, but it will do
nothing unless it finds new files. It's designed to be run after you've added
new fonts to the system, Update can be run for a single logical drive even if
you have fonts on more than one drive. Thus, if you add fonts to only one
drive, you don't have to search all drives as with initial setup.
	If a font in the master library no longer has a .PFM file, it will
mark that font as deleted so that it can't be used in future fontpaks. No
attempt is made at this time to update existing FontPaks that contain any
deleted files. This is a doable feature for the next version.

CREATING FONTPAKS

	You may create FontPaks in one of two ways. You may either enter the
desired fonts by their Font ID Number as shown on the printed Master Library
Catalog, or you can select fonts based on thier full name from a displayed
selection list.  
	When using the Font ID method, I used a technique not normally found
in window apps. You enter the font ID number in a text box and press enter to
accept it. Normally in windows apps, pressing enter selects the OK or CONTINUE
or some such command button while the tab key usually accepts data from a text
box. As only numbers are used to create FontPaks in this mode and the TAB key
is on the other side of the keyboard, I used this ENTER method. If you enter
an incorrect font ID, just select the appropriate displayed line for it and
press the delete button.
	When selecting fonts based on font names, a more traditional windows
approach is used. You'll have a list of available fonts on the left, and a list
of selected fonts on the right. Simply click on the desired font in the
available list, and it will be transfered to the selected list. FontManager
will not allow you to select a font more than once. You can remove a selected
font by clicking on it and pressing the delete button.
	You may also include whole fontpaks when creating a new fontpak. Simply
press the INCLUDE FONTPAK button, select the desired fontpak and it will be
inserted. FontManager will not allow duplicating font's in a fontpak, so don't
worry if an included fontpak includes some fonts that you have already selected
for inclusion.

MODIFYING FONTPAKS

	This procedure uses exactly the same window as creating a font pack
using font names. It simply starts with the FontPak to modify already loaded
into the selected list. You may add fonts, delete fonts or include other
fontpaks just as when creating a new fontpak.

DELETEING FONTPAKS

	Another no-brainer. Select DELETE A FONTPAK from the FILES menu, select
the desired FontPak, press Delete, answer yes to another "Are you sure?" query,
and it's gone. If you delete a fontpak by mistake, hopefully you have Norton
Utilities handy.

PRINTING THE MASTER CATALOG AND FONTPAK LISTS

	Again, very straight forward. You may print to either a PostScript or
other type printer. If you're using a PostScript printer, FontManager will
recognize the selected paper size and print accordingly.

SETUP PRINTER

	This feature utilizes the small Psetup.DLL created by Costas Kitsos.
It simply allows you access to your printer driver setup feature. If you wish
to actually change selected printers, you will need to do that through Control
Panel.

LIST INSTALLED FONTPAKS

	This routine is in the "WIN.INI" main menu. It simply displays every
PostScript port you have and the FontPak that is installed on each. If you have
modified an installed FontPak by adding another fontpak or individual fonts to
a port, it will say "CUSTOM". If you have no softfonts installed on a port, it
will say "NONE". If one of the displayed postscript ports is also the active
printer port, that line will be highlighted.

CHANGE OR SAVE FONTS

	This is the actual routine to make changes to installed softfonts with
FontManger. It is decribed in detail below. If you ever look at WIN.INI in a
text editor after it has been modified by FontManger, you'll see the line:  
;FONTPAKINSTALLED=[text] immediately preceeding the SOFTFONTS=XX line. This
line is used by FontManger to know what pak is installed on that port. It is
installed as a comment line to preclude it interfering in any way with that
ports functionality.

MOVING .PFM and .PFB FILES

	If you should move any PFM or PFB files, FontManager will update the
master library file with the new locations the next time UPDATE is run on the
drive that contains the moved files. No changes are necessary to any FontPaks
if any font files are moved. Just Make sure to run UPDATE after moving any
file.
     
CHANGING A PRINTER PORT'S FONT SETUP

You may perform any combination of 4 actions in this window:
		
1. REPLACE A PORT'S FONTPAK:  This action will delete all currently installed
softfonts lines from the selected Port or ports and install the selected font
pack.

2. ADD A FONTPAK TO A PORT:  This action will add the selected FontPak to any
currently installed softfonts installed on the selected port. No exisitng
softfont lines are deleted. 

3. ADD SINGLE FONTS TO A PORT:  This action will add selected single fonts to
any currently existing softfont lines on the selected ports. 

4. SAVE PORT SETUP TO A FONTPAK:  This action will save the softfont
configuration of a selected port to a FontPak file for future use. The FontPak
file created may be printed and modified just like any other FontPak. The SAVE
action is only available when only one port is selected. If you have selected
more than one port, SAVE will not be available.

	In steps 1 thru 3, the softfonts=xx line is updated to reflect the
actual number of softfont lines for that port. Additionally, FontManager makes
it impossible to have a font listed more than once in a port section. Even if
you add a fontpak that contains some fonts already in the section, it will not
make duplicate entries for the same font.

	You may perform any combination or all of these actions at one time.
You may replace the base fontpak, add a second font pak, and add some
individual fonts.  If your actions only affect one port, you may also save the
final font contents created on that port to a fontpak file.  The SAVE action
may also be used by itself to create a fontpak file from a port's font
configuration.  The only limitation is that you may only ADD one FontPak with
the Add FontPak action. You may add all the single fonts you want.

REPLACING AND MODIFYING INSTALLED SOFTFONTS

	Modifying a port's installed softfonts is done in two steps. First,
select the printer port(s) you want to change, select a desired action, select
the appropriate FontPak or individual softfonts to use and click on Post
Change. Then select the next desired action, FontPak or fonts and click on
Post Change again. Clicking on Post Change tells the system that you are done
with this action and ready to do another. When you click on Post Change, the
selected Action button line will change from blue to red to indicate this
action will occur when you finally Write Win.Ini. If you find you're working
on the wrong action line, simply click on the correct action line without
pressing Post Change. If you're unsure about an action you have already
comitted (Action button line is red), simply click on that action line again
and make any necessary changes. 

NOTE: At this time, there is no way to completely UNDO an action once it has
been committed with Post Change. If you have slected an action and Posted it,
you can change the Port, the FontPak or the individual fonts, but you can't
stop the basic action from occuring when you Write Win.Ini. The only current
way to get out of this situation is to Exit the window and restart it from the
Main Menu.  Candidly, I've run out of room on the window for another command
button to UNDO and I'll need to modify the window to handle this.

SELECTED PORTS TO MODIFY

	This selection determines which PostScript printer ports will be
modified. When Win.Ini is finally written, all actions will occur for the
Port(s) selected at that time. Thus, you can change the desired ports between
different change actions if the original selections were incorrect. If you have
selected multiple ports, the same changes will be carried out on all the
selected ports.

SELECTING INDIVIDUAL FONTS TO ADD TO PORT

	The sub-dialog box for this action is very similar to the Create a
FontPak window. Simply enter the Font ID number for the desired font(s) in the
Add Font# text box and press ENTER after each one. Alternatively, you can press
the SHOW FONTS button which will display a list of all fonts in the master
library. When this list is displayed, double clicking on an available font will
place it in the selected list. The list of availbale fonts can be erased by
either pressing SHOW FONTS again, or exiting the Add Individual Fonts action.
If you add an incorrect font ID, simply select the bad font in the list and
press Delete Font. The printer resident box is straight forward. When selected,
it indicates fonts are printer resident. When not selected, it indicates fonts
are NOT printer resident. It can be changed for each font added. When the Add
SINGLE Fonts to a Port action button is inactive, the entire Select Individual
Fonts sub-dialog is disabled.

POST CHANGE

	This command button acts to validate an action. If you're missing
something required for the particular change to occur, you will be prompted
for the missing information. If you do not press Post Change before going to
another Action, the action just left WILL NOT be carried out when Write Win.Ini
is selected.  Post Change also turns the selected Action line red to indicate
that this action will occur when you do Write Win.Ini.

WRITE WIN.INI

	This is the big one that will actually cause all selected actions and
changes to be made to Win.ini. If you select Write Win.Ini by mistake, there is
still a dialog box which summarizes all your changes where you'll be able to
abort. Even if you don't abort here and discover a problem, Win.Ini is saved
to a file named WIN.WFM in your windows directory which may be manually copied
back to WIN.INI to restore the previous setup. In the next revision, the option
to do this automatically will be added.
	Write Win.Ini also forces Windows to re-read Win.Ini and update the
system resources. Thus, all changes you make with FontManager are immediately
available to all Windows apps. This is accomplished by sending the
wm_WININICHANGE message. If a running app does not respond to this message by
updateing it's font resources, you'll have to close and re-open that app for
the new fonts to be available in it. Unfortuneatly, PageMaker and Word for
Windows are two big ones that don't update their font resources even when
notified by windows of a change in resources.

SUMMARY MESSAGE BOX

	After selecting Write Win.Ini to make your changes, you'll get a dialog
box that summarizes what changes will be made. It will also give you the option
of aborting these changes and return to the Change Window. 

IF YOU'RE NOT SURE

	If you make some complex changes to a port and aren't sure about their
accuracy, simply start over and do it again.  

ADDING MULTIPLE FONTPAKS TO A PORT

	You may ADD multiple font packs to a port by doing it one at a time.
Select ADD a FontPak to a Port, select the port and FontPak, press Post Change,
Write Win.ini and repeat  these steps until all the desired FontPaks have been
added to the port. Just remember that Win.Ini has a practical limit of
somewhere around 150 fonts.

ORDER ACTIONS ARE CARRIED OUT

	Actions are carried out in the same order the Action Button Lines are
displayed in the window. Save Port to a FontPak is the last action. This allows
you to make any combination or all of the first three Actions and save the
result of those Actions to a new FontPak in one pass. Remember, the SAVE action
is only available if you're acting on only a single port. If you select more
than one port, the SAVE action is disabled.

AVAILABLE FONTPAKS

	The Available FontPak list displays FontPaks with their ".FP" file
extensions which FontManager adds to the names of all FontPak files. Whenever
you are asked for a FontPak name, you DO NOT need to enter this extension.
Doing so, however, won't hurt a thing. 

GENERAL - SCREEN DESIGNS vs SCREEN RESOLUTION

	The windows in FontManger were written to look the best on high
resolution video systems, 1024x768 in particular. They display just fine in
std VGA mode, but do look a little "Horsey" to steal a Kathleen Tinkel phrase.
I just felt most people with enough fonts to need this program would have
better than VGA resolution video systems.

FONT ID NUMBERS

	During Initial Setup and Update, FontManager assigns Font ID Numbers
to each font it adds to the Master Font Library. These Font ID Numbers are used
when creating new fontpaks and when adding individual fonts to a printer port.
When FontManager is initally setup, these Font ID numbers are in the same order
as the alphabetical order of the full font names. As the UPDATE routine adds
newly installed fonts, they are added to the end of the master file and their
Font ID numbers have no relationship to any alphabetical order. Thus, if the
1789th font added to the library is named AARDVARK, it will have the Font ID
number 1789 and not 1. Just don't be surprised when you print a Master Font
Library Catalog which is ordered alphabetically by full font name and the Font
ID numbers are not in order.

VIEW/EDIT WIN.INI

	Selecting this option under the FILES menu will display the current
WIN.INI file in a text box. You may move through this text box with the scroll
bars, up/down arrows or page up/page down keys. You may also edit WIN.INI in
this text box. All the standard Windows text box editing tools are available.
Save the edited version by selecting SAVE from the FILE menu. If you save an
edited version of WIN.INI, Windows will re-read it immediately.

   Starlite Software Multimedia Product Listing

   CLASSIC CLIPS AVI CD ROM (Volume 1)
   Starlite Software is proud to announce our  new  CD  Rom  product,  Classic
   Clips.   This  is  a  collection  of over six hundred megabytes of AVI full
   motion video files, Wav sound files and GIF files. Classic  Clips  includes
   the new Whoop It Up!  3.0 AVI, and the terrific Movie Time Screen Saver. If
   you  aren't  familiar  with  AVI,  it  is  the  new  Microsoft standard for
   animation in Windows 3.1.  Other than your CD rom drive, you don't need any
   special hardware.  We include the all of the Microsoft  drivers  needed  to
   play AVI files.

   The  Classic  Clips  CD Rom comes jam-packed with exciting movie clips from
   classic drama, comedy, cartoons, sports and action.  We have also  included
   many  movie "trailers" from the classics.  These trailers are great for use
   with the Movie Time Screen Saver.  Many of the clips are only a few seconds
   long, so they are good for use with Whoop It Up! 3.0 AVI. Most of the clips
   include sound, although we have several from the golden age of  the  silent
   screen.

   WHOOP IT UP! 3.0 AVI
   Whoop!  just  gets  better  and better.  Now with AVI support, Whoop It Up!
   allows you to attach AVI files to your Windows Applications in addition  to
   wav  and midi files.  Now when you start your Windows programs a movie clip
   will be displayed in a pop-up window.  Way Cool!

   Other features include the addition of mouse clicks and keyboard clicks  to
   the  event  list.  And now you can define up to 4 random directories. (This
   program is included on the Fantastic Flicks CD Rom)

   MOVIE TIME SCREEN SAVER
   Our new Movie Time Screen Saver is the best screen  saver  yet!   Play  AVI
   movies  or  display still graphic in .gif, .pcx, and .bmp formats.  You can
   customize Movie Time with passwords, and turn the sound on  and  off.   The
   movies  play  in  "full  screen" AVI mode. (This program is included in the
   Fantastic Flicks CD Rom).

   FANFARE
   Fanfare  is  a  great  collection  of Multimedia Utilities for Windows 3.1.
   Fanfare includes  Yakkity  Clock  (the  ultimate  talking  clock),  Yakkity
   Monitor  (a  talking  system monitor with alarms) and Wave Editor (a 16 bit
   stereo WAV file editor).  Also included are 14 animated screen savers  with
   sound,  and  additional  wav and midi files - over 1.5 megs! This is a must
   have if you like Windows multimedia!

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Outside the U.S.A.: Call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer near

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.


To Order, in the U.S.A.: Call 800-245-6717 and ask Customer Service.

Outside the U.S.A.: Call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer near
