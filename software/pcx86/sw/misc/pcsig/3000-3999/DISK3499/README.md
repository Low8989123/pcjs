This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
900 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'INSTALL' at
the DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy
access to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.  All the programs are logically divided into thirteen
major categories with subcategories, making it easier to find just the
right software.

All of the programs have been scanned for viruses.  There are also three
online virus utilities that can be run from the CD-ROM which will scan,
screen and clean viruses.  Not only does this save hard disk space, but
also gives every user added security from viruses.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

Winner of the Optical Publishing Assn's Best Consumer Product Award.

Shareware for every imaginable need: Accounting Chemistry Educational
Engineering Games Hypertext Networks Programming Spreadsheets Utilities
Word Processing

Additional BBS file descriptions are available from PC-SIG so that the
CD-ROM can be set up quickly on a bulletin board.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 530K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
a graphics monitor (Hercules/EGA/VGA/SVGA).  A mouse is optional.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

Now you can play a game a day fo over a year.  This CD-ROM is jammed
with over 380 shareware games of all types, designed to appeal to the
new generation of CD-ROM users out for fun.  The CD incorporates a
hypermedia interface and allows 250 of the games to be played directly
from the CD-ROM.

The hottest games in shareware are on this disk, including the
action/arcade games "Jill of the Jungle" and "Wolfenstein 3D," which
rival or surpass commercial PC and Nintendo for use of animation,
SoundBlaster audio, and VGA graphics.  There are also games designed to
teach children mathematics, spelling and even ecology.  All these games
for less than a dime each!

Over 250 of the games can be played directly from the CD without copying
them to a floppy or a hard drive.  Being able to run from the CD means
that users can explore games without using up valuable hard disk space
or spending time downloading and deleting files.  The hypermedia
interface makes it easy to browse the titles, read a one line
description or full review, and copy or start a game by clicking the
mouse or using the keyboard.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

                           Release 2.0 - November 1991


                               PRODUCT INFORMATION


                     Copyright (c) 1991 by Stellar Industries
                               All Rights Reserved


                              Quasar SQL For Windows


          Designed to take full advantage of the Microsoft Windows
          environment, with its pull down menus, dialog boxes, icons and
          instant access to on-line help,  Quasar SQL For Windows is
          incredibly easy to use.  Besides a clear error handling and
          reporting interface, the system also supports a complete
          transaction management facility.

          Quasar SQL For Windows is the ideal choice for creating Windows
          relational database applications.  It provides:

          o    A full-featured relational data base engine (the Quasar
               Database Administrator)

          o    A multiple document editor (the Quasar Query Editor) for
               on-line interactive queries

          o    An SQL call interface (the Quasar SQL API dynamic link
               library), giving developers a choice of front-end
               development environments such as 'C', 'C++', 'Visual
               Basic', 'Pascal' etc.

          o    An implementation of the American National Standard
               X.3.135-1986 SQL specification (level 2)* plus an
               advanced indexing capability

          All programs are written in 'C' for the Microsoft Windows
          environment utilizing either 80286, 80386 or 80486 processors.
          They may be run under Microsoft Windows 3.0 in either
          "standard mode" or "enhanced mode".

          Complete examples, including source code, are included for
          both Microsoft 'C' application developers and for Microsoft
          'Visual Basic' application developers.


          *    This release does not implement the UNION operator or the
               CREATE VIEW statement.  For an excellent guide to the SQL
               language see C. J. Date "A Guide To DB2," Addison-Wesley
               (1985).

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

                              Quasar SQL For Windows


          Designed to take full advantage of the Microsoft Windows
          environment, with its pull down menus, dialog boxes, icons and
          instant access to on-line help,  Quasar SQL For Windows is
          incredibly easy to use.  Besides a clear error handling and
          reporting interface, the system also supports a complete
          transaction management facility.

          Quasar SQL For Windows is the ideal choice for creating Windows
          relational database applications.  It provides:

          o    A full-featured relational data base engine (the Quasar
               Database Administrator)

          o    A multiple document editor (the Quasar Query Editor) for
               on-line interactive queries

          o    An SQL call interface (the Quasar SQL API dynamic link
               library), giving developers a choice of front-end
               development environments such as 'C', 'C++', 'Visual
               Basic', 'Pascal' etc.

          o    An implementation of the American National Standard
               X.3.135-1986 SQL specification (level 2)* plus an
               advanced indexing capability

          All programs are written in 'C' for the Microsoft Windows
          environment utilizing either 80286, 80386 or 80486 processors.
          They may be run under Microsoft Windows 3.0 in either
          "standard mode" or "enhanced mode".

          Complete examples, including source code, are included for
          both Microsoft 'C' application developers and for Microsoft
          'Visual Basic' application developers.


          *    This release does not implement the UNION operator or the
               CREATE VIEW statement.  For an excellent guide to the SQL
               language see C. J. Date "A Guide To DB2," Addison-Wesley
               (1985).

          processing organization or value added re-seller (VAR): Quasar
          SQL For Windows may be used as your database platform for
          Windows application development.  For a fraction of the cost
          of other systems, Quasar SQL For Windows puts a well designed
          Windows relational data base management system at your
          fingertips.

                               GENERAL INFORMATION


                     Copyright (c) 1991 by Stellar Industries

                             Release 2.0 Enhancements


          Quasar SQL For Windows Release 2.0 adds significant new
          features:

          ***** Quasar SQL Applications Programming Interface (API)

          What is the Quasar SQL API?

               The Quasar SQL API is a powerful tool that enables you,
               the software developer, to have full access to a modern,
               highly optimized ANSI standard SQL database manager: the
               Quasar Database Administrator.  Your programs written in
               any language which can access dynamic link libraries can
               also access the Quasar SQL API.  These languages include
               'C', 'C++', 'Visual Basic', 'Pascal' and most assemblers.
               In fact, any program which can access the Microsoft
               Windows environment can access the Quasar SQL API.
               Microsoft Windows itself is a dynamic link library.

               The Quasar SQL API is your gateway to modern database
               technology.  With a little more than a dozen functions
               and only 4 data structures you can perform almost any
               database task.

          How does the Quasar SQL API work?

               "How is this done?"  you might ask.  Well, while the
               Quasar Database Administrator is sophisticated, complex
               and fully optimized for maximum performance: the Quasar
               SQL API is simple and straight forward.  The Quasar SQL
               API effectively buffers you from all the complex tasks of
               parsing, query analysis, query optimization, query tree
               construction, etc.

          How do I link to the Quasar SQL API?

               When programming in 'C', you need to do only three things
               to include all the power of SQL in your application:
          General Information                                Page 2 of 8


               1)   When you link your object modules, include the
                    SQL.LIB import library along with libw.lib.

               2)   Include the SQL.H file (e.g. "#include <sql.h>") in
                    your source code.

               3)   Put the Quasar Database Administrator (DBA.EXE) and
                    Quasar SQL API (SQL.DLL) someplace where windows can
                    find them (usually in your windows directory).

               When programming in 'Visual Basic', you need to do only
               two things to include all the power of SQL in your
               application:

               1)   Be sure to use the SQL.GBL file included with the
                    Quasar SQL API.  Note that the 'C' style prefixes
                    used with variable names (i.e. the 'n' in
                    nResultCode, and the 'sz' in szErrorMessage) are not
                    used with 'Visual Basic'.

               2)   Put the Quasar Database Administrator (DBA.EXE) and
                    Quasar SQL API (SQL.DLL) someplace where windows can
                    find them (usually in your windows directory).

          How do I use the Quasar SQL API?

               Your program can login to the Quasar Database
               Administrator (SqlLogin), open a cursor (SqlCursorOpen)
               and execute a query (SqlExecute).  The query itself is
               passed to the Quasar SQL API as a simple text string.  The
               Quasar SQL API does all the work for you.  To get your
               answers back (from a SELECT statement, for example) you
               simply fetch them one at a time from the Quasar SQL API.
               You can fetch the first record (SqlFetchFirst), last
               record (SqlFetchLast), next record (SqlFetchNext),
               previous record (SqlFetchPrevious) or even a record at a
               position you specify (SqlFetchPositioned).

               You can have several cursors open at a time so that you
               can access your data the way you want.

               When you're all done, close your cursors (SqlCursorClose)
               and log out (SqlLogout).

          How can I check out my SQL statements?

               You can check out your SQL statements using the Quasar
               Query Editor (QE.EXE) included with the Quasar SQL API.
               The Quasar Query Editor allows you to type in the query
               your program is going to send to the Quasar SQL API and
               have it execute right there in front of you.  You'll get
               all the results back on the screen where you can verify
               it's what you expected.  In fact, the Quasar Query Editor
               uses the Quasar SQL API the same way your program does.

          ***** GENERAL PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT

               Quasar SQL For Windows Release 2.0 has significant
               performance improvements over both Release 1.0 (about 6
               fold) and Release 1.1 (about 2 fold) as evidenced by the
               timings below.  These queries are available to you in the
               EXAMPLE.ZIP file.

            +--------------------------------------------------------+
            | release:           |    1.0    |    1.1    |    2.0    |
            |--------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------|
            | QUERY15.SQL        |  6.0 sec. |  1.4 sec. |  0.5 sec. |

            +--------------------------------------------------------+
              (80386 33MHz, 17 msec IDE disk, HYPERDISK disk cache)

          ***** OTHER ENHANCEMENTS

               Significantly fewer records are written to the
               transaction journal.



                     Unpacking and Installation Instructions


          Quasar SQL For Windows is provided as a single compressed file.
          (WINSQL20.ZIP).  The contents of WINSQL20.ZIP are defined in
          the included PACKING.LST file.

          Efficient operation of SQL For Windows requires that you use a
          disk cache manager (such as MicroSoft's SMARTDRV.SYS).  For
          superior performance use a disk cache manager which also
          caches disk writes, such as Norton Disk Cache (available with
          Norton Utilities) or Hyperdisk Disk Accelerator (available as
          shareware from HyperWare*).  We at Stellar Industries
          recommend Hyperdisk Disk Accelerator with which we observe a
          three to six fold performance enhancement verses SMARTDRV.SYS.
          Hyperdisk is available on many BBS's as HYDK421.ZIP.
          Documentation for these disk cache managers should be
          carefully reviewed.  Utilizing SMARTDRV.SYS instead of
          HyperDisk, the above timings become:

          Adding indices to tables greatly enhances performance.  A
          simple SELECT which extracts 5 records from a table of 3000
          takes 10.6 seconds without an index.  The same SELECT
          statement takes only 0.6 seconds when there is an index on the
          table.

          While indices may be created at any time, we recommend that
          you create indices immediately after you create their base
          tables, otherwise CREATE INDEX has to read and rewrite all
          data which is already in the table.

          The importance of a good disk cache manager and thoughtful
          database design including the use of indices (where
          appropriate) cannot be over emphasized.

          In order to properly install SQL For Windows on your computer
          you will need to perform the following steps:

          1)   Use your favorite editor (NOTEPAD.EXE will suffice) to
               insure that your 'CONFIG.SYS' file has the 'FILES=' MSDOS
               parameter set to at least 30.

          2)   Move DBA.EXE, DBA.HLP, QE.EXE, QE.HLP, SQL.DLL and
               SQL.HLP to the directory in which you keep windows
               programs.  This is usually the 'c:\windows' directory.

          3)   Make two new directories.  One will be for the Quasar
               Database Administrator's files (we recommend naming it
               'database'), the other will be for your queries and data
               (we recommend naming it 'data').  You can use the MS-DOS
               'mkdir' command to do this.

          4)   Unpack EXAMPLE.ZIP (contained within WINSQL20.ZIP).  This
               file contains both sample queries and an import file to
               load some sample data into the database.  We recommend
               putting these files in your 'data' directory.

          5)   Use your favorite editor (NOTEPAD.EXE will suffice) to
               modify the windows initialization file WIN.INI.  This
               file can usually be found in the 'c:\windows' directory.
               Add the following lines:

                    [QuasarDba]
                    AutoStart=1
                    DatabasePath=c:\database
                    DataFilePath=c:\data
          General Information                                Page 5 of 8


                    FileNameDatabaseDump=c:\temp\quasar.dmp

                    [QuasarQe]
                    Acknowledge=1
                    DataFilePath=c:\data
                    OpenNew=1
                    UserName=SYSTEM
                    UserPassword=QUASAR
                    WarnOnClose=1

               As DBA.EXE and QE.EXE automatically add some of these
               lines if they do not already exist, be sure you are not
               adding duplicate entries.  If you edit WIN.INI before
               running DBA.EXE or QE.EXE you don't have to worry.

               These entries have the following meanings:

               [QuasarDba]          Identifies a block of entries as
                                   belonging to the Quasar Database
                                   Administrator.

               AutoStart           Set to '0' or '1'. When set to '1'
                                   causes the Quasar Database
                                   Administrator to automatically start
                                   the database as soon as you start the
                                   program.

               DatabasePath        Set to the path you want the database
                                   files to reside in.  Make sure to
                                   create this directory before starting
                                   the Quasar Database Administrator.  We
                                   recommend naming it 'database'.

               DatafilePath        Set to the path you want to use as
                                   the default for import and export
                                   operations.  We recommend naming it
                                   'data'.

               FileNameDatabaseDump       Set to the full file name of
                                   the file you want the Quasar Database
                                   Administrator to use for the 'dump'
                                   operation.

               [QuasarQe]           Identifies a block of entries as
                                   belonging to the Quasar Query Editor.

               Acknowledge         Set to '0' or '1'. When set to '1'
                                   causes the Quasar Query Editor to
                                   display an informational dialog box
                                   every time a query completes.

               DataFilePath        Set to the path you want to use as
                                   the default for file operations.  We
                                   recommend naming it 'data'.

               OpenNew             Set to '0' or '1'. When set to '1'
                                   causes the Quasar Query Editor to
                                   automatically create a new 'pad' when
                                   the Query Editor first starts.

               UserName            Set to 'SYSTEM'.  This identifies the
                                   default user name.

               UserPassword        Set to 'QUASAR'.  This identifies the
                                   default user password.

               WarnOnClose         Set to '0' or '1'. When set to '1'
                                   causes the Quasar Query Editor to
                                   prompt the user for a file name
                                   before closing a pad which contains
                                   text not yet saved to disk.

               SQL For Windows also relies upon the international date
               and time settings.  The Windows defaults are fine and you
               can leave them alone.  If you've changed them, don't
               worry, time stamps are saved in binary and not converted
               to international format until used for output.  If you're
               interested, we recommend the following settings:

                    [intl]
                    iDate=0
                    iTime=0
                    s1159=AM
                    s2359=PM

               International date and time settings are most easily
               changed via Microsoft's Windows Control Panel.  Select
               the "International" icon then click on either "date" or
               "time".

          6)   Use Microsoft's Program Manager to create a new program
               group:

               a) select 'File', 'New'

               b) select 'Program Group', 'OK'

               c) Enter description: 'Quasar', group file: 'QUASAR'

               d) select 'OK'

          7)   Use Microsoft's Program Manager to create two new program
               items:

               a) select 'File', 'New'

               b) select Program Item, 'OK'

               c) Enter description: 'Dba', command line: 'DBA.EXE'
          General Information                                Page 7 of 8


               d) select 'OK'

               e) select 'File', 'New'

               f) select Program Item, 'OK'

               g) Enter description: 'Qe', command line: 'QE.EXE'

               h) select 'OK'

          8)   Start the Quasar Database Administrator by clicking on the
               'Dba' Icon in the Microsoft Program Manager.  When the
               Quasar Database Administrator complains that it can't find
               a database, click on "OK".  Now select 'Toolbox' in the
               main menu.  Select the 'Install' entry, this will install
               the database in the directory identified by the
               'DatabasePath' setting described above.

          9)   At this point the database is fully installed.  To run
               some sample queries, see the section "Example Queries"
               below.

          10)  If you're not going to use the Quasar SQL Applications
               Programming Interface (API), you may exit ('Exit' is in
               the 'File' menu) the Quasar Database Administrator.

          11)  If you intend to use the Quasar SQL API for 'C' program
               development:  Move SQL.LIB into some directory where it
               is accessible by your linker (usually c:\windev\lib).
               Move SQL.H to a directory where it is accessible to the
               compiler (usually c:\c\include).  You will probably want
               to read SQL.DOC.  A sample application program is
               included as EXAMPLEC.*.  You ought to compile, link and
               run it (the batch file EXAMPLEC.BAT is included to
               accomplish this) to familiarize yourself with the Quasar
               SQL API.

          12)  If you intend to use the Quasar SQL API for 'Visual Basic'
               program development:  A sample application program is
               included.  Move EXAMBLEB.* to a directory where you keep
               your 'Visual Basic' programs (usually c:\vb).  You ought
               to compile and run EXAMPLEB to familiarize yourself with
               the Quasar SQL API.  You will probably want to read
               SQL.DOC.



                                 Example Queries


          You will probably want to run our examples to familiarize
          yourself with the operation of SQL For Windows.

          1)   Start the Quasar Database Administrator by clicking on the
               'Dba' Icon in the Microsoft Program Manager.  The
               database ought to start automatically.  If you didn't set
               AutoStart=1 in the WIN.INI file, when the Quasar Database
               Administrator's window appears select 'Control' from its
               menu.  Select the 'Start' entry, this will start the
               database.

          2)   Start the Quasar Query Editor by clicking on the 'Qe' icon
               in the Microsoft Program Manager.  When the Quasar Query
               Editor's window appears select 'File' from its menu.  Now
               select the 'Open' entry and open the file CREATE.SQL.
               This is one of the files contained in EXAMPLE.ZIP.  When
               its text appears in a pad select the menu commands
               'Database', 'Execute' (or hit control/x).  This query
               creates the tables of the example database.

          3)   Now go to the Quasar Database Administrator and select the
               menu commands 'File', 'Import'.  Select the file
               EXAMPLE.DAT.  This is one of the files contained in
               EXAMPLE.ZIP.  The 'Import' loads the data in EXAMPLE.DAT
               into the tables you created with CREATE.SQL.

          4)   You can now execute any of the sample queries contained
               in EXAMPLE.ZIP.  Go to the Quasar Query Editor, open a
               file (for example QUERY01.SQL) and execute it.  Files
               which contain select statements will cause the Quasar
               Query Editor to open a new pad and place the results as
               text into the new pad.  You may then edit the data and/or
               save it to a file using the 'File', 'Save As' commands.

          5)   To remove the sample data from the database just execute
               the SQL 'drop table' statements in the DROP.SQL file.

          6)   You are now ready to write your own SQL statements and
               create your own database.

                                     Overview


          What is the Quasar SQL API?

                    The Quasar SQL API is a powerful tool that enables
                    you, the software developer, to have full access to
                    a modern, highly optimized ANSI standard SQL
                    database manager: the Quasar Database Administrator.
                    Your programs written in any language which can
                    access dynamic link libraries can also access the
                    Quasar SQL API.  These languages include 'C', 'C++',
                    'Visual Basic', 'Pascal' and most assemblers.  In
                    fact, any program which can access the Microsoft
                    Windows environment can access the Quasar SQL API.
                    Microsoft Windows itself is a dynamic link library.

                    The Quasar SQL API is your gateway to modern database
                    technology.  With a little more than a dozen
                    functions and only 4 data structures you can perform
                    almost any database task.

          How does the Quasar SQL API work?

                    "How is this done?" you might ask.  Well, while the
                    Quasar Database Administrator is sophisticated,
                    complex and fully optimized for maximum performance:
                    the Quasar SQL API is simple and straight forward.
                    The Quasar SQL API effectively buffers you from all
                    the complex tasks of parsing, query analysis, query
                    optimization, query tree construction, etc.

          How do I link to the Quasar SQL API?

                    When programming in 'C', you need to do only three
                    things to include all the power of SQL in your
                    application:

                    1)   When you link your object modules, include the
                         SQL.LIB import library along with LIBW.LIB.

                    2)   Include the SQL.H file (e.g.  "#include
                         <SQL.H>") in your source code.

                    3)   Put the Quasar Database Administrator (DBA.EXE)
                         and Quasar SQL API (SQL.DLL) someplace where
                         windows can find them (usually in your windows
                         directory).

                    When programming in 'Visual Basic', you need to do
                    only two things to include all the power of SQL in
                    your application:






                                                                Overview
          Quasar SQL API                                    Page 3 of 51


                    1)   Be sure to use the SQL.GBL file included with
                         the Quasar SQL API.  Note that the 'C' style
                         prefixes used with variable names (i.e.  the
                         'n' in nResultCode, and the 'sz' in
                         szErrorMessage) are not used with 'Visual
                         Basic'.

                    2)   Put the Quasar Database Administrator (DBA.EXE)
                         and Quasar SQL API (SQL.DLL) someplace where
                         windows can find them (usually in your windows
                         directory).

          How do I use the Quasar SQL API?

                    Your program can login to the Quasar Database
                    Administrator (SqlLogin), open a cursor
                    (SqlCursorOpen) and execute a query (SqlExecute).
                    The query itself is passed to the Quasar SQL API as a
                    simple text string.  The Quasar SQL API does all the
                    work for you.  To get your answers back (from a
                    SELECT statement, for example) you simply fetch them
                    one at a time from the Quasar SQL API.  You can fetch
                    the first record (SqlFetchFirst), last record
                    (SqlFetchLast), next record (SqlFetchNext), previous
                    record (SqlFetchPrevious) or even a record at a
                    position you specify (SqlFetchPositioned).

                    You can have several cursors open at a time so that
                    you can access your data the way you want.

                    When you're all done, close your cursors
                    (SqlCursorClose) and log out (SqlLogout).

          How can I check out my SQL statements?

                    You can check out your SQL statements using the
                    Quasar Query Editor (QE.EXE) included with the Quasar
                    SQL API.  The Quasar Query Editor allows you to type
                    in the query your program is going to send to the
                    Quasar SQL API and have it execute right there in
                    front of you.  You'll get all the results back on
                    the screen where you can verify it's what you
                    expected.  In fact, the Quasar Query Editor uses the
                    Quasar SQL API the same way your program does.

                                    Functions


          All Quasar SQL API functions utilize a common structure to
          maintain generic information : SQLCONTROL.  All functions load
          descriptive error information into this structure should an
          error condition arise.  The basic status condition is the
          nResultCode field of this data structure.  All Quasar SQL API
          functions set this field to the appropriate result code in the
          event of an error.  Note: All Quasar SQL API functions clear
          this field to 0 at entry.

                         hUser          HANDLE Identifies the user who
                                        owns the cursor.  The hUser
                                        parameter must have been created
                                        with the SqlLogin function.

                         hCursor        HANDLE Identifies the cursor to

                         This function creates a cursor.  You must
                         create a cursor after you have logged in
                         (SqlLogin) and before you execute a query
                         (SqlExecute).  You can create as many cursors
                         as you need for your application.

                         Parameter      Type/Description

                         hUser          HANDLE Identifies the user who
                                        will own the cursor.  The hUser
                                        parameter must have been created
                                        with the SqlLogin function.

                         lpSqlControl   LPSQLCONTROL Points to an SQL
                                        Control Structure.  Any errors
                                        that may occur cause the
                                        szErrorDetail, szErrorMessage
                                        and nResultCode fields of this
                                        structure to be loaded with
                                        descriptive information.

          Return Value   The return value is a cursor handle if no
                         errors occurred while opening the cursor,
                         otherwise it is 0.

          Comments       The cursors created by one user are not
                         available to another.  Once a cursor has been
                         created and used in an SqlExecute, it may be
                         reused in another SqlExecute by the same user.
                         When a cursor is reused in this manner, the
                         Quasar SQL API effectively closes the cursor and
                         re-opens it with the same handle prior to
                         executing the next query.  Note that when a
                         cursor is reused, any old result table
                         associated with it is dropped.  Cursors are
                         closed with SqlCursorClose.  Cursors should be
                         closed before logging off with SqlLogout.

                         SQLCOLUMN structure pointed to by the
                         lpSqlColumn parameter.  To describe a column
                         you must have already logged in (SqlLogin),
                         created a cursor (SqlCursorOpen) and executed a
                         query (SqlExecute) which contained an SQL
                         SELECT statement.

                                        which the column exists.  The
                                        hCursor parameter must have been
                                        created with the SqlCursorOpen
                                        function.  A result table must
                                        be associated with the cursor.
                                        A result table is created when a

          Comments       Simply calling SqlExecute does not commit your
                         query.  Queries are committed when you execute
                         an SQL COMMIT WORK statement.  Be sure to
                         execute this vital statement whenever you want
                         your program to permanently modify the
                         database.

                         Each user must close all cursors which have an
                         associated result table before executing an SQL
                         COMMIT WORK statement.  This is to insure that
                         your application has completed its access to
                         the result table before permanently committing
                         the transaction.  A convenient way to do this
                         is to use the same cursor for the COMMIT WORK
                         as you did for the SELECT: the Quasar SQL API
                         automatically drops any result table that may
                         be associated with a cursor when the cursor is
                         reused.

                         Without the SQL COMMIT WORK statement, all your
                         transactions will be rolled back when either an
                         error occurs or when you log off (SqlLogout).
                         The only exception to this is if you have the
                         mSqlFlagAutoCommitOnLogout option flag set in
                         the wFlags field of the lpSqlControl parameter
                         when you log off.  Only in this case are all
                         your transactions automatically committed at
                         logout, and then only if no errors have
                         occurred.

                         by the lpRecordBuffer parameter.  To fetch this
                         record you must have already logged in
                         (SqlLogin), created a cursor (SqlCursorOpen)
                         and executed a query (SqlExecute) which

                                        parameter must have been created
                                        with the SqlLogin function.

                         hCursor        HANDLE Identifies the cursor

                                        which the record exists.  The
                                        hCursor parameter must have been
                                        created with the SqlCursorOpen
                                        function.  A result table must
                                        be associated with the cursor.
                                        A result table is created when a

          Comments       The usual procedure for using the SqlFetchFirst
                         function is as follows:

                         1)   Set Data Format in the wFlags field of the
                              lpSqlControl parameter to the option you
                              intend to use.  If you have selected the
                              mSqlFlagFormatPadded option, set the
                              nPadding field of the lpSqlControl
                              parameter to the number of spaces you want
                              between fields.

                         2)   Call SqlExecute.

                         3)   Call SqlDescribeTable to determine the
                              characteristics of the result table.  Of
                              particular interest are the nRecordSize
                              and lNumberOfRecords fields of the
                              resultant SQLTABLE structure.

                         4)   If SqlTable.lNumberOfRecords indicates
                              that one or more result table records are
                              available, allocate a buffer sufficiently
                              large (at least as large as
                              SqlTable.nRecordSize) to receive the
                              record's data.  Set the lpRecordBuffer
                              parameter to point to this buffer and set
                              the nRecordBufferSize field of the
                              lpSqlControl parameter to the size of the
                              buffer.

                         5)   Call SqlFetchFirst.

                         Once these steps are completed, you can make
                         unlimited calls to any of the Quasar SQL API
                         fetch functions without repeating steps (1)
                         through (4).  The same lpRecordBuffer can be
                         reused for all fetches.  Note, however, should
                         you change the Data Format setting in the
                         wFlags field of the lpSqlControl parameter, you
                         must call SqlDescribeTable to calculate the new
                         nRecordSize setting, reallocate the
                         lpRecordBuffer and adjust the nRecordBufferSize
                         field of the lpSqlControl parameter
                         accordingly.

                                        parameter must have been created
                                        with the SqlLogin function.

                         hCursor        HANDLE Identifies the cursor
                                        which owns the result table in
                                        which the record exists.  The
                                        hCursor parameter must have been
                                        created with the SqlCursorOpen
                                        function.  A result table must
                                        be associated with the cursor.
                                        A result table is created when a

                                        This buffer must be at least as

          Comments       The usual procedure for using the SqlFetchLast
                         function is as follows:

                         1)   Set Data Format in the wFlags field of the
                              lpSqlControl parameter to the option you
                              intend to use.  If you have selected the
                              mSqlFlagFormatPadded option, set the
                              nPadding field of the lpSqlControl
                              parameter to the number of spaces you want
                              between fields.

                         2)   Call SqlExecute.

                         3)   Call SqlDescribeTable to determine the
                              characteristics of the result table.  Of
                              particular interest are the nRecordSize
                              and lNumberOfRecords fields of the
                              resultant SQLTABLE structure.

                         4)   If SqlTable.lNumberOfRecords indicates
                              that one or more result table records are
                              available, allocate a buffer sufficiently
                              large (at least as large as
                              SqlTable.nRecordSize) to receive the
                              record's data.  Set the lpRecordBuffer
                              parameter to point to this buffer and set
                              the nRecordBufferSize field of the
                              lpSqlControl parameter to the size of the
                              buffer.

                         5)   Call SqlFetchLast.

                         Once these steps are completed, you can make
                         unlimited calls to any of the Quasar SQL API
                         fetch functions without repeating steps (1)
                         through (4).  The same lpRecordBuffer can be
                         reused for all fetches.  Note, however, should
                         you change the Data Format setting in the
                         wFlags field of the lpSqlControl parameter, you
                         must call SqlDescribeTable to calculate the new
                         nRecordSize setting, reallocate the
                         lpRecordBuffer and adjust the nRecordBufferSize
                         field of the lpSqlControl parameter
                         accordingly.

                         then or equal to the number of records in the
                         table, otherwise it is 0.

          Comments       Physical position is the raw position of the
                         record in the file.  Physical order is not the
                         same as the order you specify with the SQL
                         ORDER BY clause.

                         The usual procedure for using the
                         SqlFetchPositioned function is as follows:

                         1)   Set Data Format in the wFlags field of the
                              lpSqlControl parameter to the option you
                              intend to use.  If you have selected the
                              mSqlFlagFormatPadded option, set the
                              nPadding field of the lpSqlControl
                              parameter to the number of spaces you want
                              between fields.

                         2)   Call SqlExecute.

                         3)   Call SqlDescribeTable to determine the
                              characteristics of the result table.  Of
                              particular interest are the nRecordSize
                              and lNumberOfRecords fields of the
                              resultant SQLTABLE structure.

                         4)   If SqlTable.lNumberOfRecords indicates
                              that one or more result table records are
                              available, allocate a buffer sufficiently
                              large (at least as large as
                              SqlTable.nRecordSize) to receive the
                              record's data.  Set the lpRecordBuffer
                              parameter to point to this buffer and set
                              the nRecordBufferSize field of the
                              lpSqlControl parameter to the size of the
                              buffer.

                         5)   Call SqlFetchPositioned.

                         Once these steps are completed, you can make
                         unlimited calls to any of the Quasar SQL API
                         fetch functions without repeating steps (1)
                         through (4).  The same lpRecordBuffer can be
                         reused for all fetches.  Note, however, should
                         you change the Data Format setting in the
                         wFlags field of the lpSqlControl parameter, you

                         This function reads the previous record in the
                         result table associated with the hCursor
                         parameter.  The data in this record is
                         formatted and loaded into the buffer provided
                         by the caller and pointed to by the
                         lpRecordBuffer parameter.  To fetch this record
                         you must have already preformed at least one
                         SqlFetchFirst or SqlFetchLast or
                         SqlFetchPositioned function.

                         Parameter Type/Description

                         hUser          HANDLE Identifies the user who
                                        owns the cursor.  The hUser
                                        parameter must have been created
                                        with the SqlLogin function.

                         hCursor        HANDLE Identifies the cursor
                                        which owns the result table in
                                        which the record exists.  The
                                        hCursor parameter must have been
                                        created with the SqlCursorOpen
                                        function.  A result table must
                                        be associated with the cursor.
                                        A result table is created when a
                                        query containing an SQL SELECT
                                        statement is passed to
                                        SqlExecute.

                         lpSqlControl   LPSQLCONTROL Points to an SQL
                                        Control Structure.  Any errors
                                        that may occur cause the
                                        szErrorDetail, szErrorMessage
                                        and nResultCode fields of this

                         lpRecordBuffer LPSTR Points to a buffer
                                        provided by the caller to
                                        receive the formatted record.
                                        This buffer must be at least as
                                        large as the nRecordSize field
                                        of SQLTABLE structure indicates.

          Return Value   The return value is 1 if no errors occurred and
                         the cursor was not already positioned at the
                         first record, otherwise it is 0.

                         This function returns status information about
                         the most recent call to SqlExecute which used
                         the cursor indicated by the hCursor parameter.
                         Status information includes the number of
                         database records deleted, inserted, selected or

                         0, SqlGetStatus simply tests for the presence
                         of an active running Quasar Database
                         Administrator.  A value of 1 is returned if and

                         In order to access the SQL Database
                         Administrator you must first identify yourself
                         as an user with sufficient privilege to access
                         the database.  This is accomplished by calling
                         the SqlLogin function with your user name and
                         password.  Once logged in, you can reference
                         all your tables without specifying an user
                         name. To reference another user's table you
                         must prefix the table name with the other
                         user's user name.  For example for user
                         "JohnDoe" to select all columns of the system
                         tables he must use:

                         occurred while logging in, otherwise it is 0.
                         You must use this user handle in all calls to
                         the Quasar SQL API.

                              Constants: Data Format


          When a record is fetched from the result table by means of one
          of the SqlFetch functions, the Quasar SQL API loads the record
          into a buffer provided by the user.  The record is returned in
          one of three optional formats.  The user selects the format he
          wants by setting the wFlags field of the SQLCONTROL structure
          to one (and only one) of the following values:

          mSqlFlagFormatPadded     The record is returned as a single
                                   null terminated character string.
                                   The data for each column is contained
                                   within this string separated by
                                   spaces.  The number of spaces is set
                                   by the user in the nPadding field of
                                   the SQLCONTROL structure.  The length
                                   of the string is constant across all
                                   records and is available to the user
                                   in the nRecordSize field of the
                                   SQLTABLE data structure. The length
                                   of each column's portion of the
                                   string is available to the user in
                                   the nFieldWidth field of the
                                   SQLCOLUMN data structure.

          mSqlFlagFormatString     The record is returned as a set of
                                   null terminated character strings,
                                   one for each column. The first
                                   column's string is loaded into the
                                   first bytes of the record buffer. The
                                   second column's string immediately
                                   follows the first and so on.  Each
                                   string contains only the minimum
                                   number of characters to represent the
                                   data. That is, the strings are not
                                   padded.

          mSqlFlagFormatStructure  The record is returned as a packed
                                   'C' data structure.  This format is
                                   not recommended for 'Visual Basic'
                                   users. Fields appear in the 'C' data
                                   structure in the same order in which
                                   they appear in the result table.
                                   Character types are converted to null
                                   terminated character strings padded
                                   with spaces to bring them to the
                                   length of nFieldWidth as found in the
                                   SQLCOLUMN data structure.
                                   Approximate and exact numeric types
                                   are converted to their 'double'
                                   representation.  A record containing
                                   three fields: CHAR (10), INTEGER,
                                   DECIMAL(7,2) would appear as:

          When a query is executed via an SqlExecute call, it is not
          committed and will be rolled back if the user should happen to
          log off.

          mSqlFlagAutoCommitOnLogout Setting this bit of the wFlags
                                   field of the SQLCONTROL structure
                                   tells the Quasar SQL API to issue a
                                   commit command to the database
                                   administrator prior to logging the
                                   user off.  This flag may be set in
                                   combination (using the '|' operator)
                                   with any one of Data Format flags.

          While character string fields may be quite lengthy: names of
          users, tables and columns are limited.

          mSqlMaximumNameLength    This is the maximum length (not
                                   including the null terminator) of
                                   names of users, tables and columns.

                                 Data Structures


          This section includes a formal description of all data
          structures which your program will use when it communicates
          with the Quasar SQL API.  Typedefs for all these structures can
          be found in the Quasar SQL API include file for 'C'.
          Declarations can be found in the global file for 'Visual
          Basic'.

          SQLCOLUMN           The data structure which describes a
                              column in the result table which was
                              generated by execution of a query

          SQLCONTROL          The data structure which contains
                              information needed by the Quasar SQL API to
                              perform its functions and which passes
                              process information back to the user

          SQLSTATUS           The data structure with gives the user
                              access to operational information

          SQLTABLE            The data structure which describes the
                              result table which was generated by

                            Data Structures: SQLCOLUMN


                      Result Table Column Description Record


          The SQLCOLUMN data structure describes the characteristics of
          a specified column of the result table.  The SQLCOLUMN data
          structure is loaded as a result of an SqlDescribeColumn
          function call.

                    typedef struct tagSQLCOLUMN {
                      BOOL      bRightJustified;
                      char      szColumnName[mSqlMaximumNameLength+1];
                      unsigned  nColumnSequenceNumber;
                      unsigned  nDataClass;
                      unsigned  nDataType;
                      unsigned  nFieldWidth;
                      unsigned  nPrecision;
                      unsigned  nScale;
                    } SQLCOLUMN;
                    typedef SQLCOLUMN *PSQLCOLUMN;
                    typedef SQLCOLUMN far *LPSQLCOLUMN;

          The SQLCOLUMN data structure has the following fields:

          bRightJustified          Indicates whether the column, by
                                   default, is left or right justified.
                                   Right justification is indicated by a
                                   a non-zero value.

          szColumnName             Gives the column heading as a null
                                   terminated text string.

          nColumnSequenceNumber    Column numbers range from 1 to the
                                   number of columns in the result
                                   table.

          nDataClass               Identifies the general
                                   characteristics of a column in the
                                   result table.  Its value will be set
                                   to one of the Data Class constants.

          nDataType                Identifies the particular
                                   characteristics of a column in the
                                   result table.  Its value will be set
                                   to one of the Data Type constants.

          nFieldWidth              The number of character positions
                                   guaranteed to hold the value of this
                                   column when the record is fetched.
                                   If Data Format in the wFlags field of
                                   the lpSqlControl is
                                   mSqlFlagFormatPadded: nFieldWidth is

                                   set to the size of the column.  If
                                   Data Format is mSqlFlagFormatString:
                                   nFieldWidth is set to the size of the
                                   column plus one for the terminating
                                   null. If Data Format is
                                   mSqlFlagFormatStructure and the
                                   column is numeric: nFieldWidth is set
                                   to sizeof(double), if the column is a
                                   character string type: nFieldWidth is
                                   set to the size of the column plus
                                   one for the terminating null.

          nPrecision               If a numeric column, nPrecision is
                                   set to the precision (as defined by
                                   ANSI SQL) of the result.  If a
                                   character field, nPrecision is set to
                                   the length (as defined by ANSI SQL)
                                   of the result.

          nScale                   If a numeric column, nScale is set to
                                   the scale (as defined by ANSI SQL) of
                                   the result.  If a character field,
                                   nScale is 0.

                    Quasar SQL API Interface Control Structure


          The SQLCONTROL data structure contains the specifications
          necessary to provide an interface between the applications
          programmer and the Quasar SQL API.

                    typedef struct tagSQLCONTROL {
                      char      szErrorDetail[65];

                      unsigned  nHiLiteOffset;
                      unsigned  nPadding;
                      unsigned  nRecordBufferSize;
                      unsigned  nResultCode;
                      unsigned long lRecordPosition;
                      unsigned long lReserved0
                      unsigned long lReserved1

                    typedef SQLCONTROL *PSQLCONTROL;
                    typedef SQLCONTROL far *LPSQLCONTROL;

          The SQLCONTROL data structure has the following fields:

          szErrorDetail            Each time an Quasar SQL API function
                                   is called, any errors that may occur
                                   cause this field to be loaded with a
                                   descriptive string: "Error detected
                                   at line n of module.c".  This
                                   information is useful if you need to
                                   call customer service.

          szErrorMessage           Each time an Quasar SQL API function
                                   is called, any errors that may occur
                                   cause this field to be loaded with a
                                   descriptive string: "ERROR xxx:
                                   text." This provides a useful
                                   diagnostic while you are debugging
                                   your application. "xxx" is the ASCII
                                   representation (base 10) of the
                                   nResultCode.

          nHiLiteLength            Each time the SqlExecute is called,
                                   any syntax errors within the query
                                   cause this field to be set to the
                                   length of the offending phrase within
                                   the query text.

          nHiLiteOffset            Each time the SqlExecute is called,
                                   any syntax errors within the query
                                   cause this field to be set to the
                                   offset of the offending phrase within
                                   the query text.

          nPadding                 The caller of the Quasar SQL API sets
                                   this field to the number of padding
                                   spaces to be inserted between columns
                                   when the wFlags field of the
                                   SQLCONTROL structure is set to
                                   mSqlFlagFormatPadded.

          nRecordBufferSize        The caller of the Quasar SQL API sets
                                   this field to the size (in bytes) of
                                   the record buffer.  This buffer must
                                   be at least as large as the value in
                                   the nRecordSize field of the SQLTABLE
                                   data structure.  The SQLTABLE data
                                   structure is available by calling
                                   SqlDescribeTable.

          nResultCode              Indicates the basic status condition
                                   after any call to an Quasar SQL API
                                   function.  A value of 0 indicates no
                                   error.  Other values are listed under
                                   Result Codes

          lRecordPosition          Indicates the position within the
                                   result table of the most recent
                                   record fetched. lRecordPosition can
                                   range from 1 to the number of records
                                   in the result table. If
                                   lRecordPosition is 0 then no records
                                   have been fetched.

          lReserved0               Do not tamper with this field.

          lReserved1               Do not tamper with this field.

          lReserved2               Do not tamper with this field.

          lReserved3               Do not tamper with this field.

          lReserved4               Do not tamper with this field.

          wFlags                   The caller of the Quasar SQL API sets
                                   this field to the desired Data Format
                                   to be utilized during record fetch
                                   functions.  The data format may be
                                   optionally combined using the '|'
                                   operator with the Automatic Commit
                                   flag.

                         Result Table Description Record


          The SQLTABLE data structure describes the characteristics of
          the result table. The SQLTABLE data structure is loaded as a
          result of an SqlDescribeTable function call.

                    typedef struct tagSQLTABLE {
                    unsigned    nNumberOfColumns;

                    typedef SQLTABLE *PSQLTABLE;
                    typedef SQLTABLE far *LPSQLTABLE;

          The SQLTABLE data structure has the following fields:

          nNumberOfColumns         Indicates the number of columns in
                                   the result table.

          nRecordSize              Indicates the minimum size (in bytes)
                                   of a buffer large enough to hold a
                                   record fetched from the result table.

          lNumberOfRecords         Indicates the number of records in
                                   the result table.

                                   Result Codes


          This section gives an explanation of all result codes returned
          by the Quasar SQL API.  Macro definitions for all result codes
          can be found in the Quasar SQL API include file for 'C'.
          Global Const definitions can be found in the global file for
          'Visual Basic'.

          mSqlErrorAmbiguousColumn When a column name can be found in
                                   more than one of several tables given
                                   in the "FROM" clause of a query, the
                                   database administrator cannot
                                   determine which of them you mean.  To
                                   remove the ambiguity, use the
                                   "Tablename.ColumnName" or the
                                   "UserName.Tablename.ColumnName"
                                   syntax.

          mSqlErrorBadEnvironment  The DatabasePath entry in the
                                   "win.ini" file is not properly
                                   specified: it must begin with a drive
                                   identifier followed by a ':' and a
                                   '\'.  A typical entry is
                                   "c:\database".

          mSqlErrorBinaryNotAllowed When creating a table, the data type
                                   BINARY was specified, the BINARY data
                                   type is not allowed in this release.

          mSqlErrorCannotActivateFile An attempt has been made to access
                                   a file which is unrecognized by the
                                   b-tree file manager.  This is an
                                   internal error which should never
                                   occur. Please contact customer
                                   service.

          mSqlErrorCannotCloseFile When the b-tree file manager
                                   attempted to close either a data file
                                   or an index file, _lclose() returned
                                   an error.  This usually indicates a
                                   problem with the DOS directory
                                   structure, we recommend you run
                                   'chkdsk'.

          mSqlErrorCannotCloseLog When the database manager attempted to
                                   close either the 'or_log.dat' or the
                                   'or_log.idx' transaction journal
                                   file, _lclose() returned an error.
                                   This usually indicates a problem with
                                   the DOS directory structure, we
                                   recommend you run 'chkdsk'.

          mSqlErrorCannotCreateDataFile When the b-tree file manager
                                   attempted to create a data file,
                                   _lcreat() returned an error.  This
                                   usually indicates your setting for
                                   'FILES' in the 'config.sys' file
                                   should be increased.

          mSqlErrorCannotCreateDumpFile When the dump manager attempted
                                   to create a dump file, _lcreat()
                                   returned an error.  This usually
                                   indicates your setting for 'FILES' in
                                   the 'config.sys' file should be
                                   increased.

          mSqlErrorCannotCreateFile This result code will not occur.

          mSqlErrorCannotCreateKeyFile When the b-tree file manager
                                   attempted to create a key file,
                                   _lcreat() returned an error.  This
                                   usually indicates your setting for
                                   'FILES' in the 'config.sys' file
                                   should be increased.

          mSqlErrorCannotCreateLog When the database manager attempted
                                   to create either the 'or_log.dat' or
                                   the 'or_log.idx' transaction journal
                                   file, _lcreat() returned an error.
                                   This usually indicates your setting
                                   for 'FILES' in the 'config.sys' file
                                   should be increased.

          mSqlErrorCannotDeleteFile When the b-tree file manager
                                   attempted to remove either a data
                                   file or a key file, remove() returned
                                   an error.  This usually indicates
                                   someone has modified the file's
                                   attribute settings.  Please be sure
                                   none of the database files are marked
                                   as 'read only', 'hidden' or 'system'.

          mSqlErrorCannotDropTable When the database manager attempted
                                   to drop a table, its 'use count' was
                                   greater than zero! This is an
                                   internal error which should never
                                   occur.  Please contact customer

          mSqlErrorCannotOpenDataFile When the b-tree file manager
                                   attempted to open a data file,
                                   _lopen() returned an error.  This
                                   usually indicates someone has
                                   modified the file's attribute
                                   settings or deleted the file.  Please
                                   be sure none of the database files

                                   This usually indicates your setting
                                   for 'FILES' in the 'config.sys' file
                                   should be increased.

          mSqlErrorCannotRemoveTable When the database manager attempted
                                   to delete a file during a 'Toolbox
                                   Remove' database operation, remove()
                                   returned an error.  This usually
                                   indicates someone has modified the
                                   file's attribute settings.  Please be
                                   sure none of the database files are
                                   marked as 'read only', 'hidden' or
                                   'system'.

          mSqlErrorCharNotAllowed  When the bind manager attempted to

          This section defines specialized terms used in this document.

          B-tree file manager      The Quasar Database Administrator is
                                   made of several large function units.
                                   One of these is the b-tree file
                                   manager.  It is responsible for
                                   carrying out low level data access
                                   and operates directly on the raw DOS
                                   files located in the database
                                   directory.

          Bind manager             The Quasar Database Administrator is
                                   made of several large function units.
                                   One of these is the bind manager.  It
                                   is responsible for associating the
                                   logical constructs in the query with
                                   actual users, tables and columns in
                                   the database.

          Cursor                   The Quasar SQL API keeps track of the
                                   result of a query by means of a
                                   cursor.  The  cursor may include
                                   status information, the table where
                                   the result of a SELECT may be found,
                                   the column descriptions for such a
                                   table, the current record position
                                   for fetch operations, etc.

          Database manager         The Quasar Database Administrator is
                                   made of several large function units.
                                   One of these is the database manager.
                                   It is responsible for carrying out
                                   high level data access and operates
                                   on logical tables and columns.  The
                                   database manager uses the b-tree file
                                   manager to access records in the raw
                                   DOS files located in the database
                                   directory.  The database manager is
                                   also responsible for policing
                                   transactions and the transaction
                                   journal (or 'log').

          Dump manager             The Quasar Database Administrator is
                                   made of several large function units.
                                   One of these is the dump manager.  It
                                   is responsible for creating the dump
                                   file.

          Physical position        The raw position of the record in the
                                   file.  Physical order is not the same

                                   as the order you specify with the SQL
                                   ORDER BY clause.

          Query                    By query we mean any SQL statement.

          Query manager            The Quasar Database Administrator is
                                   made of several large function units.
                                   One of these is the query manager.
                                   It is responsible for parsing the
                                   query into its component parts.

          Record buffer            One of the arguments to the Quasar SQL
                                   API fetch functions is a pointer to a
                                   record buffer.  This is the buffer
                                   which receives the formatted contents
                                   of a record.

          Result table             All SELECT queries generate a table
                                   containing the chosen records.  This
                                   is called the result table.  Its
                                   contents are made available to you
                                   one at a time through one of the
                                   Quasar SQL API fetch functions.

          Transaction journal      A transaction journal is a pair of
                                   files ('or_log.dat' and 'or_log.idx')
                                   written by the database manager.  The
                                   transaction journal contains a record
                                   for every event which caused a change
                                   to the database.

          General Information

                    Structured Query Language (SQL) is the database
                    management language declared by the American
                    National Standards Institute (ANSI) as a standard.
                    SQL is the lingua franca of the computer database
                    world.  SQL is used on mainframes, minicomputers and
                    PCs.

          Notational Conventions

                    While uppercase is used throughout this document to
                    indicate SQL keywords (COMMIT, SELECT, etc), in
                    actuality the Quasar Database Administrator will
                    accept keywords in either upper or lowercase.  The
                    keyword 'COMMIT' may be spelled 'commit', 'Commit',
                    'COMMIT', etc.

                    The names of users, tables, indices and columns, and
                    the content of character fields are, however, case
                    sensitive.  If you used some combination of upper
                    and lower case to create them, you have to use the
                    same combination to access them.  All system names
                    were created using upper case only.

                    Optional elements are indicated by enclosing them
                    within square brackets as in [option].  When a
                    choice may be made among a list of possible optional
                    elements, individual selections are separated by
                    vertical bars as in [option1 | option2 | option3].

                    When a pattern may be repeated, an ellipsis follows
                    the pattern as in "ColumnName1 [, ColumnName2] ...".
                    This example implies a list of one or more column
                    names separated by commas.

                                    Statements


          SQL is based on various uses of the following statements:

          COMMIT WORK    Instructs the database administrator to make
                         all changes to the database by the current
                         transaction permanent.

          CREATE INDEX   Creates an index on a database table.

          CREATE TABLE   Creates a database table.

          DELETE         Deletes records from a database table.

          DROP INDEX     Deletes an index from a database table.

          DROP TABLE     Deletes a database table.

          INSERT         Creates records in a database table.

          ROLLBACK WORK  Instructs the database administrator to forget
                         all changes made to the database by the current
                         transaction.

          SELECT         Retrieves data from database tables.

          UPDATE         Modifies the content of records within database
                         tables.

          Quasar SQL Syntax                               Page 4 of 34


                              Statement: COMMIT WORK


          Syntax         COMMIT WORK;

                         Changes made to the database are not made
                         permanent until this statement is executed.
                         Should the current user execute a ROLLBACK WORK
                         or unexpectedly log off, all changes made by
                         the user since logging in or executing a COMMIT
                         WORK (whichever occurred most recently) will
                         vanish.

                         During database recovery only committed
                         transactions are restored.

          Comments       As queries are executed within a transaction
                         and records are created, read, updated or
                         deleted; the database applies various kinds of
                         locks on the applicable records.  These locks
                         are released when the transaction is committed
                         or rolled back.  In order to minimize the
                         conflict between transactions, be sure to
                         minimize the amount of time these locks are in
                         place by issuing a COMMIT WORK or ROLLBACK WORK

                         Committing a transaction automatically starts a
                         new transaction.  COMMIT WORK is very fast
                         since the changes have already been made, they
                         are merely flagged as permanent.

          Comments       While indices may be created at anytime, we
                         recommend that you create indices immediately
                         after you create their base table; otherwise,
                         CREATE INDEX has to read and rewrite all data
                         which is already in the table.

                         The presence of suitable indices may greatly
                         enhance system performance.  Indices do,
                         however, cause a moderate increase in the
                         amount of time it takes to write a record to
                         the table upon which the index is constructed.
                         The database user should add indices
                         judiciously.

                         executed.  ROLLBACK WORK instructs the database
                         to purge all changes to the database by the
                         current user since logging in or executing a

          Comments       As queries are executed within a transaction
                         and records are created, read, updated or
                         deleted; the database applies various kinds of
                         locks on the applicable records.  These locks
                         are released when the transaction is committed
                         or rolled back.  In order to minimize the
                         conflict between transactions, be sure to
                         minimize the amount of time these locks are in
                         place by issuing a COMMIT WORK or ROLLBACK WORK
                         whenever possible.

                         Rolling a transaction back automatically starts
                         a new transaction.  ROLLBACK WORK may take some
                         time while the database administrator purges

                                        different from the current user.

                                        CorrelationName is effectively
                                        an alias for the TableName which
                                        it follows.

                         [, [UserName2.]TableName2 [CorrelationName2]]

                                        Additional tables may be
                                        included by creating a list of
                                        tables separated by commas.
                                        This effectively creates a
                                        Cartesian product of all the
                                        tables in the list.

                         WHERE SearchCondition

                                        SearchCondition specifies which
                                        records are to be read.

                         GROUP BY ColumnSpecification1

                                        Rearranges the table(s)
                                        identified by the FROM clause
                                        into groups such that within any
                                        one group all rows have the same
                                        value for the GROUP BY
                                        column(s).  The SELECT clause is
                                        then applied to these groups.
                                        Each group generates a single
                                        record in the result table.

                                    Operators


          The arithmetic operators have their usual meanings:

          +              The value on the right is added to the value on
                         the left.

          -              The value on the right is subtracted from the
                         value on the left.

          *              The value on the right is multiplied by the
                         value on the left.

          /              The value on the left is divided by the value
                         on the right.

                                Built-in functions


          Built-in functions act on several rows in a table together.
          Built-in functions may not be nested.  SQL supports the
          following built-in functions:

          AVG(Expression)          For each record selected, Expression
                                   is analyzed and a value obtained.
                                   AVG returns the average of these
                                   values.  Only values which are not
                                   NULL are included.

          COUNT(DISTINCT Expression) For each record selected,
                                   Expression is analyzed and a value
                                   obtained.  COUNT(DISTINCT) returns
                                   the number of these values which are
                                   distinguishable, one from another.
                                   Only values which are not NULL are
                                   included.

          COUNT(*)                 COUNT(*) returns the number of
                                   records selected.

          MAX(Expression)          For each record selected, Expression
                                   is analyzed and a value obtained.
                                   MAX returns the maximum of these
                                   values.  Only values which are not
                                   NULL are included.

          MIN(Expression)          For each record selected, Expression
                                   is analyzed and a value obtained.
                                   MIN returns the minimum of these
                                   values.  Only values which are not
                                   NULL are included.

          SUM(Expression)          For each record selected, Expression
                                   is analyzed and a value obtained.
                                   SUM returns the sum of these values.
                                   Only values which are not NULL are
                                   included.

                                   Expressions


          Expressions can be:

               A column name

               A constant or literal value

               A built-in function

               An arithmetic combination of expressions

          Constants can be:

               Integer (for example: 100, -5, +127)

               Decimal (for example: 100.0, -.001, 1., +1.5)

               Floating point (for example: 1E10, -2E-7, +3.14159E0)

               Character string (for example: 'SMITH' '-@k9-22', '-1',
               'Quasar')

          Order of execution:

               Arithmetic expressions are evaluated before comparisons
               and logical operations.

               Arithmetic expressions are evaluated left to right except
               that multiplication and division are performed before
               addition and subtraction.  Parentheses can be used to
               control the order of evaluation.

                                Search Conditions


          A search condition can be a simple condition or a logical
          combination of conditions.  If the value of any expression is
          NULL then the condition evaluates to UNKNOWN:

          Simple conditions:

               Expression1 = Expression2

                         Evaluates to TRUE if and only if Expression1
                         has a value equal to that of Expression2,
                         otherwise the condition evaluates to FALSE.

               Expression1 < Expression2

                         Evaluates to TRUE if and only if Expression1
                         has a value less than that of Expression2,
                         otherwise the condition evaluates to FALSE.

               Expression1 <= Expression2

                         Evaluates to TRUE if and only if Expression1
                         has a value less than or equal to that of
                         Expression2, otherwise the condition evaluates
                         to FALSE.

               Expression1 > Expression2

                         Evaluates to TRUE if and only if Expression1
                         has a value greater than that of Expression2,
                         otherwise the condition evaluates to FALSE.

               Expression1 >= Expression2

                         Evaluates to TRUE if and only if Expression1
                         has a value greater than or equal to that of
                         Expression2, otherwise the condition evaluates
                         to FALSE.

               Expression1 <> Expression2

                         Evaluates to TRUE if and only if Expression1
                         has a value which is not equal to that of
                         Expression2, otherwise the condition evaluates
                         to FALSE.

               Expression1 [NOT] BETWEEN Expression2 AND Expression3

                         Same as [NOT] ((Expression2 <= Expression1) AND
                         (Expression1 <= Expression3).

               Expression1 [NOT] IN (Value1[, Value2] ...)

                         TRUE if Expression1 is [not] equal to any value
                         returned by Subquery.

               ColumnName [NOT] LIKE Pattern

                         Only available for character types: [not] TRUE
                         if the string in the specified column matches
                         Pattern.  In Pattern, '_' matches any single
                         character, '%' matches any character sequence.

               ColumnName IS [NOT] NULL

                         True if the value of ColumnName is [not] NULL.

               [NOT] EXISTS (Subquery)

                         [Not] TRUE if Subquery returns at least one
                         record.

               Expression1 [NOT] IN (Subquery)

                         [Not] TRUE if Subquery returns at least one
                         value which is equal to Expression1.

               Expression1 = [ANY | ALL | SOME] (Subquery)
               Expression1 < [ANY | ALL | SOME] (Subquery)
               Expression1 <= [ANY | ALL | SOME] (Subquery)
               Expression1 > [ANY | ALL | SOME] (Subquery)
               Expression1 >= [ANY | ALL | SOME] (Subquery)
               Expression1 <> [ANY | ALL | SOME] (Subquery)

                         Please refer to a text book for a description
                         of the "quantified" predicate.  While
                         supported, we recommend against its use.

          Logical combination of conditions:

               NOT Condition

                         Evaluates to TRUE if and only if Condition is
                         FALSE.  Evaluates to FALSE if and only if
                         Condition is TRUE.

               Condition1 AND Condition2

                         Evaluates to TRUE if and only if both
                         Condition1 and Condition2 are TRUE.
