SNOOP is the perfect practical joke for those curious co-workers who    
always seem to be more interested in your work than their own.  When    
you're away from your computer you can display any of its fake letters, 
programs, or messages.  When some snooping person touches your keyboard,
a bright red flashing ALERT starts flashing guaranteed to startle the   
most fastidious snoop.  Only by pressing the secret key can it be       
disabled.  SNOOP also has holiday greetings, out-to-lunch signs, no     
smoking signs, and many others.  All ready to catch the office snoop!

SNOOP     Version 1.0     By Andrew M Cohn - Lorancom Productions

c. 1992                   Registration fee: $10.00


WELCOME TO SNOOP!

Does it bother you when co-workers attempt to steal a glance at your
computer monitor to see what you're working on...especially when you have
stepped out of the office?  Well, SNOOP will give them something to look at!
Totally menu-driven, SNOOP offers up a wide variety of screens to fool,
inform, entertain and annoy your fellow employees. Naturally, you will not
wish to get into serious trouble with your boss or co-workers, so please
use your discretion when selecting screens to leave up on your monitor.


RUNNING SNOOP:

Running SNOOP couldn't be easier. It consists of only one file,
"SNOOP.EXE." Simply type SNOOP and away you go. Select the general screen
category from the main menu, and the individual screen from the sub-menu.
It will be helpful for you to review the program and the various screens in
advance of actual use, to become familar with the numerous possibilities
for some real office fun!


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

You may run SNOOP on any IBM or compatible computer using DOS 3.1 or
higher, with a minimum of 256k memory, CGA, EGA or VGA graphics with color
monitor, and one disk drive.


YOUR COPY OF SNOOP IS COMPLETE!

SNOOP is complete. Nothing is omitted, nothing is crippled. It is no
different from a legally registered copy. You may enjoy a 15 day trial
period, after which time you are asked to register your copy if you
continue to use it. Registered users may receive future editions of SNOOP
and other innovative products at discounted prices. Since this version of
SNOOP is complete and intact, there is no need to ship "registered
versions". This eliminates unnecessary work and expense, and enables us to
offer SNOOP at a very low cost.
