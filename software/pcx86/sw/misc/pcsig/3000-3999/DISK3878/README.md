                       JUDY'S TENKEY(TM)

Judy's TenKey makes your calculations easier and more reliable.  If you use 
the default Windows calculator, you'll find that Judy's TenKey gives you 
many advantages (see below).  If you're still using an old-fashioned desktop 
calculator, you'll love the integration Judy's TenKey gives you with your other 
Windows applications.

This document provides a brief description of program capabilities, 
installation instructions, and author contact information.  A Windows Write 
version of this document is available with the distribution (you may
find it easier on the eyes).

PROGRAM CAPABILITIES

HISTORY TAPE:  Records your calculations in a scrolling list which you 
can save, print, and resize (a real help in keeping track of your calculations).  
You can also reuse tape entries, saving typing and reducing errors.

SELECTABLE SYNTAX:  Judy's TenKey can process numbers like a 
scientific calculator (RPN), an adding machine, or a normal calculator.  If 
you are familiar with one and not another, you know how difficult and 
frustrating it can be to try to switch.  Perfect for accountants, engineers, and 
you.

CUSTOMIZABLE DISPLAY:  You can decide how you want your TenKey 
to look (selecting from tape, memory, statistics, functions, trigonometry, 
finance, and number pad options), enabling you to optimize screen usage.  
Any TenKey function can always be activated via the keyboard regardless of 
the current display configuration.

FINANCIAL CALCULATIONS:  Judy's TenKey calculates monthly 
payments for most loans (e.g., cars, houses, etc.), expected investment 
growth, necessary retirement savings, inflation adjustment, and more.

STATISTICS:  Judy's TenKey calculates standard statistics for highlighted 
tape entries, including average value, sum, and standard deviation.

KEEP ON TOP:  You can set Judy's TenKey to stay on top of all other 
windows, so you quickly calculate something even when editing a document 
full-screen.

DECIMAL SETTING:  You can set Judy's TenKey to display the number of 
decimal positions you prefer, ranging from 0 to "as needed".  If you 
frequently deal with money, you might want to set the decimals to 2 (for 
cents) or 0 (for dollars).

INTELLIGENT COPY & PASTE:  You can copy tape entries to other 
applications, including Microsoft Word, Excel, and Notepad.  You can also 
paste input from these applications.  If extraneous text and special formatting 
are mixed in with your numbers, Judy's TenKey uses heuristic reasoning to 
extract and interpret appropriate information.

EXTRA TOUCHES:  Judy's TenKey remembers your favorite screen 
position and displays itself there every time.  It also uses commas for 
moderately large numbers (e.g., "1,000,000"), displays negative numbers in 
red, and allows you to use the backspace key to edit results for further 
calculation.  When in scientific mode, it provides an unlimited stack.

BETTER PERFORMANCE:  Judy's TenKey enables you to work faster and 
more reliably.  Once you can see (and reuse!) the numbers in your 
calculations, you will never return to the default Windows calculator.  We're 
so sure that you'll love using Judy's TenKey that we invite you to try it for 
free.  Simply send in the registration fee if you decide to keep
it.

PROGRAM INSTALLATION

REQUIREMENTS:  Version 2.0 of Judy's TenKey runs under both Windows 
3.0 and 3.1. Including the tutorial demonstration, it uses 200K of disk space.

program (install.exe) from the Windows File Manager.  This installation
program prompts you for additional information, allows you to cancel the 
installation, demonstrates its main features, and even offers to uninstall 
the program if you decide not to keep it.

version of the program, as well as a free copy of Judy's CountDown (TM), a 
fun program that helps you track important dates.
