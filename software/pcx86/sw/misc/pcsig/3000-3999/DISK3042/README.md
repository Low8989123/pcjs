Disk Title: Hugo III, Jungle of Doom 1/2 (also #3124                    
PC-SIG Version: S1                                                      
                                                                        
Program Title: Hugo III, Jungle of Doom!                                
Author Version: 1.0S                                                    
Author Registration: $20.00 ($40.00 for trilogy)                        
Special Requirements: 400K RAM and EGA. Hard drive recommended.         
                                                                        
Our heroes, Hugo and Penelope, crash land in the jungles of South       
America.  Hugo (that's you) starts to work on the plane and Penelope    
decides to take a walk (...I just bet something bad is going to happen).
Bingo!-Penelope is bitten by the dreaded tree spider and you (Hugo)     
have only 48 hours to find the antidote in the "Jungle of Doom!"        
                                                                        
This is Part III of the Hugo series. All Hugo games-HOUSE OF HORRORS,   
WHODUNIT?, and JUNGLE OF DOOM-are a special mix of text adventure games 
with arcade-style graphics. In text adventure-games, you interact with  
the game by typing instructions to the program. You might type in:      
"pickup sword," "cast a spell," or "tie vines to bridge." These games   
test inventiveness and your ability to interact in these computer       
created scenarios. Most popular of these games are the "Dungeons and    
Dragons" type of games.                                                 
                                                                        
The Hugo series adds arcade quality graphics, making the adventure more 
fun. In JUNGLE OF DOOM, you walk down jungle paths, cross rivers, pass  
through jungle villages, talk to natives, and explore in order to locate
the antidote to the poison. The animation is first rate. Each time you  
encounter an item or person, you type in an action or response. What    
makes text-adventure games challenging is that you must type in actions 
in a way that the computer understands them. It might accept "pick up   
key" or "grab key" but not "hand me the key." The documentation for     
these types of games is notoriously brief and it's up to you to         
establish the proper dialogue. This can be frustrating at first, but it 
adds an extra level of complexity that real adventure buffs crave.      
                                                                        
Hugo's JUNGLE OF DOOM has all the ingredients to be another successful  
game. The story is fun and well presented with superb graphics. It's a  
good program to start with if you're new to adventure games, and great  
if you're an old hand.

## VENDOR.DOC

Dear vendor

This is the first release of HUGO III, JUNGLE OF DOOM!

It requires a hard disk (about 1Mb), 400k ram and EGA or VGA graphics.
(It can be installed using 2 floppy drives if at least one is high density,
but you'd have to be extremely patient!)

If you are familiar with our other two HUGO games, this one has the following
new features not found in the previous games:

	- Spectacular graphics by a professional computer artist.
	- Easier puzzles with hints.
	- "Turbo" button for high speed exploration.
	- Hero cannot be killed!

These new features should insure even more fun for the player.

For your benefit we have added a DEMO.BAT batch file which may be handy for
demonstrating this program at shows.  HUGO will run through the automatic
part of the story at the beginning of the game, repeating forever.  You can
invoke it without sound if you wish.  Don't put DEMO.BAT on the user's disk.

The bad news is that HUGO III is so big you'll have to put it on two disks.
This time we have supplied an installation program for the user.
It automatically handles disk drive usage so should be very easy to use.

Your DISK one should contain:
	H3_PART1.EXE
	INSTALL.EXE

Your DISK two should contain:
	H3_PART2.EXE


Please feel free to use the following description in your catalog:

"The final and best episode of this hugely popular trilogy of colorful
3-D animated EGA adventure games.  Featuring spectacular graphics by a
professional computer artist, a new "turbo" button and built-in hints,
HUGO III is sure to be another best-seller.  Will Hugo outwit the evil
witch-doctor, find the mysterious pool of life and finally defeat his
arch-enemy the old man?  The answer is yes, and much more besides!"

Regards, David P Gray.
