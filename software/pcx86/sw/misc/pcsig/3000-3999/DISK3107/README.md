## FILE3107.TXT

```
Disk No: 3107
Disk Title: Jill of the Jungle
PC-SIG Version: S1.0

Program Title: Jill of the Jungle
Author Version: 1.0
Author Registration: $15.00/volume; $30.00/3-volume set.
Special Requirements: 512K RAM, CGA/EGA/VGA, and DOS 3.0+. Supports
                      Sound Blaster and joystick.

JILL OF THE JUNGLE is part one of the terrific new Jill game trilogy.
Jill is sort of a female Tarzan and her goal is to save the male prince
(finally a game in which a heroine saves a helpless man!). This is a
high-quality jump-and-dodge game in the tradition of games like Mario
Brothers.

Jill has all the action of any arcade game and graphics that are
comparable. In it, you (Jill) run and jump around different areas of the
jungle (different levels) and dodge an interesting assortment of
alligators, fireballs, poisonous frogs, giant ants, and other bad
things. Jill runs, jumps, swings on vines, and swims to achieve her
goal. Her only weapon is a knife. (It should be noted that even though
Jill has a knife, JILL OF THE JUNGLE in not a violence-based game.)

JILL comes with a neat sound track of music and noises that really makes
the game come alive with a Sound Blaster card. This game is really hot!
