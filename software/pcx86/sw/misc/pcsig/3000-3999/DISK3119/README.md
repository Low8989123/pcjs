   ABOUT SHAREWARE...
   
   Shareware (also known as user supported software and other names) is a
   concept not understood by everyone.  The authors of Shareware retain all
   rights to the software under the copyright laws while still allowing
   free distribution.  This gives the user the chance to freely obtain and
   try out software to see if it fits his needs.  Shareware should not be
   confused with Public Domain software even though they are often obtained
   from the same sources.
   
   If you continue to use Shareware after trying it out, you are expected
   to register your use with the author and pay a registration fee.  What
   you get in return depends on the author, but may include a printed
   manual, free updates, telephone support, etc.  Only by paying for the
   Shareware you use do you enable the Shareware author to continue to
   support his software and create new programs.  Considering that the
   Shareware registration fees are almost always far less than the purchase
   price of comparable commercial software it's obvious that Shareware is a
   good deal for everyone.
   
   There are real advantages to you in the Shareware system.  You get to
   try out software to make sure it is compatible with your hardware and
   that it fits your needs before you "buy" it with your registration.
   The author saves the expense of advertising, packaging and distribution
   and passes the savings on to you.  Plus, most Shareware authors are
   much more accessible than commercial software sources so that your
   questions and suggestions are much more likely to be responded to.
   

                         Thank you for your support.

Short Description: A fantasy role-playing game with 16 color
     EGA/VGA graphics

Description:  Sword Quest 1 is a fantasy role-playing game of
     similar style to many available for Nintendo systems.  In the
     game a player controls the actions of a character following
     a quest to rid his land of evil monsters.  The character
     encounters many different monsters to fight, towns and caves
     to enter, and people to talk to.  As the game continues the
     character will get hints from people in the towns, learn
     magical spells, and find hidden items, all of which help in
     the quest.

Distribution:  The game is to be distributed under the "Shareware"
     concept.

Registration fee: $ 12.00

Materials that come with Registration:  Maps to the world and Caves
                                        with the locations of the
                                        items to be found

Improvements over version 1:  The game has been totally re-written
     since the first version.  The only consistency is the plot and
     the monsters. The graphics are much better, and music has been
     added in some locations.
