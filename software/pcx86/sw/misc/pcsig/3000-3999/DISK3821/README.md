LAN.DOC
=======
PullDown is available for LANs.  PullDown runs strictly under DOS, and can
access anything in the DOS environment for configuration of menus by group,
by user, or with one central menu and multiple security levels by node
for that menu.

The LAN version, which is not shareware, gives you these important 
benefits:

* A node-secure version (no editor)
* Complete documentation on LAN setup and administration
* Access to technical support for your installation on the LAN
* License for up to 100 nodes per registered server

```

RT.DOC
=======
PullDown can be used to set up menus which can then be distributed
to your user base.  Essentially, the runtime version supports all of the
features of the main executable EXCEPT:

* No editors for menu definitions
* No timed event support
* No support for split-path installation
* No hypertext help facility

What's it good for?
===================
* Creation of elegant help systems using the built-in help facility in 
PullDown
* Runtime distribution of disks to EDM clients for menuing of your EDM
software at their site
* Menu creation for applications that today consist of several standalone
executable files
