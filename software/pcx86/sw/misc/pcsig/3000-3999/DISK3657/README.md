     This text file explains the features of MAXimize
     ================================================

     MAXimize is an Application Interface Manager (AIM) that will
     dramatically improve your productivity by allowing you to easily
     design, build and control the interface to your applications.    You
     will find it easy and fun to build your own interface to the
     applications on your computer.  The result is an intuitive interface
     designed specifically for you.  This will increase your speed and
     reduce errors, thus dramatically improving your productivity both when
     using and changing that interface.

     An AIM is virtually an operating environment, which is significantly
     more powerful and sophisticated then a menu system, yet not to the
     extent of Windows.  All three have the capability to "launch"
     applications by simply choosing a selection.  However, it would be an
     injustice to call Windows or MAXimize a menu system due to their
     significantly greater speed, ease, capabilities and sophistication.

     MAXimize comes in two editions, the Basic edition for novice to
     intermediate users and the Gold edition for the intermediate to
     advanced computer users.  Both editions can run on Local Area Networks
     (LANs), including usage logging and license control capabilities.

     The Gold edition contains many more options and features than the
     Basic edition.  It is thus more sophisticated due to its additional
     capabilities (although these can be ignored).  Since both editions
     share the same file formats, files created on either will run on both.
     However, if the advanced capabilities of the Gold edition are used in
     a selection/menu, the basic edition may not be able to update it.

     The two editions and the ability to run on LANs, allow MAXimize to
     appeal to a broad range of users.  These users range from a novice
     working out of their home to large corporations using LANs.

     MAXimize is a truly sophisticated and professional application
     interface manager.  It combines lightning speed, high limits, powerful
     and easy update facilities and an abundance of features.  This
     translates into flexibility and capability far superior to anything
     else on the market.


     Feature List for Both the Gold and Basic Editions:
     ==================================================

     What separates an Application Interface Manager, and specifically
     MAXimize, from other products is its significantly greater speed, ease
     or use and change, capabilities and sophistication.  The following
     list of features clearly shows this.  The features of both the Basic
     and Gold editions of MAXimize are shown below.  Each item which is
     unique to MAXimize or that is not in many other software packages has
     been preceded by a star (*) instead of a greater-than symbol (>).

     > MAXimize is VERY fast

     * Menus can be shown in a maximized window or cascaded windows!

     > Takes no memory away from applications being ran

     * Systems Application Architecture (SAA) / Common User Access (CUA).
       With "menu bar", pull down menus, dialog buttons & keyboard input.

     * Hide or disable items in the menu bar or its pulldowns.

     * Built in support to run multiple sessions of MAXimize under a task
       switching application like Software Carousel and OS/2 2.0.

     > Fully customize menus, selections, colors and directories

     * Integrated and sophisticated options, menu and selection editor

     * Multiple user support on one computer.  Each user may have a
       different setup (options and menus).

     * Each menu may have up to 99 selections - on one screen!  If you
       have ever used a menu system with a limit of 16 selections per
       menu, and eventually needed 17, you'll appreciate this.

     * Menus may be doubled spaced or displayed in multiple columns.  If
       the selections simply will not fit in the menu, then the menu will
       be scrolled with the standard scroll bar.

     * MAXimize maintains the current position (menu and selection) after
       running a selection.  Run the selection again without navigation.

     * Hot keys can be used to run often used applications without having
       to navigate to a menu

     * True mouse support using text cursor and scroll bars where needed

     * Selections can be easily copied or transferred (moved) within a
       menu or to other menus (even to and from the hot keys)

     * Update, delete, copy, & transfer many selections in one operation

     * Extensive on-line help

     * Complete Local Area Network (LAN) and shared PC support

     * The ability to track (log) selection usage

     * Log security violations

     * License control to limit concurrent access to programs (LANs).

     * Utility to manipulate/report on usage log & license control info

     > TSR to disable the break key and reboots (Ctrl+Alt+Delete)

     > Menus may have sub-menus (up to 10 menus deep)

     > Single keystroke and point-and-press selection of menu items

     > Simple selection entry/update through two types of selections that
       do complete error checking: a) Display a menu & b) Run a program

     > Selections may prompt for input parameters with one prompt

     > Extensive password protection and encryption

     > Secure screen save/blank feature to prevent screen "burning" and
       unathorized PC usage while it is unattended.

     Additional Features in MAXimize Gold
     ====================================

     * You may add up to ten lines of text to a menu.  This text may be
       your company name, logo or an explanation of how to use the menu.

     * EGA/VGA support for 25, 43 or 50 line screen modes

     * Five types of selection ID's (the ID that identifies the selection
       and that the user may enter to choose it):

         - Alpha-numeric - letters A to Z followed by 0 to 9
         - Numeric - 1 to 99
         - First character - first character of selection description
         - Specify - choose a character in selection description
         - None - no selection ID - user must point-and-press

     * An additional selection type (above the two mentioned earlier)
       that allows you to execute a set of commands similar to a batch
       file, but with several very powerful extensions

     * Full function editor, with mouse block operations like cut & paste

     * Selections may prompt for input.  These prompts may be either for
       text or for an item in a list.

     * Selections can do multiple prompts

     * Selections can prompt for files, directories or drives, with the
       &File, &Dir and &Drive functions using sophisticated dialog boxes

     * Selections can conditionally execute (or prompt) using the &If and
       &GoTo functions.  For example, the selection could prompt for a
       drive (like A:, B:, C:) and then choose to do further prompts
       differently for floppy drives then for the hard drive.

     * Extensive variable support.  This includes environment, global,
       input and special variables.  For example, the samples include a
       selection that allows you to change the PATH environment variable.
       Another example is special variables that allow you to get the
       current date, time, drive, directory, DOS version, etc.

     * Create a help message to appear at the bottom of the window and/or
       help text to appear when F1 pressed

     * Time delay execution of applications invoked by a selection

     * Utility to "type" keys as if from keyboard from batch file

     * Batch files can be imported into or exported from a selection

     > Selections can be defined to shell directly to the programs

                               =====================


                                    Version 3.1


                      Copyright (C) 1988,1990 by Don Cappaert
                                All rights reserved.



    MAXimize is distributed as "Shareware" and is fully copyrighted.  You may
    have received a copy of MAXimize free or for a small fee, from a a public
    bulletin board, shareware library, shareware disk vendor or user's group
    library.  You are encouraged to make as many copies of the software and this
    documentation as you like and distribute it to anyone you want, as long as
    you do not charge a fee (other than to cover your own distribution cost) and
    distribute only complete, unaltered copies of the package, exactly as you
    received it.  Please read the shareware screen displayed when MAXimize is
    invoked.

    If after trying the program for 60 days, you find it useful and use it
    regularly, you must register your copy by completing the registration form
    printed (you are asked if the order form should be printed when you first
    enter MAXimize).  The order form (file ORDER.DOC) can also be printed using
    the DOS command "COPY ORDER.DOC PRN".

    There is only one differences between the shareware version and the
    registered version of MAXimize.  The shareware version displays a screen
    when it is first invoked.  This screen is a reminder that you are using the
    unregistered version of MAXimize.

    The MAXLOG.EXE and MAXCONVT.EXE programs are distributed in a separate file
    (MAXUTL30.ZIP) because of their size (over 300k) and because they are used
    by both the Gold and Basic editions.  MAXLOG.EXE is a report utility for the
    usage log and is also used for license control.  While MAXLOG.EXE is a
    convenient reporting utility, you may use any XBase database to generate
    reports.  If you would like to try MAXLOG.EXE or MAXCONVT.EXE and cannot
    find MAXUTL30.ZIP, please send Max Software a check for $5 (to cover
    shipping and handling) and request MAXUTL30.ZIP be sent to you.

    When you register MAXimize, you will receive a beautiful manual, a reference
    card and the latest version of MAXimize on a diskette.  Max Software will
    provide support for any problems or questions you might have.  You will also
    be notified when there are updates to or newer versions of MAXimize.

    Windows.  All three have the capability to "launch" applications by simply
    choosing a selection.  However, it would be an injustice to call Windows or
    MAXimize a menu system due to their significantly greater capabilities and
    sophistication.

    MAXimize comes in two editions, the Basic edition for novice to intermediate
    users and the Gold edition for the intermediate to advanced computer users.
    Both editions can run on Local Area Networks (LANs), including usage logging
    and license control capabilities.  The two editions and the ability to run
    on LANs, allow MAXimize to appeal to a broad range of users.  These users
    range from a novice working out of their home to large corporations using
    LANs.

    The Gold edition contains many more options and features than the Basic
    edition.  It is thus more sophisticated due to its additional capabilities
    (although these can be ignored).  Since both editions share the same file
    formats, files created on either will run on both.  However, if the advanced
    capabilities of the Gold edition are used in a selection/menu, you may not
    be able to edit this selection/menu with the Basic edition.

    MAXimize is a truly sophisticated and professional application interface
    manager.  It combines lightning speed, high limits, powerful and easy update
    facilities and an abundance of features.  This translates into flexibility
    and capability far superior to anything else on the market.


    Features
    ========

    What separates an Application Interface Manager, and specifically MAXimize,
    from other products is its significantly greater capabilities and
    sophistication.  The feature list below clearly shows this.  Each item which
    is unique to MAXimize or that is not in many other software packages has
    been preceded by a astericks (*) instead of a dash (-).

    - MAXimize is very fast.

    - Takes no memory away from applications being ran
                                                                               2

    * Systems Application Architecture (SAA) / Common User Access (CUA). With
      "menu bar", pull down menus, dialog buttons & keyboard input.

    * Menus displayed in a cascaded fashion on top of wallpaper.

    * Built in support to run multiple sessions of MAXimize under a task
      switching application like Software Carousel and OS/2 2.0.

    * Fully customize menus, selections, colors and directories

    * Integrated and sophisticated options, menu and selection editor

    * Multiple user support on one computer.  Each user may have a different
      setup (options and menus).

    * Each menu may have up to 99 selections - on one screen!  If you have
      ever used a menu system with a limit of 16 selections per menu, and
      eventually needed 17, you'll appreciate this.

    * Menus may be doubled spaced or displayed in multiple columns.  If the
      selections simply will not fit in the menu, then the menu will be
      scrolled with the standard scroll bar.

    * MAXimize maintains the current position (menu and selection) after
      running a selection.  Run the selection again without navigation.

    * Hot keys are selections can be invoked to run often used applications
      without having to navigate to a menu!

    * True mouse support using text cursor and scroll bars where needed

    * Selections can be easily copied or transferred (moved) within a menu or
      to other menus (even to and from the hot keys)

    * Update, delete, copy, and transfer multiple selections easily with one
      operation

    * Extensive on-line help.

    * Complete Local Area Network (LAN) and shared PC support

    * The ability to track (log) selection usage.  Keep track of whom, when and
      how long a selection is being used.  Even by Projects!

    * Log security violations.

    * License control to limit concurrent access to programs (LANs).

    * Utility to manipulate/report on the usage log and license control
      databases.

    - TSR to disable the break key and reboots (Ctrl+Alt+Delete)

    - Menus may have sub-menus (up to 10 menus deep).

    - Single keystroke and point-and-press selection of menu items.
                                                                               3


    - Simple selection entry/update through two types of selections that do
      complete error checking: a) Display a menu & b) Run a program

    - Selections may prompt for input parameters with one prompt

    - Extensive password protection and encryption

    - Secure screen save/blank feature to prevent screen "burning" and
      unathorized PC usage while it is unattended.

    Additional Features in MAXimize Gold
    ------------------------------------

    * You may add up to ten lines of text to a menu.  This text may be your
      company name, logo or an explanation of the menu.

    * EGA/VGA support for 25, 43 or 50 line screen modes.

    * Five types of selection ID's (the ID that identifies the selection and
      that the user may enter to choose it):

        - Alpha-numeric - letters A to Z followed by 0 to 9.
        - Numeric - 1 to 99.
        - First character - first character of selection description,
        - Specify ID - Specify the character in description (like X in eXit)
        - None - no selection ID.  User must point-and-press.

    * An additional selection type (above the two mentioned earlier) that
      allows you to execute a set of commands similar to a batch file, but
      with several very powerful extensions

    * Full function editor, with mouse block operations like cut & paste

    * Selections may prompt for input.  These prompts may be either for text
      or for an item in a list.

    * Selections can do multiple prompts

    * Selections can prompt for files, directories or drives, with the &File,
      &Dir and &Drive functions using sophisticated dialog boxes

    * Selections can conditionally execute (or prompt) using the &If and &GoTo
      functions.  For example, the selection could prompt for a drive (like
      A:, B:, C:) and then choose to do further prompts differently for floppy
      drives then for the hard drive.

    * Extensive variable support.  This includes environment, global, input
      and special variables.  For example, the samples include a selection
      that allows you to change the PATH environment variable.  Another
      example is special variables that allow you to get the current date,
      time, drive, directory, DOS version, etc.

    * Create a help message to appear at the bottom of the window and/or help
      text to appear when F1 pressed
                                                                               4

    * Time delay execution of applications invoked by a selection

    * Utility to "type" keys as if from keyboard from batch file

    - Batch files can be imported into or exported from a selection

    - Selections can be defined to shell directly to the program


    About this Manual
    =================

    This manual has been divided into several chapters.  The introduction
    contains information on the system requirements, files, menus and
    installation instructions. Also, there is a Getting started quickly section
    for those users who are familiar with DOS and want to use MAXimize before
    reading the manual.  If you fall into this category, read the introduction
    before attempting to use MAXimize.

    The first chapter explains how to use, but not modify, MAXimize's menus.
    This includes invoking MAXimize, navigating to sub-menus, choosing a
    selection and quitting.  This chapter should be sufficient reading for users
    who are not responsible for making changes to MAXimize's setup (menus and
    options).

    The second chapter explains how to modify the menus and the third chapter
    discusses the powerful batch command extension provided by MAXimize.  The
    fourth chapter explains how to change the options (colors, passwords, etc.)
    and the fifth chapter has information about the utilities included with
    MAXimize.  The last chapter describes how to control and monitor the use of
    the applications on your computer.  Finally, there are some appendixes that
    contain useful hints, common problems, LAN/shared PC information and a list
    of messages.


    System Requirements
    ===================

    MAXimize requires MS-DOS / PC-DOS version 2.0 or higher.  It is designed to
    work on the IBM PC, XT, AT or PS2 models, or a fully compatible machine.  A
    minimum of 384K of memory is also required.  While MAXimize can run from a
    floppy-based system, it is highly recommended that you have a hard-disk
    system.


    Changes from Previous Versions of MAXimize
    ==========================================

    This version is a major enhancement to MAXimize.  Improvements include a
    significant performance enhancement when using a mouse, cascaded menu
    windows and the ability to hide/disable menu bar or pull down items.
                                                                               5

    Sample Menus
    ============

    MAXimize comes complete with a set of sample menus.  These menus are
    designed to show one possible menu structure and to provide some example
    selections.  The structure of the sample menus is depicted in the following
    "tree" diagram that shows each of the menu names:

    MAIN - is the main menu displayed when MAXimize is first invoked
      |- SAMPLES - contains selections and sub-menus that run DOS commands
      |    |- SAMPFEAT - shows some of MAXimize's features
      |    |    |- SAMPLARG - menu containing 99 selections on screen
      |    |    |- SAMPSCRL - menu containing 2 columns of selections / scrolled
      |    |    |- SAMPIDS  - menu of selections each displaying a menu ID type:
      |    |    |    |- SAMPALPH - alphanumeric selection ID type
      |    |    |    |- SAMPFRST - first letter of selection description is ID
      |    |    |    |- SAMPNUMC - numeric selection ID type
      |    |    |    |- SAMPNOID - selections have no ID
      |    |    |    |- SAMPSPEC - user specified ID (like X in eXit)
      |    |    |- MAXIMIZE.KYS - hot keys
      |    |    |- SAMPFRMT - show selection formats (run, command and sub-menu)
      |    |    |    |- SAMPNUMC - see above for description of this sub-menu
      |    |    |- SAMPPRMP - show how selections may prompt (multiple times)
      |    |    |- SAMPPASS - selection and sub-menu passwords
      |    |- SAMPPRMP - see above for description of this sub-menu
      |    |- SAMPDIR - sample directory display menu
      |    |- SAMPLOG - sample menu to log events
      |    |-SAMPUSE - sample menu showing how to keep track of program usage
      |- SAMPFEAT - see above for description of this sub-menu
      |- DBMS - database menu
      |- GAMES - games menu
      |- LANGUAGE - languages menu
      |- MISC - miscellaneous menu
      |- GRAPHICS - graphics menu
      |- UTILITY - utilities menu
           |- FLOPPY - menu for floppy applications

    NOTE: SAMPDIR is a sub-menu of SAMPLES which is a sub-menu of MAIN.

     > Selections that display a sub-menu.  The descriptions for these types of
       selections include the word "menu."  For example, choosing the "MAXimize
       samples menu" selection on the MAIN menu displays the SAMPLES menu.
                                                                               7

     > Selections that will do the indicated task using DOS commands.  These
       selections exist only in the SAMPLES menu and its sub-menus.  Thus,
       choosing the "Time change" selection on the SAMPLES menu will change the
       time on your computer.  These functional selections are intended to show
       the various ways selections may be coded.

     > All remaining selections, such as "Word processing" on the MAIN menu, do
       not invoke any program.  Instead, these selections ECHO a statement to
       the screen indicating they must be changed to invoke your programs.

    You are encouraged to modify these menus and selections to suit your tastes
    and needs.  Please keep in mind that the SAMPLES menu and its sub-menus will
    be referenced in this manual.  Therefore, keep them for future reference
    (you may want to move them off the MAIN menu).

    Definition of Shareware
    =======================

    Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software before buying
    it.  If you try a Shareware program and continue using it, you are expected
    to register.  Individual programs differ on details -- some request
    registration while others require it, some specify a maximum trial period.
    With registration, you get anything from the simple right to continue
    using the software to an updated program with printed manual.

    Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software, and the
    copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific exceptions as
    stated below.  Shareware authors are accomplished programmers, just like
    commercial authors, and the programs are of comparable quality.  (In both
    cases, there are good programs and bad ones!) The main difference is in the
    method of distribution.  The author specifically grants the right to copy
    and distribute the software, either to all and sundry or to a specific
    group. For example, some authors require written permission before a
    commercial disk vendor may copy their Shareware.

    Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software.  You should find
    software that suits your needs and pocketbook, whether it's commercial or
    Shareware.  The Shareware system makes fitting your needs easier, because
    you can try before you buy.  And because the overhead is low, prices are low
    also.  Shareware has the ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't use
    the product, you don't pay for it.

    Disclaimer Agreement
    ====================

    Users of MAXimize must accept this disclaimer of warranty: MAXimize is
    supplied as is.  The author disclaims all warranties, expressed or implied,
    including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability and of
    fitness for any purpose.  The author assumes no liability for damages,
    direct or consequential, which may result from the use of MAXimize.

    MAXimize is a "shareware program" and is provided at no charge to the user
    for evaluation.  Feel free to share it with your friends, but please do not
    give it away altered or as part of another system.  The essence of "user-
    supported" software is to provide personal computer users with quality
    software without high prices, and yet to provide incentive for programmers
                                                                               8

    to continue to develop new products.  If you find this program useful and
    find that you are using MAXimize and continue to use MAXimize after a
    reasonable trial period, you must make a registration payment of $59 to Max
    Software.  The $59 registration fee will license one copy for use on any one
    computer at any one time.  You must treat this software just like a book.
    An example is that this software may be used by any number of people and may
    be freely moved from one computer location to another, so long as there is
    no possibility of it being used at one location while it's being used at
    another.  Just as a book cannot be read by two different persons at the same
    time.

    Commercial users of MAXimize must register and pay for their copies of
    MAXimize within 60 days of first use or their license is withdrawn.  Site-
    License arrangements may be made by contacting Max Software.

    Anyone distributing MAXimize for any kind of remuneration must first contact
    Max Software at the address below for authorization.  This authorization
    will be automatically granted to distributors recognized by the (ASP) as
    adhering to its guidelines for shareware distributors, and such distributors
    may begin offering MAXimize immediately (However Max Software must still be
    advised so that the distributor can be kept up-to-date with the latest
    version of MAXimize.).

    You are encouraged to pass a copy of MAXimize along to your friends for
    evaluation.  Please encourage them to register their copy if they find that
    they can use it.  All registered users will receive a copy of the latest
    version of MAXimize.
                                                                               9

    Chapter 1: Using the Menus
    ==========================

    Invoking MAXimize
    =================

    To invoke MAXimize, you must first change to the directory containing
    MAXimize (unless this directory is in your PATH) and then type MAX or MENU
    at the DOS prompt.  Thus, if you installed into C:\MAX, the commands are:

       A> C:
       C> CHDIR  \MAX
       C> MAX

    MAX is slightly faster then Menu.  However, MAX may display a message before
    or after executing a selection.  Try both to determine your preference.


    Menu Anatomy
    ============

    After invoking MAXimize, the main menu will be displayed:

                       cascaded (the default) or maximize to use all of the
                       screen.  It will be used to hold selections for your
                       menus.

      Wall Paper     - The shaded background behind the cascaded main window.

      Border         - the double line drawn around the main window.

      Title          - the name given to the menu.  In the example above the
                       title is Main Menu.

      Menu Text      - optional text to include in the menu.  This text is
                       displayed in a box below the title and above the
                       selections.  Menu text can be used to include your logo
                       or helpful text within the menu.

      Selection Description   -    a short description of what the selection
                       will do. For example, the "Games menu" selection
                       displays a menu of games.

      Selection IDs  - the highlighted identifier in each selection.  For
                       example, the selection ID for "Word Processing" in the
                       example above is "W".  This selection ID may be the
                       first character of the description, a number (from 1 to
                       99), alpha-numeric (the letters A to Z, followed by
                       numbers 0 to 9., a character within the description
                       (like X in eXit), or none at all.

      Selection Bar  - highlights the current selection.  The current selection
                       in the example above is "Games menu"

      Help message   - contains additional information/help for the current
                       selection.  It is displayed in the bottom left hand
                       corner of the main window border.

      Status line    - will always be displayed at the bottom of the screen
                       showing the current date/time and a list of keys most
                       often needed.  It may contain a message as well.  The
                       keys and messages in this line will change as you do
                       different tasks within MAXimize (such as add, update,
                       delete, etc.).  The status of the Alt, Ctrl, Caps Lock,
                       Shift and Num Lock keys are displayed as well.  Try
                       pressing these keys to see how they are displayed.  Look
                       at the status line if you are not sure what keys to use.

      Scroll bars    - displayed when the menu's selections will not fit in the
                       window or for multiple line text.  The window can be
                       scrolled to view selections or text that do not fit in
                       the window.  For menus, the scroll bar is always
                       vertical and appears on the right edge of the window.
                       Text will always have both a vertical and horizontal
                       scroll bar.  A horizontal scroll bar will appear on the
                       bottom edge of the area being scrolled.
                                                                              11

      Scroll box     - shows how far you are positioned into the menu or text.
                       For example, if the scroll box is in the middle of the
                       scroll bar then you are positioned in the middle of the
                       menu/text.

      Arrow icons    - placed on both ends of the scroll bar to show that the
                       window can be scrolled in those directions.


    Menu Bar
    ========

    The menu bar is the top line of the screen.  It contains a list of items,
    each of which displays a drop down menu.  From the drop down menu you may
    choose a command that instructs MAXimize to perform actions.  To activate
    the menu bar press the Alt, F10 or slash (/) key.   Then press the first
    letter of the desired item on the menu bar.   For example, to get help press
    Alt+H and the help drop down menu will be displayed:

    From this drop down menu you can select the desired help command by pressing
    the highlighted character.  The commands in the drop down menus also
    includes (on the right side) the short cut key for the command.  These keys
    can be used instead of selecting the command from the drop down menus.  For
    example, you can get help for MAXimize using the menu bar by pressing Alt+H
    M or by pressing the F2 short cut key.  As you become more familiar with
    MAXimize, you will probably find the short cut keys to be easy to remember
    and quicker.
                                                                              12

    Dialog Boxes
    ============

    MAXimize uses dialog boxes to allow you to enter information to carry out a
    selection or command.  For example, the following is the dialog box used
    when you enter the command to create a new selection that runs a program,
    command or batch file (press Insert then Enter to view this dialog box):

    +----------+ Selection to run a program, command or batch file +----------+
    |                                                                         |

    The dialog box above contains multiple items: fields, toggles and buttons.
    The fields in the dialog box above all end in a colon, such as description,
    program and password.  A list is two or more selections preceded by
    parenthesis, of which you may choose only one.   A toggle is an option that
    may be on or off and is preceded by square brackets ([ ]).  The buttons are
    enclosed in less than and greater than symbols (< >) along the bottom of the
    window.  Each dialog box will have at least one message, field, list or
    toggle and a button.

    Moving the cursor to a field, list, toggle or button can be done by using
    the following keys:

       Tab ......... The Tab key is normally located just above the left Caps
                     Lock key. When pressed, it will move the cursor through
                     the items on the screen from left to right, top to bottom.
                     When the cursor reaches the last item, the next Tab will
                     return to the first item.

       Shift+Tab  ..The Shift+Tab key is the combination of holding the Shift
                    key down while press the Tab key.  This causes the cursor
                    to move from right to left, bottom to top (the reverse of
                    Tab).  When the cursor reaches the first item, the next
                    Shift+Tab will go to the last item.

       Down arrow  .The down arrow will go to the next item, unless the current
                    item uses it (like the lists in the add selection dialog
                    box).
                                                                              13

       Up arrow ....The up arrow will go to the prior item, unless the current
                    item uses it (like the lists in the add selection dialog
                    box).

       Alt+? .......Alt+? is the combination of holding the Alt key down while
                    pressing the highlighted key for an item.  Most of the
                    items will have a highlighted key to allow you to use this
                    method to quickly move to an item.  For example, pressing
                    Alt+P in the above dialog box will move to the program
                    field.   Using this method to move to a selection in a list
                    will select it, or to move to a toggle will turn it on/off
                    or to move to a button will depress (select) it.


    Buttons
    =======

    Buttons normally appear along the bottom of a dialog box and are always
    enclosed in less than and greater than symbols (eq. < OK >).   Pressing a
    button requests an action be taken.  For example, pressing cancel will
    cancel a dialog box .   To press a button, you may use the Tab or Shift+Tab
    keys to position the cursor to the desired button and then use the Enter or
    space bar key to depress it.   Also, you may hold the Alt key down while
    pressing the highlighted key in the button (eq. Alt+H would depress the Help
    button).

    Generally speaking there will usually be an OK, Cancel and Help button in
    each dialog box.  Depressing the OK button causes the dialog box to accept
    the information within it.  Depressing Cancel causes the action associated
    with the dialog box to be canceled.  Depressing Help requests help for the
    dialog box.  Dialog boxes may also contain other buttons, these are
    explained in the sections covering these dialog boxes.

    If a button is highlighted while the cursor is not positioned on it then
    pressing Enter will also depress that button.  Normally, this will be the OK
    button.  Thus, pressing enter while not on a button will normally cause the
    dialog box information to be accepted.


    Fields
    ======

    Fields are used in dialog boxes where input text is to be typed.  These
    fields are usually labeled (eq. Program: is the label for the field to
    contain the program name).  However, if the dialog box consists of only one
    field and some buttons (such as the input prompt window), then the field may
    not be labeled.  You should position to a field as described earlier and
    then type the desired text.  While typing text you may also use the editing
    keys outlined in the next section.
                                                                              14

    Editing Keys
    ============

    The following keys are always available for editing purposes:

      Left arrow ...Move the cursor left one character
      Right arrow ..Move the cursor right one character
      Home  ........Move the cursor to start of line
      End  .........Move the cursor to end of line
      Insert  ......Toggle between insert and overwrite mode
      Delete  ......Delete character at cursor
      Backspace  ...Delete character before cursor
      Ctrl+Y .......Clear the entire line
      Ctrl+Delete ..Clear the line from cursor to end

      Note:  insert mode causes the character typed to be inserted at the cursor
             and overwrite mode causes the character typed to replace the
             character at the cursor.  The current mode will show up in the
             status line as INS or OVR.


    Toggles
    =======

    Toggles are used in dialog boxes for options that may be on or off.  Each
    toggle is preceded by a set of square brackets([ ]).  The toggle is on when
    an X is displayed within the square brackets (eq. [X]).  To change a toggle
    from on to off or visa versa,  you may use the Tab or Shift+Tab keys to
    position the cursor to the desired toggle and then press the space bar.
    Finally, you may hold the Alt key down while pressing the highlighted key in
    the toggle (eq. Alt+S would toggle "Shell directly to program").


    Lists
    =====

    Lists are used in dialog boxes when you must choose one selection from a
    list.  Each selection in the list is preceded by a set of parenthesis.   For
    example, when creating a new selection, the add dialog box will be displayed
    (press Insert to view this dialog box):

                +----------------+ Add Selection +-----------------+
                |                                                  |
                |  Where: (_) After highlighted selection          |
                |         ( ) Before highlighted selection         |
                |                                                  |
                | Format: (_) Run a program, command or batch file |
                |         ( ) Display a new or existing menu       |
                |         ( ) Command stream (Batch commands)      |
                |                                                  |
                +--------------------------------------------------+
                |      < OK >       < Cancel >       < Help >      |
                +--------------------------------------------------+
                                                                              15

    This dialog box contains a list for where the selection should be added and
    another for the selection's format.  The current selection in each list is
    denoted by a dot within the parenthesis.  To change the current selection in
    a list, you may use the Tab or Shift+Tab keys to position the cursor to the
    desired list and then use the arrow keys to move the dot.  Also, you may
    hold the Alt key down while pressing the highlighted key in the selection
    (eq. Alt+B would select "Before highlighted selection").


    Getting Help
    ============

    To get help for a selection, position the selection bar on the selection.  A
    help message will appear in the bottom border of the main window.  Press
    Alt+H S or the F1 short cut key to display additional help text for this
    selection.

    To get help on how to use MAXimize, press Alt+H M or the F2 short cut key.
    This will display the help screen which has two windows.  The left window
    contains a menu of topics, and the right window has an explanation of the
    highlighted topic.  The sequence of topics allows new users to read all
    about MAXimize by pressing the down arrow key to read the next topic.  To
    view the explanation for a topic, press the highlighted character for that
    topic.  For example, press Alt+H M and then K to get the following help:

    You may use the following keys:

      Up arrow............Up one topic
      Down arrow..........Down one topic
      Home................First topic
      End.................Last topic
      Left arrow..........Prior (related) topic
      Right arrow or Tab..Positions to a related topic within the text
      Enter...............Selects (displays) the related topic positioned on

    Related topics mentioned within the text of the topic displayed are shown in
    a different color (the same color as the topics in the left window).  You
    may use the right arrow, Tab or Shift+Tab keys to position to a related
    topic. Then press the Enter key to display the related topic.  To return to
    the prior topic, simply press the left arrow key (this can be done
    repeatedly to retrace your steps backward through related topics).

    To leave MAXimize's help, press the Esc key.


    Moving the Selection Bar Within a Menu
    ======================================

    MAXimize uses the same keys in all menus to move the selection bar.  These
    keys are:

       Up arrow......Up one row.
       Down arrow....Down one row.
       Left arrow....Left one column.
       Right arrow...Right one column.
       Home..........First selection.
       End...........Last selection.
       PgUp..........Page up (for menus that scroll).
       PgDn..........Page down (for menus that scroll).

    Try each of these keys.  Notice the selection bar "wraps" around when the
    arrow keys are held down.  If you press the down arrow key when positioned
    on the last item, the selection bar will be placed on the first item.


    Choosing a Selection
    ====================

    To choose a selection, type the highlighted selection ID or move the
    selection bar to the desired item and press the Enter key.  The highlighted
    selection ID is normally on the left side of the selections' description,
    but may be a letter within the description.  This ID should be a different
    color.  Try choosing the "Word processing" selection on the main menu by
    pressing W.
                                                                              17

    Displaying Other Menus
    ======================

    Navigating to a lower level (sub) menu is done by choosing the appropriate
    selection.  For example, choosing the "Samples menu" selection on the main
    menu will display the following sub-menu:

     File  Edit  Options  Window  Help

     ++ Print the order/registartion form +-----------------------------------+

    MAXimize  +=Select_Item  ^v><=Next_Item  Alt=Actions  07:11pm  30OCT92

    To return to the prior menu press Alt+F P or the Esc short cut key.  To
    return directly to the main menu from any sub-menu, type Alt+F M or the
    backslash (\) short cut key.  To return to a previous menu, press Alt+W
    followed by the number displayed to the left of the menu to return to.


    Window Cascade
    ==============

    By default, MAXimize displays your menus in cascading windows.  That is,
    each submenu (lower level menu) the is displayed will overlay the previous
    one on the screen.  Later, you will be shown how to change this default in
    the miscellaneous options.  Any time after starting MAXimize, you may toggle
    between cascaded and full sized menu windows by pressing the Alt+W C keys or
    the F3 short cut key.  You may find it useful to display a menu with lots of
    selections in a full sized window.


    Screen Save and Protection
    ==========================

    MAXimize can automatically clear the screen after a specified period of time
    to prevent the characters from burning into the screen and/or to prevent
    unauthorized use of your unattended computer.  The setting of this automatic
                                                                              18

    screen "save" feature is discussed later under miscellaneous options.  You
    can also cause the screen to be cleared (or "saved") by pressing the Alt+W S
    keys of the Shift+F10 short cut key.  This is useful when you leave your
    computer for a period of time, especially if the automatic screen clear
    feature has been disabled.

    You can also protect your computer by using a password on the screen save
    feature.  This will help ensure that your computer isn't used when it is
    left unattended while in MAXimize.  Once the screen save feature is
    activated, this password (or the creator password) is required to reenter
    MAXimize.  To use this security, press Alt+W P or the Ctrl+F10 short cut key
    and then enter the password to use.


    Input Prompts
    =============

    The Input prompt window is displayed when prompting for a single line of
    text input.  It is used for all selection text input requests.  The window
    will appear near the bottom of your screen.  The top line of the window will
    contain a message suggesting what you should enter as input.  The input line
    may be blank or contain a default value.  You may then enter or change the
    input using the keys described in the editing keys section.  In addition,
    you may use the following keys to display and change previous input to this
    window:

               Key:            Action:
               -----------     -----------------------------
               Up arrow        Get previous input in buffer.
               Down arrow      Get next input in buffer.
               PgUp            Get oldest input in buffer.
               PgDn            Get newest input in buffer.

    Each time you enter input into this window, it is added to an input "buffer"
    of 500 characters in length.  This buffer will contain multiple input
    responses. Once the buffer becomes full, the oldest input(s) is removed as
    new input is entered.  By using the up arrow, down arrow, PgUp and PgDn
    keys, you can scroll through prior inputs.  Once you have located the
    desired input, you may modify it (if need be) and then hit Enter.

    For example, select "Execute a DOS command" on the MAXimize SAMPLES menu.
    The input prompt window will pop-up at the bottom of your screen:

     ++ Enter DOS command, program, batch file or press enter for DOS prompt: ++
     |                                                                         |
     +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
     |            < OK >             < Cancel >             < Help >           |
     +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+


    Then enter a DOS command such as DIR /W.  Choose this selection several
    times, each time entering a different command, such as, VER and CHKDSK. Now,
    choose this selection one last time.  Instead of entering a command, use the
    up arrow key to display the prior ones.  Be sure to try each of the editing
    keys listed previously.
                                                                              19


    Quitting MAXimize
    =================

    To leave MAXimize press Alt+F X or the F9 short cut key.  Also, a selection,
    such as "Quit MAXimize" on the SAMPLES menu, can be selected to exit
    MAXimize.


    Advanced Topics
    ===============

    This section covers topics related to using the menus that are not required
    reading.  You should be comfortable with the prior sections of chapter 1
    before proceeding.  You should read those topics below that you have an
    interest in.  For example, if you have a mouse installed, you will probably
    be interested in reading the next section.


    Using a Mouse
    =============

    A mouse is a hand operated pointing device that can be attached to your
    computer.  The mouse has up to three buttons that the computer can sense are
    being depressed.   MAXimize will use the right and left buttons only.  When
    MAXimize is first started, the mouse will not appear.  To use the mouse,
    simply roll the mouse across your mouse pad or desk top and the mouse will
    appear on the screen as a square box.  If the mouse does not appear, either
    your options have been set to disable it or the mouse has not been installed
    correctly.

    Before explaining how to use your mouse, the following terminology should be
    understood:

      Pointer.......The square box that is displayed when you move the mouse.
      Point.........Move the mouse across your desk until the mouse pointer is
                    on a specific area of the screen (usually within a
                    selection's description).
      Release.......Let up on the mouse button.
      Click.........Quickly press and release the left button.
      Double-Click..Click to highlight the selection and then click again.
      Drag..........Hold the left button down on a specific area and then drag
                    it around the screen by rolling your mouse across the desk.

    The mouse can be used to do the following:

      >  Display the help message for a selection in the menu.  For menus where
         a help message does or may appear, point to a selection and click.
         This will highlight the selection and display the help message (if
         any).  This help message will either be in, or just above, the bottom
         border.

      >  Choose a selection from a menu.  Point to the selection.  Then for
         menus where a help message MAY be defined, double click to choose it.
         Otherwise, a click will choose the selection.  NOTE: If item is already
         highlighted, a single click will select the item.
                                                                              20


      >  Move the selection bar.  You can drag the selection bar from one
         selection to another.  This allows you to roll through the selections
         and examining the help messages for them.

      >      >      >  Display a previous menu.  For cascaded menus, you may return to a
         previous menu simply by clicking on its window.

      >  Press the escape key.  Quickly press and release the right button to
         escape (just as if the Esc key had been pressed).

      >  Select keys shown in the status line.  Point to the key in the status
         line and click.  For example, the status line may have F1=Help.
         Clicking on this will cause the F1 key to be entered as if you pressed
         it on the keyboard.

      >  Move the text cursor within or to another field.  Point to where the
         text cursor should be located and  click.

      >  Toggle a setting on or off.  Point to the toggle and click.  If the
         toggle was off it will be turned on and visa versa.

      >  Select an item in a list.  Point to the item and click.  A dot will be
         placed in the parenthesis that are to the left of the item.

      >  Depress a Button.  Point to the button and click.  The action
         associated to the button is done.


    For windows with vertical or horizontal scroll bars:

      >  Move the selection bar.  Click on the window borders.  Click on the top
         border to move up, the bottom border to move down, the left border to
         move left and the right corners to move right.

      >  Scroll the window.  Click on the arrow icons to scroll the window in
         the direction of the arrow icon.

      >  Page up or down.  Click on the scroll bar above the scroll box to page
         up and below the scroll box to page down.

      >  Change location of selection bar or text cursor.  Drag the scroll box
         to the desired percentage into the menu/text and release.  The
         selection bar text cursor will be placed accordingly.  For example,
         dragging the scroll box to the middle of the scroll bar will place the
         selection bar on the middle selection.
                                                                              21

    Hot Keys
    ========

    Hot keys allow you to invoke applications without having to navigate to a
    menu to choose the desired selection.  This is particularly useful for often
    used applications, such as an editor.  To view the menu of hot keys press
    Alt+F H or the F7 short cut key from any menu in the main window.  The
    following is the hot keys menu:

      File  Edit  Options  Window  Help

      +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

    MAXimize  +=Select_Item  ^v><=Next_Item  Alt=Actions  07:11pm  30OCT92


    The hot key selection IDs are Ctrl+? (where ? is A through Z).  To choose a
    hot key simply hold down the Ctrl key while pressing the desired letter (ex.
    E for edit).  This can be done even when the hot key menu is not displayed!
    If you define your editor as Ctrl+E, it can easily be invoke by pressing
    Ctrl+E even when the hot keys menu is not displayed.

    If a hot key lacks a description (as Ctrl+B above), it has not been defined
    and has no action.  To define a hot key or update it, follow the section on
    updating a selection.  To leave the hot keys menu press Esc.

    There are a few minor conflicts between the hot keys and the keys on your
    keyboard.  These conflicts occur when the hot key has the same internal
    representation as another key.  These conflicts are:

                    Hot Key:    Same as:
                    --------    ----------
                    Ctrl+H      Backspace
                    Ctrl+I      Tab
                    Ctrl+M      Enter
                    Ctrl+C      Ctrl+Break
                    Ctrl+J      Ctrl+Enter
                                                                              22


    MAXimize can handle the first three in this list by detecting that the Ctrl
    key is depressed.  However, the last two appear to be the same keystroke and
    will always cause the hot key to be selected.  If this is a problem, do not
    use these hot keys.

    Try using the hot keys while they are NOT displayed.  First display the main
    menu by pressing \ and then enter Ctrl+A.  This will display the current DOS
    PATH and allow you to modify it.  You may modify the DOS PATH by adding a
    directory at the end of the PATH and pressing the Enter key.  Otherwise,
    simply press Esc to abort the execution of this selection.


    Invoking MAXimize with Parameters
    =================================

    When invoking MAXimize, you may include parameters.  For example, if you
    would like to start at a menu other than the main menu, follow MAX or MENU
    with the menu name to start at.  The following switches are optional:

      /B   Initialize the colors to have black backgrounds.  Sets colors for
           screens that cannot display them (like monochrome screens).

      /K   Are keys to be entered after MAXimize starts (as if they were entered
           from the keyboard).  This allows selections to be invoked when
           starting MAXimize (especially from an AUTOEXEC.BAT file).  Hot keys
           are represented by the @ sign followed by the desired key (ex. @A is
           Ctrl+A).  Use @@ to represent a single @ sign.

      /A   Is an alternate main menu.  This overrides the main menu defined in
           the options.  This could be used in combination with the SESSION.BAT
           file from a task switcher to cause each session to have a different
           main menu.

      /Q   Disables quitting from MAXimize and the DOS shell functions.  This
           feature would be used when you do not want the users of MAXimize to
           use the DOS prompt.  This switch will disable the Esc key quitting
           when the user is viewing the main menu, the F9 key quitting, a
           selection quitting, and the F8 key shelling to the DOS prompt.

      /M   The batch file used to invoke MAX.  This switch must be used only
           when MAX has been invoked by a batch file.

      /U   The user ID to use for a shared PC or LAN support.  This allows for
           multiple users with different configurations to run off the same copy
           of MAXimize on a single PC.  Also, it provides for multiple users to
           run off the same copy of MAXimize on a LAN.  The default for this
           switch is MAXIMIZE.  Environment variable ID can be set instead of
           specifying this switch. Please refer to Appendix C, for more
           information on this.

    For example, to display the SAMPLES menu and then cause the keys "A", Ctrl+C
    and "@" to be entered:
                                                                              23

       C>CHDIR  \MAX
       C>MENU  SAMPLES  /KA@C@@


    Using MAXimize with a Task Switcher
    ====================================

    One capability you may want to combine with MAXimize is the ability to
    switch between several tasks.  For example, you may want to switch between
    your word processor and spread sheet programs without leaving either.  There
    is a number of task switching type software on the market.  From the lowly
    DOSSHELL provided with DOS 5.0, to Software Carousel, Microsoft's Windows
    3.1 and IBM's OS/2 2.0.  Any one of which allows you to switch between
    multiple DOS applications without exiting any of them.

    Merging MAXimize with these task switchers provides you with the best of
    both.  MAXimize will fill the short-comings in these task switchers (namely,
    a great DOS menu), while the task switcher allows you to switch between
    multiple tasks.  All you have to do is set the task switcher to invoke
    sessions of MAXimize.  Then from each session, either the desired MAXimize
    selection can be chosen automatically or the user can select what they want
    to do.  Finally, the user simply switches between the sessions of MAXimize
    using the task switcher to bounce between their tasks (word processor,
    spread sheet, utilities, etc.)

    To add MAXimize sessions to your task switcher you will need to add a
    selection (program item in the DOSSHELL) for each session.  Define the
    selection with:

      1. An appropriate program title (eq. "MAXimize session 1" or "Word
         Processing Task")

      2. A command of "SESSION.BAT  ?  [parameters]",  where the question mark
         should be replaced with the session identifier (an alpha-numeric, one
         digit ID) and "[parameters] "are any valid parameters of MAX.EXE.  The
         following parameters are of particular interest:

         /Amain    - to define a different main menu for this session than the
                     other sessions
         /Q        - to disallow quitting and shelling to DOS from this session
         /Uuserid  - to have different options (like colors) for each session,
                     use a different user ID.
         /Kkeys    - to cause a selection to execute when a session starts
                     (like the word processing selection for the "Word
                     processing session").

      3. A startup directory of the one MAXimize was installed in (eq. C:\MAX)

      4. Provide as much conventionally memory as needed by the application.
         Generally, you should specify as much as your computer can provide.
         For example, about 550k can be specified with the DOSSHELL on a machine
         with 2MB of RAM.  At a minimum, supply at least 192k for MAXimize if no
         updating of the setup is to be done in this session.  If you want to
         update MAXimize's setup in this session, supply at least 384k.
                                                                              24

    The result of combining a task switcher with MAXimize is a powerful DOS menu
    environment that allows you to switch between the programs you have invoked
    without having to leave them.  This is truly the best of both worlds.  Even
    if you have DOS 5.0, you can use the DOSSHELL as a task switcher.  If you
    find this capability useful, you may then want to look into purchasing
    another task switcher.


    Go To DOS
    =========

    If you want to suspend MAXimize and enter commands at the DOS prompt, press
    Alt+F D or the F8 short cut key.  This will display the DOS prompt and allow
    you to enter any number of commands.  To return to MAXimize, do NOT invoke
    it.  Instead, type EXIT at the DOS prompt and press Enter.  This will return
    you to MAXimize where it was suspended.
                                                                              25

    Chapter 2: Modifying Menus
    ==========================

    Overview
    ========

    This chapter discusses the modification of "user" menus and their
    selections. These user menus are those menus that appear in the main (large)
    window, including the main menu, any sub-menus below it and the hot keys.
    The modification of hot keys should be treated the same as selections.
    Differences, if any, will be noted.

    When changing a menu or the hot keys be sure to back these files up (as with
    any other files on your computer).  You may use the DOS COPY/BACKUP command
    or any of several backup facilities on the market.

    Menu modification can be split into two categories:  modifying
    characteristics of the menu and modifying selections.  The former refers to
    items specific to the menu and all of its selections, such as the menu
    title, password and type of selection ID.  The latter refers to adding,
    deleting, updating and other modifications to a specific selection(s).
    Notice, there is no mention of adding or deleting a sub-menu.  This is done
    through the adding/deleting of a selection. For example, to add a sub-menu
    to an existing menu, simply add a selection and enter the name of the
    new/existing sub-menu.  To delete a sub-menu, simply delete the selection
    that displays it.

    Updating a menu or selection always follows this sequence:

      1. Display the menu to be changed.  Simply choose the normal selection(s)
         from the user menus until the desired menu is displayed as explained
         in chapter 1.  To display the hot keys, press the F7 key.

      2. If selections are to be modified, then mark the selection(s).  To
         modify one selection, simply highlight it with the selection bar.  To
         modify multiple selections, mark them using the space bar.

      3. Display the edit drop down menu by pressing Alt+E.

      4. Now choose the desired operation: add, update, delete, copy or
         transfer (move) selection(s).  Or choose menu to modify the menu
         characteristics.  If there is a setup password, you will have enter it
         at this point.

      5. Follow the directions for the specific operation you chose.

    The setup password prompt in step 4 and/or the slight delay caused by the
    setup program load may become annoying especially when doing multiple
    operations.  If this happens, you may want to use the Update Mode, which
    will be discussed in the chapter covering Options.
                                                                              26

    Marking Selection(s)
    ====================

    After displaying the desired menu, you must then mark the selection(s) to be
    modified.  If only one selection is to be changed, then highlight it by
    positioning the selection bar on it.  It you want to modify several
    selections on ONE menu with a single operation (like update), then you must
    first mark those selections.

    To mark selections, position the selection bar on them and press the space
    bar. A check mark will be placed to the left of the selection indicating it
    has been marked.  The selection bar will then be moved to the next
    selection.  You may mark as many selections as desired by repeatedly
    pressing the space bar. To mark all the selections on a menu, simply press
    Alt+E L or hold down the Ctrl key and press the right arrow short cut key.
    Choosing a selection or leaving the menu will automatically remove the marks
    from the selections.

    To remove a mark on a selection, again position the selection bar on the
    selection and press the space bar.  The check mark will disappear.  Thus,
    the space bar will toggle the check mark on and off.  To remove all marks,
    press Alt+E E or hold down the Ctrl key and press the left arrow short cut
    key.


    Text Block Operations
    =====================

    The following are additional editing keys available when editing multiple
    lines of text.  These multiple line text areas are identified by both a
    vertical and horizontal scroll bar.  Multiple line text editing is used when
    editing batch commands, menu text and help text, which are explained later.

      Key:         Action:
      -----------  ---------------------------------------------
      Up arrow     Up one line
      Down arrow   Down one line
      Ctrl+PgUp    Place cursor on first visible line of text
      Ctrl+PgDn    Place cursor on last visible line of text
      Ctrl+Home    Go to start of text
      Ctrl+End     Go to end of text
      Ctrl+N       Insert a line above the line the cursor is on
      Ctrl+Y       Delete the line cursor is on
      Ctrl+P       Imbed control characters
      Ctrl+R       Read text from a file (inserted into current
                   text at cursor)
      Ctrl+S       Save text in a file (either marked block or
                   all the text)
      Ctrl+E       Displays edit menu - read/write and block
                   operations
      Enter        Insert mode: a line is inserted.
                   Overwrite mode: go to next line.

    The Ctrl+P key allows you to enter control characters into your text.
    Control characters are those represented by ASCII codes 0 to 31.  To enter a
    control character, hold down the Ctrl key, then press the letter P followed
                                                                              27

    by the desired control key.  For example, hold the Ctrl key down and press
    the letter P and then Z.  This will result in the right arrow symbol being
    imbedded into the text.

    When editing multiple lines of text, you can mark part of the text as a
    "block". Then the block of text can be deleted, cut, copied and pasted
    somewhere else. A mouse provides the easiest way to mark a block of text.
    Simply position the mouse pointer on the screen to the start or end of the
    text block.  Then drag the mouse to the opposite corner of the block of text
    and release the mouse. As you drag the mouse the block of text will be
    highlighted.

    You can mark a block of text without a mouse by holding the shift key down
    and pressing the direction keys (ie. arrows, Home, End, PgUp, PgDn).  First
    position the cursor to the start or end of the block of text. Then hold the
    shift key down and press the required direction keys to highlight the block.

    Once the block has been marked, you can then press Alt+E to display the edit
    menu and choose to:

       Operation: Keystroke:    Description:
       ---------- ----------    -----------------------------------------
       Cut        Shift+Del     remove block of text and put in clipboard
       Copy       Ctrl+Enter    put block of text in clipboard
       Clear      Del           remove block of text
       Save       Alt+S         save block of text to a file

    To paste the contents of the clipboard somewhere else, position the cursor
    where the text is to be inserted.  Then press Alt+E to display the edit menu
    and select Paste or press Shift+Ins.  The contents of the clipboard will
    remain unchanged.  Thus, you may paste the contents in the clipboard as many
    times as you like.


    Selection Formats (Types)
    =========================

    MAXimize has the following selection formats that determine what the
    selection can do:

       > Run a single program, command or batch file
       > Display a new or existing menu
       > Command stream (this is a batch file stored in the selection itself)

    When you add a selection or update an empty hot key (no description), you
    must decide what format (from above) to use.  Then based on the format, one
    of the selection update screens is displayed.  When you update a selection,
    MAXimize determines the proper format and displays the appropriate update
    screen.

    Next, each selection format and its associated update window will be
    covered. This includes a description of the fields within the selection
    update windows and how MAXimize processes that type of selection.
                                                                              28



    Run a Program, Command or Batch File
    ====================================

    This type of selection is used when running a single program, command or
    batch file.  The selection update window will look like the following:

     +----------+ Selection to run a program, command or batch file +----------+
     |                                                                         |
     | Description:                                                            |
     |     Program:                                                            |
     |                                                                         |
     +-- Optional v -----------------------------------------------------------+
     |                                                                         |
     |   Directory:                                                            |
     |  Parameters:                                                            |
     |      Prompt:                                                            |
     |    Track By:                                                            |
     |    Password:                                                            |
     |   ID letter:   < Not allowed due to current menu's ID Type.             |
     |                                                                         |
     |   [ ] Pause after program runs           [ ] Shell directly to program  |
     +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
     |    < OK >    < Update Help >    < Format >    < Cancel >    < Help >    |
     +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+



    The fields in this window are:

      Description is the text shown on the menu and describes what the
                  selection does.  If the menu uses the first character of the
                  description for the selection ID, be sure that it is unique
                  for this menu.  This is a required field.

      Program     is the program, command or batch file to run.  Simply enter
                  what you normally enter at the DOS prompt up to the first
                  blank (anything after the first blank is parameters).  This
                  file does not have to be fully qualified (that is, include
                  the drive and directory in the file name).  MAXimize will
                  automatically search your hard disk(s) to find it if it is
                  not fully qualified. This is a required field.  To search
                  your disk drives for a program, simply Tab to this field and
                  press the F6 key.

      Directory   is the working directory to switch to before running the
                  program, command or batch file.  MAXimize will make the
                  specified drive and directory current before running the
                  program.  To search your hard disk for a directory, simply
                  Tab to this field and press the F6 key.

      Parameters  are the parameters passed to the program, command or batch
                  file. If your program is "VIEW" and your parameter is
                  "C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT", then the resulting command would be "VIEW
                  C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT".
                                                                              29


      Prompt      is the window title used when prompting for parameters to
                  pass the program, command or batch file.  The default text
                  for the parameters is supplied by the "parameters" field.
                  This allows for the entry or modification of the parameters
                  passed to the program.  If this field is blank, then this
                  prompting for parameters is not done.

      Track By    Is the unique identification to use for this selection when
                  usage logging is desired.  Normally the program name being
                  ran is specified here.  This value is also used for the
                  license control process.  Please review the chapter titled
                  Controlling and Monitoring Access.

      Password    protects the selection.  Before the selection can be executed
                  or altered this password must be entered.  Also, the
                  selection will be encoded in the menu file stored on disk
                  when password protected.  If this field is blank, the
                  selection will not be protected.

      ID Letter   is the letter to highlight in the description.  This letter
                  can then be pressed to invoke this selection.  Be careful to
                  specify a unique letter. Also, this letter is case sensitive,
                  so use the same case (upper or lower) as that in the
                  description.  For example, X in eXit.  This field is only
                  active when the menu has been defined as having the "specify
                  ID letter" type (see Update Menu Characteristics section in
                  this chapter).

      Pause after program runs [ ]

                  When this toggle is on, the selection will pause, using the
                  PAUSE DOS command, after running the selection.  This is
                  useful when the program or batch file does not pause.
                  Without the pause, anything written to the screen by the
                  program will be quickly replaced by MAXimize's screen.

      Shell directly to program [ ]

                  When this toggle is on, MAXimize will not clear itself from
                  memory when running the selection.  This can be slightly
                  faster. However, your application will have less memory
                  (about 100k) to work with.


    The description and program fields are required.  The remaining fields are
    optional.  MAXimize will process the selection in the following sequence:

       1. If a password is specified then MAXimize will request that it be
          entered.
       2. If a prompt is specified then MAXimize will prompt for parameters to
          pass the program.  The "prompt" is a message indicating what
          parameter(s) should be entered.  The text specified in the parameters
          will be the default.  The user may then modify or enter parameters.
       3. If a working directory is specified then MAXimize will change the
          current drive and directory to the working drive and directory.
                                                                              30

       4. Run the program with the parameters.  The parameters will be either
          from the prompt or as specified if prompt was not specified.  If the
          shell is on then MAXimize will not clear itself from memory when
          running the program.
       5. If the pause toggle is on, then MAXimize will wait for any key stroke
          after the program runs and before displaying the current menu.


    Display a New or Existing Menu
    ==============================

    This type of selection is used to display a new or existing menu.  The
    selection update window will look like the following:

    The fields in this window are:

      Description  is the text shown on the menu and describes what the
                   selection does.  If the menu uses the first character of the
                   description for the selection ID, be sure that it is unique
                   for this menu.  The description cannot be blank.

      Menu         is the next menu to be displayed by the selection.  It must
                   conform to the standard DOS file name convention and may be
                   an existing, new or wild card menu name.  The menu name is
                   also required.  When a new menu name is entered, the menu
                   modification window will pop-up in the middle of the screen.
                   Follow the instructions for modifying menu characteristics.
                   Besides a menu name, you may specify the following:
                                                                              31

                        Specify:  Action:
                        --------  ---------------------------------
                        {Main}     will return to the main menu
                        {Keys}     will display the hot keys
                        {Prior}    will return to the previous menu

                   If the menu specified was displayed previously (in navigating
                   to the current menu), then MAXimize will return to this menu.

      Existing menu names

                   provides a list of existing menus you may choose from
                   (although a new menu name may be entered in the menu field).

     Password      protects the selection.  Before the selection can be executed
                   or altered this password must be entered.  Also, the
                   selection will be encoded in the menu file stored on disk
                   when password protected.  If this field is blank, the
                   selection will not be protected.

                   NOTE: This password will NOT protect a sub-menu displayed by
                   the selection! Instead, use the menu password to protect the
                   sub-menu.

      ID Letter    is the letter to highlight in the description.  This letter
                   can then be pressed to invoke this selection.  Be careful to
                   specify a unique letter. Also, this letter is case sensitive,
                   so use the same case (upper or lower) as that in the
                   description.  For example, X in eXit.  This field is only
                   active when the menu has been defined as having the "specify
                   ID letter" type (see Update Menu Characteristics section in
                   this chapter).

    Only the description and menu name are required.  If you want to display an
    existing menu name, simply Tab to that field and select the desired menu.
    The remaining fields are optional.  MAXimize processes this type of
    selection in the following sequence:

        1.If a password is specified then MAXimize will request that it be
          entered.
        2.Display the menu specified.  If the menu is a new menu, than it will
          contain no selections at first.  You must then add selections to this
          sub-menu.  If the menu specified was displayed previously (in
          navigating to the current menu), then MAXimize will return to this
          menu.

    Command Stream
    ==============

    This type of selection is used to run a stream of commands.  These commands
    have the same format as a batch command file, with a minor exception and
    many added capabilities.  Often, these are the same commands you would enter
    from the DOS prompt to do a task (such as invoking a program).  However,
    there are many additional capabilities as mentioned earlier that can make
    this a very powerful tool.  The selection update window will look like the
    following:
                                                                              32

    The fields in this window are:

      Description is the text shown on the menu and describes what the
                  selection does.  If the menu uses the first character of the
                  description for the selection ID, be sure that it is unique
                  for this menu.  The description cannot be blank.

      Commands    are the DOS commands, programs or batch files to be executed.
                  Often, these are the same as those entered at the DOS prompt
                  to invoke a program.  You may have up to 99 lines.  They must
                  conform to the normal batch file conventions except the SHIFT
                  command will not work and %0 contains the first parameter.
                  Also, batch files executed must include the .BAT extension or
                  be preceded by a tilde (~) sign.  Unless you want to use the
                  current drive and directory, be sure to change them both.
                  For example, C: will change to the C drive and CHDIR \NEWDIR
                  will change to the \NEWDIR directory.  The commands specified
                  will be placed into a batch file and then executed.

      Parameters  are the parameters passed to the commands, just as parameters
                  are passed to a batch file.  In the commands, use the
                  variables %0, %1, %2,...,%9 to refer to the first through
                  tenth parameter.  The SHIFT DOS command will not shift the
                  parameters here.  This is because the parameters are filled
                  in by MAXimize before the commands are ever executed by DOS.
                                                                              33

      Prompt      is the text of the input prompt when prompting for parameters
                  to pass the commands.  The default text for the parameters is
                  supplied by the "parameters" field.  This allows for the
                  entry or modification of the parameters passed to the
                  commands.  If this field is blank, then no prompting for
                  parameters is done.

      Track By    Is the unique identification to use for this selection when
                  usage logging is desired.  Normally the program name being
                  ran is specified here.  This value is also used for the
                  license control process.  Please review the chapter titled
                  Controlling and Monitoring Access.

      Password    protects the selection.  Before the selection can be executed
                  or altered the password must be entered.  Also, the selection
                  will be encoded in the menu file stored on disk when password
                  protected.  If this field is blank, the selection will not be
                  protected.

                  NOTE: This password will NOT protect a sub-menu displayed by
                  the selection! Instead, use the menu password to protect the
                  sub-menu.

      Shell [ ]   When this toggle is on, MAXimize will not clear itself from
                  memory when running the selection.  This can be slightly
                  faster.  However, your application will have less memory
                  (about 100k) to work with.

      Quit [ ]    When this toggle is on, the selection will run (executing any
                  commands) and then MAXimize will quit (returning the user to
                  the DOS prompt).  This is used to create a selection that
                  quits MAXimize.

      Menu        is the next menu to be displayed by the selection.  It must
                  conform to the standard DOS file name convention and may be
                  an existing, new or wild card menu name.  If you specify a
                  wild card (* or ?), then a list of existing menus that match
                  the wild card will be displayed.  You may then choose an
                  existing menu name from that list.  When a new menu name is
                  entered, the menu modification window will pop-up in the
                  middle of the screen.  Follow the instructions for modifying
                  menu characteristics.   Also, the menu name can be the
                  following:

                        Specify:    Action:
                        --------    ---------------------------------
                        {Main}       will return to the main menu
                        {Keys}       will display the hot keys
                        {Prior}      will return to the previous menu

                  If the menu specified was displayed previously (in navigating
                  to the current menu), then MAXimize will return to this menu.

      ID Letter   is the letter to highlight in the description.  This letter
                  can then be pressed to invoke this selection.  Be careful to
                  specify a unique letter. Also, this letter is case sensitive,
                                                                              34

                  so use the same case (upper or lower) as that in the
                  description.  For example, X in eXit.  This field is only
                  active when the menu has been defined as having the "specify
                  ID letter" type (see Update Menu Characteristics section in
                  this chapter).

    The description and commands fields are required.  However, it is possible
    to specify a remark in the commands if you do not want to specify commands.
    To do this simply type REM in the command field.  All other fields are
    optional. MAXimize processes this type of selection in the following
    sequence:

       1. If a password is specified then MAXimize will request that it be
          entered.
       2. If a prompt is specified then MAXimize will prompt for parameters to
          pass the commands.  The "prompt" is a message indicating what
          parameter(s) should be entered.  The text specified as the parameters
          will be the default.  The user may then modify or enter parameters.
       3. "Compile" the commands.  This process will resolve all functions and
          variable references (except environment variables).  This includes
          references to the parameters.  It also removes remarks and adds code
          for batch files that are invoked.  Be sure that batch files in the
          commands are preceded by a tilde (~) sign (without this, MAXimize may
          not re-invoke itself).  The resulting commands are then written to a
          batch file.
       4. If there were commands for DOS, MAXimize will run the commands
          through DOS using the batch file created in step 3.  If the shell
          toggle is on then MAXimize will not clear itself from memory when
          running the commands.
       5. If the quit toggle is on, MAXimize will quit, returning the user to
          DOS prompt.
       6. If menu is specified, then the requested menu is displayed.  If the
          menu specified was displayed previously (in navigating to the current
          menu), then MAXimize will return to this menu.

    When specifying your commands, you may want to search your disk drives for a
    program or directory.  To do this, simply press the F6 key.

    The commands specified can be as simple as the commands you normally enter
    at the DOS prompt to do something.  They may be the same as a batch file
    with the exceptions noted.  Or they can be more complex, using variables and
    functions.  They may even set variables.  At first, you probably will start
    off simple.  Later, you can read the advance section to learn about
    variables and functions.


    Switching Selection Format
    ==========================

    It is possible to switch between the "run a program, command or batch file"
    or "Display a new or existing menu" formats and the "Command stream" format.
    While viewing the selection update window, press the format  button to
    switch the format.
                                                                              35

    If you are currently in the "Command stream" format, then MAXimize will
    attempt to reformat the selection.  If the syntax within the commands or the
    parameters specified cannot be recreated using the other formats, then the
    format switch will fail.

    The main intent is to allow you to switch formats to the "Command stream",
    which may be needed to get the additional capabilities provided.  However,
    the tradeoff is that the "Command stream" format is slightly more complex
    and does no error checking of the commands.


    Searching for a Program or Directory
    ====================================

    When MAXimize requests a program/command/batch file or a directory
    specification, it also gives you the capability to search for it on your
    disk drives.  To do this, press the F6 key.  When this feature is available,
    the status line will show this (F6=Search).  The following shows the screen
    with the search window:

          +--------------------+ Search for program +--------------------+
          | +- Current file specification -----------------------------+ |
          | | C:\MAX\*.***                                             | |

          +--------------------------------------------------------------+


    The search window has three fields/boxes.  The top box contains the current
    file specification.  You may change this file specification and include DOS
    wild cards. MAXimize uses a special extension of .*** to search for programs
    and batch files only.

    The lower left box contains sub-directories and other drives.  You may
    select one of these to change to a new drive or directory.  The period (.)
    directory is the root directory.  The double period (..) directory is the
    prior (parent) directory.

    The lower right box contains files and programs.  You may select one of
    these when searching for a program/file.

    Be aware that the type of search (for program or directory) depends on the
    field the cursor was in when the F6 key was pressed.  The file/directory
    chosen is placed in the field where the cursor was located (except in the
    "command stream" format).
                                                                              36


    Update Menu Characteristics
    ===========================

    Menu characteristics are those items that pertain to the menu and all of its
    selections as a group.  These items are the title of the menu, the type of
    selection ID, and the password to protect the menu.  Items specific to a
    selection are not included.  Menu characteristics may not be modified for
    the hot keys menu.  To modify a menu follow these steps:

    1. Display the menu to be modified.

    2. Press Alt+E U M or the + short cut key.  The menu modification window
       will pop-up on the screen:

            +-----------------+ Menu name: SAMPLES +------------------+
            |    Title: MAXimize Samples                              |
            |                                                         |
            | Password:                                               |
            |                                                         |
            |  ID Type: (_) Alpha-numeric digit                       |
            |           ( ) First character of description            |
            |           ( ) Numeric digit(s)                          |
            |           ( ) Point and press only (no ID)              |
            |           ( ) Specify the ID letter in each description |
            +---------------------------------------------------------+
            |   < OK >    < Update Text >    < Cancel >    < Help >   |
            +---------------------------------------------------------+


      The title line of the menu modification window contains the menu name (in
      the example above it is Samples).  The window contains these fields:

       Title     is a description of the contents of the menu.  For example,
                 "Games" might be the title of a menu containing selections
                 that invoke games.  This title is displayed in the middle of
                 the menu's top border line.  If this field is blank, the menu
                 will have no title.

       Password  protects the menu and its selections.  Before the menu is
                 displayed, this password must be entered.  This protects the
                 menu and its selections from being transferred since the menu
                 must first be displayed before it can be altered.  The menu
                 file stored on disk will be encoded when password protected.
                 If this field is blank, the menu will not be protected.

                 NOTE: Do not password protect the main menu.  Instead, use the
                 "entry" password of the options or password protect selections
                 on the main menu.

       ID Type   determines the identifier shown to the left of each selection
                 and the key stroke(s) used to choose a selection.   Choose the
                 desired type:
                                                                              37

                  ID Type:       Explanation:
                  ------------   ------------------------------------------
                  First          ID is first character of selection's
                  character      description.
                  Numeric        Numeric IDs - 1 through 99
                  Alphanumeric   ID is alphanumeric - A to Z then 0 to 9.
                                 This limits menu to 36 selections.
                  Specify ID     The selection will specify which letter in
                                 the description to user (ex. X in eXit).
                  Point and      Selections have no ID.  User must move
                  Press          selection bar to item and press Enter key.

       Modify or fill in the desired fields.  Use the Tab, Shift+Tab and arrow    4.
       keys to move the cursor between and within the fields.

       Press to OK button or the Enter key to accept the modifications.  Press    5.
       the cancel button or the Esc key to cancel any changes.


    Menu Modification Exercise
    --------------------------

    Now, use a sample menu and change its title.  Then change the ID type to
    each of the five selection ID types - each time viewing the result of this
    change to the menu.  While doing this, try the keys for moving between the
    fields of the menu window.  Then add some text to the menu as described
    above.


    Adding Text to a Menu
    =====================

    You can display up to ten lines of text on a menu (not the hot keys).  This
    text will be displayed at the top of the menu, just under the title.  The
    text will be enclosed in a single line box.  You could put your company
    name, your name, A logo or an explanation of the menu in this box.  You
    could even put the title of the menu in the text box instead of in the title
    line.  An example of this feature is the SAMPFEAT menu:
                                                                              38

    Adding text to a menu is easy.  First, type the Alt+E M U keys to modify the
    menu and then press the update button.  This will display the menu text
    window.  Now type the desired text.  Then press the Esc key to return to the
    menu modification window and depress the OK button or the Enter key to
    accept the changes to the menu.

    You can create your own logo, like the one above.  On the back of the
    reference card is an ASCII character table.  The first 32 characters are
    "control" characters.  To enter these, hold the Ctrl key down and press P
    followed by the associated control character (ie. C for a heart shape).
    Characters above decimal 126 (the tilde ~ sign), must be entered by holding
    the Alt key down and pressing the number on the numeric key pad.  Thus,
    holding the Alt key down while typing 179 will result in a vertical line.
    The characters represented by number 179 to 218, are line draw characters.
    These characters can be used together to make lines, like those above.  To
    create your own logo use your imagination and experiment.


    Add a Selection / Sub-Menu
    ==========================

    The main purpose of a selection is to invoke a program/command/batch file
    and/or display a sub-menu.  If the sub-menu to be displayed is new, then it
    will be added.
                                                                              39

    You may add a selection to a menu, as long as the maximum number of
    selections has not been used.  The maximum is 99 for all menus, except those
    with alpha-numeric type ID's that allows for 36 selections.  Remember,
    selections cannot be added to the hot keys menu.  To add a selection follow
    these steps:

    1. Display the menu where the selection is to be added.

    2. If the menu has selections, move selection bar to where the selection is
       to be added.

    3. Press Alt+E A or the Insert short cut key and the "add" window will
       appear:

                +----------------+ Add Selection +-----------------+
                |                                                  |
                |  Where: (_) After highlighted selection          |
                |         ( ) Before highlighted selection         |
                |                                                  |
                | Format: (_) Run a program, command or batch file |
                |         ( ) Display a new or existing menu       |
                |         ( ) Command stream (Batch commands)      |
                |                                                  |
                +--------------------------------------------------+
                |      < OK >       < Cancel >       < Help >      |
                +--------------------------------------------------+

    4. The "add" window allows you to choose where to add a selection and the
       format of the selection.  Reply A to add after, or B to add before the
       selection highlighted by the selection bar.  Note: If the menu currently
       lacks selections, then the location is not significant and this is
       ignored.

       Next, you must choose the format of the selection.  This is a decision
       on what the selection will do:

         > Run a single program, command of batch file
         > Display a new or existing menu
         > Command stream (this is a batch file stored in the selection)

       Press R, D or C for the desired format and then press Enter to continue.

    5. A selection window based on the specified format type will be displayed.
       The description of these windows and the fields they contain were
       presented in the overview at the start of this chapter.

    6. Fill in the desired fields.  Use the Tab, Shift+Tab and arrow keys to
       move the cursor between and within the fields.

    7. When the selection is complete, press the OK button or the Enter key to
       accept the selection.  Press the cancel button or the Esc key to cancel
       the selection add.
                                                                              40

    Add a Selection Exercises
    -------------------------

    Let's add a selection at the bottom of the main menu.  Follow these steps:

    1. Display the last selection on the main menu by typing \ and then the End
       key.

    2. Type Alt+E A A D for add a selection that displays a menu after the
       current selection.  Then press the Enter key to continue.  The selection
       update window for a sub-menu will be displayed.

    3. Type a description of "Add selection exercise".

    4. Using the Tab key, position the cursor in Sub-menu.  Type a sub-menu name
       of "SAMPADD".

    5. Press the Enter key to accept the selection.

    6. The menu modification window will appear.  Type a title of "Add selection
       exercise".

    7. Press the Enter key again to accept the menu modification.

    8. A selection has been added to the main menu that displays a sub-menu.
       Choose this new selection.  The SAMPADD menu will be displayed, with no
       selections.


    Let's add another selection, this time to the SAMPADD menu just added and
    displayed above.

    1. Press the Alt+E A R keys to add a selection that runs a program, command
       or batch file.  Then press the Enter key to continue.

    2. Type a description of "Directory display".

    3. Press the Tab key to position the cursor within the program field.  Then
       type a program name of "DIR".

    4. Press Alt+A to position the cursor in the "parameters" field.  Type a
       parameter of "/P".

    5. Press the down arrow key until the cursor is in the pause toggle field.
       Now press the space bar to turn the pause toggle on.

    6. Hit the Enter key to accept the selection.

    7. You have now added a selection that will display the contents of the
       current directory (DIR /P).  After the directory is displayed, the
       computer pauses until you've pressed a key.  Try running this selection.
                                                                              41

    Update a Selection
    ==================

    All of the fields in a selection may be updated.  This allows for the
    correction or improvement of a selection added previously.  Undefined hot
    keys (those that have no description) may be defined through the update
    process.  To update a selection follow these steps:

    1. Display the menu containing the selection to be updated or display the
       hot keys by pressing the F7 key.

    2. Mark the selection(s) to be updated.  For single selections, position the
       selection bar on the selection to be updated.  For multiple selections,
       use the space bar to mark them.

    3. Press Alt+E U S or the equal (=) short cut key to update the
       selection(s).

    4. If you are updating an empty hot key (no description), then you must
       choose the format of the selection.  This is a decision on what the
       selection will do:

           > Run a single program, command of batch file
           > Display a new or existing menu
           > Command stream (this is a batch file stored in the selection)

       Press R, D or C for the desired format.

    5. One of the selection update windows will appear on your screen (depending
       on the selection format).  These selection update windows and their
       fields were covered earlier in the overview section of this chapter.
       These are the same windows used to add a selection, except the fields are
       not blank.

    6. Modify the desired fields.

    7. When the changes are complete, press the OK button or the Enter key to
       accept the selection.  To cancel the update press the Cancel button or
       the Esc key.


    Update Selection Exercise
    -------------------------

    Let's update the directory display selection added previously in the add
    selection exercise.  Follow these steps:

    1. Display the SAMPADD menu and position the selection bar on the "Directory
       display" selection.  Then type = to update the selection.

    2. Using the down arrow key, position the cursor on the parameters field and
       change "/P" to "/W"

    3. Hit the Enter key to accept the change.
                                                                              42

    4. Choose the updated selection.  You will notice that the directory display
       is now "compressed".  That is, it displays only the file names and wraps
       them across the screen.


    Copy or Transfer a Selection
    ============================

    Copying a selection results in a duplicate selection in another location.
    Transferring a selection results in the selection being moved to a new
    location. To copy/transfer a selection follow these steps:

    1. Display the menu containing the desired selection or display the hot keys
       by pressing the F7 key.

    2. Mark the selection(s) to be copied or transferred.  For a single
       selection, position the selection bar on the desired selection.  To copy
       or transfer multiple selections, use the space bar to mark them.  Note,
       only one selection can be copied or transferred to the hot keys at a
       time.

    3. To copy a selection press Alt+E C  or the Ctrl+Insert short cut key.  To
       transfer a selection press Alt+E T or the Ctrl+Delete short cut key.

    4. You must now locate where the selection(s) is to be copied or
       transferred. While in this "find" mode, "Copy:" or "Transfer:" will
       appear in the lower left corner of the screen.  You may choose only those
       selections that display sub-menus.  Also, you should use the normal
       navigation keys (\, Esc, F7) to move between menus.  To abort the copy or
       transfer, press the F9 key.

    5. Once the menu to receive the selections has been displayed, place the
       selection bar where the selection(s) should be inserted or on the
       selection to be replaced.  Note, if the menu currently lacks selections,
       then there is no need to position the selection bar.

    6. Press slash (/) to continue.

    7. If the menu already had selections, you may choose to insert the
       selection before or after the current selection or to replace it.  NOTE:
       When copying or transferring to the hot keys, you are forced to select
       "replace", since selections cannot be inserted into them.

    8. If you choose to replace a selection that displays a sub-menu, you will
       then have to choose whether to delete this sub-menu.


    Copy/Transfer a Selection Exercises
    -----------------------------------

    Copy the first selection from the main menu to the SAMPADD menu (added
    previously in add selection exercise).  Follow these steps:

    1. Display the first selection on the main menu by typing \ and then the
       Home key.  Press Alt+E C to copy this selection.
                                                                              43

    2. Choose "Add selection exercise" to display the SAMPADD menu.

    3. Type /B to copy the selection before the first selection on the SAMPADD
       menu.


    Follow these steps to copy from the hot keys menu to the SAMPADD menu:

    1. Display the hot keys menu by pressing F7.  Position the selection bar on
       the hot key to be copied (for example, Ctrl+A).  Press the sort cut key
       Ctrl+Insert to copy the selection.

    2. Display the SAMPADD menu by typing \ and then choosing "Add selection
       exercise".

    3. Position the selection bar on the first selection (copied previously from
       the main menu).  Then press /R to replace the first selection with the
       hot key being copied.

    4. The selection being replaced may display a sub-menu.  If so, you will
       need to select "No" so this sub-menu is not deleted.


    Transfer first selection from the SAMPADD menu to a hot key.  Follow these
    steps:

    1. The selection bar should be positioned on the first selection of the
       SAMPADD menu.  Press the Alt+E T keys to transfer this selection.

    2. Press F7 to display the hot keys menu.  Then position the selection bar
       on the hot key to be replaced (for example, Ctrl+Z).  The hot key chosen
       should not have a description (for this exercise).

    3. Type /R to replace the hot key with the selection being transferred.
       Note: selection has been moved from the SAMPADD menu to the hot key.


    Delete a Selection / Sub-Menu
    =============================

    Deleting a selection removes it from the menu.  Deleting a hot key causes
    the selection to be cleared but not removed.  When the selection displays a
    sub-menu, you may choose to delete the sub-menu.  To delete, follow these
    steps:

    1. Display the menu containing the selection to be deleted or display the
       hot keys by pressing the F7 key.

    2. Mark the selections to be deleted.  To mark a single selection, position
       the selection bar on it.  Use the space bar to mark multiple selections
       to be deleted.

    3. To delete the selection press Alt+E D or the Delete short cut key.  Then
       depress the Delete button to confirm the deletion.
                                                                              44

    4. If the selection(s) displays a sub-menu, then you will be asked if the
       sub-menu should be deleted.  Respond "Yes" to delete and "No" to leave
       the sub-menu.  Press the Esc key to abort the delete operation.

      CAUTION: If you choose to delete the sub-menu, be sure that no other
      selection also displays this sub-menu!  Also, sub-menus below the sub-menu
      being deleted are not deleted and will become orphans if no remaining
      selections display them.  If you delete only the selection, the sub-menu
      will become an orphan should no other selection display it.

      NOTE: An orphan menu is not displayed by any selection.


    Delete Selection/Menu Exercises
    -------------------------------

    Let's delete a selection on the SAMPADD menu (added previously in add
    selection section).  Follow these steps:

    1. Display the SAMPADD menu by typing \ to return to the main menu and then
       choose "Add selection exercise".

    2. Position the selection bar on the first selection and press the Delete
       key to delete the selection.

    3. Confirm the deletion by pressing Enter.


    To delete the selection on the main menu that displays the SAMPADD menu,
    follow these steps:

    1. Display the main menu by pressing \.

    2. Position the selection bar on "Add selection exercise" and press Alt+E D
       to delete this selection.

    3. Confirm the deletion by pressing Enter.

    4. Press Enter to confirm deletion of the SAMPADD menu.


    Defining Help for a Selection
    =============================

    When adding/updating a selection or hot key, you may define both a help
    message and text for that selection.  To see the help, position the
    selection bar on the selection.  The help message will appear in the
    bottom/left border of the window.  The help text can then be displayed by
    pressing the F1 key.

    To define help for a selection, either during the add or update operations,
    depress the Update Help button (press Alt+U).  The define help window will
    appear:
                                                                              45


      +--------------------+ Define help for selection +---------------------+
      | Message: Run any program, DOS command or batch file                  |
      +--- Text: ------------------------------------------------------------+
      |This selection will prompt for a DOS command, program or              ^
      |batch file to run.  Simply enter the desired program, command         O
      |or batch file with the required parameters and press enter.           #
      |                                                                      #
      |Or enter nothing to go to the DOS prompt.                             #
      |                                                                      #
      |                                                                      #
      |                                                                      v
      +   1:  1<O###########################################################>+
      +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
      |                  < OK >                   < Help >                   |
      +----------------------------------------------------------------------+


    The first field contains the help message and the second field contains the
    help text.  Use the Tab key to move the cursor between them.  Unused lines
    and columns in the help text will not be displayed when the F1 key is
    pressed. Thus, a long single line of text will be displayed in a wide window
    with 1 line. Multiple lines of shorter text will be displayed in a thinner
    window with multiple lines.  When you are finished defining help, press the
    OK button or the Esc key to continue.


    Advanced Topics
    ===============

    This section covers the more advanced topics relating to selections.  You
    should be comfortable with modifying the menus and selections before
    attempting this section.


    Using Wild Cards in Sub-Menu Name
    =================================

    As mentioned earlier, the menu field contains the next menu to be displayed
    by a selection.  You may enter a menu name whenever adding or updating a
    selection.  The name must conform to the standard DOS file name convention
    and may be an existing, new or wild card menu name.

    A wild card menu name contains question marks (?) or asterisks (*).  The
    question mark indicates that any character can occupy that position.  For
    example, M??N will match with any menu name starting in M, ending in N and
    four characters long (like main and moon).  The asterisk indicates that any
    character can occupy that or any of the remaining positions in the menu
    name. Thus, * will return all menu names and G* will return all menu names
    starting with the letter G.

    For the "Display a new or existing menu" type of selection, the field or
    "box" that displays the existing menus will contain only those menus that
    match the wild card.  To choose an existing menu, simply Tab to this field
    and select the desired menu name.
                                                                              46

    For the "Command stream" type of selection, wild cards cause a window to
    pop-up containing existing menu names that match the wild card name.  You
    may choose a menu name by positioning the selection bar on it and pressing
    Enter. To leave this menu without choosing a menu name, press Esc.


    Wild Card Menu Exercise
    -----------------------

    Let's add a selection to the main menu as follows:

    1. Press \ and then End to position selection bar at the bottom of the main
       menu.  Then press Insert C to add a "command stream" selection after the
       current selection.  Then press Enter to continue

    2. Type a description of "Wild card menu".

    3. Type a command of "REM I really don't want a command, so use a remark".

    4. Hit Tab until the cursor is positioned in the menu field.  Type a sub-
       menu of "*" and hit Enter.

    5. A list of your menus will be displayed.  Position the selection bar on a
       menu name and hit Enter.

    6. Press Enter to accept the selection.

    7. A selection has been added that will display the sub-menu chosen in step
       number 5.

    8. Delete the "wild card menu" selection by positioning the selection bar on
       it and typing Delete.  You must confirm the deletion of the selection,
       but cancel the deletion of the sub-menu.


    Selections that Return to Prior/Main Menu
    =========================================

    You may want to code selections that return to the previous or main menu.
    While this would duplicate the Esc and \ keys, there are at least two
    reasons you might want to do this:

    1. Novice users would not have to know these key strokes - they simply
       choose the appropriate selection.

    2. You may want to run batch commands when leaving a menu.  For example, you
       may have a selection that redirects standard output of a program to a
       temporary file and then displays a sub-menu.  The sub-menu then
       manipulates the temporary file (ex. view or print it).  The sub-menu
       might have a selection to delete this temporary file and return to the
       previous menu.

       To create a selection that does this, add/update a selection and type a
       menu of:
                                                                              47

                   Menu:     Action:
                   -------   ----------------------                             ----------------------                             ----------------------
                   {Prior}   Returns to prior menu.
                   {Main}    Returns to main menu.

    For an example of each of these, see the "Return to prior menu" and "Return
    to main menu" selections in the SAMPLES menu.


    Selections that Quit
    ====================

    Besides having selections return to the main or prior menu, you may want a
    selection that quits MAXimize.  This selection would duplicate the F9 key.
    The reasons for wanting to do this are:

    1. Novice users would have a selection to quit that is very visible and that
       can be chosen like any other selection.

    2. You may want to run some commands when quitting MAXimize.  These commands
       may do some cleanup or may run (switch to) another program.

    To create a selection that quits, add or update a selection using the
    "command stream" format.  If you updated a selection that doesn't use this
    format, then press Format button to switch to this format.  Then Tab to the
    Quit toggle and press the space bar to turn the toggle on.  Finally, press
    Enter to accept the selection.  An example would be the "Quit MAXimize"
    selection on the SAMPLES menu.


    Parameters and Prompt
    =====================

    When a program is invoked, it may need additional information.  The program
    may request this once it has started or may require that you provide this
    information as parameters.  An example of the latter is the view program
    distributed with MAXimize.  This program requires one parameter, which is
    the file to view.  For example, entering VIEW C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT at the DOS
    prompt will view the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

    MAXimize allows you to enter these parameters as part of a selection.  Also,
    MAXimize provides a prompt field that indicates that the parameters may be
    entered or modified by the person choosing the selection.   The "parameters"
    and "prompt" fields work together.  If you specify just parameters, then
    they are passed to the program.  If you specify just a prompt, then MAXimize
    will request that the user type these parameters.  The message used to
    request these parameters is the text supplied in the prompt field.  If you
    specify both, then MAXimize will allow the user to modify the parameters
    specified.  The text in the prompt field is the message indicating the
    parameters may be modified.

    If you are using the "run a program, command or batch file" format, then the
    program, command or batch file is invoked with the parameters as entered.
    For example, if the program is "VIEW" and the parameters are
    "C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT", then MAXimize will run "VIEW C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT".
                                                                              48

    If you are using the "command stream" format, then all parameters are placed
    in variable %# and the first through tenth parameters are placed in
    variables %0 through %9.  These variables can then be used in the batch
    commands.

    For an example, display the SAMPLES menu and choose the "Input prompts menu"
    selection.  Then examine the first selection in the menu displayed.

    Input Prompt Exercise
    ---------------------

    For example, add a selection as follows:

    1. Display the main menu by typing backslash (\).  Position selection bar at
       the bottom by pressing End.  Then press Insert to add a selection and
       Enter to continue.

    2. Type a description of "Prompt exercise".

    3. Enter a program of "CHKDSK"

    4. For parameters, use "C:".

    5. Enter a prompt of "Enter the drive to check".

    6. Press Enter to accept the selection.

    7. Choose the selection.  You will be requested for the drive to check.
       Press Enter to accept the default of C: or type a different drive and
       press Enter. The drive will then be checked by the CHKDSK program.

    8. Delete the "Prompt exercise" selection by positioning the selection bar
       on it and pressing the Delete key.


    The Shell Toggle
    ================

    When adding or updating a selection you may choose to turn on the "shell"
    toggle.  When the shell toggle is off, MAXimize will completely clear itself
    from memory before running your program, commands or batch file.  This gives
    the maximum amount of memory to your application (program, commands, etc).

    When the shell toggle is on, MAXimize will not clear itself from memory.
    This option is slightly faster but does use about 100k of memory.  If there
    is not enough memory, DOS will display message "Program too big to fit in
    memory". You should then toggle the shell off.  If you still get the
    message, your computer does not have enough memory or some application(s)
    (normally TSR type programs) is using too much memory.

    To see the difference in speed, create a selection with a description of
    "more memory" and a program of "CD".  Then create another selection with a
    description of "faster", a program of "CD" and toggle the shell on.  Now
    pick each selection and compare the difference in speed.  When done, delete
    both selections.
                                                                              49


    Copy or Transfer a Sub-Menu
    ===========================

    The copying (duplicating) of entire menus is accomplished through the DOS
    copy command.  The file name for a menu is the menu name and the extension
    is .MNU.  The file name for the hot keys is MAXIMIZE.KYS.  You may copy
    these files to other computers to distribute your menus and hot keys.  Also,
    an entire menu can be duplicated by copying the menu's file to the new
    (duplicated) file. For instance, assuming the current directory contains
    menus, the DOS copy command COPY EXISTING.MNU DUPLICAT.MNU will create a
    duplicate of the "existing" menu and call it "duplicat".  You can then add a
    selection and specify "duplicat" as the sub-menu.  To transfer a menu to
    another location within the menu system, simply transfer the selection that
    displays that sub-menu.
                                                                              50

    Chapter 3: Commands, Variables and Functions
    ============================================

    Overview
    ========

    This chapter covers the commands, variables and functions used within
    MAXimize.  Including how these provide powerful extensions to the commands
    specified for a selection.  These commands can only be used in a selection
    with the "Command stream" format which was explained in the prior chapter.
    Before reading on, you should be familiar with this type of selection and
    with coding DOS batch files.


    Commands
    ========

    The commands specified within the Batch commands field can be as simple as
    the commands you normally enter at the DOS prompt.  For example, to invoke a
    program you might change the drive and directory, and then run the program.
    The batch commands would look similar to these:

             C:
             CHDIR   \WORDPERF
             WP.EXE

    The commands may also be the same as that coded in a batch file with two
    exceptions:  the SHIFT command will not work and %0 contains the first
    parameter (instead of %1).  Also, batch files executed from within the
    commands must include the .BAT extension, be preceded by a tilde (~) sign or
    be called using the CALL DOS command.  The commands specified will be placed
    into a batch file and then executed.  The parameters passed to the commands
    (variables %0 to %9) will be set to the value in the Parameters field or
    those prompted for by this selection.

    Finally, a selection can be very powerful by enhancing the commands with the
    variables and functions provided by MAXimize.  Even the variables can be set
    within MAXimize.  When using variables and functions, it is important to
    understand how MAXimize will process the commands.  The commands are
    processed in two passes as follows:

       1.  Compile the commands.  During this process, MAXimize will resolve all
           functions and variable references (except environment variables).
           This includes references to the parameters.  It also removes remarks
           and adds code for batch files that are invoked.  Be sure that batch
           files in the commands are preceded by a tilde (~) sign (without this,
           MAXimize may not re-invoke itself).  The resulting commands are then
           written to a batch file.

       2.  DOS executes compiled commands.  If after the compile there are
           commands for DOS to run, MAXimize will pass them to DOS in the batch
           file produced by the compile process.  DOS will then execute the
           batch file.

    Thus, the DOS commands are not processed by MAXimize, but by DOS.  For
    example, the DOS command GOTO is not processed by MAXimize, however the
                                                                              51

    &GOTO function is.  The result is that DOS executes the GOTO command and
    MAXimize executes the &GOTO function.  This allows you to direct the compile
    by MAXimize separately from the execute of commands by DOS.

    The following sections describe what are variables and functions, and how to
    use them.  In general, you can use them to enhance your commands to do such
    things as:

      >multiple prompts to user for information
      >prompt user to select an item from a list
      >conditionally execute prompts based on prior input
      >prompt for files, directories and drives
      >conditional inclusion/exclusion of DOS commands based on user input
      >get current date, time, directory, drive, user ID and DOS version
       through special variables
      >retain user input across selections through global variables
      >get parts of a file, directory or drive - like the extension
      >type keys for MAXimize, as if user typed them - to create a keyboard
       macro.


    Variables
    =========

    Variables make it possible to pass information:

      > within a selection
      > between selections (even when these selections are on different menus)
      > from one execution of a selection to another execution of the same
        selection.

    They are also used to provide information, such as the current directory, to
    a selection/menu.  When a variable is referenced (not set), the value the
    variable holds will replace the variable.  Thus, if variable %# has been set
    to "/W" and your command line is "DIR %#", the result would be "DIR /W".
    Variables may be referenced in all the fields of a selection or menu, except
    password, track by, program and directory.

    The four types of variables are special, input, environment, and global.
    After reading about each type of variable, please choose the example
    selections.  Then update these selections and inspect how the variables are
    used.  These examples should help with questions you might have.


    Special Variables
    =================

    Special variables contain information that can be used in your selection or
    menu title.  For example, your selection may need to know what the current
    drive and directory is.  Special variables are replaced with the appropriate
    information and cannot be set to a value.  The following are the special
    variables and the information they contain:
                                                                              52

       Variable:   Description:
       ---------   -------------------------------------------------------
       &DATE&      Current date as MM-DD-YYYY.
       &DATEM&     Current date as DDMMMYY.
       &DATED&     Current date as DD-MM-YYYY.
       &DATEY&     Current date as YYYY-MM-DD.
       &TIME&      Current time as HH:MM:SS.
       &DRIVE&     Current drive letter.
       &DIR&       Current directory.
       &DIR?&      Current directory for drive ? (? is A to Z).
       &VER&       DOS version number (ex. 3.30).
       &MAXDRIVE&  Drive MAXimize was installed in (ex. C:)
       &MAXDIR&    Directory MAXimize was installed in (ex. \MAX)
       &ID&        Current user identification for person using MAXimize.

    When a special variable is used, MAXimize will replace it with the
    information it contains as listed above.  For example, the batch commands
    can easily check the current drive and not allow it to be formated if it is
    the C: drive as follows:

           IF &DRIVE& == C GOTO NOFORMAT
             FORMAT
           GOTO ENDIF
           :NOFORMAT
             ECHO Cannot format C: drive
           :ENDIF

    The SAMPLES menu provides good examples of these in the following
    selections: "Edit file", "Display information" and "DOS version".  The first
    of these is a more pratical application of special variables.  Also, see the
    "Add event" selection on the "Log ents menu" for a pratical application of
    special variables.


    Input Variables
    ===============

    Input variables pass information within a selection.  They are normally used
    in the command section of a selection ("command stream" format), to obtain
    the parameters.  Thus, the selection may prompt for parameters and the
    commands can operate on these parameters by using the input variables.  In
    this respect, they are similar to variables in a batch file.  They retain
    their value only while the selection is executing.  Once the selection is
    finished, the input variables are cleared.

    Input variables start with a percent (%) sign followed by the pound (#) sign
    or the numbers 0 through 9 (%# or %0 to %9..  Each time %# is set, %0 to %9
    are set to the first through tenth parameters of %# (where parameters are
    separated by blanks).  Thus, if %# is set to "my  file", %0 will be "my", %1
    will be "file", and %2 through %9 will be null.  Each time a selection is
    chosen, %# is set to the text in the "parameters" field.  Then, if there is
    a prompt, %# is set to the parameters typed at the prompt.

    The commands in the selection can then obtain all the parameters by
    referring to variable %#.  The commands may obtain the first through tenth
    parameters by using variables %0 to %9.
                                                                              53


    The selection may also set the %# variable and then act on the individual
    parameters using variables %0 through %9.  Input variables may be set in the
    commands field only.  To do this, enter the variable as the first thing on a
    line and follow it immediately (no intervening blanks) by an equal sign.
    The variable will be assigned the value to the right of the equal sign.  For
    example, "%2= DIR /W", will result in variable %2 being set to the value "
    DIR /W".  Variables may be set to other variables.  For instance, if %1=DIR
    and %0=/W, then "%2=%1 %0" will result in %2 being set to "DIR /W".

    For example, the following batch commands prompts for a file name and
    assigns it to input variable %1.  It then prompts for text to search for in
    the file and assigns this to input variable %0.  Then the DOS FIND command
    is used to search the file.

         %1=&File[Enter file to search through:|C:\*.*|Old]
         %0=&Prompt[Enter text to search for:||64||Required]
         FIND "%0" %1 | MORE

    For more examples on how to use the input variables see the "Alter DOS PATH"
    and "Dynamic PATHing example" selections.


    Environment Variables
    =====================

    Environment variables are provided by DOS.  They are used to pass
    information to DOS or programs.  For example, the PATH environment variable
    contains directories DOS should search when it is looking for a program that
    hasn't been qualified.  Environment variables are handy since they can be
    set outside MAXimize (like in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file) and will not be lost
    when MAXimize quits.  They retain their values until your computer is turned
    off.  In MAXimize, you can use environment variables to pass information to
    programs, DOS or other selections within MAXimize.

    To obtain the contents of an environment variable, enclose the variable in
    percent (%) signs.  For example, %PATH% is the DOS PATH variable and will be
    replaced with the directories in the PATH.

    Use the DOS SET command within the commands field to set environment
    variables.  For example, SET PATH=C:\;%PATH%, will add the "C:\" directory
    to the front of your path.  However, if your selection has the Shell toggle
    on, any environment variables set in the commands field will last only for
    the duration of that selection.  This can be very useful at times and
    confusing at other times.

    An example of how to use environment variables follows.  In this example,
    the DOS PATH is saved in input variable %1 and then changed to include the
    directory that MYPROG is in.  Then the program is executed and finally the
    PATH is restored to its original value:

           %1=PATH
           SET PATH=C:\MYDIR;%PATH%
           MYPROG
           SET PATH=%1
                                                                              54

    For an excellent example of how to use environment variables, review the
    "Alter DOS PATH" selection on the SAMPLES menu.


    Global Variables
    ================

    Global variables retain their values until you quit MAXimize.  They are used
    to pass information between selections or between multiple executions of a
    selection.  A good example of this is the "Display directory menu" selection
    on the SAMPLES menu and the selections on the sub-menu it displays.  A
    global variable (&0) is used to hold the directory to be displayed.  One
    selection on the sub-menu allows the user to modify this directory, changing
    the contents of this global variable.  Then the global variable is used in
    the menu title and the selections that display the directory contents.

    Global variables start with an ampersand (&) sign followed by the numbers 0
    through 9 (&0 to &9).  Global variables may be set in the commands field
    only. To do this, enter the variable as the first thing on a line and follow
    it immediately (no intervening blanks) by an equal sign.  The variable will
    be assigned the value to the right of the equal sign.  For example, "&0= DIR
    /W", will result in variable &0 being set to the value " DIR /W".  Also,
    variables may be set to other variables.  For instance, if %1=DIR and %0=/W,
    then "&2=%1 %0" will result in &2 being set to "DIR /W".

    See the "Display directory menu" selection on the SAMPLES menu and the
    selections on the sub-menu it displays.  This selection and the selections
    on the sub-menu displayed, use &0 to hold the directory being displayed.


    Using and Setting Variables in Commands
    =======================================

    The filling in and setting of non-environment variables in the batch
    commands is done prior to the execution of the commands.  That is, when the
    commands are compiled by MAXimize.  If a line sets a variable, this line
    will not be in the commands later executed by DOS.  The processing of
    variables is done starting with the first line proceeding till the last line
    of the batch commands.  Once the variables in the commands have been
    evaluated, the commands are passed to DOS in a batch file to be executed.
    For example, suppose you had the following commands:

           &0=%PATH%
           SET PATH=C:\NEWPATH;%PATH%
           %1=%PATH%
           MYPROG
           PATH=&0

    The result of these commands is:

       &0=%PATH%                   sets &0 to the path prior to the commands
                                   being ran.

      SET PATH=C:\NEWPATH;%PATH%   adds C:\NEWPATH to the front of current path.
                                                                              55

      &1=%PATH%                    sets &1 to the path prior to the commands
                                   being ran.  Thus, &1 contains the same path
                                   as &0.

      MYPROG                       runs the program by this name.  It is assumed
                                   in this example that MYPROG can be found in
                                   C:\NEWPATH.

      PATH=&0                      resets the path to its setting prior to the
                                   commands being ran.

    This example clearly shows that variables are filled in prior to the batch
    commands execution (ie, &1 is the same as &0).


    Functions
    =========

    Functions provide very powerful extensions to the commands a selection can
    execute.  In general they provide for powerful input prompting and
    conditional execution of prompts and commands.  The use of these functions
    allows a selection to do much more than is possible in a DOS batch file.

    Functions are like variables in that they are replaced with a returned
    value.  Functions differ in that they are passed parameters to operate on.
    The parameters are enclosed in square brackets ([]) and are separated by the
    pipe (|) symbol.  Functions also differ from variables in that they can be
    used only in the "Commands" field of a selection ("Command Stream" format).
    Like variables, functions can be used multiple times in a selection and all
    function evaluation is done prior to the commands being executed.  That is,
    while MAXimize is compiling the commands.  Pressing the Esc key or cancel
    button in response to a function prompt aborts the selection.

    While function parameters are not required, the square brackets are.  Each
    function has default settings for parameters that are not present and any
    extra parameters are ignored.  Also, variables and functions may be used as
    parameters for a function.   In this case, the value of the variable or the
    value returned by the function will be filled in when the function is
    evaluated.  Finally, if a function's parameter contains either of the square
    brackets ([]), then they must be paired together while the pipe symbol (|)
    cannot be part of any function parameter.


    Prompt Function
    ===============

    The prompt function is used to prompt the user for general information
    (text).  Other functions can be used to specifically prompt for a drive,
    directory, file name or an item in a list.  This function will allow for any
    text to be entered.  For example, the selection can prompt for the
    parameters to pass a program.  The prompt function displays the prompt
    window with a title and default text.  The user may then enter or modify the
    text.  The function returns the text typed in response to the prompt.  The
    syntax of the prompt function is:

      &PROMPT[title|text|length|valid characters|required]
                                                                              56


    Where the "title" is the title to put in the prompt window, "text" is the
    default text, "length" is the maximum length for input text, "valid
    characters" are the valid characters that can be used in the input text and
    "required" indicates if null text is not allowed.  If a title is no
    specified, then the window will have no title.  If no text is given, then
    the window will have no default text.   The other parameters default to a
    length of 249, all characters are valid and text is not required (entering
    nothing at the prompt is valid).  If is recommended that the prompt function
    be given a meaningful title to indicate what information should be entered.
    For example:

    &PROMPT[Enter a directory:|C:\]
    &PROMPT[Enter a file name:||64|abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789.\:|Req]

    The first example will prompt for a directory with C:\ being the default.
    The second example prompts for a file name with no default text, a maximum
    length of 64, valid keys are alpha-numeric plus the period, colon and
    backslash symbols.  A null entry is not allowed in the second example.

    A good example of the prompt function can be found by displaying the SAMPLES
    menu and then examining  the "Date change" selection to see how it uses the
    prompt function.  The commands within this selection is as follows:

    DATE &Prompt[Enter new date (format=MM-DD-CCYY):|&DATE&|10|1234567890-|Req]

    The above command prompts for a new date, using the &DATE& special variable
    to provide the current date as the default.  The maximum length is 10
    characters, valid characters are numeric and the dash, and the date is
    required input.  The date entered then replaces the prompt function and
    finally the DATE command is executed by DOS.


    Menu Function
    =============

    The menu function gives the user a list of items to choose from.  It should
    be used instead of the prompt function, when there is a small list of items
    that may be chosen from.  Choosing from a list will be easier for the user
    and prevents typing errors.  For example, a selection can use the menu
    function to have the user choose an action to perform, such as view or
    print, from a list.  The menu function displays a menu with a title and from
    one to 26 items.  The user may then choose an item.  The function returns
    either the item or its identifier.  The syntax of the menu function is:

      &MENU[title|type|item1|item2|.........|item26]

    The "title" is the title to put on the menu.  The type is a one or three
    character long type code.  The first character indicates the type of
    selection ID to use:

          ID:  Explanation:
          ---  -------------------------------------------------
          F    first letter of each item
          N    numeric IDs
          A    alphanumeric IDs
                                                                              57

          P    point and press (no IDs)
          S    first letter of each item is not shown, but is
               used to determine the letter to highlight in the
               item.  This is case sensitive.  Example: XeXit
               will display as eXit.

    Follow the first character with "ID" if this function should return only the
    ID selected.  For numeric IDs, "2" will be returned when the second item is
    chosen. For alpha-numeric, "B" will be returned when the second item is
    chosen.  Without "ID", the menu function returns the actual item selected.

    The type parameter should be followed by the items to choose from separated
    by the pipe symbol.  There are two special items that cause the selection to
    be aborted when chosen.  These special items are "Esc" and "No/Esc".  When
    these items are selected, MAXimize aborts the selection.

    If there is no title, then the menu window will have no title.  If there is
    no type, then it is set to "F".  If there are no selections present, then
    "Yes|No/Esc" is assumed.  Here are some examples:

       &MENU[Enter drive:|F|A:|B:|C:]
       &MENU[Choose a file:|AID|C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT|C:\CONFIG.SYS]
       &MENU[Delete the file?]

    The first example prompts for a drive.  The user may then select from the
    list of A:, B: or C:.  The first letter of each item is highlighted.  The
    function returns the complete drive (ex. C:).

    The second example prompts the user to choose one of two files.  Alpha-
    numeric IDs will be used to the left of each file name.  When the user
    selects an item, the ID (either A or B) is returned.

    The third example prompts the user whether to delete a file.  The defaults
    are taken, so the items are "Yes" and "No/Esc".  The first letter of each
    item is highlighted.  The function will return "Yes" if that is selected.
    If the user selects "No/Esc", the selection is aborted.

    Another example would be to allow the user to choose wether to edit, view or
    print a file using the following command:

    &MENU[Choose function:|F|View|Edit|Print] &File[Enter File|C:\*.*|Old]


    A good example of the menu function can be found by first displaying the
    SAMPLES menu.  Examine the "Documentation"  selection to see how it uses the
    menu function.
                                                                              58

    Drive Function
    ==============

    The drive function is used to prompt the user for a disk drive.  It should
    be used instead of the prompt or menu functions when prompting for a drive.
    The drive function is almost identical to the menu function, except that
    invalid drives are removed from the list.  For example, the selection can
    prompt the user to select a floppy drive.   The function returns the drive
    selected.  The syntax of the drive function is:

      &DRIVE[title|type|drive1|drive2|.........|drive26]

    Where "title" and "type" are as explained under the menu function.  The
    remaining parameters are the drives to select from.  You should specify the
    default drive as the first drive in the list.  Any drives which are not
    valid for the computer MAXimize is running on will be removed from the list.
    If only one drive remains in the list, it will be returned as if the user
    selected it without user interaction.  If no drives remain in the list, then
    an error message will be displayed.  Here are some examples:

      &DRIVE[Enter a floppy drive:|FID|A:|B:]
      &DRIVE[Enter drive to check:|F|C:|D:|A:|B:]

    The first example will prompt for only floppy drives and returns either "A"
    or "B" depending on the drive chosen.  The second will prompt the user with
    a list of up to four drives (D: and C: may not be valid) to check and
    returns the drive letter chosen including the colon.  A good example of the
    drive function can be found by displaying the SAMPLES menu and then
    examining  the "Check disk drive" selection to see how it uses the drive
    function.  The commands used are:

         CHKDSK &Drive[Enter drive to check:|F|C:|D:|E:|F:||A:|B:]
         PAUSE

    In the above example the user will be able to select a drive from the list
    presented (C:, D:, E:, F:,A: and B:) excluding those that are not valid.
    The drive selected by the user replaces the drive function and then DOS
    executes the CHKDSK and PAUSE commands.


    Dir Function
    ============

    The dir(ectory) function is used to prompt the user for a directory.  It can
    be used instead of the prompt function when prompting for a directory.  The
    directory entered must be valid and you can ensure that the directory exists
    or is new.  For example, the selection can prompt the user to enter an
    existing directory and then display the files in that directory.   The
    function returns the directory entered, including the drive.  The syntax of
    the directory function is:

      &DIR[title|filespec|type]

    Where "title" is the title for the file/directory input window and
    "filespec" is the initial file specification.  If no title is specified,
    then the window will not have a title.  The default file specification is
                                                                              59

    "*.***", which displays all executable files in the current directory.  The
    "type" parameter indicates the type of directory that must be entered:

            Type:        Explanation:
            ---------    -----------------------------------
            Old          Directory entered must exist
            New          DIrectory entered must be new
            Reuse        If directory entered exists, prompt
                         user to ensure it can be reused.
            Either       Directory can exist or be new

    The default type is Either.  Also, if you add a backslash to the end of the
    type parameter (eq. Old\), then the directory returned will always have a
    backslash at the end.  Otherwise, the root directory will have a backslash
    at the end and all other directories will not.  Therefore, when using the
    directory function to get a directory to be used with the change directory
    command (CHDIR), do not use the backslash on type.  However, if a file name
    will be appended to the end of the directory, use the backslash at the end
    of the type parameter.

    Here are some examples:

      &DIR[Enter directory to print file listing for:|C:\*.*|Old\]
      &DIR[Enter directory to create:|C:\*.*|New]

    The first example will prompt for an old directory.  The file/directory
    window will initially display files in the root of the C drive.  The
    directory entered will be returned with a backslash at the end.  The second
    example prompts for a new directory to create, using a file specification of
    C:\*.*.  The directory entered will be returned without the backslash for
    the make directory command (MKDIR).

    One last example is a selection that prints a file listing for any
    directory.  The command is as follows:

      DIR &DIR[Enter directory to print file listing for:|C:\*.*|OLD\] > PRN


    File Function
    =============

    The file function is used to prompt the user for a file.  It can be used
    instead of the prompt function when prompting for a file.  The file entered
    must be valid and you can ensure that the file exists or is new.  For
    example, the selection can prompt the user to enter an existing file to
    view.   The function returns the file entered, including the drive and
    directory.  The syntax of the file function is:

      &FILE[title|filespec|type]

    Where "title" is the title for the file/directory input window and
    "filespec" is the initial file specification.  If no title is specified,
    then the window will not have a title.  The default file specification is
    "*.***", which displays all executable files in the current directory.  The
    "type" parameter indicates the type of file that must be entered:
                                                                              60

          Type:      Explanation:
          --------   --------------------------------
          Old        File entered must exist
          New        File entered must be new
          Reuse      If file entered exists, prompt
                     user to ensure it can be reused.
          Either     File can exist or be new

    The default type is Either.  Here are some examples:

      &FILE[Enter file to edit:|C:\*.*|Old]
      &FILE[Enter file to copy to:|C:\*.*|Reuse]

    The first example will prompt for an old file.  The file/directory window
    will initially display files in the root of the C drive.  The second example
    prompts for an output file, using a file specification of C:\*.*.  If the
    file entered exists, then the user will be prompted to ensure it can be
    reused.  A good example of the file function can be found by displaying the
    SAMPLES menu and then examining the "View a file" selection.  This selection
    uses the following command:

      VIEW &FILE[Enter file to view:|C:\*.*\Old]


    Part Function
    =============

    The part function is used to return a portion of a file or directory, such
    as the drive.  It is often used to extract a portion of the result of a file
    or directory function.  These parts can then be used as part of the process
    or for verification.  For example, you can extract the file's extension and
    ensure that it is "DOC".  The syntax of the part function is:

      &PART[file/directory|part]

    Where "file/directory" is the file or directory to extract from.  This
    parameter is generally specified as either a function or variable that
    contains the results of the file or directory function.  The "part"
    parameter is the portion to extract.  Part defaults to "F" and may be one of
    the following:

             Part:                 :                 :   Explanation:
             -----   ---------------------------------------
             R       Drive with colon (C:)
             D       Directory (\MAX)
             D\      Directory with backslash at end (\MAX\)
             F       File (MAX.EXE)
             N       Name (MAX)
             E       Extension with period (.EXE)

    The above list includes the results of the part function in parenthesis for
    a file of C:\MAX\MAX.EXE

    The part function will return a null string (nothing) if the file/directory
    does not contain the requested part.  Also, the function assumes that the
    file/directory is valid.  Here is an example:
                                                                              61


      &1=&FILE[Enter file to edit:|C:\*.*|Old]
      %1=&PART[&1:F]

    The example will prompt for an old file and place the results in the &1
    variable.  Then the part function is used to extract the file from the
    results of the file function and place it in the %1 variable.  The selection
    could then  process the variables.  A good example of the part function can
    be found by displaying the SAMPLES menu and then examining the "Display a
    menu" selection.


    If Function
    ===========

    The if function allows for the conditional inclusion of commands, functions
    or text.  This function compares two strings with the specified operator and
    returns one of two strings based on whether the condition is true.  The
    string returned is often another function.  The if function is used most
    often in combination with the GoTo function described in the next section to
    conditionally execute other functions based on some prior input.  The syntax
    of the if function is:

      &IF[string1|operator|string2|then|else]

    Where if compares "string1" to "string2" using the "operator".  If the
    condition is true, "then" is returned.   Otherwise, "else" is returned for
    the if function.  The operator may consist of the equal (=), less than (<)
    or greater than (>) signs.  You may also combine these signs to specify not
    equal (<>), less than or equal (<=) and greater than or equal (>=).   The
    defaults for the strings compared (string1/string2) and those returned
    (then/else) are null strings.  The default operator is equal.

    The if function is deceptively powerful, especially when combined with the
    other functions (like GoTo).  Perhaps the most powerful way to use this
    function is to test input from a prior prompt and to conditionally execute
    additional prompts based on the prior prompt.  Here is an example of the if
    function:

      &1=&FILE[Enter file to edit:|C:\*.*|Old]
      %1=&PART[&1:E]
      IF[%1|<>|.DOC|&ABORT[Extension not DOC - selection aborted]]
      EDIT &1

    The example will prompt for an old file and place the results in the &1
    variable.  Then the part function is used to extract the extension from the
    results of the file function and place it in the %1 variable.  Finally, the
    selection ensures that the file's extension is DOC.  If the file extension
    is incorrect, the selection is aborted.  A good example of the if function
    can be found by displaying the SAMPLES menu and then examining the "Set any
    environment variable" selection.
                                                                              62

    GoTo Function
    =============

    The GoTo function returns a null string and then skips command lines.  This
    function is usually used with the if function to conditionally execute
    commands or functions.  The syntax of the GoTo function is:

      &GOTO[label]

    Where "label" is the label to branch to.  This label should be a standard
    batch file label and must follow the line the GoTo function is coded on.
    The label specified in the GoTo function does not have to be preceded by a
    colon.   However,  the label being branched to must be preceded by a colon
    and be the only item on the line.

    The GoTo function not only skips lines, but actually deletes the lines
    following the line GoTo is on, through (and including) the line containing
    the label branched to.

    Here is an example of the GoTo function:

      &1=&FILE[Enter file to edit or view:|C:\*.*|Old]
      %1=&PART[&1:E]
      IF[%1|=|.DOC|&GOTO[EDIT]]
       VIEW &1
       &GOTO[ENDIF]
      :EDIT
       EDIT &1
      :ENDIF

    The example will prompt for an old file and place the results in the &1
    variable.  Then the part function is used to extract the extension from the
    results of the file function and place it in the %1 variable.  Finally, if
    the extension is DOC the file is edited. otherwise the file is viewed.  A
    good example of the if function can be found by displaying the SAMPLES menu
    and then examining the "Execute a DOS command" selection.


    Abort Function
    ==============

    The abort function terminates the execution of a selection.  This function
    is usually used with the if function to conditionally abort a selection when
    an error condition occurs.  The syntax of the abort function is:

      &ABORT[text]

    Where "text" is the text of the error message to display.  If "text" is not
    included, then no error message is displayed.  Otherwise the text is
    displayed as error number 300.  Here is an example of the abort function:

      &1=&FILE[Enter file to edit:|C:\*.*|Old]
      %1=&PART[&1:E]
      IF[%1|<>|.DOC|&ABORT[Extension must be DOC - selection aborted]]
      EDIT &1
                                                                              63

    The example will prompt for an old file and place the results in the &1
    variable.  Then the part function is used to extract the extension from the
    results of the file function and place it in the %1 variable.  Finally, the
    selection ensures that the file's extension is DOC.  If the file extension
    is incorrect, the selection is aborted.  A good example of the abort
    function can be found by displaying the SAMPLES menu and then examining the
    "Display a menu" selection.


    Key Function
    ============

    The key function is used to have a selection enter keys to MAXimize (not the
    applications invoked by MAXimize) as if they had been typed at the keyboard.
    It returns a null string after "inserting" the keys into the keyboard
    buffer.   Generally, this function is used to run one or more selections
    after the selection containing the key function has ran.  Another use is to
    create a macro by using this function in a Hot Key (this is explained in the
    appendix on Hits and Tips).  The syntax of the key function is:

      &KEY[text]

    Where "text" is the keys to be inserted into the keyboard buffer.  Text may
    contain any keystroke, however certain keystrokes require special handling
    as follows:

      1. Control codes are ASCII codes 1 through 31.  These codes are shown on
         the back of the reference card along with the corresponding control
         character.  To enter one of these keys, press Ctrl+P and then Ctrl+?
         (where ? is the corresponding control character).  For example, Ctrl+I
         is the same as the Tab key and can be entered by first pressing Ctrl+P
         and then Ctrl+I.  There is one exception in Ctrl+M.  This key should be
         entered as Ctrl+P , Ctrl+@, Ctrl+P, Ctrl+A.

      2. Extended ASCII codes  are codes 128 through 255.  These codes are also
         shown on the back of the reference card.  To enter an extended ASCII
         code, simply hold down the Alt key and type the decimal ASCII code
         number on the numeric key pad (on the right of your keyboard).  For
         example. the square root sign can be inserted by holding down the Alt
         key and typing 251 on the numeric key pad.

      3. Extended key codes are listed below and are entered by first pressing
         Ctrl+P Ctrl+@ and then holding the Alt key down while typing the
         extended key code on the numeric key pad.  The extended key codes are:

                Code:      Meaning:
                -----      -----------------------
                16-25      Alt-Q/W/E/R/T/Y/U/I/O/P
                30-38      Alt-A/S/D/F/G/H/I/J/K/L
                44-50      Alt-Z/X/C/V/B/N/M
                59-68      Keys F1-F10
                71         Home
                72         Up Arrow
                73         PgUp
                75         Left Arrow
                77         Right Arrow
                                                                              64

                79         End
                80         Down Arrow
                81         PgDn
                82         Insert
                83         Delete
                115        Ctrl+Left Arrow
                116        Ctrl+Right Arrow
                117        Ctrl+End
                118        Ctrl+PgDn
                119        Ctrl+Home

    A simple example would be &KEY[A],  which inserts the letter "A" into the
    keyboard buffer.  A good example of the key function can be found in the
    SAMPLES menu by examining the "Display a menu" function.  This selection
    uses the key function to insert two Tab keys so that the cursor is
    positioned in the file area of the dialog window for the file function.
                                                                              65

    You can then choose any of the items shown on the option menu.   Each is
    described in the following sections.


    Colors
    ======

    To change any of MAXimize's colors, follow these steps:

    1. Press C from the option drop down menu.  At the bottom of the screen, the
       "color" window will appear.  Above that will be the status line, the main
       window (that is smaller to allow for the color window) and at the top is
       the menu bar.  The screen will look like this:
                                                                              66

    2. Choose the window or status line that you want to inspect/change the
       colors of.  Use the right/left arrows to move the selection bar to the
       desired window.  As the selection bar moves between the names of the
       windows, a sample of that window is displayed.  All the selection update
       windows are grouped together and the "general" setup menus are also
       grouped together. Once the selection bar is on the desired window or
       status line, press Enter or the down arrow key.

    3. The "change colors" window will then appear at the bottom of the screen:

       The "change color" window contains the items within the chosen window
       that you can inspect/change the colors of.  It also contains a
       background and foreground color chart.  These charts show the various
       colors you may choose for the background (color behind the letters) and
       foreground (color of the letters).  Below the colors in the charts are
       the codes that correspond to that color.  Thus, "1" is a blue background
       and "O" is a yellow foreground. The background/foreground color of the
       current item will be enclosed in square brackets on the color charts.

    4. From the "change color" window, you should select the item you want to
       inspect/change the color of.  Use the right and left arrows to move the
       selection bar to the desired item.

    5. Now choose the desired colors for this item from the charts by pressing
       the color code corresponding to the desired background/foreground colors.
       For example, press "1" for a blue background and "O" for a yellow
       foreground.

    6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 above until you are satisfied with the colors of
       this window.

    7. When you are finished changing the colors for this window, press the
       Enter  or Esc keys to return to the "colors" menu.

    8. Repeat steps 2 through 7 for each window, until all windows are the
       desired colors.
                                                                              68

    9. Press the OK button (by pressing Allt+O) to accept the changes made to
       the colors.  Otherwise press the Cancel button or the Esc key to cancel
       the changes made.

      NOTE:  It is usually easier to determine the background color for a window
             first. Next change the background color of all the items for that
             window. Then change the foreground color of each item in the window
             as desired.


    Directories
    ===========

    All the directories used by MAXimize are modifiable.  To inspect or change
    them:

    1. Press D from the option drop down menu.  The directory window will pop-up
       below the option menu:

    2. Tab to the directory to be changed and modify it.  The directories are:

       Batch execution file directory contains the batch file (MAXIMIZE.BAT)
       built from a selection's commands and then executed.  This directory may
       be on a RAM or virtual disk drive to improve performance.

       NOTE: Changes to this directory take effect only when MAXimize is
       started.

       Menus & Hot keys path contains your user menus (.MNU extension) and hot
       keys (MAXIMIZE.KYS).  Multiple directories may be specified separated by
       semicolons (;).  Menus are read from the first directory they are found
       in.  A new menu is saved in the first directory and an updated menu in
       the same directory it was read from.
                                                                              69

       Setup pgm & Help file directory contains MAXimize's system files.  The
       MAXIMIZE.HLP and MAXSETUP.EXE files must be in this directory.  This
       should be the directory MAXimize was installed in.

       Usage & License DBF directory contains the usage log (MAXLOG.DBF) and
       license control (MAXCHK.DBF) files.  These are the databases used for
       usage logging and application license control (LAN version only).  Please
       review the chapter titled Controlling and Monitoring Access.

       Edit read/save files directory contains the files to export from or
       import into the text editor.  This is the default directory used when
       exporting or importing a file to/from the commands or help text.

    3. Press the OK button or the Enter key to accept the changes.  Press the
       Cancel button or the Esc key to cancel any changes made to the
       directories.


    Password Protection
    ===================

    Besides allowing menus and selections to be password protected, MAXimize
    allows for the following passwords:

    Creator    satisfies a prompt for any password.  It uniquely identifies the
               person who enters it as the installer of MAXimize.  With this
               password, any other password protection can be bypassed and
               changed.  Remember this password, it will be used later to
               determine forgotten passwords.

    Entry      protects entry into MAXimize.  It will be requested each time
               MAXimize is entered.  In this way MAXimize disallows
               unauthorized access.

    Quitting   protects leaving MAXimize.  This password must be entered each
               time an attempt is made to quit MAXimize and can be used to
               ensure that use of your computer is with MAXimize.

    Setup      protects the setup.  Whenever a slash (/) is pressed from a user
               menu or the hot keys menu, the first setup window appears.  From
               this window, you can change MAXimize's options, menus and
               selections.  This password prevents unauthorized use of these
               capabilities.  Before the first setup window is displayed, this
               password must be entered.

               NOTE: The setup password can become an irritant when doing
               massive updates to your menus and selections.  In this case, you
               should read the section title "Update Mode" in this chapter.


    Hide/Disable    Hide or disable items in the menu bar or the pull down
               menus.
                                                                              70

    Log Violation   Logs security violations.  This will allow you to determine
               if someone is trying to use facilities they are not authorized
               for.  Choosing this selection will toggle violation logging on
               (X) or off.

               NOTE: MAXLOG.EXE allows you to view this log.

    Encryption Key  encodes password protected menus and selections.  If an
               encryption keys is specified, then menus that are password
               protected (or that have password protected selections) cannot be
               used in other MAXimize systems that do not have the same
               encryption key.  If no encryption key is specified, then
               MAXimize will use the default.  In this case, other menu systems
               can bypass your password protection by entering their creator
               password.

    NOTE: Before changing the encryption key, be sure to remove all password
          protection of menus and selections.  Then change the encryption key
          and implement the password protection.

    To change any of the above passwords or the encryption key:

    1. Press S                               for security from the option drop down menu.

    2. If a creator password has been entered previously, you will be requested
       to enter it.  Thus, only the "creator" is allowed to inspect/modify
       these passwords.  The password menu will be displayed:

                              +----+ Security +------+
                              |  Creator password    |
                              |  Entry password      |
                              |  Quitting password   |
                              |  Setup password      |
                              +----------------------+
                              |  Hide/Disable        |
                              |  Log violations [ ]  |
                              |  Encryption Key      |
                              +----------------------+
                              |  < OK >    < Help >  |
                              +----------------------+


    3. Select the desired password or encryption key to change.  This will
       display the input prompt window to allow you to change/enter the
       password.  To remove a password, either delete it or set it to blanks.

       In the case of Hide/Disable,                                   ,                                   , you must enter the codes of items to hide
       or disable instead of a password.  A lower case letter indicates the
       less powerful Hide function and an upper case letter indicates the more
       powerful Disable function.  Thus, a lower case "x" will hide the "DOS
       shell" but allow the F8 short cut key to shell to DOS.  An upper case
       "X" will not only hide the "DOS shell" but disallow the F8 short cut
       key.  An item without a short cut key is disabled when hidden (ie. there
       is no difference between hide and disable).  The following table shows
       the codes to type and the associated item hidden/disabled:
                                                                              71

         P                Protect Clear item in window pull down menu

    4. When the desired passwords have been entered or changed, press the OK
       button or the Enter key to save the changes.  To cancel the changes press
       the Cancel button or the Esc key.

         All passwords can be the same.  This will have the effect of    NOTE:
         protecting with one password.



    Miscellaneous
    =============

    The remaining options are grouped together under miscellaneous.  These
    options are broken into three groups.  The first group applies to the input
    prompt window, the second group to the screen and the last group is the
    remaining options.

    To change the miscellaneous options, press M from the option drop down menu.
    This will display the miscellaneous options window below.  You may then Tab
    to a field and modify it.  When you are finished press the OK button or the
    Enter key to accept the changes.  To cancel any changes made, press the
    Cancel button or the Esc key.
                                                                              72

        +------------------------------------------------------------------+

      > Insert into or Overwrite text as key typed.  When the prompt window is
        first displayed, which mode should be used?  The valid choices are "I"
        for insert mode or "O" for overwrite mode.  Insert mode causes the key
        typed to be inserted at the cursor.  Overwrite mode causes the key
        typed to replace the character the cursor is under.

      > Clear initial text if first key is valid input?  If the first key
        entered is a valid input (non-directional) key, should default text
        within the prompt window be cleared first?  The valid choices are "Y"
        for yes or "N" for no.

      > Cursor placement at Start or End of text?  When the prompt window is
        first displayed, should the cursor be placed at the start or the end of
        the default text?  The valid choices are "S" for start of "E" for end.

      > Cascade menu windows at startup?  Should the windows for your menus be
        cascaded (yes) or be as large as possible (no) when MAXimize is first
        started?  Choosing yes results in smaller windows that overlap, while
        no results in a larger window that can display more selections.  While
        running MAXimize, you can flip between the two settings at any time by
        pressing Alt+W C or the F3 short cut key.

      > Wall paper character.  This is the decimal value from 0 to 255 of the
        character to use as wall paper.  The default is 177.  See the back of
        the reference card for an ASCII table of characters and their
        equivalent decimal values.

      > Smart shadowing of windows?  MAXimize uses "smart" shadowing.  Smart
        shadowing will shadow a window if its background and the window it
        overlays are NOT black.  If you want your windows shadowed, choose "Y"
        and use non-black backgrounds.  Choosing "N" will turn shadowing off.
                                                                              73

      > Maximum number of lines on screen?  You may specify the maximum number
        of lines you want to display on your screen.  Valid numbers are 25, 43
        and 50. Only EGA and VGA video tubes are capable of 43 lines.  The VGA
        video tube is the only one capable of 50 lines.  Regardless of the
        number you specify, MAXimize will not exceed the capability of your
        video tube.  If the number you specify is too large, MAXimize will use
        the highest line number possible for your video tube.  Thus, you can
        specify 50 for EGA video tubes, but only 43 lines will be used.

      > Show date, time and key status in status line?  Should the current
        date, time and key status (Caps lock, insert/overwrite mode, Num lock,
        Ctrl and Alt) show up in the status line?  The valid choices are "Y"
        for yes or "N" for no. If you choose "N", then additional help will be
        displayed where the status information was.  Another use of "N" is to
        keep MAXimize from constantly updating the screen's status line.  This
        can be useful with some windowing software packages, such as main frame
        3270 emulation.

      > Maximum number of menu levels allowed.  This is the number of user
        submenu levels allowed, including the main menu.  This IS NOT the
        number of total submenus allowed, but how deep the submenus can be
        cascaded (ot stacked).  If you do not plan to use the cascaded windows
        option, then specify 10.  Otherwise, this number will affect the size
        of the windows when cascading.  Therefore, be sure to specify a number
        that will provide sufficient levels of submenus and also provide the
        size of menu desired.

      > Seconds to wait before screen blanked.  This is the number of seconds
        MAXimize waits for a response before clearing the screen.  Thus, if you
        get interrupted by a phone call, the characters currently on the screen
        will not get "burnt" into the screen.  The user can press any key to
        display the screen again.  Enter 0 to deactivate this option (that is,
        screen will not be cleared at all) or enter the number of seconds
        MAXimize should wait for a response before clearing the screen.

      > Main menu name.  Type your main menu name here.  The default main menu
        name is "Main".  You may make an existing or new menu your main menu.
        If a new menu name is entered, a menu with no selections will be
        displayed the next time the main menu is displayed.  You may then add
        selections to this menu.

      > Mouse sensitivity.  To turn your mouse on, set the sensitivity to a
        non-zero number (start at 8..  You may want to adjust the sensitivity
        based on your mouse and personal preference.  Smaller numbers are more
        sensitive than larger numbers.  To turn the mouse off, set the number
        to zero.  If you have no mouse, this option is ignored.

      > Clear keyboard after running a selection?  Allows you to choose whether
        the keyboard should be cleared of any excess keys after choosing a
        selection that runs a program, batch file or commands.  Clearing the
        keyboard will keep novice users from accidentally choosing selections
        (by hitting keys during the running of the program/commands before the
        menu reappears).  Experienced users may prefer not clearing the
        keyboard, thus allowing them to choose the next selection before
        viewing the menu.  Valid choices are "Y" to clear keyboard or "N" not
        to clear it.
                                                                              74



    Reset Options
    =============

    The reset selection in the options drop down menu allows you to reset your
    options to their original values (as shipped).  MAXimize will reset all of
    the options, except the passwords.  When you reset the options, you must
    choose whether the windows should have colored or black backgrounds.  The
    black background is mainly used for black and white monitors, but does use
    colors for the foreground letters (these are bland colors that work on all
    video tubes).


    Update Mode
    ===========

    You may need to change many selections on several menus using different
    operations (add, update, delete, etc.).  While making these changes, you may
    prefer to stay within the setup routine while you make your changes.  This
    would avoid having to enter the setup password repeatedly and the short
    delay associated with loading the setup program for each operation.  Update
    mode allows you to do just that - switch into the setup routine to make
    multiple changes.

    There are two methods you may use to enter this mode.  The first is to press
    Alt+O U while in MAXimize and the second is to invoke MAXSETUP.EXE (in the
    MAXimize directory) from the DOS prompt.  Both will put you into update
    mode.  However, the second method is provided for computers that do not have
    sufficient memory for MAXimize to load the setup program.  If you receive an
    insufficient memory message, then you must run MAXSETUP.EXE from the DOS
    prompt instead of using Alt+E or Alt+O U from within MAXimize.

    If you have established a setup password in the options, then no matter how
    you enter setup, the setup password must be provided first.  However, with
    the update mode, this is done once, instead of for each operation.

    Once you are in the update mode, you will see "Update Mode:" in the lower
    left corner of the screen.  You may only pick selections that display a sub-
    menu, in which case the sub-menu will be displayed.  To navigate to other
    menus use the same keys (Esc, \, F7, etc.) that you normally use.

    To modify a menu or selection(s), follow the same instructions outlined
    earlier. That is: find the menu, mark selection(s), press Alt+E, choose the
    operation (ex. update), and then follow the instructions for the chosen
    operation.  When the operation is complete, you will be returned to update
    mode.  Repeat the above process until your modifications are complete.  To
    leave update mode, press Alt+O U.
                                                                              75

    User ID
    =======

    The "User ID" selection on the option drop down menu allows you to change
    the setup (ie. menus, colors, directories, etc.) to those of another user.
    Thus, multiple users can share the same MAXimize files and have different
    setups.  Each user of MAXimize that wants a different setup should have a
    unique user ID.  A user who wants more than one setup may have multiple user
    IDs.  These user IDs must be valid DOS file names without an extension.
    They can exceed 7 characters in length, but the first 7 characters must be
    unique.   The default user ID is MAXIMIZE.

    To change the current user ID and its associated setup, simply press Alt+O I
    and enter the new user ID.  The setup will be changed to that of the new
    user ID and the main menu will be displayed.  Each user may then change the
    setup (eq. colors or main menu) to suit their preference, while running
    MAXimize from the same set of files.

    As an example of how this could be used, press Alt+O I and enter a user ID
    of your first name.  Then change the colors (in particular, the background
    color of the main window) as described earlier.  Also, change the main menu
    name in the miscellaneous options to something other than MAIN (like GAMES).
    Now you should switch between the MAXIMIZE default user ID and your first
    name, by pressing Alt+O I and entering the user ID.  Note how MAXimize
    switches the colors and the main menu when you switch the user IDs.  This
    applies to all options, not just with the colors and main menu name.

    Another use is to have separate menus for each user, while also sharing some
    menus.  To do this, create a directory to contain the shared menus (eq.
    C:\MAX\SHARED) and a directory for each user (eq. C:\MAX\userid - fill in
    their user ID) that wants their own menus.  Then each user who only wants
    the shared menus will specify a "Menus & Hot keys path" directory of  the
    shared directory (C:\MAX\SHARED).  Those users who want their own menus in
    addition to the shared menus would specify both
    (C:\MAX\userid;C:\MAX\SHARED).  Finally, users who want only their menus
    would specify their directory (C:\MAX\userid).  Please review the "Menus &
    Hot keys path" item in the "Directories" section of this chapter for more
    information.

    NOTE: Review the /U switch of MAX.EXE in chapter 1 under the section titled
    "Invoking MAXimize with Parameters".  This switch allows you to set the user
    ID when invoking MAXimize.  Also, you may set the ID environment variable to
    the desired user ID before invoking MAXimize.  This could be used to set the
    user ID in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

    The "Project" selection on the option drop down menu allows you to change
    the project you are using to track program usage by.  This allows you to
    keep track of what programs you used for a project and how much time you
    spent in those programs.  The current project will be displayed in the upper
    right hand corner of the screen.  You may click on this area, press Alt+O P
    or use the short cut key of F5 to enter or change the current project.
    Please review the chapter on Controlling and Monitoring Access for more
    information.
                                                                              77

    Chapter 5: Using MAXimize's Utilities
    =====================================

    This chapter contains information about the useful utilities included with
    MAXimize.  Some of these utilities are provided to enhance your batch files
    and selections that use the "command stream" format.  While the others work
    with the menus or options.

    Asking Questions from Batch Files with ASK
    ==========================================

    ASK.COM is a program designed specifically for batch files or the "command
    stream" type of selection.  ASK can be used to request a drive letter such
    as A, B or C from within batch commands.  Another use is to ask if the batch
    file should continue after a program fails.  ASK will display a message and
    then wait for the user to enter a valid key.  This key is then returned in
    the DOS ERRORLEVEL.  The batch file should then check the ERRORLEVEL to see
    which key was entered.  The syntax for ASK is:

                      ASK  [Prompt string];[Valid keys]

    All of the parameters are optional.  If no parameters or a single question
    mark is given to ASK, a short copyright statement and syntax is displayed.

    The "Prompt string" is the question being asked or message to display.  It
    should indicate what information is being requested.  For example, it could
    be "Please enter a drive letter (A,b or c):" or "Program failed, continue
    (Y,n)?"  If no "Prompt String" is given, then none is printed.  In this
    case, it is assumed that this has already been done by an ECHO statement(s).

    The "Valid keys" are keys that may be entered in response to the question.
    The first key in the list must be the default key.  This key will be
    returned when the user hits the Enter key.  To allow the user to press the
    Esc key, include an exclamation point (!) as a valid key.  The space bar can
    be included as a valid key by imbedding it within the list of valid keys.
    For example, specify "A A" to allow for the letter A or the space bar.  If
    no valid keys are entered, then any key will be allowed (including extended
    keys such as F2).

    The ASK program will first print the "Prompt string" to the screen if
    specified. It will then perform somewhat differently depending on whether a
    list of valid keys was included.

    If a list of valid keys was given, then the key entered must match (case is
    ignored) one of these valid keys.  If the key does not match, ASK issues a
    beep sound and waits for another key.  Once a valid key is entered, the key
    will be shifted into upper case and printed after the prompt string.
    Pressing the Enter key will return the first key in the list of valid keys.
    Hitting the Esc key will check the valid keys for an exclamation point (!)
    and if found, return the exclamation point.  Depressing the exclamation
    point key will cause ASK to beep and wait for another key.
    If NO valid keys are given, then the exact key entered is returned.  No
    checking of key validity or shifting to upper case is done.  The key entered
    is not printed after the prompt string.  For extended key strokes, a zero is
    returned. You MUST call ASK with just a semi-colon (ASK ;) to get the second
    part of the extended key.
                                                                              78


    After the ASK program has been called, the calling batch file should check
    the DOS ERRORLEVEL to determine which key was entered.  The check must be
    for the key's ASCII decimal equivalent (ex. 65 for the letter A).  Also,
    when you have multiple checks to determine which key was entered, always
    start with the highest decimal value to the lowest key (ex. Z to A, 9 to 0
    and then !).  For example:

       :Another
       ASK  Enter one of these keys: A, M, 0, 2 or Esc ; AMZ029!
       IF ERRORLEVEL 77 GOTO KeyM
       IF ERRORLEVEL 65 GOTO KeyA
       IF ERRORLEVEL 50 GOTO Key2
       IF ERRORLEVEL 48 GOTO Key0
       IF ERRORLEVEL 33 GOTO End
       :KeyM
           ECHO Key entered was M
           GOTO Another
       ;KeyA
           ECHO Key entered was A
           GOTO Another
       .
       .     .
       :End

    Notes:ASK.COM should be in a directory that has been included in your DOS
          PATH.  Make sure MAXimize's directory is in the DOS PATH.

          The ASCII decimal values for each key can be found on the back of the
          reference card included with MAXimize.

          You will notice that the ASK program is like the &Menu function.  The
          difference is that the &Menu function is executed as part of a
          selection, prior to the execution of the batch commands (during the
          "compilation" of the batch file for a selection).  The ASK program is
          executed as your batch commands are executed.


    Examples of ASK in Batch Files:
    -------------------------------

    The following code will ask whether a batch file should continue:
       .
       ASK Should batch file continue (Y,n): ;YN!
       IF NOT ERRORLEVEL 89 GOTO End
       Echo batch file continues
       .
       :End


    The next example will ask which drive to run CHKDSK on:

       ASK Please enter drive letter to check (a,b,C): ;CAB
       IF ERRORLEVEL 67 GOTO ChkC
       IF ERRORLEVEL 66 GOTO ChkB
           CHKDSK A:
                                                                              79

           GOTO End
       :ChkB
           CHKDSK B:
           GOTO End
       :ChkC
           CHKDSK C:
           GOTO End
       :End


    Finally, a list of items to choose from is presented through ECHO
    statements. The user may then select one:

       CLS
       ECHO Please choose item by pressing desired number or hit enter for 1:
       ECHO  1. Display current directory
       ECHO  2. Display current disk's volume label
       ECHO  3. Display files in current directory
       ASK ;123!
       IF ERRORLEVEL 51 GOTO Key3
       IF ERRORLEVEL 50 GOTO Key2
       IF ERRORLEVEL 49 GOTO Key1
       GOTO End
       :Key1
           CD
           GOTO End
       :Key2
           VOL
           GOTO End
       :Key3
           DIR /W
       :End


    Making the Computer BEEP
    ========================

    BEEP.COM is also a program specifically designed for batch files or the
    "command stream" type of selections.  It will cause your computer's speaker
    to beep.  This can be very useful in alerting you of an error that occurred
    within the batch file.  Also, it can be used in conjunction with the ASK
    program to alert the user that the batch file needs a question answered.
    The syntax for BEEP is:

                BEEP [?]

    If the question mark or an invalid parameter is specified, BEEP will display
    a short copyright statement and syntax.  If no parameters are specified,
    BEEP will cause your computers speaker to beep.  An example of using BEEP
    with ASK, after an error in a batch file follows:
                                                                              80

       .
       .
       :Error
       BEEP
       ASK An error occurred within this batch file - continue (Y,n): ;YN!
       IF NOT ERRORLEVEL 89 GOTO End
       ECHO Batch file continues
       .
       .
       :End


    Notes: BEEP.COM should be in a directory that has been included in your DOS
           PATH.  Make sure MAXimize's directory is in the DOS PATH.


    Viewing a File's Contents
    =========================

    Included with MAXimize is a VIEW.EXE program that allows you to view the
    text in files.  This program is useful within batch files, selections and
    from the DOS prompt.  The syntax for VIEW is:

                    VIEW [Drive:][Directory]Filename[.Ext]

    The parameter past to view is the name of the file to be viewed.  If view is
    not given a file name or it is a question mark, then view will display a
    short copyright statement and syntax.  The drive is not required if the file
    is on the current drive.  The directory is not required if the file exists
    on the current directory for the specified drive.  The extension (Ext) is
    required if the file has an extension.  For example, to view your
    AUTOEXEC.BAT file enter:

       C> VIEW  C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT

    To change the colors of the view program, press the letter C.  Then use the
    following keys:

         Key:       Action:
         ------     -------------------------------------------------
         Ctrl+F     changes the text foreground color
         Ctrl+B     changes the text background color
         Alt+F      changes the top and bottom line foreground colors
         Alt+B      changes the top and bottom line background colors

    As you press these keys, the view program will rotate through the available
    colors.  I would suggest that you pick the desired background colors first
    and then the foreground colors.  When you are finished with the colors,
    press the Esc key.  The view program will then ask you if the colors should
    be saved. Type Y to save the colors.
                                                                              81

    If you have a program that produces a lot of text to the screen, causing the
    screen to scroll, you can use the DOS MORE filter.  Another approach would
    be to direct this output to a temporary file, view the file and then delete
    it.  This has the added benefit over MORE of allowing the user to page up
    and down through the text.  As an example, the DIR command's text could be
    viewed as follows:

             ECHO OFF
             DIR %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9 > \tempfile
             VIEW \tempfile
             DEL \tempfile

    Notes: VIEW.EXE should be in a directory that has been included in your DOS
           PATH.  Make sure MAXimize's directory is in the DOS PATH.


    Changing the Setup with MAXSETUP
    ================================

    The MAXSETUP program allows you to update MAXimize's menus, hot keys and
    options.  It is used by MAX when you update the setup, but can also be
    invoked from the DOS prompt.  You may need to invoke MAXSETUP from the DOS
    prompt if MAX displays error message 907 (insufficient memory) when you try
    to update the setup.  When MAXSETUP is invoked, it will put you into the
    "Update Mode" which is described in Chapter 4.  The syntax for MAXSETUP is:

             MAXSETUP  [menu name]  [Switch(es)]

    The switches are:

      /B   Initialize the colors to have black backgrounds.  Sets colors for
           screens that cannot display them (like monochrome screens).

      /K   Are keys to be entered after MAXimize starts (as if they were entered
           from the keyboard).  This allows selections to be invoked when
           starting MAXimize (especially from an AUTOEXEC.BAT file).  Hot keys
           are represented by the @ sign followed by the desired key (ex. @A is
           Ctrl+A).  Use @@ to represent a single @ sign.


    Preventing Control Break and Reboot
    ===================================

    The NOBREAK.COM Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program allows you to
    prevent anyone from breaking out of a Batch file line AUTOEXEC.BAT or
    MAXimize.  The Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Break keys are disabled.  Also, the
    Ctrl+Alt+Del key is disabled as well to prevent reboot using this key
    combination.  This program would normally be invoked as part of you
    AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  The syntax for TYPEKEY is:

                    NOBREAK

    For example, you can include NOBREAK in your AUTOEXEC.BAT as below.  To use
    the minimum about of space, be sure to set all environment variables to null
    (delete them) and run NOBREAK from the root of your C drive.  This should
    result in the NOBREAK TSR using about 368 bytes!
                                                                              82


      @SET PATH=
      @SET COMPSEC=
      @C:\NOBREAK.COM
      @SET COMSPEC=C:\COMMAND.COM
      .
      .

    Warning: NOBREAK disables Ctrl+C.  All programs, including MAXimize with its
             hot keys, will not be able to use Ctrl+C!


    Typing Keys Automatically
    =========================

    The TYPEKEY.EXE program allows you to type keys as if they were entered from
    the keyboard.  This can be used to type in keys that you always enter when
    entering an application.  TYPEKEY will let you enter up to 15 key strokes
    which will replace any keystrokes already entered from the keyboard.  The
    syntax for TYPEKEY is:

                    TYPEKEY key(s)

    The parameter past to TYPEKEY is the key(s) to type.  If TYPEKEY is not
    given any parameters it will display a short copyright statement and syntax.
    The key(s) can be entered as non-numeric text, or any text in quotes or as
    decimal numbers that represent the ASCII code to enter.  Please review the
    &KEY for a list of ASCII codes.  For example to enter F10, TEXT1, Enter in a
    batch file:

      @ECHO OFF
      TYPEKEY   0   68   TEXT   "1"   13
      .
      .

    NOTE: 0 68 is the ASCII code for F10 and 13 is the ASCII code for Enter.


    Delayed Execution of Commands
    =============================

    The WAITTILL.COM program allows you to delay the execution of commands
    within a batch file until a specified time of day or until a key is pressed.
    This can be useful for doing backups of your hard disk or to download from
    bulletin boards during the night.  The syntax for WAITTILL is:

                    WAITTILL [/Thh:mm:ss]  [message]

    The parameter past to WAITTILL is the time to wait till and a message to
    display while waiting.  If WAITTILL is not given any parameters it will
    clear the screen and wait for a key to be pressed.  The time may be
    turncated and should be specifed as in a 24:00 clock.  For example, to delay
    the execution of commands within a batch file until eight PM, the batch file
    would contain:
                                                                              83

      @ECHO OFF
      WAITTILL /T20:00 Waiting until 8 PM to download files, press Esc to abort.
      IF ERRORLEVEL 1 GOTO STOP
      REM Place commands to run after this remark:
      .
      .
      .
      :STOP

    The user may abort the wait by pressing the Esc key.  This will return an
    ERRORLEVEL of 1.  Any other key stroke or when the specified time is reached
    will return an ERRORLEVEL of 0.


    Mouse Initialization
    =====================

    The FIXMOUSE.COM program will reset the mouse, leaving it in the proper
    state for MAXimize.  This program should be used after running a program
    from within a MAXimize selection that leaves the mouse in an improper state.
    FIXMOUSE will also tell you if the mouse is "FAST" (the mouse software must
    be at the Microsoft versioni 6 level).  FIXMOUSE has no parameters.


    Converting Menus to MAXimize
    ============================

    The MAXCONVT.EXE program will convert AutoMenu(R) menu definition files
    (those with the MDF extension) or Max-Menu version 1.? format to MAXimize
    menus.  This utility is distributed separately - please read the README
    file.

    The conversion from MDF files is not precise, but should be fairly close.
    Therefore, after a conversion, be sure to update the selections to verify
    they are correct.  The syntax for MAXCONVT is:

             MAXCONVT [Drive:][Directory]Filename.Extension

    If no parameters or a single question mark are passed to MAXCONVT, then a
    short copyright statement and its syntax is displayed.  The file
    specification indicates which files are to be converted.  The extension must
    be *, ???, MNU, SET, KYS or MDF.  The * or ??? extensions indicate that all
    menus, hot keys and MDF files should be converted (KYS, SET and MNU files
    are converted from Max-Menu version 1.? to MAXimize version 3.0 format).

    To convert MDF files, change to the MAXimize directory and run MAXCONVT
    giving it the file specification of the MDF files to convert.  For example,
    if  the MDF files are in directory C:\AUTOMENU, then enter the following
    commands:

           C> CD  \MAX
           C> MAXCONVT  C:\AUTOMENU\*.MDF
                                                                              84

    This will convert all files in the C:\AUTOMENU directory with an extension
    of MDF and store the new files in the C:\MAX directory.   Be sure to specify
    an extension of MDF, since this tells the conversion routine the type of
    file it is converting.
                                                                              85

    Chapter 6: Controlling and Monitoring Access
    ============================================

    This chapter contains general information about security features that
    control access to MAXimize, DOS and the setup (options, menus and
    selections).  The actual information on how to specify security passwords
    has been addressed in previous chapters.  Also covered in this chapter is
    the optional usage log and license control features.  The usage log allows
    you to monitor and report on which applications are being used by whom, for
    what project and for how long.  In addition, the usage log keeps track of
    security violations and rejected accesses.  The license control feature
    allows companies to purchase fewer copies of a software product then there
    are potential users, since MAXimize will ensure the number of concurrent
    users does not exceed the license agreement for that product.


    Security
    ========

    Forgotten Passwords
    ===================

    MAXimize has a very generous password protection system.  This allows for
    preventing unauthorized access and changes to MAXimize and its setup (menu,
    selection, setup, etc.).  Once this password protection is set, it may not
    be removed unless you either know the password or the Creator password.  The
    same is true when trying to view a menu or choose a selection that is
    password protected.  For this reason, it is very important to set the
    Creator password to identify you as the creator of MAXimize.  It is equally
    important not to forget it!

    If you forget a menu or selection password, you (that is the creator of
    MAXimize) may enter the Creator password instead.  The Creator password will
    always be accepted on any prompt for a password.  To determine what the menu
    password is, display and then modify the menu.  To determine what a
    selection's password is, update the selection.  In either case, you will
    need to enter the Creator password when requested for the menu/selection
    password (assuming you have forgotten it).  You may then view or modify the
    password through the normal menu/selection update window.


    Protecting MAXimize or DOS Access
    =================================

    You may prevent unauthorized access to MAXimize or to the DOS prompt once
    someone is in MAXimize.  These are accomplished by setting the Entry and
    Quitting passwords within the options.  In addition, if both of these are
    set, then once the person attempts to use MAXimize, they will not be allowed
    to quit until they have typed the Entry password.  This can be useful since
    it can prevent unauthorized access to your computer at startup.  To do this,
    include MAXimize in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and set both an Entry and
    Quitting password (the same password can be used for both).  Then, when your
    computer is powered on, the Entry password must be enter before anyone can
    use your computer.  Also consider using the NOBREAK TSR provided.  This TSR
    will prevent the person from breaking out of your batch files, such as
    AUTOEXEC.BAT.
                                                                              86



    Preventing Unauthorized Changes
    ===============================

    MAXimize also prevents unauthorized changes to the setup (options, menus and
    selections) through the Setup password.  The Setup password is specified in
    the options and must be entered each time someone attempts to modify the
    setup.  This can become bothersome when doing multiple changes.  For this
    reason and to improve the speed of change operations on slower machines,
    MAXimize provides an Update mode.  This mode will prompt for the Setup
    password once, and then let you perform multiple change operations quickly.


    Securing an Unattended Computer
    ===============================

    You may secure an unattended computer from unauthorized access by specifying
    the Protect Clear password (press Alt+W P or the Ctrl+F10 short cut key).
    Then whenever you press Shift+F10 or the screen save feature occurs, your
    computer's screen will be cleared.  Anyone attempting to use the computer
    will then have to enter the Protect Clear password.  Thus, you can manually
    secure your computer by pressing Shift+F10 or allow MAXimize to do it
    automatically with the screen save feature.


    Protecting Menus and Selections
    ===============================

    MAXimize also allows each menu and selection to be password protected.  This
    password must be entered whenever the menu or selection is updated.  It is
    also required when an attempt is made to view the menu or the selection is
    chosen.  To protect a menu or selection, simply update or add the
    menu/selection and enter the password in the indicated field.

    NOTE:Password protecting a selection that displays a menu does not protect
         the menu.  Other selections could also display the menu or the person
         could start MAXimize giving it the unprotected menu.  Thus, this
         protection can be easily bypassed.  Therefore, use the menu password
         to protect menus.


    Selection Password Annoying
    ===========================

    Selection password protection can become bothersome for selections you
    repeatedly choose, since the password is requested each time.  As an
    alternative, group selections to be protected on a menu(s) and use the menu
    password.  Then, the password will be requested once when the menu is
    displayed as opposed to each time a selection is chosen.
                                                                              87

    Truly Securing MAXimize
    =======================

    To really secure your MAXimize system you need to specify your own
    Encryption Key and use the NOBREAK TSR.  The Encryption Key prevents someone
    from copying the menus to another computer and then using them.  It also
    prevents them from bypassing security on your computer (this is possible,
    but will not be discussed here for obvious reasons).  The Encryption Key
    encodes the menu files, thus preventing any possible attempt to use your
    menus or bypass your security.

    The NOBREAK TSR disables the Ctrl+Break, Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Alt+Delete keys.
    This will prevent anyone from intentionally or inadvertently breaking out of
    MAXimize while it is running a batch file and also prevents them from
    rebooting.  Without the NOBREAK TSR, it is possible for someone to break out
    of MAXimize and enter commands at the DOS prompt.


    Monitoring Access
    =================

    Whether you are a LAN administrator or own a computer in your home, you will
    probably be interested in knowing which applications are being used, when,
    by whom and for how long.  For example, lets say you installed a piece of
    shareware software (like a game for the kids).  Wouldn't it be nice to know
    that its being used frequently?  If it is, you would pay for it.  Otherwise
    you might consider removing it from your hard disk to save space.  For a
    business, this can be helpful in justifying the purchase of the software or
    additional software.  It can also be used to determine which persons used
    the software and for which projects.

    MAXimize allows you to generate a variety of summary reports.  For example,
    reports can be generate on how often someone runs any program or a specific
    program, for how long and for which project.  Reports can also be generated
    for all programs, or a specific program, showing  how often they are used,
    by whom, for which projects and for how long.  From these summary reports,
    you can easily tell who is using which programs and how often a program is
    used.

    In addition to the monitoring mentioned above, MAXimize allows you to
    monitor security violations as well.  Thus, you can easily determine if
    someone is attempting to violate your security by viewing the usage log.

    Finally, the usage log allows you to determine which programs are  currently
    being used and by whom.   This is useful on  LANs, particularly if you  have
    purchased the optional license control feature.


    The Usage Log
    =============

    The usage log is a standard XBase database that MAXimize uses to keep track
    of who is using which programs, for which projects, at what time and for how
    long.  MAXimize also uses this database to log security violations and
    rejected accesses.  A rejected access occurs when the license control
    feature prevents someone from using a program because all copies are in use.
                                                                              88

    The name of the usage log database is MAXLOG.DBF and it should reside in the
    same directory as the MAXLOG.EXE program (except if you set the MAXDIR
    environment variable to the directory MAXLOG.DBF can be found in).  The
    format of the usage log database is:

       Field:        Length:  Description:
       ------------  -------  ---------------------------------------------
       Status        1        Status of entry:
                              I = In Use
                              U = Used
                              S = Security Violation
                              R = Rejected Access (license control feature)
       Userid        7        User ID of the person
       Project       8        Project they are working on
                              May be blank if user didn't set project
       Program       12       Program used or attempted to be used
       Start_Date    6        Date when the selection was chosen
                              Format = YYMMDD
       Start_Time    6        Time when the selection was chosen
                              Format = HHMMSS
       Used_Time     6        How long the selection was used
                              Format = HHMMSS

    Since the usage log is a standard XBase database, you can manipulate and
    generate reports using any standard XBase database program, such as DBase
    III+.  You  can also import it into many programs, such as spreadsheets.

    To view the usage log, simply run MAXLOG.EXE.  If you have the optional
    license control feature, you will have to select Usage log.  The usage log
    will be displayed in date/time sequence as follows:

         +===============================================================+
         | Userid   Project   Program         Date     Start   Time Used |
         +===============================================================+

         +===============================================================+

    The number of records will be displayed just above the usage log window and
    to the right.  Use the up and down arrow keys to move the report one line at
    a time, the PgUp and PgDn keys to page through the report, and the Home and
    End keys to move to the top and bottom respectively.  Finally, press the Esc
    key to exit the usage log display.
                                                                              89

    The format of the date field is YY/MM/DD and the project the person was
    working on may be blank unless set by the person (see options).  Also, the
    time used may appear as:

         Time Used:   Description:
         ----------   -----------------------------------------------------
         HH:MM:SS     The amount of time the program was used
         In use       The person is currently using the program
         Security     The person attempted to violate security
         Rejected     The person's attempt to use the program was rejected
                      since the current number of users is equal to the
                      number of licenses purchased.  This applies only the
                      optional LAN license control feature.

    The program is actually the value specified in the Track By field of the
    selection.  Generally, this should be the program name.  However, for
    security violations, the program will be set to one of the following values
    to indicate what security the person attempted to violate:

     Program:      Person tried to:
     ------------  ---------------------------------------------------------

                   didn't know its password.  The selection description is
                   truncated to 12 characters and used as the program name.
     Menu name     tried to view a menu and didn't know its password


    Reducing the Data Viewed
    ========================

    The usage log can become too large for you to quickly find the data you are
    interested in by paging through it.  For example, you may want to find data
    for a specific program, such as WP.EXE, or a person with a user ID of JANET.
    Or perhaps you want to find specific data where both the user ID is JANET
    and the program is WP.EXE.  It would be difficult to scroll through 1,000
    lines to find them.  MAXimize solves this problem by providing the ability
    to Query, which allows you to quickly reduce the data being viewed to those
    of interest to you.  To query the usage log, press Q and the following
    window will appear:
                                                                              90

    +=========================================================================+

    The usage log query window allows you to specify the specific data you are
    interested in viewing or reporting.  Within this window you may specify
    which of the four status's you want to view (Programs In Use, Programs Used,
    Rejected Accesses and Security Violations).  Enter "Y" next to at least one
    status.  If you are interested in data for one user ID, program or project,
    you should specify this in the window. If you are interested in a specific
    date range, again specify this in the window.  When you are done specifying
    what to query on, press Enter to accept the query or Esc to cancel the
    query.  The number of records which satisfy the query will be displayed in
    the upper right corner.  You will then be returned to the usage log display
    which will show only data that satisfies the values you specified in the
    query.  To clear the query and again display all the usage log data, press
    C.

    Provided here is just a few examples of what the query capability can be
    used to determine:

     > what programs someone is currently using (specify their user ID and the
       Programs In Use status only).
     > all the programs that are currently being used (specify the Programs In
       Use status only).
     > what programs are still in use, but were started prior to today.
       (specify the Programs In Use status only and an end date or yesterday)
     > what programs were used for a project (specify the project)
     > what programs does a person use (specify the user ID and the Programs
       Used and Programs In Use status's only)
     > what security violations have occurred (specify the Security Violation
       status only)
     > which people and programs where rejected due to too few licenses
       (specify the Rejected Access status only)
                                                                              91

    Sequencing the Usage Log Data
    =============================

    The Usage log is sequenced (or ordered) by the start date and time.  You may
    want to change that sequence.  For example, you could sequence the data by
    user ID, program and start date/time.  This example would show the first, or
    primary, sequence to be user ID.  Within user ID the data would be ordered
    by program and for each person/program combination the data would be ordered
    by start date/time.

    To change the sequence of the data in the usage log display, press S and the
    following window will be displayed:

           +===================== Usage Log Sequence ==================+
           |                                                           |
           |    USERID     _      Enter 1 in the 1st sequence field,   |
           |                      2 in the 2nd sequence field, 3 in    |
           |    PROJECT    _      the 3rd sequence field, etc.  Leave  |
           |                      a field blank if you do not want to  |
           |    PROGRAM    _      include the field in the ordering    |
           |                      sequence.  Subtotals will be printed |
           |    DATE/TIME  _      for each field with a sequence number|
           |                      when using the report option.        |
           |    TIME USED  _                                           |
           |                      ENTER=Done                ESC=Cancel |
           +===========================================================+

    Then enter the desired sequence by placing 1 next to the first field to
    sequence, 2 next to the second field to sequence (within the first
    sequence), 3 next to the third sequence, etc.  Enter a blank next to any
    item which you do not want part of the sequence.  To sequence by user ID,
    program and start date/time, enter 1 next to user ID, 2 next to program and
    3 next to date.  Then blank out the project and time used fields.  Finally,
    press the Enter key to accept the sequence or Esc to cancel it.  The usage
    log will be displayed with the desired sequence.


    Set Program Used
    ================

    MAXimize will automatically keep track of which programs are currently being
    used.  As part of this process, MAXimize will set the program to the used
    status when it is exited.  The process consists of changing the status to
    "used" and filling in the amount of time the program was used.  However, it
    is possible for someone to accidentally prevent this process.  This
    generally occurs when the computer is powered off or rebooted before the
    program is exited.  You can easily determine if this has happened using the
    query facility mentioned previously.

    If you do not have the optional license control feature then the exposure is
    very small - the time the program was used will be 0 seconds.  This may
    effect summary reports of the usage log.  If the accuracy of these reports
    is important to you, then you should set these programs as used.  Of course,
    the sooner this is done, the more accurate the reports will be.
                                                                              92

    If you do have the optional license control feature and the program is
    registered in the license control database, the exposure is greater.  In
    addition to the summary report exposure mentioned above, one "copy" of the
    program is still marked as being in use that nobody else can use.  In this
    case, you will certainly want to set the program to used to allow someone
    else to use that copy of the program.

    There are two ways to set the used status for a program.  The first is to
    query the usage log for programs in use (specify the Programs In Use status
    only).  You may want to narrow this query further by specifying the program
    or user ID as well.  Then position the selection bar over the program to set
    to used and press U

    The second method is to use the /U switch which is explained later in the
    section titled "Periodic Maintenance to Databases".


    Usage Log Reports
    =================

    The information in the usage log can be the basis for some very useful
    reports.  The reports generated by MAXimize will always include summary
    information and can optionally include a detailed list of the data in the
    usage log.  The summary information includes the number of programs used and
    the total amount of time spent in those programs.  Also included are the
    number of security violations, rejected accesses and how many are currently
    in use.  The summary information above can be printed for each user ID,
    project, program, start date, or any combination of these.

    For example, a report could be created for the "RealBig" project showing for
    each person involved in that project, which programs they ran, how many
    times they ran the program and for how long.  Sub-totals are also shown for
    each person.  Finally, at the end of the report, grand totals are given for
    the entire project.  With this report, you can easily determine how much
    time each individual spent on a project and which programs were used most.

    To create a report, first query the usage log as outlined in the section
    titled "Reducing the Data Viewed".  Be sure to query just the data you want
    to report on.  This may be data for a specific person, project, program,
    date range, etc.  In the example above, you would set the query to view the
    "RealBig" project.  You may also want to exclude security violations,
    programs in use and rejected accesses by setting these status's to "N".

    After setting the query to view the desired data, you should set the proper
    sequence for the report.  This is described in the section titled
    "Sequencing the Usage Log Data".  Be sure to specify a sequence on only
    those fields you want summary information for.  This is important because
    MAXimize generates summary information for each field that is part of the
    sequence.  For summary reports (no detail), if there are no sequence fields
    then the report will summarize on user ID.  Also, summary reports will
    ignore Time Used if it was sequenced on.  Again using the example above, the
    sequence would be set to user ID (1) and program (2).  This will set the
    proper sequence and also generate summary information for each person as
    well as for each program used by that person.
                                                                              93

    At this point, the usage log display should contain the desired data for the
    report and have the proper sequence.  Now press R for report.  Then simply
    indicate whether the detailed records should be part of the report and the
    desired report destination (file/printer).

    A sample summary report is shown below.  This report is for user ID DEREK
    and is sequenced within user ID by project and then program.  Totals are
    generated for each sequence field and for the entire report:

    Limiting License Usage
    ======================

    The license control feature may be purchased as part of the LAN version of
    MAXimize.  With this feature the LAN administrator can purchased fewer
    copies of a program than there are potential users of the program.  All the
    LAN administrator needs to do is register these programs within the license
    control database indicating the total number of licensed copies for each
    program.  Then MAXimize will ensure that the number of users that are
    concurrently using these programs does not exceed the number of licenses
    purchased.  This can result in considerable savings since it isn't necessary
    to purchase copies for everyone on the LAN.

    Not only will MAXimize prevent too many people from using a program, it will
    also keep track of the following for each program registered:

      > who is currently using them
      > the largest number of concurrent users
      > the current number of users
      > the total number of uses
      > the total number of user accesses rejected because there weren't enough
        copies available

    Using the above information, the LAN administrator can view or print reports
    that will tell them if they have purchased enough copies of a program.  This
                                                                              94

    can be determined by examining the largest number of concurrent users as
    well as the number of rejected accesses.  If more information is needed, the
    usage log contains who is using (or has used) the program as well as who and
    when someone has been rejected because there weren't enough licensed copies.
    Thus, MAXimize provides all the information and capabilities a LAN
    administrator needs to effectively and easily manage the licenses for
    programs.


    License Control
    ===============

    The license control database is a standard XBase database MAXimize uses to
    control the number of people that can use a program at once.  The usage log
    is also used for license control since it keeps track of who is using (and
    has used) a program.  In addition, all rejected accesses are recorded in the
    usage log.  The name of the license control database is MAXCHK.DBF and it
    should reside in the same directory as the MAXLOG.EXE program (except if you
    set the MAXDIR environment variable to the directory MAXCHK.DBF can be found
    in).  The format of the license control database is:

      Field:         Length:  Description:
      -------------  -------  -------------------------------------------
      Program        12       Program to  control -  matches  selection's
                              Track By field.
      Maximum        3        Maximum concurrent  users  of  the  program
                              (number of licenses purchased)
      High_Water     3        Most  users  to   have  used  the   program
                              concurrently
      In_Use         3        The number  of  users currently  using  the
                              program
      Total_Used     4        The total number of  times the program  has
                              been used
      Total_Rejects  4        The number of times an access was  rejected
                              because  there   weren't  enough   licenses
                              available.
      Reset Date     6         The date that  the line was  last modified.
                               This  value  can  be  changed  by  the  LAN
                               administrator when  the  data  is  modified
                               (such as  the  totals  being reset).    The
                               format of this date field is YY/MM/DD.
      Status         1         Status of license control:
                               *=Program execution disabled

    Since the license control database is a standard XBase database, you can
    manipulate and generate reports using any standard XBase database program,
    such as DBase III+.  You  can also import it into many programs, such as
    spreadsheets.

    To view the license control database, simply run MAXLOG.EXE and choose the
    License control selection.  The license control database will be displayed
    in program sequence as follows:
                                                                              95

         |                                                               |
         |                                                               |
         |                                                               |
         |                                                               |
         |                                                               |
         |                                                               |
         |                                                               |
         |                                                               |
         +===============================================================+
         | F1=Help  A=Add     I=Show-In-Use                 ^v PgDn PgUp |
         | E=Edit   D=Delete  R=Report       *=Disabled        ESC: Exit |
         +===============================================================+

    Use the up and down arrow keys to move the report one line at a time, the
    PgUp and PgDn keys to page through the report, and the Home and End keys to
    move to the top and bottom respectively.  Finally, press the Esc key to exit
    the license control display.


    Add License Control
    ===================

    There are two steps needed to control the maximum number of people that can
    use a program concurrently.  First, set the Track By field for each
    selection that invokes the program to the program's name.  Then while
    viewing the license control database press A or the Insert key to add the
    program to this file.  In the window that appears, fill in the program's
    name and the maximum number of concurrent users allowed.  MAXimize will then
    ensure that this maximum does not get exceeded.

      NOTE:  The Track By field in the selection and the Program in the license
             control database do not have to be the program's name, but they
             must match each other.


    Edit License Control
    ====================

    After a program has been added to the license control database, you may need
    to change the information for that program.  For example, you may need to
    change the Maximum In Use after purchasing additional copies of the program.
    You may also want to reset the totals such as Most In Use, Total Used and
    Total Rejects back to zero.  If you do change these totals, you may want to
    change the Reset Date as well.

    To edit the control information for a program, highlight the desired program
    and press E or the equal (=) key.  Then change the desired fields.  Use the
    tab key to skip fields that are not to be changed and press Enter when done.
                                                                              96

    Delete License Control
    ======================

    To delete information about a program from the license control database,
    simply highlight the desired program and press D or the Delete key.  You may
    find this necessary if you no longer use the program or if you buy a site
    license.


    Disable Program Execution
    =========================

    The LAN administrator may want to disable a program so it cannot be executed
    by new users.  When disabled, current users of the program may continue to
    use it until they finish.  Once the current users have stopped using the
    program, maintenance or a new release can be implemented.  To disable
    program execution, highlight the desired program and press the asterick (*)
    key.  An asterick will be displayed to the left of the program indicating it
    is disabled.  To enable the program, again highlight the program and press
    the asterick (*).


    Display Current Users
    =====================

    While viewing the license control database, you may want to display the
    current users for a program.  In addition, you may find it necessary to set
    one or more of these as being used.  As explained earlier, this can be done
    using the query facility on the usage log.  However, MAXimize provides a
    convenient method for doing this from within the license control display.
    Simply highlight the program and press I.  The current users of this program
    will be displayed:

                          +========== WP.EXE ===========+
                          | Userid     Date     Start   |

                          |                             |
                          |                             |
                          |                             |
                          |                             |
                          |                             |
                          +=============================+
                          |                ^v PgDn PgUp |
                          | U=Set-Used        ESC: Exit |
                          +=============================+

    You may then set any program as being used by highlighting that program and
    pressing U.  To return to the license control display press the Esc key.
                                                                              97

    License Control Reports
    =======================

    The LAN administrator may want to print the information in the license
    control database to determine growth.  For example, each month the LAN
    administrator could print off the license control report, which lists and
    summarizes all license control information.  Then the program's totals could
    be reset.  Using these reports, it should be fairly easy to see were the
    growth in program usage is.  To print a report of the license control
    database, simply press R while viewing the license control database.  Then
    enter the desired destination file/printer for the report.


    Periodic Maintenance to Databases
    =================================

    The usage log and license control databases will require periodic
    maintenance.  How often depends entirely on activity.  Since the maintenance
    procedures are quick and can be done as an unattended "batch" process, you
    may do this maintenance as frequently as you like.  For example, you may do
    this each time you power on your LAN, nightly, weekly, monthly, yearly, etc.

    Periodic maintenance is needed for the usage log since the data will
    eventually become old.  This makes the database larger and slower.
    Therefore, old data should be purged (cleaned up) and the database compacted
    to remove the purged rows on a periodic basis.

    The license control database requires periodic maintenance when programs are
    incorrectly shown as being in use.  This can occur due to such things as
    power outages or when someone powers their computer off while using a
    program.

    The recommendation is to run MAXLOG with the /P and /U switches frequently
    on busy systems.  Perferably nightly and when powering the LAN on/off.  The
    compact should be done somewhat less often, such as weekly or when powering
    the LAN on.  For home use, this is only needed on a monthly or yearly basis.

    MAXLOG has three switches you can use to do this maintenance:

      /P?  This switch tells MAXimize to purge (or delete) usage log data older
           than the number of days (?) specified from the usage log.  The
           default is to purge data older than 31 days.  Thus, you can purge
           usage log data greater than one year old by using switch /U365.

      /C   This switch tells MAXimize to compact (or physically remove) all
           purged data from the usage log and the license control databases.
           This switch should only be used when no one is currently using
           MAXimize.  This releases the space used by purged data.

      /U?  This switch will set programs that are currently in use for the
           specified number of hours (?) to the used status.  The default is to
           set in use programs to the used status if they have been used more
           than 9 hours.  Thus, I could set all programs to the used status
           before my computer (or the LAN server) is powered off, or when it is
           powered on, by running MAXLOG /U0.  I can also use the WAITTILL
           program to run MAXLOG /U9 at 2:00 AM in the morning to set programs
                                                                              98

           started the previous day before 5:00 PM to the used status!

    These switches can be used together or independently of one another.  Since
    the /C switch should be done only when no one is using MAXimize, and the
    other switches do not have this restriction, you may not want to compact the
    usage log every time the purge is done.  To purge records older than one
    month, set programs in use that have been used since 5:00 PM and compact the
    usage log at 2 AM in the morning, you should run the following batch file:

      @ECHO OFF
      WAITTILL 02:00 Waiting until 2 AM to purge, reset and compact usage log.
      IF ERRORLEVEL 1 GOTO STOP
      MAXLOG   /P   /U   /C
      :STOP

        NOTE: If you are not running on a LAN, you will not want to wait until
              2 AM to run MAXLOG or use the /U switch.  In this case, simple
              run MAXLOG /P /C
                                                                              99

    Appendix A: Hints
    =================

    This appendix is intended to provide hints on how to get the most from
    MAXimize.  Only after installing and using MAXimize, should you read these
    hints. It is assumed that the reader has developed some knowledge of DOS and
    has the DOS manual available as a reference.


    Cut and Paste Between Selections
    ================================

    The cut and paste capability of the editor is to a temporary clipboard in
    memory.  Thus, copy and paste features of the editor cannot be used directly
    to copy text from one selection to another.  However, you may highlight a
    block of text and use the save feature (Ctrl+S) to save the block to a file
    (for example "CLIPBORD").  Then update the text/selection to be copied to,
    position to where the text is to be inserted and use the read feature
    (Ctrl+R) to read the block back from the file ("CLIPBORD") into the
    selection.  You may use this technique to copy text from any multiple line
    text area to another - such as menu text, help text or a selections
    commands.


    Invoke MAXimize without Directory Change
    ========================================

    You may want to invoke MAXimize by entering MENU or Max from the DOS prompt
    without having to change the current directory.  To do this, add the
    directory containing the MENU.BAT, MAX.EXE and MAXIMIZE.OVR files to your
    PATH.  This directory is usually the directory you installed MAXimize into.

    Assuming you installed into the default directory of C:\MAX, you could
    change your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to include the command PATH C:\MAX\.  If you
    already have a PATH command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT, then simply
    add this directory to those already specified (the directories are separated
    by semicolons (;)).

    Another alternative is to copy these files to a directory that is already in
    your path.  However, the option file (MAXIMIZE.SET) still must be available.
    For more information on this, please review the section of "file Placement"
    in the Introduction.


    Invoke MAXimize Automatically
    =============================

    You may want MAXimize invoked automatically each time you power on your
    computer.  To do this, edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  Then add a line to the
    bottom of the file that changes (DOS CHDIR command) to the directory
    MAXimize was installed in.  This is not needed if this directory has already
    been added to your PATH.  After this, add a line to invoke MAXimize by
    entering MENU or MAX.  Then save the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
                                                                             100

    Removing ECHO OFF
    =================

    To keep "ECHO OFF" from appearing on your screen, upgrade to DOS version
    3.30 or above.  Then change the MENU.BAT file's "ECHO OFF" statement to
    "@ECHO OFF".  You can use this technique in your batch files to suppress the
    ECHO OFF.


    Renaming MENU.BAT file
    ======================

    The MENU.BAT file can be renamed.  This may become necessary if it conflicts
    with another batch file or program.  This ability is provided through the /M
    switch in this file.  This switch tells MAXimize the name of the menu batch
    file being used.  To rename this file, use the DOS REN command.  Also, you
    may invoke MAXimize by entering MAX at the DOS prompt.


    Macros
    ======

    Keyboard macros can be easily created by using the &KEY function in a hot
    key.  For example, update a hot key currently not being used.  Choose a
    format type of Command stream.  Then code the &KEY function with the desired
    keys to be entered (eq. &KEY[ABC] as the only command.  Then whenever you
    want to type those keys, simply press the hot key instead.


    File Placement
    ==============

    The placement of MAXimize's files is generally handled through the
    directories specified in the options.  However, during startup of MAX.EXE
    and MAXSETUP.EXE, certain files must be located (including the options
    themselves) before the directories in the options can be used.  If you have
    DOS version 3.00 or higher and installed these files in one directory, then
    you do not have to continue reading this section since the files will be
    located.  Otherwise, at startup MAXimize searches for files
    MAX.EXE/MENU.BAT, *.SET (eq. MAXIMIZE.SET) and MAXIMIZE.OVL in the following
    directories:

      1. MAXDIR environment variable.  This allows you to specify a directory to
         search.
      2. The directory MAX.EXE is in (DOS version 3.00 or higher)
      3. Current directory
      4. DOS PATH.
      5. C:\MAX

       NOTE:Options files are always saved in the directory the original option
            file was read from.
                                                                             101

    Maximizing Performance
    ======================

    While MAXimize's performance is very good, there are several things you can
    do to get maximum performance.  One of the easiest is to specify BUFFERS=20
    in the CONFIG.SYS file.  This change will benefit many of the programs you
    run. When invoking MAXimize, use the MAX.EXE program instead of the MENU.BAT
    file.  The program should be slightly faster.

    When creating selections, turn the Shell toggle on where possible.  If there
    is insufficient memory, DOS will display message "Program too big to fit in
    memory".  In this case, toggle the shell off.

    Also, keep the commands short.  If they become too long, try saving (use
    Ctrl+S) these commands to a batch file and then execute the batch file.
    This is particularly important for frequently used selections (it slows down
    selection invocation).

    You may be able to greatly increases the speed of MAXimize if you have a
    mouse attached to your computer.  The speed increase depends on your mouse,
    but generally is about 1 second per selection invocation and can be as high
    as 2 seconds!  The performance enhancement can only be gained if your mouse
    software driver is compatible with Microsoft Mouse driver version 6.0 or
    higher.  To determine if your mouse driver software is at this level, run
    FIXMOUSE.COM from the DOS prompt.  This program is distributed with
    MAXimize.  It will initialize your mouse and tell you if MAXimize will
    perform faster.  If the FIXMOUSE message doesn't indicate "(FAST)", you
    should get the latest mouse software driver from your local computer store
    (your mouse hardware doesn't need to be changed).  Another possibility is to
    turn the mouse off in the miscellaneous options.  If nothing else, turning
    off the mouse for a while will give you an idea if it is slowing MAXimize
    down.

    Finally, if you have a RAM drive (virtual disk), consider:

     > Copying the COMMAND.COM file from the root directory of your hard drive
       to the root directory of the RAM drive.  Turn on the read-only attribute
       so it will not be deleted accidentally.  Then set COMSPEC to the new
       location of COMMAND.COM file.  This can be done in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
       file. For instance, if your RAM drive is D the batch file could do the
       following after creating the RAM drive:

           COPY C:\COMMAND.COM D:\*.*
           ATTRIB +R D:\COMMAND.COM
           SET COMSPEC=D:\COMMAND.COM

         This will speed up all programs that "shell" since the COMMAND.COM file
       can be loaded quicker from the RAM drive then the hard disk.

     > In the options, change the Batch execution file directory to be on the
       RAM drive.  Since the RAM drive is quicker than a hard disk, this will
       speed up the execution of the commands for a selection.
                                                                             102

    Appendix B: Trouble Shooting and Technical Support
    ==================================================

    Max Software will provide support for MAXimize for at least 90 days after
    the registration date.  This includes answering questions and fixing serious
    defects.  Max Software may choose to refund the purchase price during this
    90 day period rather than fix a problem when the problem is due to a
    specific hardware or software environment.  Beyond this 90 day period,
    support for this version of MAXimize is not guaranteed when a newer version
    is available or past one year from the registration date.  Thus, after 90
    days, Max Software MAY request that you purchase a newer version (when
    available) to determine if the problem is fixed by it.

    MAXimize is designed to be easy to install and use.  However, there is a
    rare chance that you might encounter a problem that you cannot resolve
    yourself. Below is a list of commonly asked questions and answers.  If,
    after reading this section and the hints in appendix A, you still have a
    problem finding an answer, please follow the procedure for contacting
    technical support described at the end of this appendix.


    Commonly Asked Questions and Answers:

    1. A selection's commands are failing.  How can I tell what is going wrong?

       Answer: The easiest way to find out why batch commands are failing is to
       see them as they execute.  That is what the DOS ECHO command will do.
       Simply add a line before the first batch command (position cursor on top
       line and hit Ctrl+N) containing "ECHO ON".  Then each command in the
       batch file will be echoed to the screen as it is executed by DOS.  If
       they disappear off the top of the screen to quickly, add the PAUSE
       command at the end of the batch commands (and perhaps within them).  The
       PAUSE command will temporarily halt the execution of the batch commands
       until you strike a key.

    2. Why does a selection keep quitting MAXimize (causes the DOS prompt to be
       displayed)?

       Answer: A selection can request that MAXimize quit by turning on the quit
       toggle.  A selection can accidentally cause MAXimize to loose control
       (quit) by executing a batch file within the batch commands and not
       specifying an extension of BAT or preceding it with a tilde (~) sign.  If
       all else fails, use the "ECHO ON" command to find the last command
       executed.  Then make sure it is not a batch file!  If it is, use a BAT
       extension or precede it with the tilde (~) sign.

    3. Why won't a selection permanently update an environment variable

       Answer: A selection can update an environment variable only if the shell
       toggle is off and the environment variable is set by a command within the
       batch commands.  In all other cases, the environment variable will not be
       permanent, since the setting of the variable was done from a "shelled to"
       batch file.

    4. How can a memory resident program be invoked from a selection's batch
       commands?
                                                                             103


       Answer: This should only be done with the shell toggle off.  Also, the
       program must be executed directly from (specified) within the batch
       commands.

    5. After chosing a selection and running a program, the mouse is left in an
       improper state.  For example, the mouse will either not display, not move
       on the screen or misbehaves in some other way.

       Answer:                                This generally occurs when a program uses the mouse COM port
       improperly.  For example, this would happen if your communications
       program used the mouse COM port instead of the modem port.  If this
       occurs, you should correct the offending program if at all possible
       (i.e. change your communications program to use the correct COM port).
       If this fails, create a batch file that calls the offending program and
       then FIXMOUSE.COM.  FIXMOUSE will reset the mouse, leaving it in the
       proper state for MAXimize.

    Appendix C: Networks and Shared PCs
    ===================================

    MAXimize supports Local Area Networks (LANs) and will also allow several
    people to share a single PC.  In both cases, users may share menus and/or
    have their own individual menus.  Also, each user may have their own
    options, such as colors.  Thus, each user may have different setups (colors,
    directories, passwords, main menus, menus, etc), while running off one copy
    of the MAXimize files.

    When you invoke MAXimize, you may provide a user identification.  This user
    identification indicates who is using MAXimize and thus, which setup to use.
    If the user identification is not specified, then the LAN version will
    prompt for it and the non-LAN version will use "MAXIMIZE" (which is the
    base).  This user identification must be a valid DOS file name with no
    extension.  The user ID may be greater than 7 characters, but the first 7
    characters must be unique.  You may specify your user identification with
    the /U switch or the "ID" environment variable (this may be changed during
    the installation of the LAN version of MAXimize).  If both are specified,
    the /U switch takes precedence.  To force MAXimize to prompt for the user
    identification, specify a user identification of question mark (/U?).

    To change the user identification while in MAXimize, press Alt+O N and then
    the new user ID (see the "New User ID" section of Chapter 4..  This is
    particularly useful when working with a PC shared by more than one person.

    As each user modifies the options, it is saved to a file with their user
    identification as the file name and an extension of SET.  This file is saved
    in the directory the current setup file was originally read from.

    For each computer on the LAN using MAXimize or a shared PC,  you MAY want to
    change the following:

       1. Add SET SPACE=12345678 to their AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  This reserves
          space in their environment pool.  This space may be needed when
          changing the user ID with the /U switch or when they press Alt+O N.
          If there is not enough space in the environment pool, error number
          902 will occur.

       2. Add the MAXimize installation directory to the PATH in their
          AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  This will allow the users to invoke MAXimize
          without switching to its drive/directory.

       3. Set the ID environment variable either by modifying their
          AUTOEXEC.BAT file or their network login script.  For example, use
          the DOS SET command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to set the ID
          environment variable (ie. SET ID=janet).

       4. Add a line at the end of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to invoke MAXimize, if
          the user wants MAXimize to be invoked when they power on their PCs.

    For the shared PC support, without the LAN version, you may want to force
    MAXimize to prompt for a user identification (instead of using "MAXIMIZE").
    This can easily be done by creating a batch file as follows:
                                                                             105

           ECHO OFF
           MAX /U? %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9

    To invoke MAXimize run the above batch file.  You will then be prompted for
    your user identification.  Another twist on this is to create a batch file
    for each user to invoke MAXimize.   Each batch file would be the same as
    that listed above, except the question mark should be replaced with a user
    identification.

    It is a good idea to include the user identification in the main menu title.
    This can be done using the &ID& special variable.  For example, the title
    could be "Main menu for user &ID&".  This will allow users to determine that
    the desired identification is being used.  Also, selections may use this
    special variable.  In this way the selection could act differently for each
    user.  For example, each user may have a separate directory that the
    selection switches to.  If this is the case, the selection's description
    should have the user identification in it (ex. "Word processing for &ID&").
    This will help identify which selections are dependent on the user's
    identification being correct.

    If some users have their own menus (besides a shared set), they can modify
    the Menus and Hot keys path of the options.  They should specify their
    directory and then the shared directory separated by a semi-colon.  To do
    this, create a directory to contain the shared menus (eq. C:\MAX\SHARED) and
    a directory for each user (eq. C:\MAX\userid - fill in their user ID) that
    wants their own menus.  Then each user who only wants the shared menus will
    specify a "Menus & Hot keys path" directory of  the shared directory
    (C:\MAX\SHARED).  Those users who want their own menus in addition to the
    shared menus would specify both (C:\MAX\userid;C:\MAX\SHARED).  Finally,
    users who want only their menus would specify their directory
    (C:\MAX\userid).  Please review the "Menus & Hot keys path" item in the
    "Directories" section of  chapter 4 for more information.

    NOTES:   The LAN version of MAXimize is required if you are running MAXimize
         on a LAN with multiple users.  Therefore, be sure to purchase a LAN
         license if you are going to use MAXimize on a LAN!

         Using this feature MAY require DOS 3.10 or higher (see error message
         number 902).
                                                                             106

    Appendix D: Messages
    ====================

    The message window reports any informational, warning or error messages.
    The majority of messages are warnings.  Besides the message, the window
    contains the message number in the lower right hand corner.  All messages
    are documented by this message number below.  After reading the message, you
    must hit the space bar to continue.  MAXimize will then take an appropriate
    action as documented.  You may then take corrective action, if any, for the
    message.

    The following is a list of message numbers on the left and the text of the
    message on the right.  Each message will have a description of the problem,
    the action MAXimize will take and any corrective action you might want to
    take.


    200  Menu [menu] not in [path]
         where [menu] will be replaced with a menu file name and [path] will be
         replaced with a directory name(s).
       Description: The menu shown cannot be found in the user menus and hot
                    keys path (also shown).
         Action:    The menu will be displayed using a title of the menu name
                    with no selections.
       Correction:  If the menu should exist, press Esc to return to prior menu.
                    Then locate the menu file on your hard disk and copy it to
                    the directory shown.  If the menu is new, add selections.

    201  Maximum number of menus reached, ignoring [menu]
         where [menu] will be replaced with the file name of the sub-menu
         requested.
       Description: A selection chosen has specified a sub-menu however, the
                    maximum number of nested menus has been reached.
         Action:    MAXimize will ignore the sub-menu and display the current
                    menu.
       Correction:  Transfer the selection that displays the sub-menu to a
                    higher level menu.

    202  Menu [menu] file format error
         where [menu] will be replaced with the file name of the menu in error.
       Description: The menu file's format is incorrect.
         Action:    MAXimize will ignore the menu and display the current/main
                    menu.
       Correction:  If the menu is a version 1 menu, then it should be converted
                    to version 2 format.  Run MAXCONVT.EXE specifying this file
                    as the only parameter.
                                                                             107

    203  Menu [menu] does not match encryption key
         where [menu] will be replaced with the file name of the menu in error.
       Description: The menu file's encryption key doesn't match the encryption
                    key for this MAXimize system.
         Action:    MAXimize will ignore the menu and display the current/main
                    menu.
       Correction:  If you are using a menu from another MAXimize system, you
                    must specify their encryption key.  Also, you may have
                    changed the encryption key in your options without first
                    removing password protection from all menus and selections.

    301  Selection has no action to perform
       Description: A selection or hot key was chosen for which no action (sub-
                    menu or commands) has been defined.
         Action:    MAXimize will ignore the request.
       Correction:  Either the wrong hot key was pressed or it must be updated
                    to have an action.

    302  All copies of [application] are in use
       Description: All licensed copies of the desired application are in use.
         Action:    MAXimize will ignore the request.
       Correction:  Either wait till a copy is no longer in use or notify your
                    LAN administrator.

    303  Selection has an invalid [function] parameter: [parameter]
         where [function] is the failing function and [parameter] is the bad
         parameter
       Description: The function failed due to the specification of an invalid
                    parameter.
         Action:    The execution of the selection is stopped.
       Correction:  Correct the bad function parameter.

    305  Program [TrackBy] has been disabled by the administrator
         where [TrackBy] is the application that has been disabled
       Description: The administrator has  disabled the  application, making  it
                    unavailable for use at this time.   Generally, this is  done
                    to allow  the  administrator  to apply  maintenance  to  the
                    application.
         Action:    The execution of the selection is stopped.
       Correction:  Wait till the administrator has enabled the application.

    400  Total number or length of commands is too large
       Description: The maximum length of the commands specified in a selection
                    or the number of commands is too large.
         Action:    Selection cannot be saved.
       Correction:  Create a batch file with the commands needed and then
                    execute the batch file.
                                                                             108

    401  No room in menu for selection(s). Change menu ID type to allow more.
       Description: You have attempted to insert a selection(s) into a menu that
                    would exceed the maximum number of selections allowed.
         Action:    Operation is not allowed.
       Correction:  The menu has the alpha-numeric option ID.  Its maximum
                    number of selections can be increased from 36 to 99 by
                    changing the option ID to numeric.  Otherwise, split this
                    menu into smaller menus.

    402  No room in menu for selection(s)
       Description: You have attempted to insert a selection(s) into a menu that
                    would exceed the maximum number or selections allowed.
         Action:    Operation is not allowed.
       Correction:  Split this menu into smaller menus.

    403  Total length of menu's descriptions and messages is too large
       Description: The total length of this menu's description and help message
                    fields is too large.
         Action:    Operation is not allowed.
       Correction:  Shorten the description and or help messages for some of the
                    selections on this menu.

    404  Sub-menu is a variable ([menu]) - cannot process selection
         where [menu] is the sub-menu name.
       Description: The copy/transfer/find function cannot process through a
                    selection that contains a variable in the sub-menu name.
         Action:    The sub-menu is not displayed.
       Correction:  Use/define another route to get to the desired sub-menu.

    405  Cannot copy or transfer an empty Hot Key
       Description: The copy/transfer/find function cannot be used on a Hot Key
                    that has not been defined.
         Action:    The copy or transfer operation is aborted.
       Correction:  Do not copy or transfer an empty Hot Key.

    406  Cannot insert into hot keys
       Description: The copy/transfer operation was used to copy more than one
                    selection to the hot keys menu.
         Action:    Operation is not allowed.
       Correction:  Copy/transfer selections to the hot keys one at a time.

    601  File MAXLOG.DBF cannot be found in current directory or in the
         directory defined in the MAXDIR enviroment variable.
       Description: The MAXLOG.DBF database file could not be located in the
                    current directory or through the MAXDIR environment

         room" or a return code.
       Description: The user identification variable could not be set in the DOS
                    environment.
         Action:    Previous user identification will be used.  MAXimize will
                    quit if it was called from the MENU.BAT batch file and there
                    is no previous user identification.
       Correction:  If the reason code is "not enough room", add "SET
                    SPACE=12345678" to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  This reserves
                    space in your environment pool for this purpose. If the
                    reason code is anything else, check your DOS version (use
                    the DOS VER command).  If your DOS version is less than
                    3.10, then upgrade to a newer DOS version. Otherwise, report
                    the problem.

                    etc.).  This file is the user's identification with an
                    extension of SET.
         Action:    The default settings are used.
       Correction:  MAXimize will search the default directory as specified by
                    the /D switch, the directory specified by the MAXDIR
                    environment variable, the directory MAXimize was invoked
                    from, the current directory, the directories in the DOS PATH

    904  Unable to allocate memory required for copy/transfer
       Description: MAXimize must allocate additional memory to do the copy or
                    transfer functions.  However, this failed.

       Correction:  Make sure you have enough memory on your machine to run
                    MAXimize.  Also, if you were processing multiple selections,
                    try doing one at a time.
                                                                             112

    905  Options directories are invalid, changed to initial values
       Description: One or more of the directories specified in the options does
                    not exist.
         Action:    These directories will be reset to their initial setting.
                    This will either be the directory MAXimize was invoked from
                    or none at all, depending on the directory that is bad.
       Correction:  Review all directories specified in the options to ensure
                    they are correct.

    906  Mouse not installed - cannot be used
       Description: The mouse driver software is not installed.

       Description: MAXimize was unable to load the program.
         Action:    The operation fails.
       Correction:  If the filespec is your comspec, then correct the comspec
                    specification in your environment variables to point to your
                    command processor (COMMAND.COM).  Otherwise, make sure that
                    the program specified as filespec is there.

    909  File line too large, read terminated
       Description: MAXimize could not read a text file in since the file had a
                    line length that was too long.
         Action:    The text is not read in by the editor.
       Correction:  Check the length of the files record and shorten those that
                    are too long.

                    version of MAXimize.
         Action:    For update operations, you will be allowed to update the
                    selection.  However, if you change a selection and then
                    accept those changes, the lock must then be obtained. This
                    allows you to view a selection even though it could not be
                    locked.  For all other operations, the operation fails.
       Correction:  Make sure no one else is using or updating the menu.
                                                                             113

    911  Access error ([code]).  User already in MAXimize.
         where [code] is an internal code indicating the type of error.
       Description: MAXimize could not open the batch file used to execute a
                    selection's commands because it is already in use.  There is
                    one allocated for each user and session combination.
         Action:    MAXimize will request the user identification to be used.
       Correction:  Make sure no one else is using this user identification and
                    session.

    950  Selection was built by MAXimize Gold - unable to update
       Description: MAXimize could update this selection because it was built by

     Introduction:
     =============

     This document contains information more current than the manual.  It
     explains what documentation files are available, has information to
     get you started quickly and includes a history of changes made to
     MAXimize.

     For the shareware version of MAXimize, a shareware panel will appear
     when MAXimize is started.  This panel should appear once a day.  Also,
     MAXIMIZE.INI is a special initialization file that must not be
     deleted!


     Other Documentation Files:
     ==========================

     FEATURES.DOC - lists the major features of MAXimize Gold & Basic.
     WHATSNEW.DOC - lists the new features of version 3.0
     ORDER.DOC    - order form and instructions for ordering MAXimize.
     VENDOR.DOC   - vendor distribution form.
     MANUAL.DOC   - copy of manual (licensed copies get a nicely printed
                    and bound manual).


     Installing MAXimize:
     ====================

     To install MAXimize, simply run the INSTALL.EXE program provided.
     This program should be located in the directory you unpacked the files
     into.


     Starting MAXimize:
     ==================

     After installing MAXimize, you can start it by either entering MENU or
     MAX at the DOS prompt from the MAXimize directory.  For example:

          C:
          CD \MAX
          MAX



     Getting Started Quickly:
     ========================

     If you want to get started using MAXimize quickly and know a little
     about DOS, then keep the following in mind:


     1) After starting MAXimize, sample menus will be displayed.  The
        selections on these menus will either:

        A) Display another menu (These selections have "menu" added to the
           end of their descriptions as in "Games menu").

                                                                          3

        B) "ECHO" a statement to the screen.  These selections should be
           changed to run your program.  Simply change the "ECHO" to your
           program name and either clear or change the "Parameters."
        C) Perform some work. This is done in the menus that start with
           "SAMP".

        An "ECHO" is usually done, such as with the "Word Processor"
        selection. These menus are provided to give you one possible way
        to organize your applications.  Feel free to update these menus to
        fit your needs.

        NOTE:  Any menu starting with SAMP will be replaced when you
               upgrade.  The "SAMP" menus are displayed by selecting
               "Samples menu" from the main menu.  Also, the sample menus
               assume that the directory containing DOS is in your PATH.

     2) The menu bar is displayed in the top line of the screen.  It is
        activated by the slash (/), Alt or F10 keys.  From the menu bar,
        you may choose file to display another menu or exit from MAXimize.
        The edit selection in the menu bar has selections to update the
        menu displayed or the selections within the menu.  The options
        selection allows you to change MAXimize's options (such as the
        colors).  And the help selection in the menu bar allows you to get
        help for a selection, for MAXimize or about MAXimize (its edition
        and version).

     3) The status line is the bottom line of the screen.  It contains a
        list of keys most often needed.  These keys will change as you do
        different tasks (such as add, update, delete, etc.).  In general,
        you should look at the status line if you're not sure which key to
        press.

     4) If you need help at any time, simply press F2.  MAXimize contains
        extensive help that is context sensitive (that is, MAXimize
        displays help that pertains to the operation you're currently
        doing).  If you are not sure how to use the help facility, simply
        press F1 for an explanation.

     Ordering MAXimize:
     ==================

     When you order MAXimize, you will receive a beautiful manual, a
     reference card and the latest version of MAXimize on a diskette.  Max
     Software will provide support for any problems or questions you might
     have for at least 90 days after you order MAXimize.  You will also be
     notified when there are updates to or newer versions of MAXimize.

                                                                          4


     To order MAXimize (or additional copies of MAXimize), simply print off
     the order form.  The order form can be printed by entering "PRINT
     ORDER.DOC" at the DOS prompt from the MAXimize installation directory.
     Then simply follow the instructions on the order form.  If you will be
     using MAXimize on a LAN, be sure to call for a LAN license (the
     software is different for LANs).


     Getting Help:
     =============

     To get help, you may:

     1) Send a letter to:     Max Software
                              9121 141st West
                              Taylor Ridge, IL 61284

     2) Send a message to CompuServe user ID 71170,740

     3) Call the MAXimize phone line at 309-798-2533

     Be sure to include your name, address, phone number and company name
     (if applicable).  The text of the letter should adequately describe
     the problem you are having.  If a selection is causing the problem,
     please include information about the selection.


     Common Problems:
     ================

     1) If after your selection runs you are:

          A) at the DOS prompt
          B) positioned in the main menu instead of the sub-menu.

        Then you probably are running a batch file from a selection (the
        "Commands" section) without including the tilde symbol (~) prefix.
        Add an "ECHO ON" statement before any commands - this will show
        each command as it is executing.  The last one executed is the
        batch file causing the problem.  To fix the problem, simply add
        the tilde symbol immediately before the batch file being ran.

     2) If you lose position on the sub-menu (main menu is displayed)
        after the selection runs, then the commands invoked through the
        selection has probably invoked MAXimize again.  This may have been
        done because of the first problem above (going back to the DOS
        prompt after running a selection).  Remove the line that invokes
        MAXimize again from the commands.
