```
                       Version 1.01
                       ============
Version 1.01 introduces two additional cursor control functions:

Press Ctrl-Home to move the cursor to the upper left corner of the screen.
Press Ctrl-End to move the cursor to the end of the current note.


                       Version 1.1
                       ===========
Version 1.1 introduces the Renumber Note function.   This function 
allows you to change the order of your notes. 

Press Ctrl-F3 to renumber the current note.  The cursor will move next
to "Note #".  Type the new number of the current note, then press 
<Enter>.  The current note will be renumbered, and other notes will be 
renumbered according to the sequence you selected.  Since you are 
rearranging existing notes, the number you enter must be the number
of an existing note.


                       Version 1.2
                       ===========
Version 1.2 expands the hotkey selections to include F11 and F12
combinations, and fixes the problem with the hotkey program in
version 1.1.  The Help screen on monochrome monitors displays
properly.  Also, registered copies now display the word "Registered" 
in the lower right corner.

                        
                       Version 1.3
                       ===========
Version 1.3 adds support for monochrome laptops that have a color
card.  Type NOTEWARE /M to tell NoteWare that your laptop has a
monochrome screen.  The Ctrl-left and Ctrl-right arrows now move 
the cursor one word at a time.  Ctrl-PgUp moves to the first 
note; Ctrl-PgDn moves to the last.  Major static "snow" on CGA's
is suppressed.
                        
                       Version 1.4
                       ===========
PRINTNW, a separate utility program to print notes, has been 
added in version 1.4.  It allows you to choose one, many, or
all notes to print, on the printer number of your choice.
You can choose the number of lines per page, whether to
include the time & date of the printing, and whether each note
should be printed on a separate page.
