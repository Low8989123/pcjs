PC-SIG UPDATES PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM

For Immediate Release


PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM UPDATED TO INCLUDE A NEW USER INTERFACE AND MORE
THAN 800 MB OF PROGRAMS June 21, 1992, SUNNYVALE, CALIF. - PC-SIG, Inc.
today announced availability of The Eleventh Edition of the PC-SIG Library
on CD-ROM.  The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM contains over 800 megabytes of
shareware and includes more than 300 new programs, 550 updated programs,
and the addition of 75 megabytes of Windows 3.x shareware.  The
user-interface has been completely re-engineered to take advantage of the
HyperWriter! hypermedia and multimedia authoring system from NTERGAID, Inc.

The implementation of HyperWriter! provides significant performance and
ease of use enhancements.  Programs can access and download much faster
than with previous editions.  Programs have been reorganized and indexed
for better referencing.  Users just c lick with a mouse, or point with the
cursor, on a program name to see a complete description of the program.
Downloading or copying a program is handled automatically by HyperWriter!
Addition of a preview option is especially important for anyone who uses
images, icons, or fonts.  "You can preview the whole library of images to
find the right one," according to Bruce Kent, product development manager.
"This CD finally makes it possi ble to conserve your disk space and paper,
yet still have all the information you need to make an informed decision,"
said Kent.

All new and updated programs have been reviewed and tested by PC-SIG. Every
program goes through extensive virus checking using the most recent version
of VIRUSCAN from McAfee Associates, and other anti-virus software.
According to Kent, "In the ten ye ars we've distributed shareware, we have
never had a confirmed report of a virus on any of our distributed programs
or CD-ROMs."

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, Eleventh Edition has a list price of $179.

Upgrades from previous editions are available for $99.

Users of PC-SIG's Essential Home & Business Collection CD-ROM can upgrade
for $120.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

                               WHAT IS TRANSCAN?
                               ----------------- 

     TranScan provides an easy way to scan compressed files for Viruses
     using ViruScan by McAfee and Associates.  It supports the nine most
     popular compression programs including ZIP, ARJ, LZH, ARC, etc.  It
     will convert files to your default compression method, delete unwanted
     files, add selected files, and insert ZIP and ARJ file comments.  It
     supports imbedded compressed files and will also retain directory
     structures saved in ZIP, ARJ, and LZH files.  TranScan will test
     TeleDisk files, convert GIF files to JPG, covert JPG files to GIF, and
     GIFLite and GifTest GIF files. 

                          TRANSCAN & WILDCAT! BBS V3+
                          --------------------------- 

     TranScan also works with version 3+ of the Wildcat BBS.  When used in
     Wildcat's SCANFILE.BAT, TranScan checks each upload for Integrity,
     Viruses, and file Date or Age.  It displays color output to the on-
     line caller and updates all name, date, and file size changes to the
     Wildcat database.  It will even take FILE_ID.DIZ or DESC.SDI
     descriptions found in an archive and import them into the Wildcat file
     description.  All activities can take place immediately after the
     upload or in a daily event.

                         HOW TRANSCAN.DOC IS ORGANIZED
                         ----------------------------- 

     We want you to be able to install and run TranScan as easily as
     possible.  In fact many of you will have already installed the program
     and processed several files before reading this manual.  TranScan
     really is that easy to install. 

     We will start with the installation process. We'll show you how to
     create a few text files to use some of the advanced features of
     Transcan.  Next, we'll give you a Quick Start and let you process a
     file.  You will then be given a number of examples to demonstrate the
     many things you can do with Transcan. 

     You will find additional information in the appendix, too.

                            HOW TO INSTALL TRANSCAN
                            ----------------------- 

     TranScan is packaged in compressed form under the name TSCNxxx.ZIP.
     xxx represents the version number (i.e. TSCN310.ZIP is TranScan
     version 3.10).  The filename might not end in ZIP but rather might be
     ARJ, ARC, LZH, EXE, etc.  The important thing is that you Uncompress
     the file.  Since you are reading these docs I'm quite sure you have
     already done this. 

     TRANSCAN.EXE, TRANSCAN.OVR, and TRANSCAN.HLP must be copied into a
     directory that is in your path statement.  To determine which
     directories this includes you can type PATH at the DOS prompt and you
     will see a list of all the areas in your path.  For example: 

     C:\>PATH
     PATH=C:\;C:\DOS;C:\UTIL;C:\WC30; 

     Of course you could create a TRANSCAN path and then modify your
     CONFIG.SYS file by changing the SET PATH line.  For example: 

     SET PATH=C:\;C:\DOS;C:\UTIL;C:\WC30;C:\TRANSCAN; 

     If you changed the path in your CONFIG.SYS you would need to boot your
     computer before the new path would take place. 

     Let's assume that you have decided to not modify your CONFIG.SYS file
     but plan on copying the files to your C:\UTIL directory.  Let's also
     assume that you have uncompressed the files onto a floppy disk in
     Drive A.  You will need to do the following: 

     A:
     A:\>C:\COPY TRANSCAN.EXE C:\UTIL
     A:\>COPY TRANSCAN.OVR C:\UTIL
     A:\>COPY TRANSCAN.HLP C:\UTIL 

     TranScan should now be on your system.  You should now run the program
     by changing to the drive it is located on and typing TRANSCAN.  For
     example: 

     C:\>TRANSCAN 

     You should now see the TranScan screen and Menu.  You will notice that
     on the bottom row of the display it lists the various keys that are
     available.  You can press F1 to see specific help information
     pertaining to the prompt that the cursor is on.  You can Press F2 to
     enter the setup menu, press F3 to Pick a file to process, and press
     Ctrl-Enter to start processing files.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 


     SetUp 

     If the TranScan screen and menu are on your display press the F2 key
     now.  If they are not type TRANSCAN at the DOS prompt and then press
     F2. 

     TranScan SetUp is very easy to use.  You will notice in the bottom
     right hand corner are listed special keys that are available.  Press
     the F1 key and a HELP screen will be displayed.  Press ESC to return
     to the SetUp screen.  If your cursor is on the top line press F3 and a
     Select list will be displayed.  You can use the arrows or tabs to move
     around in this list.  Pressing the Enter Key will select the option
     under the cursor. 

     Most of the items you will need to select will be on pages 1 & 2.  If
     you are a Wildcat sysop you will also need to select options on page
     11.  The following is a summary of the contents of all the SetUp
     pages: 

          Page 1    General Set-Up
      
          Page 2    Path/FileName Set-Up
          Page 3    ViruScan Set-Up

          Page 5    ZIP Files
          Page 6    LZH Files
          Page 7    ARC Files
                    PAK & SDN Files
          Page 8    GIF Files

                    TD0 Files
          Page 11   Wildcat Related Processing

     You can move from page to page by using the PageUp and PageDn keys,
     using the Up and Down arrow keys, and also using the TAB key to move
     from field to field.  You can jump to any page by holding down the ALT
     key and pressing a number key.  For example, to move to page 6 you
     would press ALT-6, to move to page 10 press ALT-0.  To move to the
     Wildcat Related Processing page (page 11) press ALT-W ("W" is for
     "Wildcat!").

     Let's start by setting up Page 1 (Press ALT-1 if you are not already
     there).

     Default Compression Method: .ZIP

          You may either press the "-" "+" or space key to select your
          default compression method, or press F3 and move the cursor
          to your choice and press enter.  The Default Compression
          Method is what you want ALL compressed files converted to

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 

          after they have been uncompressed and scanned.  For example:
          If you select ZIP and you TranScan an ARJ file, it will be a
          ZIP file after it is finished. 

     Time Stamp Option: Keep 

          Move to this field by pressing enter or tab.  Press F3 and
          you will be presented with three choices: KEEP, OLDEST,
          YOUNGEST, and CURRENT.  TranScan Time Stamps the compressed
          file based on your selection here.  If you select KEEP the
          original file date and time will be retained.  If you select
          OLDEST the compressed file will take the date of the OLDEST
          file inside it.  If you select YOUNGEST the compressed file
          will take the date of the YOUNGEST file inside it.  If you
          select CURRENT the current date and time will be stamped on
          the file.  Choose this carefully, it has a profound effect
          if you plan on rejecting files based on age.   

     Reject Files Based On: None 

          Move to this field and again press F3.  With TranScan you
          can choose to not reject files based on Age or Date (select
          NONE), reject files based on AGE, or reject files based on a
          specific DATE.  Choose this carefully, it is very much
          dependant on the selection you made above for "Time Stamp
          Option". 

     Disposition of FAILED files: None 

          First let me explain all the reasons a file may fail the
          TranScan process: 

               1.   It may not UnCompress properly (e.g., Bad CRC,
                    file corrupted, etc). 

               2.   It may contain Viruses detected by SCAN.

               3.   It may be rejected based on Age or Date.

          TranScan allows you to choose what to do with these files.
          You can do nothing (select NONE), have the file RENAMED to
          xxxxxxxx.BAD, have the file MOVED to a specific directory,
          or have the file DELETED.  If you select MOVED you will then
          be prompted for the PATH where the files should be moved.
          Make sure this path exists.  For example: 

          C:\BAD 

     Selective Scan (TranScan.Did)? N 

          TranScan can create a listing of files processed by
          TranScan.  If this option is selected TranScan will check
          the TranScan.Did list to see if this file has been processed

          before processing it.  If you are updating all the files in
          your collection I would recommend you use this feature.   

     Exclude ReCompressing: N 

          TranScan by default will ReCompress all files after Scanning
          them.  If you do not want files that are already in the
          Default Compression Method format recompressed then select
          no.  It takes so little time to ReCompress the files I
          recommend you select yes.  This is extremely helpful when a
          new version of your favorite compression program comes out.
          You can have TranScan ReCompress Everything! 

     Compress Non-Compressed Files: N 

          If you would like to compress all files that are non-
          compressed (like TXT and DOC files) you can select this
          feature.   

     Work Drive: C Drive Type: Hard Disk                    K Free: 20,231 

          You should now be on page 2 of the TranScan Set-Up.  Press
          the letter of the drive you want to use as the Work Drive.
          This drive should have at least 1,000K free (see "K Free:"
          at right edge of display).   

          TranScan will use this drive to uncompress all files and
          also to SWAP iteself out of memory if it cannot access
          enough EMS mormory to do this. 

          HINT: I have 4MB of RAM in my computer so I set up a 1MB ram
          drive as my TranScan work directory.  This increased
          processing speed tremendously. 

     TranScan.Log File: C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.LOG 

          TranScan keeps a detailed log of all activities it performs.
          You can call this log anything you want and put it in any
          directory.  The default of course is TranScan.Log located in
          the same directory TranScan.Exe is found.  A log will not be
          created if you leave this field blank. 

     TranScan.Add File: C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.ADD 

          Some people want a file added to every compressed file.
          Usually this is a BBS AD or a Special Interest Group (SIG)
          AD.  Write the path and filename of your TranScan.Add file.
          I would recommend you place this file in the same directory
          as your TranScan.Exe file and call it TranScan.Add.  For
          example: 

          Path of TranScan.Exe     C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.EXE
          Path of TranScan.Add     C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.ADD

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 


          Press the F4 key and you will be able to edit this file.  In
          this text file you will need to include the full filename
          and path of the file(s) you want added to every compressed
          file TranScan processes.  For example: 

          C:\SIG\MY_SIG.AD 

     TranScan.Del File: C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.DEL 

          Don't you just hate all those BBS & SIG ADS that get stuffed
          into the files you download? <grin>  TranScan will delete
          these for you saving all that valuable file space.  Write
          the path and filename of your TranScan.Del file.  I would
          recommend you place this file in the same directory as your
          TranScan.Exe file and call it TranScan.Del.  For example: 

          Path of TranScan.Exe     C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.EXE
          Path of TranScan.Del     C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.DEL

          Press the F4 key and you will be able to edit this file.  In
          this text file you will need to include the filename of any
          file you want deleted.  Be careful, TranScan WILL delete all
          files listed in this file if it finds them inside an
          archive.  For example: 

          MY_SIG.ADD
          BBS.ADD
          CONFIG.SYS
          AUTOEXEC.BAT
          COMMAND.COM 

     TranScan.Not File: C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.NOT 

          The TranScan Not file is a list of all the directories you
          NEVER want processed by TranScan.  Again, I would place it
          in the same directory as TranScan.Exe (see above) and you
          can create or edit it by pressing F4.  I don't want my DOS,
          UTIL, and WC30 directories TranScanned so I have included
          the following paths in this file: 

          C:\DOS
          C:\UTIL
          C:\WC30 

          The directories should NOT be followed with the "\"
          character. 

     TranScan.Bad: C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.BAD 

          A lot of users wanted all the FAILED files listed to a
          specific file.  That is what TranScan.Bad does.  If a file
          fails for any reason it's full path and filename will be
          written to this file.  If the file is Relocated (Disposition

          of FAILED files: MOVED) the path listed will be its new
          path. 

     TranScan.Cmt: C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.CMT 

          Many users like to attach a file comment to all their ZIP or
          ARJ files.  You may have already created such a comment.  If
          so press the F3 key and move around in the Select list until
          you find your comment file.  If you have not created a
          comment file you can enter a path and filename (yes, again I
          recommend the same directory as TranScan.Exe and the name
          TranScan.Cmt).  You can then press the F4 key and edit your
          own file. 

          HINT:  If you would like the comments stripped from all
          files processed by TranScan then create a ZERO byte file.
          You do this by entering the path and filename then pressing
          F4 and saving the blank file.  File Comments take up a lot
          of space because they are not compressed in a ZIP or ARJ
          file, they are just attached. 

     TranScan.Did: C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.DID 

          This is a listing of files processed by TranScan.  The list
          is created and read only if "Selective Scan (TranScan.Did)?"
          is "Y" on page 1.  If you are updating all the files in your
          collection I would recommend you use this feature.   

     Saving Your SetUp 

          To save your TranScan SetUp press F2.  You will then be
          asked to press Ctrl-Enter.  You will then be returned to the
          TranScan Menu. 

                                  QUICK START
                                  ----------- 

     I promised that I would give you a quick start, so here it goes.  If
     TranScan is not running then type TRANSCAN at the DOS prompt.  Pick a
     file to process.  If you already know the filename then enter it and
     press Ctrl-Enter.  TranScan will process this file if it exists. 

     If you would like to PICK a file to process then press the F3 key and
     you will be presented with the File PICK list.  Pick a file and press
     enter.  Then press Ctrl-Enter and TranScan will process this file. 

     If you would like to process all the files in a certain path then use
     *.* as the filename and include the Path Name in the PATH field.
     Press Ctrl-Enter and TranScan will process these files. 

     If you would like to convert all the LZH files on Drive C to your

                        SCANFILE.BAT & WILDCAT! BBS V3+
                        -------------------------------

     If you are running a Wildcat v3+ BBS then TranScan can process all
     incoming files for you while the Uploader is on-line.  To do this you
     need to create a single ScanFile.Bat file in your Wildcat Home
     Directory (where MAKEWILD.DAT lives, usually C:\WC30).  This
     ScanFile.Bat file needs only to be one line as follows:

     TranScan %1

     Make sure there are no ScanFile.Run files in any of the node work
     directories. Wildcat gives preference to a TranScan.Run file over a
     TranScan.Bat file.  If you are running Wildcat Multi-Node TranScan
     will determine what it should without separate TranScan.Run files.

     You should also add the following line to any of your daily event
     batch files:

     TRANSCAN  -F

     You will also need to enter your setup information on Page 11 of the
     TranScan SetUp.  To get there from the main menu just press ALT-W ("W"
     is for Wildcat).

     MakeWild.Dat     C:\WC30\MAKEWILD.DAT

          Your path and filename to your MakeWild.Dat file should be
          listed on the first line.  If it is not, it is because
          TranScan could not find it in your path.  If this is the
          case, please enter the full path and filename of your
          MakeWild.Dat file now.

     COM Output Display Type: Box

          You have a choice of several different displays sent to the
          on-line caller.  They include BOX, TEXT, DOTS, PROP, and
          NONE.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 


          BOX is similar to the display you see on the SySop side of
          the Display.  It presents the TranScan screen and check
          marks check off the various actions as they are performed.
          Messages are also displayed to the on-line caller. 

          TEXT is just text displayed telling the user what is
          happening.  It's not as fancy as the BOX. 

          DOTS are just periods that are written to the screen as
          things process so the user does not think the computer is
          locked up.  PROP is similar in concept, a propellor cursor
          spins as the various tasks are completed. 

          NONE of course means that NO output is displayed to the
          caller. 

     Write to ACTIVITY.xxx Log? Y 

          If this is selected TranScan will write a message to your
          Wildcat Activity.xxx log. It will indicate if the file is
          OK! or why it failed.  If it contains a virus it will even
          tell you what kind of virus it discovered. 

     Update Wildcat File Date? N 

          If you would like the date of the file in the Wildcat File
          Database to be the same as the new date on the file then
          select this yes.   

          Hint: I would recommend you NOT do this, because the NEW
          FILE list feature of the Wildcat BBS will be adversely
          effected by this. 

     Activity to perform:                    Do When?
     --------------------                    --------

          TranScan lets you determine when the various processing
          should be performed.  The choices are SCANFILE.BAT, EVENT,
          and NEVER.  Use the space, "+", or "-" keys to select your
          choice or press F3 to use the select box.

          If you select "ScanFile.Bat" then the processing will take
          place while the user is on-line.

          If you select "Event" then the file path and file name will
          be written to a TRANSCAN.LST file.  The Event should run at
          some point in a daily event.  The command line for running
          the event is as follows:

          TRANSCAN -F

          Note: If none of your "Do When?" settings are "Event" then
          TranScan will not have anything to do in the event.  I would



                                     - 12 -


     T r a n S c a n                "The Ultimate File Scanner & Converter"
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 

          recommend you go ahead and setup a TranScan event just in
          case you should change one of the settings at a later time. 

          If you select "Never" then that process will NEVER take
          place for the files. 

     Scan Files for Viruses:                 ScanFile.Bat

          This is when the files are Scanned for Viruses.  I would
          recommend you ALWAYS scan for viruses in the ScanFile.Bat
          process. 

     Add Files from TranScan.Add:            ScanFile.Bat

          This is when the files you listed in your TranScan.Add file
          will be added.   

     Delete Files from TranScan.Del:         ScanFile.Bat

          This is when the files you listed in your TranScan.Del file
          will be deleted.   

     Write Desc.Sdi files:                   Never

          TranScan can take the file description entered by the caller
          and create a Desc.Sdi description file and insert it into
          the archive.  It will only create this file if 1) a
          File_Id.Diz file does not exist and 2) a Desc.Sdi file does
          not exist.

     Read File_Id.Diz & Desc.Sdi files:      ScanFile.Bat

          Many Shareware authors are including File_Id.Diz description
          files with their software packages.  This is often the most
          complete description because it was written by the author.
          Desc.Sdi files are also the standard now for description
          files.  If this is selected TranScan will read the
          description from the File_Id.Diz or Desc.Sdi file and import
          the description into the Wildcat File Database Description.   

          Note: Users love this feature because they can create a
          Desc.Sdi file before upload and not have to type the file
          description by hand when Wildcat asks for it.   

     Compress Files after processing:        ScanFile.Bat

          TranScan can compress and convert files while the user waits
          on-line.   

     Process GIF & JPG Files:                Never

          This is when the GIFTest, GIFLite, GIF2JPG, and JPG2GIF
          processing you selected on page 8 would take place.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 


          Note: If you plan on using this feature I would recommend
          you only do it in an Event.  Most of these programs are
          incredibly slow and the uploader will probably drop carrier
          before waiting for them to finish. 

     Add Arj/Zip Comment to File:            ScanFile.Bat

          This is when the TranScan.Cmt file will be added to the
          archive. 

     Delay After Processing: File Passed: 0 Seconds 

          Some users like to have the TranScan display screen delay
          for a few seconds after it is done processing before
          returning control to Wildcat.   

     Delay After Processing: File Failed: 6 Seconds 

          Some users like to have the TranScan display screen delay
          for a few seconds after it is done processing before
          returning control to Wildcat.   

     Min. Sec. Level: 9999 

          A lot of SysOps asked for this feature.  What it does is
          allow users above the "Min. Sec. Level" to upload files and
          not have TranScan do any processing on them until the Event.   

          This is handy if you use the local upload feature.  TranScan
          detects if a user has a security level higher than this
          value. If they do TranScan writes the file path and name to
          the TRANSCAN.LST file (read by TRANSCAN -F).  It precedes
          the name with a "#" number sign.  In the Event TranScan then
          knows that this file has not yet been processed.  The
          processing normally done during the ScanFile.Bat process and
          the processing normally done during the event will both be
          completed.

                                  SCANFILE.BAT
                                  ------------ 

     The SCANFILE.BAT file used with Wildcat! BBS v3+ need only contain one
     line: 

     TRANSCAN %1 

     This is much simpler than many of the other 3rd party Wildcat
     utilities that require you to include a SET WCNODEID=1 in your CAT.BAT
     file and add a CD\WC30\WCWORK\NODE%WCNODEID% line to your SCANFILE.BAT
     file.  TranScan reads the information for you from other sources. 

     If you use MsgCat, a 3rd party Wildcat utility by _________, you may
     wish to use the following SCANFILE.BAT file: 
      
     tranScan %1 
     if exist c:\wc30\wcwork\node%wcnodeid%\scanfile.bad MSGCAT 0 BAD %1 
     if not exist c:\wc30\wcwork\node%wcnodeid%\scanfile.bad MSGCAT 0 OK %1 

                                   EVENT.BAT
                                   --------- 

     You should add the following to one of your daily event batch files: 

     TRANSCAN -F 

                                 CONVERT FILES
                                 ------------- 

     From time to time a new compression method becomes available and
     everyone decides to convert their files to the new, tighter
     compression method.  TranScan makes this easy because it not only
     converts the files, but it changes the name and size in the Wildcat
     database.   

     Let's assume you plan on converting all your files on drive D: to the
     ARJ format.  Since the files have already been scanned once you don't
     see a need for that at this time.  Here is a sample batch file: 

     REN C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.DID C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.001
     REN C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.002 C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.DID
     TRANSCAN D:\*.* -S -VOFF -CARJ -D -M120
     REN C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.DID C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.002
     REN C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.001 C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.DID 

     If you are using the TranScan.Did feature on Page 1 of the setup you
     would need to rename this file (here assumed to be in c:\util) and
     then rename it back.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 


     "D:\*.* -S" tells TranScan to process all files on drive D in all
     subdirectories. 

     "-VOFF" tells TranScan to turn SCAN.EXE off. 

     "-CARJ" tells TranScan to convert the files to *.ARJ format. 

     "-D" tells TranScan to only process files not in the TRANSCAN.DID file
     and after a file has been processed add it's name to the TRANSCAN.DID
     file. 

     "-M120" tells TranScan to only process files for 120 minutes (2 hours) 

     You could run this event every night from 1-3am and eventually
     TranScan would have converted every file.  Isn't that painless? 

                          UPDATING COMPRESSION METHOD
                          --------------------------- 

     Occasionally the author of a compression method like PKZIP finds a
     better way to compress files faster and smaller.  With these advances
     come the need to compress our files even further.  TranScan can do
     this for you as well.   

     NOTE:  Make sure you have "Exclude Recompressing: N" on page 1 of the
     SetUp.  If this is marked "Y" the files will not be ReCompressed. 

     REN C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.DID C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.001
     REN C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.002 C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.DID
     TRANSCAN D:\*.* -S -VOFF -X- -D -M120
     REN C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.DID C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.002
     REN C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.001 C:\UTIL\TRANSCAN.DID 

     If you are using the TranScan.Did feature on Page 1 of the setup you
     would need to rename this file (here assumed to be in c:\util) and
     then rename it back.   

     "D:\*.* -S" tells TranScan to process all files on drive D in all
     subdirectories. 

     "-VOFF" tells TranScan to turn SCAN.EXE off. 

     "-X-" tells TranScan to NOT eXclude Recompressing. 

     "-D" tells TranScan to only process files not in the TRANSCAN.DID file
     and after a file has been processed add it's name to the TRANSCAN.DID
     file. 

     "-M120" tells TranScan to only process files for 120 minutes (2 hours) 

     You could run this event every night from 1-3am and eventually
     TranScan would have converted every file.  Isn't that painless?

                           PROCESS INBOUND MAIL FILES
                           -------------------------- 

     If you run a front in mail program you could have TranScan check the
     inbound directory for any files received after the mail has been
     tossed.  For this example we will assume that you are using Binkley
     and our inbound file area is C:\BINKLEY\INBOUND. Add this command line
     to your AFTRMAIL.BAT file: 

     TRANSCAN C:\BINKLEY\INBOUND\*.* -VON 

     If you are running a program like Wildcat File Forward by Derek
     Koopowitz you would NOT want to convert the inbound files because
     doing so would mess up the TIC files.  You could still scan them for
     viruses before they are tossed into your file areas by using the
     following command line: 

     TRANSCAN C:\BINKLEY\INBOUND\*.* -VON -CNONE 

     Another approach would be to have your file forward areas in
     subdirectories below a certain directory.  For example: 

     D:\WCFF\WDNET2
     D:\WCFF\WDNET3 

     You could then have Wildcat File Forward TOSS the files to their
     proper directories and then run TranScan as follows: 

     TRANSCAN C:\WCFF\*.* -S -VON -D 

     It would only process each file once because of the "-D" or
     TranScan.Did switch.  Because of the "-S" or Subdirectory switch it
     would only process the files in these three directories: 

     D:\WCFF
     D:\WCFF\WDNET2
     D:\WCFF\WDNET3 

     NOTE: You would not be able to do this if you forward files to anyone
     else.  The TIC files your system created would be wrong. 

                            PROCESS LOCAL DOWNLOADS
                            ----------------------- 

     I have all my downloads go to my Qmodem download directory.  In fact,
     I have created a batch file to start Qmodem and process all the
     uploads immediately after I quite Qmodem.  My QMODEM.BAT file is as
     follows: 






                                     - 23 -

     QMODEM.EXE
     TRANSCAN C:\QMODEM\DOWNLOAD\*.* -VON -D 

                           GIF & JPG FILE PROCESSING
                           ------------------------- 

     A lot of SysOps are converting their GIF images to JPG because they
     take up less space and download times are much shorter.  Doing this
     conversion can be time consuming, so here is a way to keep up with it
     easily.  I have added this command line to my Daily Event Batch file: 

     TRANSCAN D:\*.GIF -G2 -S -M60  

     This looks in every subdirectory (-S) on drive D for *.GIF
     files(D:\*.GIF).  It converts them to JPG (-G2) but only processes up
     to 60 minutes (-M60) that day.  If there are still GIF files to
     process they will keep until tomorrow when the event tries again.

                          --------------------------- 

     There are probably hundreds of other special command line tricks you

                               WHAT IS SHAREWARE?
                               ------------------ 

     Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software before
     buying it.  If you try a Shareware program and continue using it, you
     are expected to register.  Individual programs differ on details --
     some request registration while others require it, some specify a
     maximum trial period. With registration, you get anything from the
     simple right to continue using the software to an updated program with
     printed manual. 

     Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software, and
     the copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific
     exceptions as stated below.  Shareware authors are accomplished
     programmers, just like commercial authors, and the programs are of
     comparable quality. (In both cases, there are good programs and bad
     ones!)  The main difference is in the method of distribution.  The
     author specifically grants the right to copy and distribute the
     software, either to all and sundry or to a specific group.  For
     example, some authors require written permission before a commercial
     disk vendor may copy their Shareware.   

     Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software.  You
     should find software that suits your needs and pocketbook, whether
     it's commercial or Shareware.  The Shareware system makes fitting your
     needs easier, because you can try before you buy.  And because the
     overhead is low, prices are low also.  Shareware has the ultimate
     money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the product, you don't pay
     for it. 

                                COMMON QUESTIONS
                                ---------------- 

     Why can't I get the F2 key to work to access the set-up?
               The most common reason is not enough memory.  The Set-Up
               Screens take up lots of memory not normally needed by
               TranScan.  You might check that no TSR's are active, that
               you are not in a DOS shell, or that the DesqView or Windows
               window is large enough.

     have stayed the same.

       o  Added Select lists for all SetUp fields that have multiple choice
          variables (i.e. Compression Method, Age Reject, Disposition, COM
          Display type, and Do When?).  Select lists are always activated
          with the F3 key. 
       o  Changed SetUp display colors, added help headers (lower left of
          window frames) that display special keys available. 
       o  Added the following HOT Keys: 
               Alt-1..Alt-0    Goto Page 1..10 of SetUp
               Alt-W           Goto Wildcat SetUp (page 11)

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 

               Alt-S           Save SetUp and Exit to Menu
               Ctrl-PgUp       Go to 1st field on page 1
               Ctrl-PgDn       Go to last field on last page
       o  ReWrote Help Text to reflect the above changes. 

     TranScan v3.00 (03/29/92) - v3.07 (06/14/92) 

       o  Fixed problem writing DESC.SDI files to imbedded compressed
          files. 
       o  Fixed problem processing imbedded compressed files more than
          once. Fixed a similar problem where it was processing the first
          file in a directory of files more than once. 
       o  Fixed problem where "Scan Failed" flag was not being set if file
          failed date or age test. 
       o  Added descriptions to Wildcat Activity Log explaining reason for
          FAILED and Disposition of file (moved, renamed, deleted, etc.). 
       o  I believe I fixed the File Sharing problem.  When TranScan is
          running you should be able to run WCPro. 
       o  Fixed a problem where TranScan would not update the Wildcat
          Database if another node was running. 
       o  Added selectable COM output: box, text, propellor, dots, or none. 
       o  Added security level bypass during ScanFile.Bat. 
       o  Detect Errorlevel=3 from GIFLite and write a msg to log that GIF
          file too big to be processed by unregistered GIFLite. 
       o  Filename put in log if file moved, renamed, or deleted after
          rejection. 
       o  Added second command line option for ZIP, LZH, and ARJ
          uncompression.  If the default compression method is not one of
          these three TranScan will use the second command line option to
          uncompress the files without retaining the full path. 
       o  Routines added to make TranScan "DesqView Aware". It will not do
          any screen writes if running in the background under DesqView. 
       o  Added validation routines that check if relocate path exists,
          work drive is a valid drive and all paths are valid paths. 
       o  Added "Date" rejection option in addition to "Age" reject. 
       o  Added "Drive Type" and "K Free" info to "WorkDrive" entry prompt
          in SetUp. 
       o  Added Menu when run with no filename on command line. 
       o  F1 provides context sensitive help. 
       o  F2 provides SetUp Screen that scrolls both directions and uses
          PgUp, PgDn, arrows, and tab keys to move around the menu. 
       o  Mouse support added to all entry screens. 
       o  F3 provides a file pick list at all filename prompts. 
       o  F4 provides a text file editor at all filename prompts. 
       o  Fixed miscellaneous problems reported by Beta Team. 

     TranScan v2.00 (08/23/91) - v2.37 (04/05/92) 

       o  Added "Dupe Checking" If file exists in Wildcat database TranScan
          will NOT convert the file. 
       o  Added support for GIF2JPG, JPG2GIF, and GifTest. 
       o  TRANSCAN.NOT file added contains paths you do NOT want processed. 
       o  Added writing to Wildcat Activity Log. 
       o  Failed files can be relocated to a special path.

     T r a n S c a n                "The Ultimate File Scanner & Converter"
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 

       o  Adds FILE_ID.DIZ and DESC.SDI descriptions and Key Words to
          Wildcat database. 
       o  Added switch to turn ViruScan On/Off.
       o  Stopped display from scrolling off top of screen.
       o  Added Software Flow Control (Xon/Xoff) and Hardware Flow Control
          (RTS/CTS). 
       o  Added swap to EMS or disk (work drive) during external program
          execution. 
       o  Optional file age rejection added.
       o  Added switch to allow processing of subdirectories or whole
          drives. 
       o  ESC aborts processing between files.
       o  DOS masks like "*" and "?" can be used as filenames.
       o  Toggles Wildcat "Scan Failed" switch off as well as on.
       o  Added ability to compress non-compressed files (txt, doc, etc.).
       o  Optional updating of Wildcat file database date.
       o  Added work drive command line switch.
       o  Added routine to support AutoNode feature in Wildcat.
       o  If MakeWild.Dat is not detected "Updating Wildcat" does not show
          on main display screen. 
       o  Added file age to TranScan.Log.
       o  File can be time stamped with KEEP original date, CURRENT date,
          date of YOUNGEST file in archive, or date of OLDEST file in
          archive. 
       o  If TranScan detects the file to be converted already exists in
          path it will not convert the file.  File age reported in log is
          dependant on the time stamp selected. 
       o  "Carrier Detected" appears on display screen.
       o  TranScan will continue processing even if a caller hangs up.
       o  Before updating Wildcat database the file path and area are
          compared to be sure they are the same file. 
       o  Virus Name reported by Scan.Exe is written to the TranScan.Log.
       o  Added ColorAnsi screens for output through COM port.
       o  Processing time is displayed in log in Min:Sec format.
       o  COM routines added to support ports 1-8 and baud rates up to
          115,000. 
       o  Local upload scans are supported with no special batch file
          tricks. 
       o  Reads DOOR.SYS file in NodeWork directory to determine COM port,
          baud rate, Color/NoColor, Ansi/NoAnsi. 
       o  Writes SCANFILE.BAD file to NodeWork directory if scan failed.

ZC v1.02 - ZIP Commenter
by Jeff Garzik


Requirements
------------
PC-DOS or MS-DOS v3.1 or later
IBM or compatible machine
At least 95k FREE RAM at time of execution


Disclaimer
----------
The program, ZC, and its associated documentation, are hereby dedicated to
the public domain.  Anyone may use this for their own personal purposes, or
for any reason, as long as that reason doesn't include commercial
distribution.  By issuing this statement, the author disclaims any

disclaimer is prohitibed in certain states of the US, and is void in those
states.

If you wish to distribute this product with your program, or any program,
you are free to do so, as long as due credit is given to the author, Jeff
M. Garzik.


Using ZC
--------
[d:][path]ZC [zipfile] [commentfile]

[d:][path] before ZC to specify the drive and path that contains the
ZC.EXE command file.

[zipfile] after ZC to specify which .ZIP file(s) to be processed.  This
is a standard DOS path/file name, and CAN contain wildcards.  If an
extension is not specified, then the default extension of .ZIP is
assumed.

[commentfile] after zipfile to specify which ASCII TEXT file is to be
used as the ZIP comment.  This CANNOT include wildcards, and will abort
with an error if one is specified.


Examples
--------
ZC * COMMENT.FIL
     This executes ZC, with the command to process all files with the
extension .ZIP, and replace the existing comment (if any) with the
comment contained in COMMENT.FIL.

E:\UTILITY\ZC C:\DOWNLOAD\A*.ZIP AUTOEXEC.BAT
     This executes ZC.EXE, assuming it is on drive E: and in directory
UTILITY, with the command to process all .ZIP files that start with A in
their filename, replacing the existing comment (if any) with all the
text contained in AUTOEXEC.BAT in the current directory.

Benchmarks
----------
235 files (ranging from 1k to 30k):
     ZC       - 41.59 seconds
     PKBANNER - 45.96 seconds

13 files (ranging from 6k to 312k):
     ZC       - 2.36 seconds
     PKBANNER - 2.80 seconds


Update History
--------------
0.00 -    Beta test release.

1.00 -    First public release.
          Fixed memory allocation bug.
          Included command line help.
          Included documentation.
          Added support for wildcard zipfiles on command line.
          Added default extension (.ZIP) support.

1.01 -    Changed command line help.
          Improved file read routines (now faster).
          Major overhaul of documentation.
          Fixed another memory allocation bug.
          Reduced code redundancy.

1.02 -    Make processing a WHOLE lot faster.  It still isn't up to the
               speed of PKBANNER, but it is getting closer each time.
               What ZC did previously was repeatedly read the zip
               comment file from disk each time a ZIP file was processed.
               This was stupidity personified on my part, and I apologize.
               What it now does it read the comment file into RAM at the
               start of the program, and then process.  This means that
               about 32k more RAM is required, but the speed makes up for
               that.
          Updated documentation to reflect changes.
          Fixed bug in command line when a single ZIP file was specified.

1.02a-    Interim release.
          There was a major bug that messed up the comments that forced me
          to release this newer version.
          Updated the docs so users could see a unbaised comparison of the
          two programs.

2.00 -    ZC IS NOW FASTER THAN PKBANNER! (See "Benchmarks" for details)
          Documentation update
