This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
900 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'INSTALL' at
the DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy
access to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.  All the programs are logically divided into thirteen
major categories with subcategories, making it easier to find just the
right software.

All of the programs have been scanned for viruses.  There are also three
online virus utilities that can be run from the CD-ROM which will scan,
screen and clean viruses.  Not only does this save hard disk space, but
also gives every user added security from viruses.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

                  Useful Editor (Version 1.9d) Documentation
                  ==========================================


     Features
     ~~~~~~~~

     Useful Editor (Ued) is a small (about 35K), fast, ASCII editor that is
     suitable for a wide variety of text manipulation tasks.  Some of Ued's
     features include:

        - ability to edit up to 9 files in memory at once
        - files as large as 1000 characters wide and 10,000 lines long
        - file size is only limited by available memory
        - split screen editing
        - typeover and insert mode editing
        - search and replace (both case sensitive and insensitive)
        - cut and paste (three modes: line, range, and block)
        - escape to DOS
        - can load "piped" files
        - wildcard expansion of command line arguments
        - word wrap and paragraph reformat
        - smart indentation
        - easy to use consistent interface
        - user configurable preferences


     System Requirements
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Ued runs on any IBM PC or compatible.  Ued automatically determines
     the  type of video card installed and switches the card into 80 X 25
     text mode when it starts up.  The following video cards (or ones that
     are compatible) are supported:

        - Color Graphics Adapter (CGA)
        - Monochrome Graphics Adapter (MGA)
        - Hercules Graphics Adapter (HGA)
        - Enhanced Graphics Adaptor (EGA)
        - Video Graphics Array (VGA)
        - Multi-Color Graphics Array (MCGA)

     Any monitor that can display 80 X 25 text works with Ued.  If you have
     a color monitor and card, you can change the default colors (of black
     and white) by running uedcfg.exe (see Configuring Ued).  In addition
     Ued supports a 43 line display on EGA systems and a 28 or 50 line
     display on VGA systems.

     Ued is very small and runs on systems with as little as 128K of
     memory.  Of course the more memory that you have, the larger the files
     that you are able to edit.



     Starting Up Ued
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     From the DOS prompt, type:

        Ued <filename1> <filename2> ... <filename9> [/l]

     then press the Enter key.

     Each "filename" is either an ASCII text file that you want to edit or
     the name of a file that you want to create.  Up to 9 file names can be
     specified on the command line when starting up Ued and can contain
     wildcard characters.  Each file is assigned to its own workspace.

     Piping to Ued is allowed.  For instance if you typed the command:

        dir | Ued

     A directory listing would be loaded into Ued with the name "PIPED".

     You can also start up Ued with no files specified.  In this case the
     editor starts within an empty unnamed workspace.

     The command line argument /l can be added when you are loading very
     large files.  Only a single file should be loaded if the /l option is
     used.


     Workspaces
     ~~~~~~~~~~

     Files are loaded into Ued "workspaces".  A workspace can be as much as
     1,000 characters wide, and 10,000 lines deep.  You can move the cursor
     anywhere in the workspace to edit text.  The "text window" follows the
     cursor as you move about the workspace.

     There are 9 workspaces (numbered 1-9) in Ued, each of which can hold a
     single file.  The F2 Workspace command is used to switch between work-
     spaces.

     Ued maintains one other workspace (workspace 0) which is used as a
     "clipboard" when you Cut and Paste text.


     Screen Layout
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Ued uses the top 23 lines of the screen to display the text being
     edited.  Consider this to be a "window" (that is 80 columns wide and
     23 lines deep) into the "text workspace".  This window is bordered on
     the top and sides by the edge of the screen, and bounded on the bottom
     by an inverse line.

     That inverse line is called the "status line".  On the left edge of
     the status line is a number (0-9) which indicates what workspace that
     you are in.  Beside it appears the name of the file that you are edit-
     ing in that workspace.  To the right side of the status line, the line
     and column position of the cursor is displayed.

     Below the status line are the command lines.  All of the commands that
     are currently available to you are displayed on these two lines.



     The Cursor(s)
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     The "cursor" is a pointer within a workspace.  Text can be added or
     deleted here.  In Ued the cursor appears as a solid inverted block
     when you are in "insert mode", and a flashing underscore when you are
     in "typeover mode".

     When you start up Ued a cursor appears in the upper left hand corner
     of the text window.  This is your "active" cursor.  In actual fact
     there are two cursors in Ued.  An "inactive" cursor is initially pos-
     itioned there as well but not displayed.

     When you move the active cursor, the inactive cursor remains where it
     is.  You can move the active cursor to the inactive cursor position by
     using the "Flip" command (Ctrl-F).  The position that you moved from
     becomes the inactive cursor position.  The inactive cursor can be used
     as a "bookmark" in your text (a place that you want to get to quickly)
     and also plays an important role in the F8 Split command.


     Moving the Cursor
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Moving the cursor around can be accomplished with the following keys.
     In all cases, the text window is adjusted when necessary in order to
     keep the cursor on the screen.


     Up Arrow   Moves the cursor up one line of text.

     Down Arrow Moves the cursor down one line of text.

     ->         Moves the cursor right one character.

     <-         Moves the cursor left one character.

     Home       Moves the cursor to the first character on the current
                line.  If you are already on the first character, moves the
                cursor to column 1.

     End        Moves the cursor one position past the last character on
                the current line.

     PgUp       Moves the cursor up one screen of text.

     PgDn       Moves the cursor down one screen of text.




     Additional cursor movement commands can be accessed by holding down
     the "Ctrl" key (you will see the menu change when you do this) and
     pressing one of these keys:


     Ctrl ->    Moves the cursor to the beginning of the next word.  (A
                word is considered to be a series of characters preceded
                and followed by at least one space.)

     Ctrl <-    Moves the cursor to the beginning of the previous word.

     Flip       Moves the active cursor to the inactive cursor position.
                The current cursor position becomes the inactive cursor.

     Goto Line  Prompts for a line number, then moves the cursor to the
                line number entered.  Adjusts the text window so that the
                cursor is centered vertically in the window.

     Outdent    Moves the cursor left to the previous level of indentation.

     Back
     Workspace  Moves the cursor to the previous (lower numbered) work-
                space.
     Next
     Workspace  Moves the cursor to the next workspace.

     Ctrl Home  Moves the cursor to the first line of the current file.

     Ctrl End   Moves the cursor one line past the end of the current file.

     Ctrl PgDn  When a search Pattern has been defined, moves the cursor to
                the next occurrence of Pattern in the text.
     
     Ctrl PgUp  When a search Pattern has been defined, moves the cursor to
                the previous occurrence of Pattern in the text.


     Entering Text
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     To enter text into Ued, position the cursor where you want the text to
     be added and then type.  If you make a mistake use the Backspace or
     Del key to erase the error.  In insert mode, characters to the right
     of the solid block cursor (including the current character) shift
     right to make room for new text being entered.

     You can do "power" data entry using Ued by turning on the "word wrap"
     feature found under the Text command.  When you turn word wrap on you
     will notice an inverse line appear down the right side of the screen.
     This line marks the right margin.  With word wrap on, any word that is
     incomplete when it "hits" the right margin is moved down to the next
     line.  With this feature you can enter long passages of text without
     having to worry about the ends of lines.  You can alter the position
     of the right margin with the Set and Enter options of the Text
     command.

     All extended charcaters (with ASCII values > 127) can be entered by
     holding down the Alt key and typing in the character's decimal value
     using either the keypad numbers or the number keys on the top row.



     Ued considers a block of text separated by at least one blank line
     above and below to be a paragraph.  Lines beginning with a '.' or a
     ':' are also considered to be paragraph separators.  Editing text
     within a paragraph when word wrap is on might be a little
     disconcerting at first, especially when in insert mode.  Ued makes no
     attempt to reformat paragraph text "on-the-fly" as you are editing it.
     When in insert mode Ued moves any text to the right of the cursor down
     to the next line (if necessary) to make room for new text.  The
     Paragraph Reformat option under the Text command can be used to fix
     things up after you have made all your changes.


     Smart Indentation
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     When you press the Enter key, the cursor moves down one line and Ued
     positions the cursor under the first character of the current line.
     This makes it easy to enter blocks of indented text.

     Similarly the Paragraph Reformat looks at the leading spaces on the
     second line of a paragraph to determine where to place the left margin
     (the right margin is "set" explicitly).  Any positive or negative
     indentation on the first line will be preserved.

     The Outdent option under the Ctrl key moves the cursor to the previous
     level of indentation (which it determines by looking "up" in the text
     of the workspace).


     Deleting Things
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Characters are deleted with the following keys:


     Del        Deletes the character under the cursor.  Any text to the
                right of that character shifts left to "fill the gap".  If
                the cursor is past the end of the line and you are in
                insert mode, Ued brings up the next line of text and joins
                it with the current line.

     Backspace  Moves the cursor left one character.  If you are in insert
                mode, Ued deletes the character to the left of the cursor
                and all text to the right of and including the cursor
                shifts left.  Also in insert mode, if the cursor is in
                column 1, Ued moves the current line up and joins it with
                the previous line.

     Backtab    Moves the cursor to the previous tab stop.  If you are in
                insert mode, all characters to the left of the cursor up to
                and including the previous tab stop are deleted.



     By pressing and holding down the Alt key, a sub-menu with the follow-
     ing additional delete options appears:

     Word       Deletes the word under the cursor.  If the cursor is not on
                a word, the first word to the left of the cursor (if
                there is one) is deleted.

     Beginning
      of Line   Deletes all of the text to the left of the cursor.  The
                remaining text and the cursor shift left to the current
                level of indentation.

     End
      of Line   Deletes all of the text to the right of and including the
                character under the cursor.

     Line       Deletes the line that the cursor is on.


     Other Keys You Should Know About
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     The following keys are important to the operation of Ued:

     Esc        Returns to the previous level of menus.  If you are at the
                main command menu nothing happens.

     Ins        Switches between "typeover" and "insert" modes.

     Enter      Moves the cursor down one line and positions it at the cur-
                rent level of indentation.  If you are in insert mode, a
                new line is created immediately after the current line, and
                any text to the right of and including the cursor character
                is moved down with the cursor.

     Tab        Moves the cursor to the next tab stop.  If you are in
                insert mode, characters to the right of and including the
                cursor character shift right with the cursor.


     Entering Control Characters
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     For the most part, the technique of holding down the Alt key then
     typing the 3-digit decimal equivalent of the desired control character
     on the number pad will work with Ued.  However to get the symbol
     corresponding to an Esc or Arrow key (for instance) into your file,
     Ued requires that you to use the Alt key in conjunction with the
     number keys on the top row of the keyboard.



     Main Menu Commands
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     The function keys F1 - F10 are used to access the main Ued command
     set.  These commands are invoked by pressing the appropriate function
     key.  In addition, pressing and holding down the Ctrl key reveals
     additional cursor movement keys.  Pressing and holding down the Alt
     key is used for Delete functions.

     Many of the main menu commands have sub-options.  Sub-option menus
     replace the main command menu when invoked.  They show the main com-
     mand selected in inverse text (just below the file name on the status
     line) and the option choices on the bottom line of the screen.  You
     select an option by pressing the first (highlighted) letter or char-
     acter of the appropriate choice.

     You can always get out of sub-option menu(s) by pressing the Esc key,
     or by selecting another main menu command.

     The sections that follow describe the main menu commands and sub-
     options in more detail.



     F1 File
     ~~~~~~~

     File commands are used to copy Ued workspaces to and from disk files.
     In addition the current workspace can be erased or renamed.


     Load       Prompts for the name of a file to load.  If the entered
                file name is found on the disk in the current directory,
                Ued copies it into the workspace at the current cursor
                position.  Existing text is moved to make room for the text
                being loaded.  An empty workspace is given the name of the
                first file loaded into it.

                If you are not sure what the name of the file is, pressing
                Enter at the prompt for a file name will generate a list of
                all the files in the current directory and allow you to
                select one of them.  In addition you can type a partial
                file name using the standard DOS wildcard characters (*,?)
                to obtain a list of specific files to select from.

     Save       The workspace text is copied to a disk file in the current
                directory and given the current workspace name.  Ued
                prompts for a file name if the workspace is unnamed.  If
                the "backups" option is on, a backup copy of the file on
                disk to be over written is created with a .bak extension
                prior to saving.  Thus if you save over a file by mistake
                you can immediately recover from the backup copy.

     Name       Prompts for a name for the current workspace.  The name
                entered must be a valid DOS file name.  If the name is the
                same as one on your disk in the current directory, Ued 
                prompts you to verify that you really want to use that 
                name.

     Clear      Erases the contents of the current workspace.  If the work-
                space has been changed since that last time it was saved,
                Ued prompts you to verify that you really want to clear the
                workspace.


     F2 Workspace
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~

     The Workspace command allows you to switch between the files that you
     have loaded.  In addition some status information about workspaces is
     displayed as follows:


     >          This symbol appears to the left of a workspace number if
                that workspace has been used at any time during the current
                edit session.

     *          When this symbol appears immediately after a workspace
                number it means that the workspace has been changed in some
                way since it was last saved.

     <-         This arrow points to the number of the workspace that is
                currently being displayed in the active window.



     To move between workspaces use the following keys:


     <-         Displays the previous (lower numbered) workspace.

     ->         Displays the next workspace.

     Enter      Moves you into the workspace pointed to by <-.

     0 - 9      Moves directly to the workspace who's number is pressed.

     Esc        Moves you to the workspace that was active when the F2
                Workspace command was invoked.


     F3 Search
     ~~~~~~~~~

     Search allows you to find strings or "Patterns" within the text of the
     current workspace and optionally substitute a "Replacement" string of
     your choosing.


     Count      Displays the total number of times that the Search Pattern
                appears in the text of the current workspace.

     Fix        Substitutes the Replacement string for a Pattern string
                provided that the cursor is on a piece of text matching
                Pattern (the text will be highlighted).

     Global     All instances of text in the current workspace matching the
                Pattern string are changed to the Replacement string.

     Pattern    Prompts for a search Pattern.  If the Pattern entered is in
                all lower case, searches will be case insensitive.  If any
                of the letters in the Pattern are in upper case, the work-
                space text and Pattern must be exactly the same for a match
                to occur.

     Replace-
      ment      Prompts for a Replacement string.  The Replacement string
                can be empty, which has the effect of deleting the Pattern
                when a Fix or Global substitution is applied.  Changing the
                Pattern does not affect the current Replacement string.

     PgUp       Moves the cursor to the previous occurrence of Pattern in
                the current workspace.  If there are no more matches, moves
                the cursor to the beginning of the workspace.

     PgDn       Moves the cursor to the next occurrence of Pattern in the
                current workspace.  If there are no more matches, moves the
                cursor to the end of the workspace.



     F4 Print
     ~~~~~~~~

     The contents of the current workspace are sent to the printer attached
     to LPT1.  No formatting is performed on the text.


     F5 Cut
     ~~~~~~

     Cut allows you to select a block of text which can subsequently be
     deleted, copied, moved, or shifted.  Text selection begins at the
     current cursor position.  As you move the cursor around (using the
     standard cursor movement keys) selected text is highlighted.
     Selection ends when you press the Copy, Delete, or Move command keys.
     How the text gets marked out depends on the Cut mode that you are in.
     The three Cut styles are:


     Block      A rectangular block of text.

     Line       Whole lines of text only.

     Range      All the text from one selected position in the text to
                another.


     Any time that you select a block of text and copy, move, or delete it,
     the selected text is copied to workspace 0.  Workspace 0 thus acts as
     the "clipboard" or "cut buffer" for Ued.  The former contents of work-
     space 0 are lost when newly selected text is copied to it.  You can
     edit in workspace 0 as you would any other workspace, but you have to
     be careful because of the transient nature of the text placed here
     (ie. its NOT a good idea to load files into workspace 0).

     Once marked, there are four operations that can be performed on the
     highlighted text.

     
     Copy       Copies the selected text to workspace 0.

     Delete     Copies the selected text to workspace 0 then removes it
                from the current workspace.

     Move       Copies the selected text to workspace 0, removes it from
                the workspace, then prompts you to position the cursor
                where you want the text moved.  When you press Enter to
                complete the operation, the selected text is copied to the
                new location.

     +/-        Shifts the selected text right (+) or left (-).  Text 
                cannot be shifted over text that is not highlighted.  You 
                will notice that the highlighting does not go away.  After 
                shifting you can perform one of the other Cut operations,
                or press Esc to quit the Cut command.  



     F6 Paste
     ~~~~~~~~

     This command copies the text from workspace 0 into the current work-
     space at the current cursor position.  If you are in insert mode, the
     workspace text is moved to make room for the workspace 0 text being
     added.  Care should be exercised when you are in typeover mode as the
     workspace 0 text is copied on top of the text in the current work-
     space.  If there are more than 2 lines of text being Pasted and you
     are in typeover mode, you are asked to verify that you really want to
     Paste.


     F7 DOS
     ~~~~~~

     When you press F7, Ued starts up another DOS session by executing the
     secondary command processor.  Ued looks at the environment variable
     COMSPEC= for the name of the secondary command processor.  This is
     usually COMMAND.COM.

     The F7 Dos command fails if:

        - COMSPEC= is not set in the environment
        - the command processor indicated by COMSPEC could not be found
        - there is not enough memory to run the command processor

     To return to Ued, from the DOS prompt type:

        exit

     then press the Enter key.


     F8 Split/Zoom
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Pressing F8 splits the text window horizontally at the current cursor 
     position.  A second status line appears separating the two windows.  
     The upper window shows the text at the active cursor, while the lower
     window shows the text at the inactive cursor position.  You can flip
     between the windows using the Ctrl-F command.

     Both windows can "view" the same workspace, or each can be positioned
     on a different workspace.  If they are both positioned over the same
     piece of text, changes made in one will be echoed to the other.

     Pressing F8 again expands (zooms) the window containing the active
     cursor to be the size of a full screen.  The window containing the 
     text pointed to by the inactive cursor is no longer displayed.



     F9 Text
     ~~~~~~~

     The Text command offers some simple word processing options.


     Enter
      Right
       Margin   Prompts for the column that you want words to wrap at.  The
                column must be in the range 20 to 250.

     Set
      Right
       Margin   The right margin is placed one character position past the
                longest line in the current paragraph (ie. the one that the
                cursor is on).

     Reformat
      Paragraph Adjusts the text in the current paragraph so that each line
                has the maximum number of words between the left and right
                margins.  The left margin is determined by looking at the
                number of spaces preceding the second line of the para-
                graph.  The right margin is set with one of the above
                commands.

     Word Wrap  Turns the word wrap feature ON or OFF.

     25,43,50
      Lines     Changes the number of lines displayed on the screen.  This
                option is only available if you have an EGA or VGA monitor.


     F10 Quit
     ~~~~~~~~

     This command is used to exit Ued.  If any of the workspaces have been
     modified in any way, you are prompted to verify that you really want
     to quit.



     Configuring Ued
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     A separate program (uedcfg.exe) is provided to modify Ued with some of
     your own preferences.  When you run this Ued Configuration, you must
     ensure that Ued.exe is in the current directory.  Follow the prompts
     for the configuration program, and when you have answered the last
     question Ued.exe will be updated with your selections.

     The following user preferences can be configured within Ued:

        - video display mode
        - initial text entry mode
        - initial Cut style
        - color of normal text
        - color of inverse text
        - distance between tab stops
        - initial right margin column

     Uedcfg will create also Ued.cfg file.  This small configuration file
     can be used to re-configure a newer version of Ued without having to
     answer the questions again.  Again making sure that Uedcfg.exe,
     Ued.exe and Ued.cfg are all in the same directory simply type:

        uedcfg /r

     and your new verion of Ued will be setup with your current settings.

     If for any reason there is no Ued.cfg file, you can generate one by
     typing:

        uedcfg /s

     Of course you should do this before copying the new version of Ued
     over the old.





     Licensing

             The programs and documentation in this archive are
                 Copyright (c) 1989-1991 by Useful Software

     Ued is a shareware editor.  This means that you only pay for it if you
     decide to continue using it.  If you don't think that it is worth the
     asking price, delete the program, or better yet give it to someone who
     might find it useful.  However if you do decide to keep Ued after a 2
     week trial period, please send $20 (see REGISTRATION FORM on next
     page) to:

        Useful Software
        340 Dale Crescent
        Waterloo, Ontario
        Canada, N2J 3Y3

     The shareware fee pays for unlimited use of Ued by a single person.
     You are allowed (and encouraged) to give away copies of Ued with the
     understanding that each person receiving a copy is under the same
     obligation as you are to send in the shareware fee if they decide to
     keep it.  You can upload Ued to other computer systems, either free or
     commercial, as long as this archive remains intact, with the copyright
     and shareware notices unchanged.

     Useful Editor can be installed on LANS.  In such situations I ask only
     that the LAN Administrator estimate the maximum number of people that
     will be making "simultaneous" use of Ued and pay the shareware fee
     based on that estimate.  I do not expect that the limit be closely
     monitored or enforced (I appreciate how much trouble that would be),
     but I do expect that the estimate will be revised (and additional fees
     paid) should a substantial increase in the number of nodes on the LAN
     and Ued usage occur.

     No guarantee is made as to the functionality of this software; however
     it has been tested quite thoroughly by a large number of people.  If
     it doesn't do what you want, don't keep it and send no money.

     Please support the shareware concept.  Shareware means useful programs
     at a fraction of the cost you might pay for them commercially.  You
     can try-before-you-buy, and you are not subjected to copy protection
     or other atrocities that many software vendors inflict on their
     customers.  Software updates can also be distributed much faster than
     is possible through normal channels.

     The following changes were made in version 1.4

        - a warning is now issued if a file is changed when loaded (Ued
          will substitute a space for any null (0) character found and/or
          split lines that are too long (>999 characters))
        - Ued now uses the DOS interrupt 21 console I/O routine (function
          6) to fetch keystrokes (this should facilitate the use DOS key
          remappers) (removed in version 1.6 - BIOS interrupt 16 used)
        - a bug when word wrapping lines >80 columns was fixed
        - a display error when reading zero length files was fixed
        - editing of filenames and search patterns has been improved and in
          addition the last filename or pattern can be recalled by pressing
          the  key
        - added the option of creating backup files when saving


     The following changes were made in version 1.5

        - added configuration support to allow Ued to start up in word wrap
          mode
        - Ued now allows you to edit while a file is being loaded (removed
          in version 1.6)
        - changed Ued to load "piped" files in BINARY mode (thus ignoring
          EOF characters in the file)



     The following changes were made in version 1.6

        - added the Back/Next Workspace commands under the Cursor menu
        - when a new pattern is entered the replacement string is no longer
          automatically cleared
        - the first file name entered on the command line is now copied to
          the "Previous Filename" buffer
        - the field for entering the default word wrap column in uedcfg has
          been increased to 3 characters
        - the performance when loading and saving files has been improved
          considerably
        - a low pitch beep has been added when invalid keys are pressed
          within commands


     The following changes were made in version 1.7

        - support for VGA 28 line mode added
        - the "archive" bit is now being set correctly when saving
        - Ued now recognizes lines beginning with a '.' or a ':' as being
          the equivalent of a blank line when reformatting paragraphs
        - Alt-x can be used as an alternate to F10 (Quit)
        - empty workspaces can now be saved creating a 0 length file

     
     The following changes were made in version 1.8

        - extended characters (with ASCII values > 127) can now be typed
          into Patterns and Replacements
        - at the Filename? prompt when loading you can get a list of files
          by typing in a file specification with the standard DOS wildcard
          characters (*,?) or by pressing Enter with no file name for all
          files


     The following changes were made in version 1.9

        - a problem with the keyboard on some systems (PS/2 Model 60, old
          XTs and others) misreading the function keys unless NumLock was
          on has been corrected
        - the Text/Set right margin command will now leave a space at the
          end of the longest line of text in all instances
        - you can now have keys "automatically" typed into Ued (say via a
          TSR or the Window's 3.0 clipboard) at a much higher rate
        - Uedcfg will now generate a "ued.cfg" file or can be forced to by
          typing "uedcfg /s" and will restore an older configuration with
          the command "uedcfg /r"
        - you cannot save to a "Read Only" file when automatic backups are
          on any more (Ued used to make the .bak file Read Only then save
          the file)



     The following changes were made in version 1.9c

        - when you reach the left or right edge of the screen, the window
          shifts 20 columns so that you can see more context
        - optimized memory management so that larger files could be loaded
        - also added a /l command line argument so that even larger files
          can be loaded


     The following changes were made in version 1.9d

        - a new set of memory allocation routines were added making memory
          usage even more efficient
        - Passive video mode was added to the configuration which will use
          whatever video mode is in effect when the editor loads (and not
          reset the mode on exit)
        - the window now shifts 20 columns only if you are entering text
          (and not when scrolling)

                 Useful Index (Version 1.0) Documentation
                 ========================================


     What is Useful Index?
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Useful Index allows you to organize the textual information on your
     hard disk in a manner that makes finding words or phrases, no matter
     where they are, a snap.  Often this type of organization is called an
     "infobase" or a "textbase".  You can quickly search and view the full
     text of any file located on your hard disk.

     Each of the files that you want to reference is added to an "index",
     hence the name Useful Index.  You can of course have may "indexes".

     Once indexed, information in the files is quickly accessed using
     powerful searching techniques.  The average search time through many
     MEGABYTES of text is only a few seconds.


     Features
     ~~~~~~~~

     Useful Index (Uin) is a fast, efficient text retrieval engine that is
     suitable for a wide variety of productivity tasks.  Some of Uin's
     features include:

     INDEXING
        - up to 32,000 files in each index
        - files as large as 16M can be indexed and viewed
        - words up to 99 characters long
        - index less than 25% the size of original text (may vary)
        - incremental indexing of files
        - re-index only files that have changed
        - may popular word-processing file formats work with Uin

     SEARCHING
        - very fast
        - root-word (any ending)
        - Boolean (AND, OR, NOT)
        - phrase (with wild card)
        - proximity
        - limit search by date and/or file patterns
        - domain control

     VIEWING
        - built-in file viewer
        - query keywords highlighted in context
        - optional word-wrap when viewing files
        - easy to use consistent interface
        - user configurable preferences



     System Requirements
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Uin runs on any IBM PC or compatible.  Uin automatically determines
     the type of video card installed and uses 80 X 25 text mode when it
     starts up.  The following video cards (or ones that are compatible)
     are supported:

        - Color Graphics Adapter (CGA)
        - Monochrome Graphics Adapter (MGA)
        - Hercules Graphics Adapter (HGA)
        - Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA)
        - Video Graphics Array (VGA)
        - Multi-Color Graphics Array (MCGA)

     Any monitor that can display 80 X 25 text works with Uin.  If you have
     a color monitor and card, you can change the default colors (of blue
     and yellow) by running Uincfg (see Configuring Uin).  In addition Uin
     supports a 43 line display on EGA systems and a 28 or 50 line display
     on VGA systems.

     Uin is quite small and runs on systems with as little as 250K of 
     memory.  The actual minimum RAM requirement depends on the size of the
     index being processed.


     Installation
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Copy the executable files in this distribution to a directory on your
     hard disk that appears in your PATH statement.  In addition copy the
     files NOTINDEX.WDS and NOTINDEX.FLS to the same directory as the
     executables.



     Indexing Files
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Before you can take advantage of the "query" capabilities of Uin, you
     must first "index" the files that you want to search.  To add files to
     a Useful Index you must run the program Uindex.  The format of the
     command line when running Uindex looks like this:

       uindex indexname [@]file1 [file2...] [/Fdddd] [/Odddd] [/Waaaa] [/C]

     Where:

       indexname  Is the name that you want to call this Index, or the name
                  of an existing Useful Index.  The name can be from one to
                  eight characters in length and must adhere to standard
                  DOS naming conventions.  Uindex ignores any extension
                  added to the name.

       file1...n  The names of the files to add to the index.  You can have
                  as many file names as will fit on the command line.  Also
                  names can contain the standard DOS wild card characters
                  *  and  ? .

               @  When the  @  character immediately precedes a file name,
                  it indictates that the file contains a "list" of files to
                  index.  That list must be ASCII text only with at least
                  one space (or a new line) between each file name.  As
                  with file names on the command line, the names listed can
                  contain the DOS wild card characters  *  and  ? .

          /Fdddd  Gives an indication of the number of FILES to be indexed.
                  "dddd" can be any decimal number between 1 and 32,000.
                  This number does not have to be exact, but results in
                  more efficient indexing (requiring less time).

          /Odddd  Specifies an OFFSET into the files being indexed where a
                  meaningful description of that file might be found.
                  Useful Index reads and saves the text starting at this
                  offset until a new line is encountered or 80 characters
                  are read (whichever comes first).  This description
                  appears on the one line summary for each file when you
                  run Uquery.

                  The default is the beginning of the file (offset 0).

          /Waaaa  Defines the characters that make up a WORD.  Useful Index
                  treats the files indexed as blocks of characters.  A word
                  is a group of adjacent characters (within that block)
                  that you have defined as "word" characters.  Everything
                  else represents the spaces between the words.

                  The letters, numbers, and other characters that you enter
                  with this parameter are the "in" word characters.  A dash
                  character  -  can be used to indicate a range of letters.
                  If you want the  -  to be part of the words enter a  \-
                  (back slash followed immediately by a dash).

                  By default words are defined as being lower (a-z) and
                  uppercase (A-Z) letters plus digits (0-9).



     Indexing Files (continued)
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

              /C  Compresses the database once all the files have been
                  indexed.  This leads to saving of disk storage, but a
                  somewhat slower reindexing of files.

     Example:

       uindex mydocs *.doc /F300 /O20 /Wa-zA-Z0-9_

     Means add all of the files in the current directory with a .doc
     extension into the index called "mydocs".  There are about 300 files
     in the index.  At an offset of 20 characters into each file you will
     find a description of that file.  Words indexed contain all lower and
     uppercase letters as well as digits and an  _  character.


     Incremental Indexing
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     It is perfectly OK with Uin to index a group of files, then at some
     future date index more files.


     Reindexing Files
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Uin records the DOS time and date stamp and the size of each file that 
     it indexes.  When you reindex files, Useful Index "skips" those files 
     whose time, date, and size match exactly those saved previously.  For 
     instance, it is relatively efficient to reindex all the files in a
     specified directory when only a few have changed.


     Interrupting Indexing
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     If you have started an indexing session and for some reason you must
     stop the process, press the Ctrl and Break keys simultaneously.  You
     should see the message:

        User requested indexing be stopped!  Cleaning up...

     Uindex must finish the current operation before it can successfully
     shut down.  If this operation is an index "reorganization" this could
     take a few minutes.

     Once finished the current operation, Uindex should terminate normally.
     Should you restart the indexing session, all files that have been
     indexed up to the point of interruption are quickly "skipped".



     Skipping Words When Indexing
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Many words in the English language are so common that we can assume
     that they appear in every file.  "The", "and", "but" are good examples
     of what are often called "noise" or "stop" words.  Since they add
     little value to the searching process, Uindex can be instructed to
     ignore them.

     If used in a query, noise words are treated as though they are in all
     files.  They do however count in determining proximity.  For example
     the phrase "field of dreams" would only be found if the noise word
     "of" appears between "field" and "dreams".

     The file "notindex.wds" contains a list of some common "noise" words.
     Uindex looks for this file in the directory where the "uindex.exe"
     file is run from (for DOS 3.0 or later).  If Uindex can't find it
     there, it looks in the current directory.  Uindex stops with an error
     if it cannot find this file at all.

     You can change "notindex.wds" with any ASCII text editor (like Useful
     Editor).  Words can be added or removed.  There must be at least one
     space (or a new line) between each word.


     Skipping Files When Indexing
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     You can have Uindex exclude specific files or types of file from the
     indexing process.  It is unlikely that you would want to index binary
     files with .EXE or .COM extensions for instance (although you can if
     you choose).

     The file "notindex.fls" contains a list of the common binary files 
     (default:  *.com  *.exe  *.zip  *.bak  *.obj  *.prj  *.dsk  *.tfa).
     Uindex looks for this file in the directory where the "uindex.exe"
     file is run from (for DOS 3.0 or later).  If Uindex can't find it
     there, it looks in the current directory.  All files are processed if
     Uindex can't find "notindex.fls".

     You can change "notindex.fls" with any ASCII text editor.  Files can
     be added or removed from this list.  There must be at least one space
     (or a new line) between each file name.  File specifications can
     contain the standard DOS wild card characters  *  and  ? .



     The Path to Indexed Files
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Inside the index, file names are stored exactly the way they appear on
     the command line or in the file list (with the exception that the wild
     card characters are expanded).  For example, if you build an index in
     the same directory as the files that are being indexed, you need only
     specify the file names themselves (*.* say without the path).  When
     you want to search or view that index however, you must be in that
     same directory when you run the Uquery command.  If you try to access
     that index from any other directory, Uquery will not be able to VIEW
     the files and reports "File not found".

     If you wish to be able to access an index from any directory, you must
     enter the full path for each file being indexed with Uindex.


     Indexing Tips
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     The indexing process is very disk intensive!  Running Uindex with a
     large disk "cache" greatly decreases the time it takes to index files
     (by as much as 4-6 times faster).

     You should have at least as much free space on your disk as there is
     text to index.  While the index (with /C compression enabled) will
     only be 15 to 25 percent the size of the original text, the indexing
     process requires some extra disk space.

     If you know approximately how many files are to be indexed, use the
     /Fnnnn command line parameter when running Uindex.  This saves the
     indexer from having to periodically "reorganize" the index as it
     grows.

     Although you can run Uindex over a LAN, you should not try to create 
     an index on a remote LAN drive (especially if the files being indexed 
     are on a LAN drive as well).  This process will work, but at the cost 
     of a long index time and high network traffic.  Create the index on a
     workstation instead (the files being indexed can be on a remote drive
     if necessary) and copy the index to the LAN when done.



     Viewing Indexes
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Once you have created an Index using Uindex, you may search that index
     and view the files in it with the Uquery program.  The command line
     for Uquery is:

       uquery indexname [/Ld] [/Wd]

     Where:

       indexname  The name of an existing Useful Index.  The name can be
                  from one to eight characters in length and must adhere to
                  standard DOS naming conventions.  Uquery ignores any
                  extension added to the name.

             /Ld  Specifies the format for the one LINE description of the
                  files that were indexed.
                     d=0 - Directory like with short description (default).
                     d=1 - File name only and a longer description.
                     d=2 - Long description only.

             /Wd  Specifies the WORD-WRAP mode when viewing files.
                     d=0 - Word wrap Off (default).
                     d=1 - Word Wrap On.

     The defaults for these parameters can be changed using the Uincfg
     program (see Configuring Uin).


     Example:

       uquery mydocs /L2 /W0

     Means load the index called "mydocs".  When displaying the list of
     indexed files, use only the description for each file.  When viewing
     the files, no word-wrap is performed on long lines.  



     Screen Layout for Uquery
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     The topmost highlighted line of the screen displays the most recent
     Query.

     Uin uses the middle lines of the screen to present you with a scroll-
     able list of the files that are contained in the index (one file per
     line).  When you first start Uquery, all of the files in the index
     appear in this list.  One of these file lines is highlighted in a
     different color (or inversed).  This is the "current" file.

     Below the list of files is an inverse line that is called a "status
     line".  On the left edge of the status line is the name of the "Index"
     that you are currently working with.  To the right side of the status
     line appear statistics indicating:

        - the number of words indexed
        - total number of files indexed
        - the number of files currently selected

     Below the status line are the command lines.  All of the commands that
     are currently available to you are displayed on these two lines.


     Main Menu Commands
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Most commands in Uin are invoked by pressing the first letter of the
     command name.  In cases where this is not so, the key to press will
     precede the command name and be highlighted.  In addition, pressing
     and holding down the Ctrl key while VIEWing a file reveals additional
     commands.

     Many of the main menu commands have sub-options.  Sub-option menus
     replace the main command menu when invoked.  They show the main com-
     mand selected in inverse text (just below the index name on the status
     line) and the option choices on the bottom line of the screen.  You
     also select options by pressing the first highlighted letter or
     character of the appropriate choice.

     You can always get out of sub-option menu(s) by pressing the Esc key.

     The sections that follow describe the main menu commands and sub-
     options in more detail.



     Select
     ~~~~~~

     As mentioned, Uin uses the middle part of the screen to show you a
     list of the files in the index (one file per line).  When you press
     the arrow keys while at the main menu, you should notice that the bar
     highlighting one of those files moves up and down.  (If you do not see
     a highlighted bar, you should run Uincfg and make sure that the ACTIVE
     colors are set differently from the NORMAL colors.)  The highlighted
     file is called the "current" file.

     Trying to move the highlighted bar below the status line or above the
     query line causes the list of files to scroll (if there are more
     files).  You can also use the PgUp and PgDn keys to "scroll" a whole
     screen at a time.

     Open
     ~~~~

     If you have more that one index, Open lets you switch between them.
     When you select Open from the main menu you are prompted for the name 
     of another index.  If the name you enter is that of a valid Useful 
     Index, the current index is cleared, and the new one loaded.


     Setup
     ~~~~~

     Setup allows you to override the default settings for the format of
     the one line description when on the FILES screen, and word-wrap mode
     when VIEWing files.

        Fileinfo  Directory like with short description (default).

            Name  File name only and a longer description.

         Subject  Long description only.

       Word Wrap  On  - Word-wrap is off turn word-wrap on.
                  Off - Word-wrap is on turn word-wrap off.


     Exit
     ~~~~

     Press  x  from the main menu when you want to quit from Uquery.  When
     prompted to verify that you want to quit press  Y.  Pressing the Alt
     key and x at the same time allows you to quit without the verify.



     Limit
     ~~~~~

     This command is used to Limit or reduce the number of files to search
     in subsequent queries.  When you first run Uquery, all files that have
     been indexed are "selected".  Limit can be used to restrict searches
     to files that:

        - fall within a range of Dates
        - match a certain File specification (with wild card characters)
        - are currently Selected

     This is sometimes called restricting the "Domain" of the search.

     When you select the Limit command by pressing the letter  L  (from the
     main menu), you are presented with three options Date, Filespec, and
     Selected.  Beside each of these sub-options (in square brackets) is
     its current value.

           Dates  Every DOS file has a date associated with it.  Normally
                  this is set to the creation date of the file or the date
                  that the file was last modified.  When you select Limit
                  Dates, you are prompted for the start and end dates of a
                  range of dates.  Only files whose DOS date falls within
                  this range (including the start and end days) show up in
                  the files list and are searched in subsequent queries.
                  The default for this options is all possible dates:
                  [01-01-80] to [today's date].

        Filespec  A file specification is a pattern or template for a file
                  name made up of a combination of normal file name
                  characters and (usually) the DOS wild card characters  *
                  and/or  ? .  When you select Limit Filespec, you are
                  prompted to enter just such a pattern.  Only files whose
                  name matches this pattern show up in the files list and
                  are searched in subsequent queries.  The default for this
                  options is all possible files [*.*].

        Selected  When you enter a query, Uquery only lists those files
                  that meet the selection criteria.  The rightmost item on
                  the status line indicates how many files are "Selected".
                  When you invoke Limit Selected, only the files that are
                  currently "selected" are searched in subsequent queries.
                  The default for this option is [No], which means search
                  all files that meet the Dates and Filespec criteria.


     Clear
     ~~~~~

     This command appears on the main menu only if you have used Limit to
     restrict the Domain of subsequent searches.  Clear lets you reset any
     or all the Limits that have been imposed to their default values.



     VIEWing Files
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Once you have selected a file to VIEW by placing the highlighted bar
     over it, simply press Enter to view that file.  The command lines
     should change to the VIEW menu.

     Immediately below the status line on the left side of the screen you
     will see the word VIEW: followed by the full name of the file being
     viewed (including the path).  Beside the file name (in brackets) is a
     number representing the relative position of the current window into
     the file as a percentage of 100.  If the file being viewed has changed
     since it was indexed, you will also see  *Out of Date* on that same
     line.

     The bottom line of the screen has the commands that are active when
     VIEWing, and the center of the screen now shows the text of the file
     that you have selected.  Think of that center portion of the screen as
     a WINDOW into the file.  While VIEWing a file the following keys can
     be used:

     Up Arrow   Moves the window up one line of text.

     Down Arrow Moves the window down one line of text.

     ->         Moves the window right one character.

     <-         Moves the window left one character.

     PgUp       Moves up a full window of text.

     PgDn       Moves down a full window of text.

     Space Bar  Moves the window to the next spot that has a Query keyword
                in it.  If there are no more keywords, moves to the end of
                the file.

     Backspace  Moves the window to the previous spot that has a Query
     ( <-- )    keyword on it.  If there are no more keywords, moves to the
                start of the file.

     Additional window movement commands are accessed by holding down the
     "Ctrl" key (you see the menu change when you do this) and pressing one
     of these keys:

     Ctrl Home  Moves the window to the start of the current file.

     Ctrl End   Moves the window to the end of current file.

     Ctrl PgUp  Moves the window to the start of the previous file in the
                FILES list.

     Ctrl PgDn  Moves the window to the start of the next file in the
                FILES list.

     To return to the FILES list press the  Esc  key.



     Query
     ~~~~~

     You can search the files that have been indexed with the Query
     command.  When you press  Q  while at the main menu, you are prompted
     to enter a free form query.  (See the next section on "Searching for
     Files" for more details about this process.)

     Uquery remembers the last 10 queries that you made.  You can access
     this query "history" while at the Query? prompt by pressing the up and
     down arrow keys.  Previous queries are brought into the edit space
     where they can be further edited, or simply selected by pressing
     Enter.


     Searching for Files
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Uin's indexing of textual data allows you to locate files based on the
     WORDS that occur in the text.  You can use a single word to locate
     files, or you can use several words and specify their positional
     relationship to each other.

     You start a search for files by selecting the Query command from the
     main menu.  Queries are entered as free form text and are made up of a
     number of elements.  The sections that follow define what these
     elements are.


     Query Words
     ~~~~~~~~~~~

     Query words are the "Keywords" that you want to search for.  When
     entered into a Query, each Keyword must be separated by at least one
     space.  You can type Query words in upper and lower case, but Uin
     treats all words as being lower case.

     You can use an  *  at the end of a keyword to indicate "any ending".
     For example if you searched for:

        print*

     you could find:

        print
        prints
        printer
        printing  etc.



     Booleans
     ~~~~~~~~

     Three words have special meaning to a Query.  AND, OR, and NOT can be
     used to define logical relationships between words.

     AND - Used to indicate that two or more words must be present in a
     (&)   file for that file to be selected.  You can use  &  as a short 
           form for AND.

           Example:  printer and network

                     Only files that contained both these words would be
                     selected.

      OR - Used to indicate that any one of two or more words must be
     (|)   present in a file for that file to be selected.  You can use  |
           as a short form for OR.

           Example:  communications or telecommunications

                     Any files that contained either (or both) of these
                     words would be selected.

     NOT - Indicates that a word must not be in a file for that file to be
     (!)   selected.  You can use  !  as a short form for NOT.

           Example:  not multitasking

                     Any files that contain the word "multitasking" would
                     not be selected.  All other files would be selected.


     Phrases
     ~~~~~~~

     If you enclose a string of words in double quotations they are treated 
     as a phrase.  These same words must appear together in the text for a
     match to occur.

     Like other queries, words in a phrase can have an  *  indicating any
     ending.  Phrases only can also have an  *  representing any word.

     Example:  "* error code*"

               Matches "the error codes", "an error code", etc.



     Proximity
     ~~~~~~~~~

     Sometimes you are interested in two words only when they are near each
     other in the text.  To indicated proximity in Uquery use the form:

        word1 .dd. word2

        Where  dd  represents the maximum number of words that word1 and
        word2 can be apart in the text for a match to occur.

     Example:  network* .20. print*

               Matches any file that has a word beginning with the root
               "network" within 20 words of a word beginning with "print".


     Parenthesis
     ~~~~~~~~~~~

     When processing a query with more than two words, Uquery chooses an
     order to process them that results in the most efficient search. 
     Words in parenthesis will however be processed first.  You may use
     parenthesis in a query to ensure that your meaning is clear.  For
     example the query:

        barney or fred and wilma

     Might match files that contain one (or both) of the words barney or
     fred along with the word wilma.

        (barney or fred) and wilma

     OR

     Might match files that contain the word barney or files that contain
     the words fred and wilma.

        barney or (fred and wilma)

     Since both interpretations would lead to different results, you would
     use parenthesis (as above) to clarify which files it is that you want.



     Complex Searches (Putting It All Together)
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     All of the above elements can be combined in complex ways to help you
     find exactly what you are looking for.

     A few examples of complex queries are:

        Find all files that refer to John Smith or Jack Jones or Jim Small.

                "john smith" or "jack jones" or "jim small"


        Find all files that have the words red and blue but not yellow in
        them.

                red & blue & (!yellow)


        Find files that contain the phrases "error code" or "error codes"
        within 20 words of the words print or printer or printing or
        printed or prints.

                "error code*" .20. print*


     Searching Tips
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     You normally do not know your complete search criteria when you begin
     to search (although you might).  The search process is more often an
     iterative one in which you refine and build on the results you are
     getting.

     Start by trying to Limit the search.  Is there a certain type of file
     that is more likely to contain the text that you are looking for?
     (Filespec!)  Was the information you are searching for created within
     within a known period of time?  (Dates!)

     Then try a few "keyword" queries.  Make the selection of keywords as
     unique as possible.  Use "root-word" searches (like print*) to be sure
     that you are finding all occurences of a word no matter what the
     ending.  Phrases and proximity searches take a little longer, but will
     often narrow the search more quickly.

     If you are successful at reducing the number of files with the above
     techniques, use the Limit/Selected command to keep the search space
     small.  Repeat the last few steps until you have reduced the files
     selected to a manageable size, then use VIEW to see the keywords in
     context.

     Practice!  As with any skill, searching a text database will get
     easier with time.



     Configuring Uin
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     A separate program (Uincfg) is provided to modify Uquery with some of
     your own preferences.  When you run this Uin Configuration, you must
     ensure that "uquery.exe" is in the current directory.  Follow the
     prompts for the configuration program.  When you have answered the
     last question "uquery.exe" is updated with your selections.

     The following user preferences can be configured within Uin:

        - video display mode
        - initial text entry mode
        - color of normal text
        - color of inverse text
        - color of active (edit) text
        - initial word wrap mode
        - initial one line description of indexed files

     Uin is a Shareware information manager.  This means that you only pay
     for it if you decide to continue using it.  If you don't think that it
     is worth the asking price, delete the program, or better yet give it
     to someone who might find it useful.  However if you do decide to keep
     Uin after a 2 week trial period, please send $35 (see REGISTRATION
     FORM on next page) to:

     The Shareware fee pays for unlimited use of Uin by a single person.
     You are allowed (and encouraged) to give away copies of Uin with the
     understanding that each person receiving a copy is under the same
     obligation as you are to send in the Shareware fee if they decide to
     keep it.  You can upload THIS VERSION ONLY of Uin to other computer
     systems, either free or commercial, as long as this archive remains
     intact, with the copyright and Shareware notices unchanged.

     Useful Index can be installed on LANs.  In such situations we ask only 
     that the LAN Administrator estimate the maximum number of people that 
     will be making "simultaneous" use of Uin and pay the Shareware fee 
     based on that estimate.  We do not expect that the limit be closely 
     monitored or enforced (I appreciate how much trouble that would be),
     but we do expect that the estimate will be revised (and additional
     fees paid) should a substantial increase in the number of nodes on the
     LAN and Uin usage occur.

     No guarantee is made as to the functionality of this software; however
     it has been tested quite thoroughly by a large number of people.  If
     it doesn't do what you want, don't keep it and send no money.

     Please support the Shareware concept.  Shareware means useful programs
     at a fraction of the cost you might pay for them commercially.  You
     can try-before-you-buy, and you are not subjected to copy protection
     or other atrocities that many software vendors inflict on their
     customers.  Software updates can also be distributed much faster than
     is possible through normal channels.
