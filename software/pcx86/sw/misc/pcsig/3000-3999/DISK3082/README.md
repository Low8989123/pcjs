PC-SIG UPDATES PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM

For Immediate Release


PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM UPDATED TO INCLUDE A NEW USER INTERFACE AND MORE
THAN 800 MB OF PROGRAMS June 21, 1992, SUNNYVALE, CALIF. - PC-SIG, Inc.
today announced availability of The Eleventh Edition of the PC-SIG Library
on CD-ROM.  The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM contains over 800 megabytes of
shareware and includes more than 300 new programs, 550 updated programs,
and the addition of 75 megabytes of Windows 3.x shareware.  The
user-interface has been completely re-engineered to take advantage of the
HyperWriter! hypermedia and multimedia authoring system from NTERGAID, Inc.

The implementation of HyperWriter! provides significant performance and
ease of use enhancements.  Programs can access and download much faster
than with previous editions.  Programs have been reorganized and indexed
for better referencing.  Users just c lick with a mouse, or point with the
cursor, on a program name to see a complete description of the program.
Downloading or copying a program is handled automatically by HyperWriter!
Addition of a preview option is especially important for anyone who uses
images, icons, or fonts.  "You can preview the whole library of images to
find the right one," according to Bruce Kent, product development manager.
"This CD finally makes it possi ble to conserve your disk space and paper,
yet still have all the information you need to make an informed decision,"
said Kent.

All new and updated programs have been reviewed and tested by PC-SIG. Every
program goes through extensive virus checking using the most recent version
of VIRUSCAN from McAfee Associates, and other anti-virus software.
According to Kent, "In the ten ye ars we've distributed shareware, we have
never had a confirmed report of a virus on any of our distributed programs
or CD-ROMs."

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, Eleventh Edition has a list price of $179.

Upgrades from previous editions are available for $99.

          Adrol1.txt     1-17-91

          This is a collection of music files for AdLib's Music Synthesizer
          Card.  They were produced by  converting public domain MIDI files
          to  AdLib's  .ROL  file  format   using  Patch  Panel  Software's
          proprietary MIDI-AdLib converter.  See also Adrol2 and Adrol3 for
          more such files.

          The  MIDI  files were  public  domain  and in  keeping  with that
          concept, these .ROL  format files should be as well.  Any attempt
          to sell these files other  than a nominal disk-duplicating charge
          is expressly prohibited.  The author acknowledges a great debt to
          those MIDI authors who  published their work.  Without  them, the
          converter  would not  be possible,  nor would the  enjoyment that
          their work brings to the listener exist.

          This  is a great way to build  your library of songs for use with
          Composer, Jukebox,  and PopTunes.   Every AdLib  user needs  this
          program.   Over 85%  of  the MIDI  files tested  so far  produced
          useable material as this library demonstrates.  If MIDI files are
          purchased as  shareware, the  cost runs  less than  60 cents  per
          useable tune.

          The converter  supports Composer-compatibility  as an  option and
          all of  these  files used  that  option and  can  be played  with
          Composer.  

          The converter can be purchased from Patch Panel for $25.00. (Fla.
          residents  add  $1.75  sales  tax.)   Price  includes  a  30-page
          document describing the converter and the MIDI spec as it applies
          to the conversion  process.  60-day  money-back guarantee if  not
          satisfied.  Specify disk size.  Hard disk recommended.

          This  library demonstrates the  converter's support of instrument
          assignments.  A variation of the "symno8?m" files is available as
          "sym8?" to illustrate  one possible  instrument scheme.   Compare
          "symno81m.rol" to "sym81.rol" to see the difference.

                               MIDI to AdLib Converter
             Copyright(C) 1991, Patch Panel Software, All Rights Reserved

          Patch Panel Software has developed a MIDI-to-AdLib converter that
          is very successful converting MIDI standard files to AdLib's .ROL
          file format.   This is no small feat  considering MIDI is for all
          intents  and  purposes  a 32-bit  timing  standard  while AdLib's
          hardware  and software  imposes  a 16-bit  timing standard.   The
          converter  routinely tolerates  the 480  Tick-per-beat resolution
          frequently found in MIDI files.

          See  ADROL1.EXE, ADROL2.EXE,  and ADROL3.EXE  for self-extracting
          libraries of  over forty  files  as examples  of the  converter's
          work.   Very large files can  be converted.  So far  no MIDI file
          has  been  found to  be  too  large for  the  converter, although
          theoretically one could be.  Pieces 16-20 minutes long are easily
          converted.

          The output files  are fully compatible with  AdLib's Composer(tm)
          program  for editing.  They  can be used  wherever .ROL files are
          used (Composer(tm), JukeBox(tm), PopTunes(tm)).

          In a test  of over 50 MIDI  files, the converter produced  useful
          conversions  for  over  85%  of  the  files.    The  unsuccessful
          conversions fell roughly  equally into  2 categories: junk  music
          and too complex music.  Junk means it was bad to begin with.  Too
          complex means  the files  required too many  voices, often  20-30
          voices versus AdLib's 9-11.

          This is an excellent tool for any AdLib user who wants to collect
          music for playback on their AdLib boards.  Editing files is slow;
          converting files is  fast.   If you purchase  shareware disks  of
          MIDI files, the price is under 60 cents per useable tune.   There
          is a wide  assortment of MIDI  music available,  and the work  is
          generally more ambitious work than AdLib users typically see.

          The converter is also a good tool for MIDI users who want to  tap
          this market with their work.

          You can scan the file to get a report of the contents to help you
          plan your conversion.   You also  get rolplayr.exe, a program  to
          play .ROL files  without the burden  of a graphics interface  for
          easier testing.   Multi-track files  are no problem.   Tempo  and
          tick-per-beat can be adjusted.  Patch-to-instrument mapping gives
          you control over  the instrument  selection for program  changes.
          Volume control is also supported.

          The  converter  costs $25.00  (Fla. add  $1.75  tax).   A 30-page
          document is included.  Specify disk size.  Hard disk recommended.

               MuchMusic for Adlib & Sound Blaster v1.11


                    Copyright (c) 1990 Tsung Hu.

                        All rights reserved.




Usage

    Play Adlib ROL and Sound Blaster CMF music files and ZIP files
    that contain ROL and CMF music files.


Requirements

    Adlib music card with the Sound Driver SOUND.COM installed or
    Sound Blaster music card.

    90K to 150K bytes free memory is required depending on the number
    of music files in the directory.

    MuchMusic is a DesqView-aware software.


Setting up the environment variables

    MuchMusic uses several environment variables to locate
    the music files.  Once the variables are set up, you
    can run MuchMusic at any directory without any parameter.

    The following commands should be put in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.

    SET ROL=  indicates the directory where the Adlib ROL music file is.
    SET CMF=  indicates where the Sound Blaster CMF music file is.
    SET BNK=  indicates where the Adlib BNK instrument bank is.
    SET MMUNZIP= indicates where the PKUNZIP is.

    All directories must end with an '\', for example,
        SET ROL=C:\ROL\
        SET CMF=C:\CMF\
        SET BNK=C:\ROL\
        SET MMUNZIP=C:\UTIL\

    During the setup, if AUTOEXEC.BAT reports 'not enough environment
    space', you should put the SHELL command in your CONFIG.SYS. For
    example,
        SHELL=\COMMAND.COM /p /e:1200
    increase the environment space to 1200 bytes.


Running MuchMusic

    MM [rolfile] [cmffile] [bnkfile] [zipfile] [/a] [/b]

        Default is ROL and CMF files of the current directory or the
        directory indicated by the SET ROL= and SET CMF= environment
        variables. \ must be the last character in these variables. For
        example, you can put the following lines in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
              SET ROL=C:\ROL\
              SET CMF=C:\CMF\
        If no ROL or CMF is in the directory, ZIP files in the directory
        are searched.  As a result, just
              MM
        in the DOS command line includes all ROL file in C:\ROL\ and
        CMF file in C:\CMF\.  If there is no ROL or CMF, all ZIP file
        in C:\ROL\ and C:\CMF\ are included for ROL and CMF file.

    [rolfile] and [cmffile] can be any valid path name. If no
        extension is given, both ROL and CMF files will be searched.
        For example,
              MM \MUSIC\*
        includes all ROL and CMF in the MUSIC directory.  Multiple
        directories can be specified.  For example,
              MM \ROL\*.ROL \MUSIC\*.ROL \CMF\*.CMF
        includes all ROL files in ROL and MUSIC directory and CMF
        files in the CMF directory.

    [bnkfile] is a Adlib instrument bank. Default bank is the
        STANDARD.BNK in the current directory or the directory
        indicated by the SET BNK= environment variable. For example,
              MM MYBANK.BNK
        uses the MYBANK.BNK instrument bank instead of the standard
        bank. If the standard instrument bank is not on the current
        directory, you can put the following lines in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
              SET BNK=C:\ROL\
        assuming that the STANDARD.BNK is in the C:\ROL\ directory.

    [zipfile] is a ZIP compressed file which contains ROL or CMF
        music file.  You must have PKUNZIP.EXE in the current
        directory, a directory indicated by the SET PATH= environment
        variable or the directory indicated by the SET MMUNZIP=
        environment variable. For example, you can put the following
        lines in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
              SET MMUNZIP=C:\ROL\
        To play ROL or CMF inside a ZIP file, you can rum
              MM ROL.ZIP
        or    MM ROL.ZIP \MUSIC\CMF.ZIP
        However, the STANDARD.BNK inside the ZIP file is NOT used.
        You can also mix the [rolfile] and [cmffile] with the
        [zipfile] parameter.  For example,
              MM *.ROL *.CMF \MUSIC\*.ZIP

    [/a] option forces MuchMusic to check for Adlib Music Card
    only.  If you have an Adlib card and CMF music files, you
    should use this option.

    [/b] option forces BIOS write instead of direct screen write.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
