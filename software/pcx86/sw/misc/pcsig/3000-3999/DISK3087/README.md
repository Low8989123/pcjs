Jumble Fever 2.0 is a program designed to run under Windows 3.0 
or later. This program cannot be run directly from DOS. The 
program files are all in a compressed format.

A program called "Setup" is provided on this disk. Setup will
install Jumble Fever on your Hard Drive (or another floppy.)
The program installation is a simple process that you can abort 
at any time, and does not require any information from you.
 
Setup will prepare and copy all required files from this program 
disk to any drive/directory you specify (C:\jumble is the default.) 
In addition, Setup will create a  Windows Group and place the 
program icon in it, so that Jumble Fever can be started from an 
icon.  

To run the Setup program:
   1.) Start Windows,
   2.) Open the Program Manager,
   3.) Put this program disk in your floppy drive,
   4.) Select Run... from the File Menu,
   5.) Enter a:setup
       (This assumes that the floppy with this program disk is the 
       A drive. If the floppy is your B drive, then enter b:setup
       instead.)

After you do the above, Setup will install Jumble Fever. Setup
will report its actions and status to you throughout the installation
process.
