BKG   Windows background fader
==============================

  This program is for Windows users who have limited memory and/or
think faded colors look nice as a background.  This program will 
display a color fade as your Windows background.  A color fade means 
that the color gradually changes from one side to another in a smooth
fashion.  This App. has the advantage over wallpaper of needing very 
little memory.

  Once you run the program, the starting/ending colors and the fade
direction can be set from a dialog box.  The dialog box is brought
up by clicking on the background with the RIGHT mouse button. Setting
RGB values for the colors is done with scroll bars and/or mini edit boxes.
The fade style (Vertical, Horizontal, Vertical Center, Horizontal center)
is set via a combo box. The dialog box also has options to save the color
or exit the program.

  Before running BKG, make sure you set your wallpaper to NONE.  If you 
don't everything will work OK but the wallpaper will still be taking up 
whatever memory it needs for the bitmap.

  If you use other programs which are invoked by clicking the right mouse
button on the background (BackMenu for example), you can disable the mouse
for this program by adding the line UseMouse=No to the [BKG] section of 
your Win.Ini file. Note that if you do this you will need to edit Win.Ini
to change colors in the future as you will have no way of getting to the 
dialog box.

  Feel free to copy, distribute, fold, spindle and mutilate this program
as you like, BUT... I hereby claim no responsibility whatsoever for any
reason for anything... ever. Go GATORS!

and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.

and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,

you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Sync-It Product Overview

The ultimate file transfer and synchronization program.

Sync-It is a must have program for those of you who use more
than one computer and need to frequently transfer files between
them, without the hassle of connecting cables. 
 
It's the perfect program for computer users who frequently
switch between portables and desktops and need the latest
versions of their important files updated on both PCs. 
 
Or, if you frequently transfer files between PCs... desktops,
notebooks/laptops or network whether at home or in the office,  
In-Sync is the answer.  Better yet if you frequently transport
files between offices, it's the ideal solution.  
 
Connecting cables or a modem is often impossible, cumber-some,
inconvenient or impractical.  Sync-It eliminates the tedious task
of transferring files between PCs using cables, modems or DOS
commands.  

With Sync-It you can use any removable media such as floppy disks
as a transfer media. 
 
Sync-It even keeps track of files which have been deleted from one
PC with the option to delete these from your other PC as well.
This is ideal if you use programs such as a personal information
manager and need to keep these files completely synchronized
(identical) on two PCs. 
 
Transfer Utility 
 
The Transfer Utility is used each time you want to transfer files
from one PC to another, using a transfer media such as floppy
diskettes.  You can be as selective as you want in determining
which files or directories you want to keep synchronized.  All
of the files which you have created, changed or have been copied
in the directories you want to keep synchronized are copied to
the transfer media. 
 
If you need to keep files such as a database or personal
information manager totally synchronized (identical) between
two PCs, the "Synchronize" feature assures that files deleted
from one PC are also deleted from the other. 
 
Optional file compression minimizes the number of disks needed for
transferring files and our split file technology assures that the
largest files can be transferred even when using floppy disks. 

Update Utility 
 
The Update Utility, restores the files you transferred from the
transfer media onto the other PC, making sure only the most recent
files are updated and that all files are synchronized. 
 
Major Benefits 
 
- Keeps the latest versions of files on multiple PCs updated. 
- No cables to attach. 
- Easy to install, setup and use. 
- Splits large files onto more than one diskette. 
- Compresses files during file transfers to minimize the number
  of diskettes needed. 
- Option to delete files which have also been deleted from another
  PC, keeping such things as databases  and PIMs completely
  synchronized. 
- Automatic protection against updating files which were changed
  on  both PCs. 
- Transfer media can be any removable storage device. 
- Does not interfere with backup programs. 
- On-line documentation and help facility. 
- Unlimited technical support for registered users. 
 
Major Uses 
 
1. To keep your latest files updated between PCs. 
 
2. To keep databases such as Personal Information Managers
   synchronized on two PCs. 
 
3. To transport data between cities or offices. 
 
4. To transfer files from one PC to another. 
 
3. System Requirements

Windows 3.0 or higher, DOS 3.0 or higher, IBM« PC/XT/AT,PS/2«
or 100% equivalent systems.


THE LOCATOR

The Locator is the ideal companion and utility for any PC user who
uses removable storage as an integral part of their computing.
The use of removable media such as SyQuest drives, Bernoulli Boxes,
flopticals, opticals, floppies and the emerging PCMCIA cards is
growing.  

Software programs used today occupy a massive amount of hard disk
space. And data files are becoming larger and larger. 
 
Removable media use is growing as a result of the need for more and
more disk space for applications such as backup, archival, secondary
storage, additional primary storage and security.  Keeping these
disks organized, locating files and determining which disk a file is
on is time consuming, difficult and cumbersome.  
 
The Locator is very different from other File Finder utilities which
only allow you to search an "on-line" disk to locate files.  With
The Locator the disk doesn't even have to be inserted. 
 
The Locator allows you to catalog files on your removable disks
into a database and using the file finder, quickly and easily locate
and determine which disk a file is on.  You no longer have to
tediously insert each disk and repeatedly change and display
directories.  Now the location of these files is at your fingertips
and instantly accessible. 

Catalog Utility 
 
The Catalog Utility creates a database on your hard disk containing
information about each of the files which are cataloged.  You can
be as selective as you want in determining which drives, files or
directories you want to catalog.  You can catalog multiple drives
at once or multiple disks from the same drive. Each file recorded to
the database contains the following information.  
 
	1.  Catalog Name (User defined) 
	2.  Disk ID (User defined) 
	3.  File Name 
	4.  File name extension 
	5.  Date/Time

	- Network Computing 


The Problem 

If you're like most people, you know how important it is to
regularly back up your hard disk.  But like most people, you
probably don't.  Why?  Because back up is a chore.  It's 
non-productive and traditional backup software - although fast-
requires too much effort, making backup easy to ignore.   
 
Even if you backup once a week or month, all of the files you
have created or changed since your last backup are still exposed.
These files are usually the most important at the time and if 
lost causes the greatest productivity loss.  
 
The Solution 

Its SitBack, a memory resident backup program that keeps your
most recently created and changed files backed up automatically,
in the background, without lifting a finger or exiting the 
programs you are working with.   
 
You remain 100% productive and at the same time 100% protected.   
 
Its perfect for professionals who have more important things
to worry about than the usual hassle involved with other backup
programs, but who's data is critical and time sensitive. 
 
How It Works

changed files each time your computer is just sitting idle for
an amount of time you can specify.  So your hard disk is kept 
currently backed up throughout the day... automatically and in
the back-ground. 
 
Or you can schedule backups at specific times of the day or week.  
 
Either way it's the perfect utility for those who want complete
peace of mind, without the hassle. 
 
Easy To Use/Setup 

SitBack is easy to install and setup.  Just tell SitBack which
drives, directories or files to backup, how frequently and to 
where.  Once it's setup, the rest is left to SitBack.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
