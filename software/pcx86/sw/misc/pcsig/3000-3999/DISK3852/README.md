 Dear Shareware Vendor:

 This file contains our distribution policy and information on all
 products.

 Open Windows has a simple distribution policy: You have permission to
 distribute our shareware in its original form as long as you:

 * identify it as shareware (with an appropriate definition)

 * leave all intellectual property (copyright) notices in place

 ..and as long as we do not request that you stop.

 That's it.

 You may archive our programs, unarchive them, include/exclude optional
 files (like this one), include them with other programs on the same
 diskette, and do essentially anything you want as long as you follow
 these simple rules.  We want the widest possible distribution, and
 don't want to stand in your way so long as you are honest with our
 mutual customer.

 We suggest that you include all files with the same name (WINFLS21.EXE,
 WINFLS21.HLP, WINFLS21.REG, WINFLS21.FRM, WINFLS21.FLS ) in your 
 distribution together with the REGISTER.TXT file.  You may choose to include
 all or a part of this file with your distribution at your option.

 Our normal distribution sequence is:

 1  New versions are offered to our registered users and are
    automatically shipped to new users registering an out-of-date copy.

 2  New versions are posted on CIS in the WINSHARE forum.

 3  ASP distribution members are included in the regular ASP mailing.
    This saves both of us money and effort; if you are not an ASP
    vendor or bulletin board member, please consider joining.

 4  Then, we send copies of major revisions of software to non-ASP
    vendors who have notified us of their interest.  If you are a
    catalog house, send us a copy of the catalog in which the 
    program appears, together with a copy of the diskette(s) 
    containing the program(s) you wish to distribute; we will send
    you a copy of any major updates to our software.  If you run a
    bulletin board, send us a diskette(s) containing the program(s)
    you wish to distribute, and your mailing address, and we will 
    update the diskette and mail it back to you.

 If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints, please contact me:

## README.TXT

{% raw %}
```
Thank you for trying one of Open Windows' programs!  This disk
contains three of my programs - WinUpD8R 3.0, WinFlash 2.1 and 
BailOut.  Before using a program you'll need to create a new 
directory on your hard disk to hold the program's files, copy 
the program to your hard disk, UNZIP it and install it as an 
application into Windows.  If this makes perfect sense to you -
excellent - go to it!  If it doesn't, the step-by-step example 
below may help you work through the process.  Please forgive me
if this is overly detailed, but I've tried to make this usable 
by a complete newcomer to both DOS and Windows.

If you're planning to use the step-by-step instructions, print 
out this file so that you'll have hard copy handy for reference.
Let's assume you want to install WinUpD8R 3.0.  All the necessary 
files to run this program are contained in "compressed" form 
inside the file UPD8R-30.ZIP on this disk.  To install the 
program, follow the steps below:


1. Start Windows 3.1.  If Windows is already running and you've 
been working on something in Windows, save and close your files 
and close your applications so that if we reach a point where we 
need to turn the machine off and then back on we won't lose any 
data.


2. One of your program groups (probably the UTILITIES group) 
should contain an ICON with the title "MS-DOS Prompt".  Double-
click the mouse on this ICON.  This action should start up a 
full-screen DOS session - a black screen with a box  at the top 
whose first statement is "Type EXIT and press ENTER to quit this 
MS-DOS prompt and return to Windows".

The last line on the screen should look something like:

C:\WINDOWS>

with a flashing bar following the >.  Letters that you type will 
appear at the position of the flashing bar.

For the remainder of the instructions, I'll be using the 
following conventions:

If I want you to type something, I'll enclose WHAT I want you to 
type in square brackets - [ ].  If one of the keys isn't a 
regular character, such as the Enter key (the large key on the 
right of the main section of keys - it generally has a left-
facing arrow and the word "Enter" on it), I'll indicate a press 
of this key by enclosing its name in angle brackets - < >.  
Finally, I'll isolate that line from the rest of the text by 
putting a row of asterisks above and below the line.

For example, if I want you to type the word CAT and press the 
enter key, I'll indicate this as


*****************************************************************
TYPE [CAT<Enter>]
*****************************************************************


3. Our first step is to create a directory on the hard drive for 
the WinUpD8R files.  We'll call the directory WINUPD8R (or 
WINFLASH or BAILOUT depending on which program we're installing -
if you're installing one of the other programs, remember to 
substitute WINFLASH or BAILOUT from now on whenever you see 
WINUPD8R) and place it on the C drive as follows:

*****************************************************************
TYPE [MKDIR C:\WINUPD8R<Enter>]
*****************************************************************


4. Insert the Open Windows floppy disk into the proper drive.  
Make sure that the disk-retaining arm is closed correctly if the 
disk is a 5 1/4" disk (turn the arm 1/4 turn clockwise after 
inserting the disk).  If you have two floppy disk drives, make 
sure the other drive is empty.

If you know the correct letter designator for the drive in which 
you've placed the Open Windows floppy (it will be A or B), use 
that letter in step 5.  If you don't know, start with A, as I've 
indicated, and follow through the instructions.


5. 
*****************************************************************
TYPE [A:<Enter>] 
*****************************************************************

The computer should come back with

A:>

If so, move on to step 6.

If, instead, it says something like:

Not ready reading drive A:
Abort, Retry, Fail?

it means that the disk is really in drive B.  To recover

*****************************************************************
TYPE [f]
*****************************************************************

the computer should respond with:

The current drive is no longer valid>

*****************************************************************
TYPE [B:<Enter>]
*****************************************************************

the computer should respond with:

B:>


6. 
*****************************************************************
TYPE [DIR<Enter>]
*****************************************************************

At this point there should be a list of files appearing on your 
screen that looks something like:

BAILOUT  ZIP 	13332
FLASH-21 ZIP 	62438
README   TXT  	12070
UNZIP    EXE    30226
UPD8R-30 ZIP    76260

along with some other dates, times and numbers.  


7.  Now we'll copy the files we need to the directory that we've 
created on the hard drive in step 3:

*****************************************************************
TYPE [COPY UPD8R-30.ZIP C:\WINUPD8R<Enter>]
*****************************************************************

(If you're installing WinFlash or BailOut, substitute 
FLASH-21.ZIP or BAILOUT.ZIP for UPD8R-30.ZIP above and WINFLASH
or BAILOUT for WINUPD8R - remember to continue with these 
substitutions in the following steps...) 

The computer should respond with:

1 file(s) copied

*****************************************************************
TYPE [COPY UNZIP.EXE C:\WINUPD8R<Enter>]
*****************************************************************

Again the computer should respond with:

1 file(s) copied


9.  Now, we'll move back over to the hard drive:

*****************************************************************
TYPE [C:<Enter>]
*****************************************************************

the computer should come back with:

C:\WINUPD8R>

or:

C:\WINDOWS>

or perhaps just

C:>

In any case, as long as what comes back STARTS with C:, you're 
in good shape.

*****************************************************************
TYPE [CD C:\WINUPD8R<Enter>]
*****************************************************************

the computer should come back with:

C:\WINUPD8R>

or, again, perhaps just

C:>

To be sure we're in the right place and everything we need is 
here:

*****************************************************************
TYPE [DIR<Enter>]
*****************************************************************

The two files we copied should now appear on your screen in a 
list looking like:

UNZIP    EXE    30226
UPD8R-30 ZIP    75748

along with some other dates, times and numbers.  

If one or both of the files is missing, return to step 5 and 
carefully go through the instructions again.  Be VERY careful not 
to insert extra spaces and that you type EXACTLY what is shown.


10.  Next, to start the unzipping process:

*****************************************************************
TYPE [UNZIP UPD8R-30<Enter>]
*****************************************************************

This will produce the following eight files in the WINUPD8R 
directory:

	WINUPD30.EXE - The executable program file
	WINUPD30.HLP - The help file supporting WinUpD8R
	WINUPD30.REG - Information on shareware in Windows Write
		 format - called by registration procedure
	WINUPD30.FRM - Registration form in Windows Write
		format - called by registration procedure
	REGISTER.TXT - Registration form in ASCII format
	README.WRI - The help documentation in Windows Write 
		format
	VENDOR.TXT - Information of interest to shareware
		distributors and BBSs in ASCII format
	FILE_ID.DIZ - Program description supporting automatic
		extraction of description text by BBSs

To see these files listed:

*****************************************************************
TYPE [DIR<Enter>]
*****************************************************************

If the computer lists the files shown, plus the two files that we 
started with, we've completed the hard part of the job!!

(Similar files will appear if we're working with WinFlash and a 
smaller list if we're working with BailOut)


11.  Before returning to Windows, let's remove the files we no 
longer need:

*****************************************************************
TYPE [DEL UPD8R-30.ZIP<Enter>]
*****************************************************************

*****************************************************************
TYPE [DEL UNZIP.EXE<Enter>]
*****************************************************************

*****************************************************************
TYPE [DIR<Enter>]
*****************************************************************

The list should now only include the "new" files listed above, as 
we've DELeted UPD8R-30.ZIP and UNZIP.EXE.


12.  To return to Windows:

*****************************************************************
TYPE [EXIT<Enter>]
*****************************************************************

We should now be back in Windows.


13.  Select, by double clicking on it with the mouse, the program 
group which you want to hold the WinUpD8R ICON for running the 
program.


14.  Open the Program Manager's File menu by clicking once on the 
word "File" (at the top of the screen) with the mouse.


15.  Click once on the word "New" on the menu which appears with 
the mouse.

This will bring up a "dialog box" labeled "New Program Object" 
with two circles in it, one of them blackened.


16.  If it is not blackened already, click in the circle next to 
the words "Program Item" with the mouse so that the circle 
becomes blackened.


17.  Click the OK button with the mouse

This will bring up another dialog box labeled "Program Item 
Properties".


18.  Click the mouse inside the box following the word 
"Description" and:

*****************************************************************
TYPE [WinUpD8R]
*****************************************************************

(or WinFlash)  If you're installing BailOut, open the BAILOUT.WRI
file with the Windows WRITE editor for further instructions.  You
may wish to install BAILOUT in the WIN.INI file rather than as a
regular application.

Click the mouse inside the next box down and:

*****************************************************************
TYPE [C:\WINUPD8R\WINUPD30.EXE]
*****************************************************************

(Remember to replace WINUPD8R and WINUPD30.EXE with their 
proper counterparts if installing one of the other applications)

Click the OK button with the mouse.


19. The ICON for WinUpD8R (a red disk with UpD8R on it in yellow
letters) or other application you are installing should now 
appear in the program group you selected in step 13.  If so, 
congratulations!! - you've successfully installed WinUpD8R 3.0!!

20. To use WinUpD8R, double-click on its ICON and take some time 
to read through the on line help provided to learn how to use the 
program.

If you have comments or suggestions on how to improve these 
instructions, or questions relating to their use, please write me 
at the address below or send me a note on CompuServe.
