This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
900 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'INSTALL' at
the DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy
access to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.  All the programs are logically divided into thirteen
major categories with subcategories, making it easier to find just the
right software.

All of the programs have been scanned for viruses.  There are also three
online virus utilities that can be run from the CD-ROM which will scan,
screen and clean viruses.  Not only does this save hard disk space, but
also gives every user added security from viruses.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

Winner of the Optical Publishing Assn's Best Consumer Product Award.

Shareware for every imaginable need: Accounting Chemistry Educational
Engineering Games Hypertext Networks Programming Spreadsheets Utilities
Word Processing

Additional BBS file descriptions are available from PC-SIG so that the
CD-ROM can be set up quickly on a bulletin board.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 530K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
a graphics monitor (Hercules/EGA/VGA/SVGA).  A mouse is optional.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

## PMTOOLS.DOC

{% raw %}
```
 

The PrintMaster program on the IBM-PC is a very popular and useful
program. The PMTOOLS program is a collection of utilities
designed to enhance the PrintMaster program. Version 1.0 includes
three functions.

   1) Print a listing of the icons contained in a library.

   2) Display icons on the screen so that they may be captured
      with a screen capture program.

   3) Convert a group of icons from a library to a Windows Paint
      format file.


To use the PMTOOLS program place the disk containing the PMTOOLS
program in  drive A and your PrintMaster disk in drive B. Now run
the PMTOOLS program by typing PMTOOLS. The program will ask you
to enter the file name of the icon file - Type B:SLIB.SHP. The
program will now read the icon file and display the first icons
from the file on the screen. You will notice two messages on the
right side of the screen. One states - PRESS <ESC> TO EXIT. This
reminds you that you may leave the program by pressing the ESC
key. The other message states - PRESS H FOR HELP. A help screen
listing the available commands will be displayed when you press
the H key. To leave the HELP screen - press the space bar.

If you have created your own graphics images the icons will be
stored in a file called ULIB.SHP. You may also use these icons
with the PMTOOLS program.

To obtain a printed listing of the icons turn your printer on,
align the paper to the top of a page and press the P key on the
keyboard. To stop printing at any time press the CTRL and BREAK
keys at the same time. Seventy-two icons will be printed on each
page as nine rows of eight icons each. The printing function will
only work with EPSON or EPSON compatible printers. You will
notice that the icon names are not shown on the screen but are
included on the printed listing.

To capture PrintMaster icons for use in other graphics programs,
load your capture program before running PMTOOLS. Then run
PMTOOLS as described above. Thirty icons will be loaded in at a
time. It is not possible to display all thirty at the same time
due to the limitations of the CGA display. You may scroll through
the initial thirty icons by pressing the PGUP, PGDN and up/down
arrow keys on the cursor pad. The PGUP and PGDN keys will scroll
the display fifty lines in the corresponding direction. The up
and down arrow keys will move the display 1 line in the
corresponding direction. To display the next 30 icons from the
file press the N key. Each time you press the N key another 30
icons will be loaded until you reach the end of the icon file.
A beep will be sounded when you reach the end of the file and the
display will return to the icons at the top of the file. You may
return to the top of the file at any time by pressing the T key. 

The icons are displayed on the screen as a black image on a white
background. You may invert the image to a white on black display
by pressing the I key. Pressing the I key again will invert the
image back to a black on white display. 

To create a Windows Paint format file that can be used with the
Windows Paint program first run the PMTOOLS as described above.
The Windows Paint file will contain thirty PrintMaster icons. To
select which thirty icons are to be included in the paint file
press the N key until the desired icons are loaded. Remember that
all thirty current icons will be written to the paint file not
just the ones visible on the screen. Use the PGUP and PGDN keys
to look at all thirty. When you have selected the desired icons
press the W key. The program will ask for a file name to store
the Windows Paint format file in. PMTOOLS supports drive
designators and path names so you may store the paint file
anywhere. If you intend to use the program with Windows Paint
give the file name a MSP extension.

        the PSTOOLS program by typing PSTOOLS.  The program will ask  you 
        to  enter the file name of the icon file - Type B:ICONS.DAT.  The 
        program  will now read the icon file and display the first  icons

        the H key. To leave the HELP screen - press the space bar.

        If  you have the graphics library disk #1 the icons are stored in  
        a file named GRLIB1.DAT.  If you have the PrintShop Companion the 
        icons are stored in a file named GRPSC.DAT.  If you have  created 
        your own icons they will be stored in a file named GRDATA.DAT.

        To  obtain  a printed listing of the icons turn your printer  on,

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
