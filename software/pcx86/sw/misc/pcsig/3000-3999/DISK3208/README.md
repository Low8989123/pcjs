PC-SIG UPDATES PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM

For Immediate Release


PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM UPDATED TO INCLUDE A NEW USER INTERFACE AND MORE
THAN 800 MB OF PROGRAMS June 21, 1992, SUNNYVALE, CALIF. - PC-SIG, Inc.
today announced availability of The Eleventh Edition of the PC-SIG Library
on CD-ROM.  The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM contains over 800 megabytes of
shareware and includes more than 300 new programs, 550 updated programs,
and the addition of 75 megabytes of Windows 3.x shareware.  The
user-interface has been completely re-engineered to take advantage of the
HyperWriter! hypermedia and multimedia authoring system from NTERGAID, Inc.

The implementation of HyperWriter! provides significant performance and
ease of use enhancements.  Programs can access and download much faster
than with previous editions.  Programs have been reorganized and indexed
for better referencing.  Users just c lick with a mouse, or point with the
cursor, on a program name to see a complete description of the program.
Downloading or copying a program is handled automatically by HyperWriter!
Addition of a preview option is especially important for anyone who uses
images, icons, or fonts.  "You can preview the whole library of images to
find the right one," according to Bruce Kent, product development manager.
"This CD finally makes it possi ble to conserve your disk space and paper,
yet still have all the information you need to make an informed decision,"
said Kent.

All new and updated programs have been reviewed and tested by PC-SIG. Every
program goes through extensive virus checking using the most recent version
of VIRUSCAN from McAfee Associates, and other anti-virus software.
According to Kent, "In the ten ye ars we've distributed shareware, we have
never had a confirmed report of a virus on any of our distributed programs
or CD-ROMs."

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, Eleventh Edition has a list price of $179.

Upgrades from previous editions are available for $99.

Users of PC-SIG's Essential Home & Business Collection CD-ROM can upgrade
for $120.

PC-SIG CD-ROMs are distributed worldwide through a network of distributors
and resellers. Based in Sunnyvale, Calif., PC-SIG, Inc. markets and
supports one of the world's largest collections of shareware for IBM PCs
and compatible systems.  PC-SIG also publishes Shareware Magazine, which is
devoted solely to shareware.  The magazine is availa ble by subscription
and on newsstands nationwide.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K memory, DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions, and a hard drive. Microsoft compatible

In Contact! (c) 1992, Version 1.0
Suggested BBS Name, this version INCT100.ZIP

A Full Featured Shareware Contact Manager for Windows
Requires VBRUN100.DLL to run

Brought to you by:
Serious Shareware, P.O. Box 5523, Arlington TX  76005-5523 

GETTING STARTED
---------------

To install InContact!, follow these directions:

1.  Copy the InContact! program files to your hard drive, or you
    can install the program from your floppy drive.

2.  Make sure that the file VBRUN100.DLL is either:
      A. In the same place as the InContact program files, -or-
      B. In your Windows SYSTEM directory, where it can be shared
         with any other Visual Basic Application.
    If you are installing from a floppy drive, VBRUN100 must be
    in the Windows SYSTEM directory.

3.  From Windows, run the program INSTALL.EXE (from Program 
    Manager select the "Run..." option from the File menu)

4.  Follow the instructions in the install program.  It will 
    allow you to either install to a new directory (i.e. from a 
    diskette) or will just configure in the current location 
    (if you have already copied the files to your hard disk). 
    It will even create a Program Manager group for you if you 
    wish.

After you complete the installation, InContact! will 
automatically run.

For Floppy Disk Users:

Floppy disk is not recommended for this program as speed and 
performance will be diminished.  If you must use a floppy, you 
can run InContact! from the disk provided but you still must run
the installer to configure the program (without it copying any 
files!).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:

InContact! is a professionally-oriented contact manager for 
Windows 3.x running in standard or enhanced modes with at least
1meg of memory (recommended).  It not designed for multi-user 
network use.  Read the file NOTICE.TXT and the Shareware 
information in the application.  There is also an Overview 
section in the program for your review which can give you a 
more detailed description.

This README file contains information about getting started with
the application.  There are other files which cover more specific 
topics:

REVIEWR.TXT   A quick guide through InContact! (please read!)
EXT.WRI       Information which allows you to create add-on

              you will need to read before you distribute

InContact! Ver 1.0 ... A Guided Tour
--------------------------------------------

To help your review of this version of our application we have 
compiled a list of features.  Feel free to use this sheet to 
guide you through many of InContact's finer points and unique 
features. 

When you first run the program it creates a file called SAMPLE 
if no files exist.  Thereafter the program will remember and 
auto-load the last file used.  We have included a file called 
(coincidentally) SAMPLE which contains 10 records.  Feel 
free to use this file for testing purposes. 

When you see the About window, select the Overview and Shareware 
buttons.

Once in the program, take a short trip through some of these 
features:

[] All windows are movable and InContact remembers where you put 
   them (even after you exit the program).  This feature can be 
   turned off via the Preferences dialog.

[] The View menu allows you to customize the look of InContact.  
   By selecting items on this menu you can toggle sections of the 
   window on and off.  This can help you reduce the size of the 
   window by hiding information you are not interested in.

[] All applicable fields have an auto-capitalize feature (which 
   you may turn off in the Preferences dialog).  Entry fields 
   will capitalize each word and notes will capitalize only the 
   first word of each sentence.

[] Most date fields have a browse button (with an ellipsis "...") 
   to the right of applicable fields.  When you activate one of 
   these buttons a popup monthly calendar appears, allowing you 
   to easily select the appropriate date.

[] In all cases where a file name is required, a browse button 
   allows you to search for a filename via a standard file 
   selection dialog.

[] Eight user-definable "flags" have been provided to allow you 
   to set up your own yes/no-type identifiers for each file 
   (located at the bottom of the main window).  

[] In addition, InContact has two user-defined "list" fields: 
   Category and Status.  These allow you to set up your own lists 
   of categories for each file  (located toward the upper-right 
   of the main window).

[] InContact features a control bar at the top of the main 
   window.  This bar allows you to access many frequently-used 
   functions directly with the mouse:

   [] The control bar contains three iconic buttons at the far 
      right.  These correspond to: File Attach, Call and Quick 
      Mail and provide visual feedback (i.e. the Call button 
      lights up when you are in a call, the Attach button lights
      up when a contact has any files attached to it, etc.)

   [] The Store, Cancel and Add buttons are predictable.  The 
      Locate button pops-up a dialog that contains a sorted list
      of all contacts on file.  Once the dialog is visible, you 
      can perform some sophisticated selects.  InContact even 
      remembers the last select operation you made for each file.
      From the locate dialog, you can toggle back and forth 
      between the complete and selected list of contacts by using 
      the check box at the bottom of the window.

   [] In addition, the control bar contains a scroll-bar which,
      when activated, will scan quickly through your contacts 
      like flipping through pages of a document.  All keyboard 
      commands work here, too.

   [] Arrow keys and PgUp/PgDn work as expected.  As an extra 
      feature, you can type an alpha character (while the cursor
      is blinking on the scroll bar) to find the first contact on
      file that starts with that character.

[] InContact allows you to "Attach" any number of files to any 
   contact in any contact file via the File Attach option.  You 
   could keep: a picture of a contact (unlikely), a map with 
   directions to their location, copies of recent correspondence,
   spreadsheets or darn near any file type using ENGLISH 
   descriptions.  To view any of these files, you need only 
   select the View button on the file attach dialog.  The program
   will search through your Windows file associations for the 
   correct program to use with that file type.  If a file 
   association does not exist you can add a file association via 
   Windows. 

[] Complete DDE support is included (look at the last portion of the file
   EXT.WRI for more specific information).

One of the key themes with InContact is accommodating the user's
wishes.  We have taken much care in allowing more than one way to
accomplish a given task.  We try to please both mouse and 
keyboard users (and abusers). We appreciate your time in 
reviewing this product and look forward to any comments or 
suggestions you might have.  Have a pleasant time exploring 
InContact!

   In addition, this program REQUIRES VBRUN100.DLL which is the 
   Microsoft runtime module for Visual Basic.  This file is 
   freely distributable and is readily available from a variety 
   of sources.  If you received a copy of InContact directly from
   Serious Shareware, we have included a copy of this DLL.  If 
   your shareware library has VBRUN100.DLL, feel free to use it 
   instead of the copy we sent.

3. You may NOT sell InContact as (or included with) a COMMERCIAL
   or RETAIL product WITHOUT OUR WRITTEN CONSENT.  Our name 
   doesn't have the word SHAREWARE in it for nothing!

4. Do not include InContact as part of a shareware package 
   UNLESS the other items in the package are augmentive utilities
   for (or relating to) our application (for large collections 
   like CD-ROMS, please get our permission).

5. If you have a rating system and your reviews deem InContact 
   as average or below overall, please don't bother distributing
   it.  We don't have an ego problem, we just don't want to waste
   your time.

6. Sing our praises (optional, but it would be nice!) 

As a special note: this application allows integrated extension 
modules. These modules can easily be created in most any language
and allow user-installable functionality to extend the product.
Modules could be anything from links to Windows programs, 
conversions for more specialized formats, billing links, etc.  
We maintain a collection of any modules sent to us and can make a
list available to you.  These modules are so easy to build that 
we expect them to appear in droves.  In addition, InContact has
full DDE support. (Check out the WRITE document "EXT.WRI" for 
more information)

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Outside the U.S.A. call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer in

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
