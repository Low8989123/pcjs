     Thanks for selecting this shareware file!   
     This listing has something for virtually all computer users.
     'CompuFreebies' is a valuable source of free promotional
     items, information, product/technical help, and many other
     things for computer users. Names and descriptions of
     everything offered are included and is very easy to use. A
     major computer monthly - PC SOURCES - has reviewed an earlier
     registered version of 'Freebies' in their April '91 issue New
     Products section. The magazine staff felt it would benefit
     their readers and was carefully considered among hundreds of
     new products. This is not a novelty or gimmick item to be
     thrown away or used up.

     The resources offered here, knowledge gained and contacts
     made will continue to be helpful for years. This is one of
     the few shareware products that offers much more value in
     material items and learning opportunity than the price paid.
     Our registered version (described later in detail) is the
     largest centralized source of demo-disks and free
     computer-related items in the U.S. available on disk. This
     file you have now has 2 parts. The first part lists companies
     offering general free items. The 2nd part lists companies
     offering 10 free videos.

 HOW IS THIS FILE ORGANIZED  
                                      
     All companies offering free items are organized by software
     categories.  In each software category (word processing,
     database, desktop publishing, games, magazines, spreadsheet,
     etc.) you'll find a company offering a free item such as a demo
     disk, or free information.

 ABOUT ACTUAL SOFTWARE. (Get yours right now!)
 
     Our category - 'actual software' lists companies that give
     away free software. Most will work for at least 30 days - and
     some for an unlimited time. This is the 'real thing!' You
     actually receive software which can be used. No features are
     disabled. You install it on your computer just like regular
     software you would pay for.                            
                                                         
     As our thanks for reading this long documentation we've
     included a listing for a company that will send free
     software. Please see the 'Actual Software' category on page 9.
                                                
 ABOUT DESCRIPTIONS USED HERE

     Descriptions used here are a general guide and not meant to
     be a comparison or evaluation for any product. Some
     descriptions are shorter only because the software is complex
     and could not be easily described, such as an engineering or
     scientific program. If you're seeking any good program it
     would be best to request the demo disks for all programs (if
     more than one is listed) within that category and compare. Do
     not be guided mainly by brief descriptions in deciding on the
     best software. Good decisions are based on as much good
     information as possible. I decided against writing a


- 3 -
     paragraph or so for each item as it would basically be unfair
     to the company (a good software feature might go unmentioned)
     and still not provide enough information for users to go
     ahead and purchase it. Nothing less than a side-by-side
     comparison of all software in each category, such as the
     major magazines do, would be fair. Even those studies must be
     carefully studied by the user. Descriptions here are used
     mainly to help in asking for the free item. 

EXPERT HELP, MAKING CONTACTS AND TOLL-FREE TECH SUPPORT
  
     You'll speak with the department most knowledgeable about the
     product. Sales reps. are very helpful and can answer most
     questions except the most technical. If a company has
     toll-free tech support the number is listed near the
     sales/marketing 800 number. These numbers are not widely
     advertised and were obtained with a lot of effort. A lot can
     be learned, including basics. E.g., anyone with an interest
     in networks can contact a network company that will explain
     some basics. 

     Because you can speak with someone quickly and easily much
     more can be learned with less effort (and cost) than reading
     a book or manual. For many applications, e.g. Wordperfect,
     completely free tech. support is available.  For those who
     prefer studying, the booklet category has companies that send
     good basic guides for most computer fields.   

MISCELLANEOUS FREE ITEMS

     Examples of miscellaneous free items are: 
     Booklets, literature, magazines, expos, game demos, seminars,       
     discount catalogs, posters, personal organizers, mugs, large          
     envelopes, etc. (Mugs and personal organizers available in 
     registered version)

     Many companies send thick informative booklets and literature
     describing many computer-related topics. To educate their
     users they send basic 'How To' booklets. For example, titles
     read something like, "Getting The Most from Your PC, Network,
     Mainframe, Connectivity, Telephone, etc. (titles depend on
     the company.)" I carefully selected booklets which are truly
     informative and do not try to sell a particular product.
     These are not sales materials or brochures and you will
     really learn a lot from them. Many have basic definitions.

     Free computer magazine subscriptions are used to increase ad
     revenue. The ads found in these magazines deal with specific 
     products and systems. These free magazines are specialized and 
     appeal to a certain reader. They are an excellent source of           
     information, news and events. 

     Free admission to popular expos and conferences: These are
     large trade shows with many exhibits from companies all over
     the U.S. Normally admission at the show without an invitation
     is at least $10 - $30.00. As with other items, these passes
     are free to all callers.


- 4 -
     Free seminars are given to explain the basics of products and
     help potential customers understand products and services
     better. Practically all the expos and seminars listed in the
     here and in the registered version of CompuFreebies are not 
     advertised any place else. Free catalogs are offered are on 
     either CD Rom or diskettes. These are found in the electronic 
     catalog section.      
     Many sales brochures come in large folders for holding papers.     
     Large envelopes can be re-used for other mailings.     

LEARN ABOUT COMPUTER PRODUCTS YOU NEVER KNEW EXISTED.
  
     A convenient listing of companies (such as this) with toll
     free numbers provides computer users with a great opportunity
     to explore and come across a solution or helpful product.
     Some companies with good products  may not take out a full
     page ad (or any ad) in magazines or newspapers. We have many
     unadvertised free items and computer products listed.

     No purchase is required at any time from any company. Take as
     much time as necessary to review the demo disks and other
     material carefully. Only ask for what is really necessary as
     most things are expensive, especially for mail and handling.

     <<<<< BEFORE CONTACTING COMPANIES, PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING >>>      
     <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

 HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS    

     Nearly all companies listed here and the registered version
     have toll-free nos. I have contacted each company and found
     the most direct phone numbers. As a result, time spent on
     'hold' or transferred will be greatly reduced when you call.
     You'll reach the department directly responsible for the
     desired product. Often companies do not list their 800 number
     in ads or any other literature. But through research I've
     managed to find and include them here. This feature will save
     phone charges and time. Detailed instructions on what
     extension to ask for or number to press is included. 

     The following will give good results in using this list. 
     When someone answers the phone when contacting any company,
     the following short 'speech' is recommended:  "I'd like to
     receive product information about _______" (name of free
     item). If you've reached the switchboard operator you now
     will be: 1) transferred to sales, marketing, or product info.
     dept. or, 2) someone will take your name and address and send

- 5 -
     the item. Often the phone operator will quickly transfer you
     to some other area if you ask something about their product
     that sounds complicated. It's important, then, to quickly say
     you only want something mailed. This might often prevent a
     call from being transferred or placed on hold. If you're
     still transferred to another dept. you may have to start all
     over and ask, "I'd like to receive product information
     about_____ (name of item)". After a conversation with the
     company representative, when appropriate, mention the
     following: 

     "Please include a demo disk (or other free item) also."  This
     is better than quickly asking only for the item right away.
     Sometimes you might be asked, "Where did you hear about our
     product." You can reply, "From Infolist software catalog." 
     Often you may not speak to a sales rep. as many companies are
     large so they have many people that just mail out literature.
     Companies are more than happy to send product information.
     They will send a demo, video, booklet, seminar registration
     etc. to any individual or company and sometimes will ask
     basic information such as your company name, address,
     department, and other things. Do not be concerned about being
     pressured to buy. You can say that you'd like a demo for now
     and will call back after reviewing it. Most companies do not
     call again, I've found. You can, if you like, let them know
     what you think of the demo, information or whatever else you
     receive. In fact, they would be very happy to hear from you
     and perhaps there are other 'extras' which can be made
     available later on. It's a good idea to listen to the sales
     or marketing representative as you can learn some good basic
     information about the computer industry, computer products in
     general, etc. as well as their product. I've found them to be
     very informed.  However, if you're too busy you can quickly
     ask to have (whatever) sent and after reviewing it you'll
     call back. They may ask what use you plan to make for the
     software. One suggestion is to say you'd like the demo disk 
     for evaluation for your own or company's use. Any item can be sent 
     to your home address (ATT: your name). This may be faster than     
     using your company address. You can still use a company name. 

     Near the phone number in many listings you may see, 'Press 1, 
     then 2.' You can press 1 as soon as you're connected and hear
     the recording. Then quickly press 2 once you hear the
     beginning of another recording. If you feel you might have
     reached the wrong area call again and this time listen to the
     entire recording. The company may have changed their phone
     directory. Once you get an actual person, follow the same             
     instructions in the above paragraph. Usually, items will
     arrive very quickly. If not, after 15 days you can call
     again. To keep track, it's a good idea to note the date
     called and the date item was received. Also write down
     company contacts. Soon you will have a listing of helpful
     contacts and friends within the industry. Everything on this
     list is currently available however, free promotions don't
     last forever. But to make sure that an item is truly not
     available you can try the following:  
     Call in about a half hour and request the item again to make
     sure. Perhaps when you called the first time you may have

- 6 -
     reached someone who didn't feel like filling out a form or
     thought that the offer expired. In some rare cases you might
     have come across a company that sends demos or other free
     items only if a specific advertisement or magazine is
     mentioned. If this happens, call again (it shouldn't happen
     but I mention it just in case) but do not repeat what was
     said the first time. You can mention that you heard about
     their product from any computer magazine, you're unsure
     where, or anything else you can think of - you happened to
     jot down their phone number a while ago but forgot what
     magazine. Also try reaching a company representative that
     handles some other region of the country.  

     Phone numbers may change and there may not always be a
     recording mentioning the new number (rarely happens). Try
     calling 800 555 1212 (toll free 800 # information) or regular
     directory assistance. You can always try the company's long
     distance number. Read on for phone tips and tricks. 

 COMPATIBILITY 
 
     All demo disks listed here will work with IBM compatible
     personal computers unless otherwise noted. Demo disks will
     work on virtually all PC's.  

 SOME NEAT PHONE TRICKS.  

     (Can be used in trying to reach any company you will ever
     call - not just those listed here!)     

     In choosing companies for this listing, I made sure that
     anyone calling would not have any inconveniences or
     aggravation. If a company placed me on hold too long or
     transferred me too many times, or for whatever reason the
     free item was not easily obtainable, I did not include that 
     company here. But I thought I'd mention some telephone tactics     
     which might be helpful for those who spend a lot of time on the    
     phone.

     If no 800 # is listed here, the company doesn't have a
     toll-free no. Each company was checked thoroughly for any 800
     no. Try calling 800 555 1212, directory assistance before
     dialing a long distance no. There might be a toll-free no.
     available. However, you needn't worry about this as only one
     of the companies listed here has no toll free number. If,
     however, you ever need to find more than one 800 number for a
     company, write down the company names and ask toll free               
     information for a few numbers at one time. Compuserve also
     has a free area for finding toll free numbers for any
     company.  

     When calling any company (not only those listed here) long
     distance and you're paying for the call, as soon as someone
     answers, quickly ask if they have an 800 number. If they do,
     you can quickly hang up and call right back. Often, some
     companies may not have their 800 number listed in their own
     name. For example, a company you see advertised may have a
     parent company. The 800 number may be listed in that parent

- 7 -
     company's name. Others may not want the general public to use
     their 800 number to keep costs down.

     In order to properly route calls to the sales rep. or dept.
     handling your region, many large companies will quickly ask
     (maybe before you've had a chance to say much!) where you're
     calling from, name, zip code, etc. After you hear the first
     question quickly interrupt and say that you only want product
     info mailed. Sometimes this will speed things up and they
     will take your name and address right away and send the item.
     Other times you will be transferred to some other area. But
     what happens if you get a voice mailbox, the phone just rings
     or you're told that "no one is available?" You can do the
     following:

     Try calling back again in a few minutes. This time say that
     you're calling from some other part of the country. For
     example, if the first time you mentioned that you called from
     California and got a voice mailbox or were on hold too long,
     the second time you call say that you're calling from
     Michigan. You will then be transferred to the sales (or other
     company representative) for another part of the country. They
     naturally will assume you really live or work in that area.
     If asked how you happened to "get here to my extension or
     dept." you can say that the call was misdirected somehow but
     while you're on the phone, can you please mail the item.
     Later you can call back and speak with the regular sales rep.
     that handles your region. Or, you can say that you're now
     travelling in that area but mail the item to your business
     address.  

     I've done all the above and it does work.   

 HOW TO AVOID BEING PLACED ON HOLD    
     
     If placed on hold after dialing an 800 no. you might want to call  
     again right away. The 2nd time (or even the 3rd or 4th!) you'll
     most likely not be placed on hold. You'll most likely reach
     another operator that's not so busy. Your time is too
     valuable to be placed on hold! Sometimes you may ask someone
     a question and they are taking much too long. Someone else
     may have more experience and will find the answer more
     quickly. If you reach a recording asking you to press a
     number on your touch tome phone, pressing '0' will often
     transfer you back to a human voice, even if the company's own
     recording does not mention this. When leaving a message on a
     voice mailbox by pressing '#' you'll usually hear some
     options. Often the company's own recording may not mention            
     this. You can then save your message using the right number
     on your touch tone pad. Otherwise the message might be lost
     (not common but why take chances) if you just hang up. After
     saving you can then press 0 and be transferred to another
     area - all without having to redial and possibly be placed on
     hold. This should not happen when requesting any items here,
     however, I included it just in case.

 ABOUT TECH SUPPORT PHONE NUMBERS

     Toll-free tech support phone numbers are listed here right
     next to their regular phone number. Tech support departments
     for companies without a toll-free tech. support number listed
     may be reached by calling the long distance number. But call
     their 800 number listed first to make sure. Tech. support
     should be able to answer just about any question and help
     with problems using the company's product. However, speak
     with marketing, sales or customer service first.

 FOR MORE THAN ONE DEMO OR FREE ITEM     

     If you have many computers, PC's or workstations, you can
     mention this and ask if they will send the desired amount all
     at once.  

 CONTACTING COMPANIES BY MAIL       

     You can always write to request anything. Include the
     following in a letter: Your name, address, phone and name of
     software demo (or other items) you want. 

     Always include your phone number so they can verify the
     correct mailing address if necessary. If you really don't
     want to be called, mention that there is no phone at your
     location. If you have a hard time getting through by phone
     you may want to write. Also, if you've called a few times and
     the item is unavailable, you can try writing as a last

     DOS/IBM Compatible disks sent but can be read by Macintosh
     computers. (for MAC order 3.5" disks only).        

     The registered version is ordered exactly the same way as you
     see here (with many more companies!) except that each of the
     42 categories has it's own file on the diskette. You would 
     select the file you're interested in. Don't have to search through
     one huge file! Thus, word processing companies are in a
     separate file - named wordproc. Databases are in the
     'databas' directory. 

  The registered version has 3 more ways (besides Categories)
  in which the companies are organized: 

1) A large file with names and addresses of each company - in mailing   
   list format - 450+ computer companies. 
   
For example:

     10 companies offering 10 free videos are listed here. Title of
     each video and brief descriptions are included. These videos
     are mainly computer-related and describe products made by
     each company. You can learn from these tapes about the
     subjects covered as well as the company's products.  

     Promotions and offers may end, however, all videos are
     currently available as this is constantly updated. Ask for
     extension, if listed, or request by video title. If you reach
     an operator, give the extension number (if listed) or just ask
     for the title of the video. Videos arrive  in re-usable boxes
     and can be recorded over after viewing. If anyone asks how
     you heard about the video mention Infolist catalog. If you're
     told that the video is no longer available, call back later.
     Often a different person may be more cooperative. If calling
     a second time and are asked how you heard about the video
     mention a major computer magazine, or that you're not sure how
     you learned about it but had written down the company's phone
     no. You should rarely encounter such difficulty but I mention
     it just in case. If you don't have a touch tone phone and you
     reach a recording, eventually a company operator will answer. 
     
     Videolist, one of our products, (described later in detail)
     lists 150 free videos and is the largest centralized source
     of free videos in the U.S. All the companies are constantly
     updated so there is no need to worry about outdated phone
     numbers or other information.

      Read the following section if you're interested in learning more
      about demo disks.

WHAT ARE DEMO DISKS AND THEIR ADVANTAGES?

      Demo disks are given away as part of advertising and promotion 
      efforts, especially for new products. Most are similar to slide 
      shows and you watch colorful screens magically appear. They show 
      an example of the features found in the commercial program. The 
      term 'self-running demo' is  often used and means the same as a 
      'demo' or 'demo disk.' A working model does more than a self-
      running demo disk. It is almost the very same as the company's 
      software sold for a lot of money. Unlike self-running or 
      interactive demos, with a working model you can actually use many 
      of the same features of the actual, expensive program. Each 
      company's working model has unique limitations; most do not allow      

      saving and/or printing. For obvious reasons, there must be 
      limitations or companies would in effect be giving away their 
      software. However, some companies are more generous than others 
      with usable features on the working model.  One company's working 
      model (found in the registered version) allows design of up to 30 
      IC's (Integrated Circuits) for printed circuit boards.  Our 
      registered version lists all of Microsoft's working models 
      including Windows. The working model of Windows 3.0 actually allows 
      use of Windows in the lowest operating mode. For many people this 
      may be good enough. You'll actually be able to use powerful Windows    

      features. As you can see, working models are very powerful.
      Many demos and other items are not advertised in magazines so          

      Compufreebies is the only place you'll know about them. You don't 
      have to pay for or return anything. Demos are sent on re-usable 3.5" 
      or 5.25" diskettes. High density and 3.5" diskettes can be expensive,  
      as you know. 

      Demos are very valuable in revealing a great deal about the
      actual software. They will answer many questions such as: 



- 32 -

    A) exactly how the screens are organized and will appear on the          
       commercial version     
    B) how easy will it be to maneuver around, and 
    C) where to locate the features YOU feel are important (not   
       only those which advertisements describe).  
    D) reveal quality of paper manuals and documentation. If the  
       directions and documentation supplied with the demo disk   
       (especially working models) are easy to use, then there's  
       a good chance that the actual program will have the same   
       qualities.
    E) quality of help screens and company support. How well are  
       questions answered about materials received when you call  
       the company? You'll see exactly how much on-screen help is 
       provided.
    F) compare one or more software products easily and quickly.  
       You'll be more certain as to which is the best software    
       for your needs - without having to take a chance on a      
       purchase. Often many magazines rate software and choose 2  
       programs as the best. You can further compare these 2      
       quickly on your own computer. 

       I'm sure there are a lot more than these 6 points but the          
       usefulness of demo disks in evaluating software should be 
       quite clear.

       Demos offer many advantages over buying the actual, expensive
       software for review, for example, some computer/M.I.S. depts.
       cannot get quick authorization for purchase of a wide variety
       of actual software. Other problems are: Forms to be
       completed, red tape, waiting for approval, installation time,
       returns problems (IF allowed) such as keeping track of return
       dates, packing, postage, potential loss of items,
       're-stocking fees', etc. All this makes it very difficult to
       review a lot of very good software. At least for preliminary 
       reviews, demo disks are a good idea. The actual software program 
       can always be reviewed later on.

     These two guys just arrived in America and decide to buy
     their first jigsaw puzzle.  It takes them six months to
     finish it.  One guy says, "Let's have a party to celebrate
     our accomplishment."  So they invite their friends over for a
     party and one of the guests asks, "What are we celebrating
     guys?"  The guys reply, as they're pointing to their
     accomplishment on the table, "We put together our first
     jigsaw puzzle and it only took us six months!" The guest
     says, "What is so special about that?  It doesn't look very
     difficult."  The guys reply, "Well, the cover of the box said
     '3 to 5 years'."

     I walked into a pizza place down the street from where I use
     to live. I was with a friend and we could not decide what
     kind of pizza we wanted. We decided to get a half of one kind
     and half another. "Give us a large vegetarian pizza, but put
     pepperoni on half". The guy behind the counter VERY straight
     faced and quite serious asked: "Which half would you like the
     pepperoni on?" Without missing a beat, I said "The right
     half!" He wrote "Pepperoni on the right half" on the tag and
     handed it to the guy who makes the pizzas. That guy smiled a
     bit and proceeded to make us our pizza.

     About 20 minutes later they called my name. When I went to
     pick up the pizza I noticed that it was sitting so that the
     pepperoni was to my right but the counter person's left. I
     could not resist. I said "Hey, I wanted the pepperoni on the

- 34 -
     right side not the left side!"  This taught me not to be such
     a smart ass in the future. The clerk, looking worried,
     grabbed the pizza and tossed it into the trash saying "Damn,
     I'm sorry, they must have made a mistake. We will make you
     another one right now!"

     25 minutes later, I kept quiet and ate the pizza! My friend
     and I did laugh about it for quite some time. Especially when
     the clerk gave us each a free beer and said he was sorry for
     the mistake and that we had to wait!!!!
          
     This piece of string walks into a bar, and says "Ouch!" He
     asks the bartender for a drink.  The bartender says "Hey, we
     don't allow string in here.  You'll have to leave."  The
     string gets up and walks out.  Later he decides to try it
     again.  This time he ties himself in a knot around the middle
     and cuts the end of the string by his head.  He goes back in
     the bar and orders a drink.  The bartender says "Hey, are you
     a string?"  The string says "No, I'm a frayed knot."

     I just heard about a group of US tourists who came back from
     the Soviet Union. They visited Lenin's Tomb, which is one of
     the most important monuments in the Kremlin.  Although the
     line was long, the foreigners were allowed to go to the front
     of the line. As they were allowed to enter, one 20 year old
     woman was not allowed to go in because she wore a short
     sleeved blouse. (It was in the summer) She couldn't figure
     out why such a rule existed. 

     Later on, she asked her travel guide about the rule, and was
     told that the Soviet constitution does not guarantee the
     right to bare arms.

     own bed."

SUBJECT: Service Interaction

     A particularly insidious kind of sales call now appearing in
     several cities is one which is initiated by computer, and
     contains recorded questions by some mellifluous voice that
     requires answers in simple digits or "yes" and "no". A voice
     recognition circuit then processes your answers and asks
     further questions based on your former answers.  The sales
     pitch is usually disguised as a survey of some kind.  The
     despicable thing about these things is that they won't leave
     you alone. If you hang up, they will just call back again.


     One day my wife got a call from one of these computer
     systems, and her answering machine answered. The conversation
     that followed was hilarious, as it consisted of two machines
     talking to each other without having the slightest idea about
     what each other was saying. The conversation wound up in an
     endless loop, as follows:

     [PHONE] *RING*
     
     [ANSWERING MACHINE] "...At the tone, please give your
     message.  BEEEEEP."

     [PHONE] "Hello. This is [company_name], and we are taking a
     telephone survey...when I ask a question, wait for the beep,
     then please speak plainly.  I will repeat your answer back to
     you, and verify it.  First, what is your phone number?
     BEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

     (The answering machine, upon hearing the beep, got confused
     and thought it was a play-back command, and generated another
     beep in response.)
- 36 -

     [ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

     [PHONE] "Thank you! Your phone number was
     443-28347-47756-377764-22222.  Is that correct?
     BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

     [ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

     [PHONE] "Thank you! Do you have any children?
     BEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

     [ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

     [PHONE] Thank you! What is the age of your first child?
     BEEEEEEEEEEP."

     [ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

     [PHONE] "Your first child is 1,222 years old. Is that
     correct?  BEEEEEP."

     [ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."
          
     [---------------  BEGIN ENDLESS LOOP ----------------]

     [PHONE] "Thank you! Do you have any more children? BEEEEEEP."

     [ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

     [PHONE] "Thank you! What is this child's age? BEEEP."

     [ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."

     [PHONE] "This child is 4,233 years old. Is that correct?
     BEEEEP."
     
     [ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."
     
     [---------------------END LOOP -----------------------]
     
     My wife, upon noticing that the answering machine had been
     going for over half an hour, turned up the volume to find out
     what was going on. When she discovered this endless loop (by
     now she had over 200 children, all over 1,000 years old), she
     switched off the answering machine. The computer never called
     again. 


     "My Uncle is in Leavenworth because he made big money."
     "How much?"
     "About a third of an inch too big."

  
      Officer: Are you happy now that you are in the Army?
      Soldier: Yes sir!
      Officer: What were you before you got into the Army?
      Soldier: Much happier!
