Catalog vendors: Please include Sand Storm in your printed and disk shareware
                 catalogs.
                 
                            RACKWARE VENDORS

MVP Software has a new policy on shareware rack vending.  Beginning immediately
no MVP Software shareware product may be sold on shareware racks in any retail
location without prior written approval from MVP Software.  This policy affects
Sand Storm, plus all other MVP products.  Many of our shareware products are
also sold in retail locations.  We do not want our shareware products to under-
mine these sales.  Thanks for your understanding.

All MVP shareware products may be sold via catalogs, mail order, telephone
orders, flea markets, computer clubs, and any other method that does not
involve sales in retail locations.

We will give permission to rack vendors to sell our products in retail
locations only if the following conditions are met: (1) The vendor must pay
MVP Software a royalty on all copies sold in retail locations.  This does not
include any other type of shareware sales.  Suggested royalty is 10 cents per
copy sold.  (2) The vendor must provide reports to MVP Software not less than
quarterly of all rack sales minus returns.  (3) The vendor must include a one-
page flyer provided by MVP Software in all packages of MVP products sold on
shareware racks.  The size of the flyer may be determined by the vendor so
that it fits properly in the package.

Rack vendors meeting the above three conditions must still receive written
authorization from MVP Software to distribute our products on shareware racks.
Permission may not be given in all cases; the decision will be on a case-by-
case basis, and we usually will want to inspect the packaging before granting
distribution permission.

I apologize to those rack vendors to whom these requirements seem onerous.
However, this is the only way we can control how our products get distributed
to make sure we have both a return on our investment and a reasonable chance
at getting a registration. 

We really appreciate the distribution that vendors give us.  And we will con-
tinue to work with vendors to make both of our businesses prosper.  Thanks for
your understanding of why this step is necessary.

And just to be clear: the above requirements do NOT apply to catalog sales.
