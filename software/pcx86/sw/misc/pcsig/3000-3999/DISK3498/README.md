This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
900 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'INSTALL' at
the DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy
access to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.  All the programs are logically divided into thirteen
major categories with subcategories, making it easier to find just the
right software.

All of the programs have been scanned for viruses.  There are also three
online virus utilities that can be run from the CD-ROM which will scan,
screen and clean viruses.  Not only does this save hard disk space, but
also gives every user added security from viruses.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

Winner of the Optical Publishing Assn's Best Consumer Product Award.

Shareware for every imaginable need: Accounting Chemistry Educational
Engineering Games Hypertext Networks Programming Spreadsheets Utilities
Word Processing

Additional BBS file descriptions are available from PC-SIG so that the
CD-ROM can be set up quickly on a bulletin board.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 530K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
a graphics monitor (Hercules/EGA/VGA/SVGA).  A mouse is optional.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.


                      The PC-SIG Games CD-ROM
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now you can play a game a day fo over a year.  This CD-ROM is jammed
with over 380 shareware games of all types, designed to appeal to the
new generation of CD-ROM users out for fun.  The CD incorporates a
hypermedia interface and allows 250 of the games to be played directly
from the CD-ROM.

The hottest games in shareware are on this disk, including the
action/arcade games "Jill of the Jungle" and "Wolfenstein 3D," which
rival or surpass commercial PC and Nintendo for use of animation,
SoundBlaster audio, and VGA graphics.  There are also games designed to
teach children mathematics, spelling and even ecology.  All these games
for less than a dime each!

Over 250 of the games can be played directly from the CD without copying
them to a floppy or a hard drive.  Being able to run from the CD means
that users can explore games without using up valuable hard disk space
or spending time downloading and deleting files.  The hypermedia
interface makes it easy to browse the titles, read a one line
description or full review, and copy or start a game by clicking the
mouse or using the keyboard.

BBS Update Program:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most BBSs have standard procedures for acquiring new files.  They
get them from other boards, new programs are uploaded by users,
etc.  This is good because most authors cannot afford to mail
disks or upload files to thousands of BBSs.  However, some BBSs
prefer to obtain programs directly from the authors.  If you
would like to obtain programs directly from us, automatically,
then please help us to cover the cost.

If your BBS would like to receive automatic upgrades to any of
our products, directly from us, then please refer to the
information below.  Due to the time and expense we are generally
unable to upload directly to a large number of Bulletin Board
Systems.  However, we are able to mail updates on disk (in a
sealed envelope) to many BBS's.

If your BBS would like to receive automatic updates then please
take advantage of our BBS Update Program.  Under this program you
can receive updates for an entire year for only $10 per program
(this helps to offset our costs).

To receive updates, simply send us a letter with the name and
address of your BBS, your mailing address, the name of the person
we may contact (preferably the SYSOP or CO-SYSOP), the program
(or programs) for which you would like to receive updates, and a
check or money order for $10 for each program (for countries
outside of North America please add an additional $10 per
program).  Payment in U.S. funds drawn on a U.S. bank only,
please.

The BBS Update Program is available for the following products
(as of December, 1992)

   From Scratch - the recipe processor for Windows

NOTE: All BBS's participating in our BBS Update Program will
      automatically receive any NEW programs which we may release
      while their BBS Update Program is in effect.

The BBS Update Program is only intended to help us cover our
expenses in those cases where a BBS desires to obtain the program
directly from us.  If you have other standard ways to obtain
programs, then you may prefer not to use our BBS Update Program.

Please refer to DESCRIBE.DOC for our mailing address and phone
number.  Thank you for your support!

               - From Scratch, Version 1.11 - Vendor.DOC -


The From Scratch package is defined as containing all the material listed
in the PACKING.LST text file.  If any files listed in the PACKING.LST text
file, or the PACKING.LST file itself, are missing, then the package is not
complete and distribution is forbidden.  Please contact us to obtain a
complete package suitable for distribution.

The From Scratch package - including all related program files and
documentation files - CANNOT be modified in any way and must be distributed
as a complete package, without exception.  The PACKING.LST text file
contains a list of all files that are part of the From Scratch package.

   Small additions to the package, such as the introductory or installation
   batch files used by many shareware disk vendors, are acceptable.

No price or other compensation may be charged for the From Scratch
package.  A distribution fee may be charged for the cost of the diskette,
shipping and handling, as long as the total (per disk) does not exceed
US$8.00 in the U.S. and Canada, or US$12.00 internationally.

Disk Sets & CD-ROMs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The From Scratch package CANNOT be sold as part of some other inclusive
package.  Nor can it be included in any commercial software packaging
offer, without a written agreement from Desktop Solutions.

   ASP Approved Vendors who wish to distribute the From Scratch package
   as part of a collection (such as PsL's MegaDisk set, or a CD-ROM
   package) may do so provided that all the other restrictions are met.

   Vendors (non-ASP Vendor Members) who wish to distribute the
   From Scratch package as part of a collection (such as PsL's MegaDisk
   set, or a CD-ROM package) must obtain permission from Desktop Solutions
   prior to beginning such a distribution.

   If you wish to add any of our programs to a CD-ROM or other collection,
   please check the release date of the version you have.  If the version
   is over twelve (12) months old then please contact us to ensure that you
   have the most current version.  This version was released in December,
   1992.

   of old (out of date) disks.  Only current versions may be shipped as
   Disk-of-the-Month disks.

The PRINTED User's Guide may not be reproduced in whole or in part, using
any means, without the written permission of Desktop Solutions.  In other
words, the disk-based documentation may not be distributed in PRINTED
(hardcopy) form.

The From Scratch package cannot be "rented" or "leased" to others.

You may not list any of our products in advertisements, catalogs, or other
literature which describes our products as "FREE SOFTWARE".  Shareware is
"Try-Before-You-Buy" software, it is not free.

Desktop Solutions prohibits the distribution of outdated versions of the
From Scratch package, without written permission from Desktop Solutions.
If the version you have is over twelve (12) months old, please contact us
to ensure that you have the most current version.  This version was

Vendor Update Program:
----------------------

Most non-ASP vendors have standard procedures for acquiring new files.
They get them from other vendors, BBSs, etc.  Most authors cannot afford to
mail disks to hundreds (perhaps thousands) of vendors.  However, some
vendors prefer to obtain programs directly from the authors.  If you would
like to obtain programs directly from us, automatically, then please help
us to cover the cost.

If you are NOT an ASP Approved Vendor (in good standing), but you would
still like to receive automatic updates directly from us, then please take
advantage of our Vendor Update Program.  Under this program you can receive
updates for an entire year for only $10 per program (this helps to offset
our costs).

To receive updates, simply send us a letter with your name, company name,
mailing address, the name of the person we should contact (such as your
disk librarian), the program (or programs) for which you would like to
receive updates, and a check or money order for $10 for each program
(Countries outside of North America please add an additional $10 per
program).  Payment in U.S. funds drawn on a U.S. bank only please.

The Vendor Update Program is available for the following products (as of
December, 1992):

   From Scratch: the recipe processor for Windows

All vendors participating in our Vendor Update Program will automatically
receive any NEW programs which we may release while their Vendor Update
Program is in effect.

NOTE: ASP Associate Members automatically receive free updates and do not
      need to apply for the Vendor Update Program.  This is yet another
      advantage to being an ASP Associate Member.

The Vendor Update Program is only intended to help us cover our expenses in
those cases where a vendor desires to obtain the program directly from us.
If you have other standard ways to obtain programs, then you may prefer not
to use our Vendor Update Program.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Outside the U.S.A. call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer in
your country.

To install From Scratch version 1.1:

Start Windows, or if Windows is running, get to the Program Manager.
(This is the first screen you see when you start Windows)

Choose File/Run
Type A:Setup
Follow the directions on your screen.

If you are installing 'From Scratch' from any place other than drive A:,
simply specify that instead, for example C:\Arcs\Test\Setup.

The files that end with the underscore have been compressed using the
Microsoft format, and can be expanded using the EXPAND utility packed
with windows. However, the install.exe program will do this for you
automatically. The install program will also create a directory and a
program manager group for its files.

From Scratch is registered with the Association of Shareware
Professionals. See the OMBDSMN.ASF file for details.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
