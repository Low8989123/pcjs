The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

                      Cross-Stitch Designer
                      Shareware Version 2.1
                    
          Copyright 1993 By HobbyWare All Rights Reserved
                              5/9/93

Cross-Stitch Designer is a Windows 3.1 program that allows you to
design Cross-Stitch patterns.  A pattern is drawn with the mouse
by placing stitches on a pattern displayed on the screen.  The types
of stitches supported include full, half, quarter, and outline 
stitches.  The colors of these stitches can be selected from the DMC
thread list or from a list of custom thread colors that you provide.
A pattern can be printed at any time in either the stitch mode or a
symbolic mode where symbols are used to represent the various thread
colors.

To use Cross-Stitch Designer, you will need a mouse, a VGA graphics 
adapter, and a printer.  In addition to the basic 16-color VGA
adapter mode, this program supports the 256 color mode.  This mode 
allows pure colors to be displayed instead of the dithered colors 
produced with the 16 color mode.  Obviously, for a program such 
as Cross-Stitch Designer, thread color representation is very
important.  Thus, to get the most from this program, it is
recommended that an adapter that supports the 256 color mode be used.

The following files should have been provided with your copy of 
Cross-Stitch Designer:
        xstitch.exe - Program file
        xslib.dll   - Program library file
        xstitch.hlp - Help file
        manual.wri  - User's Manual, in Microsoft Write format
        sharew.prn  - Explanation of Shareware & Licensing
        threads.cus - Custom thread list
        threads.dmc - DMC thread list
        default.pal - Default thread palette
        empty.pal   - Empty thread palette
        lamb.pat    - Example pattern
        pitch.pat   - Example pattern
        prayer.pat  - Example pattern
        readme.txt  - This file

To install Cross-Stitch Designer, create a directory (such as 
'\XSTITCH') and copy all of the above files into it.  Next, add a
program item for Cross-Stitch Designer to one of your Windows 
program groups.  If you need more assistance in installing Cross-
Stitch Designer, then please read the provided User's Manual.  
This manual can be viewed and/or printed using Microsoft Write
which is a simple word processor provided with windows.  

An example pattern is provided with Cross-Stitch Designer.  To
load this pattern, select the FILE:OPEN menu item and then select
the "pitch.pat" file located in the Cross-Stitch Designer directory
(that you created).

To get on-line help information, select the HELP:INDEX menu item.
This will activate the Cross-Stitch Designer help window.   

 

Cross-Stitch Designer is distributed using the shareware distribution
method.  This method allows you to try-out this program before 
buying it.  If you are not a registered user of Cross-Stitch Designer,
you may evaluate the program for up to 30 days.  If you find this program 
useful and/or you use this program after the trial period, you are 
expected to register your copy.  To register, please send a $30 
check or money order and the registration form to:
        HobbyWare
        9686 Spruce Lane

The registration form which is included in the on-line help of
Cross-Stitch Designer is accessed by HELP:INDEX:REGISTRATION. 
After displaying the form, it can be printed-out by selecting 
FILE:PRINT TOPIC of the help window.

Please also read the file SHAREW.PRN for a more detailed 
explanation of the licensing requirements of this program.

Revision History
  VERSION 2.1

   1.  Improved zoom-in/out capability (both zoom-out to see
       most/all of a pattern and zoom-in based on a selected region).
   2.  Horizontal & vertical flipping of a region (can be used to 
       mirror a region also).
   3.  Improved bitmap-to-pattern conversion (faster, uses exact 
       region size; displays percent complete, can abort conversion
       in progress).
   4.  Added capability to enlarge or reduce pattern size after 
       initial creation (can directly specify new size, change size
       to currently used size, or change size to include only the
       currently selected region).
   5.  Added standard Windows printer setup dialog.
   6.  Added printing of a selected region.
   7.  Added printing of selected pages.
   8.  Added page numbers and pattern name to print-out.
   9.  Added function key support for selecting thread colors and 
       stitches.
   10. Added 'solid' view mode (displays a stitch using a filled
       square instead of a cross stitch).
   11. Fixed problem in printing to certain printers (HP Deskjet 5XXC
       and Postscript).
   12. Added status bar (shows selected color name & number, color
       used for the stitch under the cursor, mouse coordinates, 
       region size).
   13. Added support for deleting the selected thread color from the
       palette and/or pattern.
   14. Added the remaining DMC threads to the thread list for a total
       of 360.
   15. Revised DMC thread list to use the standard color names.
   16. Revised tool bar to be horizontal and located under menus.
   17. Created separate tool icons for quarter and half stitch tools.
   18. Increased stitch thickness for print-outs so that stitch is

   20. Changed file open/save dialog boxes to use the standard Windows
       dialog boxes.
   21. Changed font selection dialog box to use the standard Windows
       dialog box.  This change includes the support of bold and
       italics characters for the symbolic mode.
   22. Changed symbolic mode to use maximum character width instead
       of average width when calculating grid size to prevent wide
       characters from being clipped.  
   23. Widened thread name fields of the Select dialog box so that all
       of the thread name is visible.
   24. Moved font selection for information print-out from under the
       threads menu to the Information dialog box.  


  VERSION 2.0

       those threads used in the pattern.

       if a color specified in a pattern is not in the list.
       If the thread is listed but has a different color definition,
       then the user is prompted to select either the color 
       currently in the thread list, or the color in the pattern.
   7.  Revised pattern information print-out to only list threads
       used in the pattern.
   8.  Added more DMC thread definitions for a current total of
       230 colors.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
