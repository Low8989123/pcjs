The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

                                     from
                                   A C U T E
                                 s y s t e m s

INTRODUCTION
------------
REFONT is a font utility that allows you to use MAC type 1 and TrueType
fonts on IBMPC machines with Windows and ATM. With REFONT you can:
1) Convert MAC format type 1 outlines to IBM format type 1 outlines (PFB).
2) Convert MAC format TrueType outlines to IBM format TrueType outlines (TTF).
3) Convert Postscript AFM files to Windows compatible PFM files.
4) Generate INF files from AFM files.
In outline font conversions Refont uses a "raw" translation which does not
change any data in the font, it extracts and reformats the data.

DOS FILE TYPES
--------------
Below are definitions of the the file types and the DOS filename extentions
mentioned throughout this file.
PFB - PC Postscript Type 1 font file. Text and binary file containing font
      outline data. Necessary for ATM.
AFM - Adobe Font Metric file. Text file containing Font metrics (font names,
      character widths, kerning, etc). Not used much on Mac.
PFM - Printer Font Metric file. Much of the same information as in AFM files
      only in binary format. Necessary for ATM.
INF - Extra information text file containing individual platform, application,
      and other metric information. 
TTF - PC TrueType font. Binary file containing font outline data in TrueType
      format.

MOVING FONTS FROM MAC TO PC
---------------------------
Before you can convert font outlines to PC format you must copy them from
the Mac to the PC. There are many ways to do this, below are two methods
using floppy disks and the Mac's SuperDrive. These instructions are valid
for both Type1 and TrueType fonts.

WITH APPLE FILE EXCHANGE:
Mac files have two parts to them (called forks) a data fork (holds data) and
a resource fork (holds code,bitmaps,etc). Mac font outlines (printer fonts)
usually exist in the resource fork of a file. If they are copied directly
using AFE, you will most likely end up with a zero length file on the PC.
This is because AFE only copies the data fork (which is empty for PS type1
and TrueType fonts) to the PC disk. The resource fork must be copied to the
data fork of a file before using AFE. There are several ways to do this,
here are a few:
1) Use Mac freeware utility REFORK (v1.1 or later). It comes with the
registered version Wrefont and is also available on compuserv and other BBS's.
2) MacBinary format is used in multi-platform situations and telecommunications
to keep images of both data and resource forks in one file. You can use a
MacBinary program to manually generate a data file which is transferrable
to the PC with AFE.
3) Use a compression utility like Stuffit or Compactor on the MAC end to create
a .SIT, .CPT, or .SEA file and a PC decompressor (Unsit or Extractor) on the
PC end. With this method you can copy both AFM files and font outlines in one
stuffit file.
After creating a data file you can use AFE in the default translation mode
to copy the file to a PC disk.

WITH DOSMOUNTER:
Dosmounter is a Mac desktop utility by Dayna Communications, Inc. which
provides support for reading and writing DOS floppy disks, on a Mac
SuperDrive, as if they were Mac format disks. Dosmounter copies both the
data and resource fork to a PC disk. There is no need for other utilities.
After copy, the root directory will contain a file with the data fork.
This will probably be of length zero and is not needed. A directory
called RESOURCE.FRK (This directory may be invisible to dir, but you
can still cd to it) will be created in which the resource fork data
resides. This file contains the font outlines which you want.

If you are using Windows and ATM you will need the AFM files for your fonts.
AFM files are contained in the data fork and can be copied to the PC directly.

RUNNING REFONT 1.4
------------------
Once the fonts are correctly transferred Refont can be run on them to create
the appropriate files. Be sure the files you are going to run through Refont
do not have extensions reserved for the output files (PFB,TTF,PFM,orINF) or
things will get screwed up. This version of refont has a simplified user
interface. It will automatically sense the type of file (Mac Type1,
Mac TrueType, or AFM) and generate the appropriate type of output file.
It also supports DOS wildcard characters (* and ?). Refont will automatically
add the appropriate DOS extension (PFB,TTF,PFM,orINF) to the output filename
unless the prompt flag (/P) is used. If /P is specified on the command line
refont will ask for an output filename instead of generating it automatically.
When Refont encounters an AFM file it will generate a PFM unless the /I flag
is specified on the command line which specifies INF generation instead.
Refont parses the command line from left to right so placement of the /I
flag is critical. The /I flag only affects AFM files. The /D flag will allow
you to specify an output directory or disk drive. Below are several
different command line scenarios.

"REFONT /Da: MACTYPE1" will generate MACTYPE1.PFB on the A drive
"REFONT /Dc: a:MACTYPE1" will generate MACTYPE1.PFB on the C drive
"REFONT MACTRUE" will generate MACTRUE.TTF in the current directory
"REFONT /D\fonts MACTRUE" will generate MACTRUE.TTF in the fonts directory
"REFONT /I MACTYPE1 MACTYPE1.AFM" will generate MACTYPE1.PFB and MACTYPE1.INF
"REFONT *.AFM" will generate PFM files for all AFM files
"REFONT /I *.AFM" will generate INF files for all AFM files
"REFONT *.AFM /I *.AFM" will generate PFM and INF files for all AFM files
"REFONT /I /P *.AFM" will prompt for all output filenames and create INF files.

Flags:
/I or /i - Create INF instead of PFM.
/P or /p - Always prompt for output file name.
/D or /d - Specify output directory name.

Note: If a Mac TrueType resource has more than one font, the user will be
prompted for the output filename of each font.

FOR USE WITH ATM:
Fonts can be installed with ATM using PFB and PFM files or using PFB, AFM, and
INF files. The latter is the preferred method as it ensure compatibility with
future versions of Windows and ATM. Another advantage of using INF files is
that you can edit their information to change the way ATM handles them:
  MSMenuName: The name that shows up in the Windows type selection menus.
  VPStype: There can be up to four font styles with the same MSMenuName. This
   letter specifies either normal (N), bold (B), italic (I), or bold-italic (T).
  Pi: Pi fonts are not "remapped" for windows like text fonts are, this flag
   specifies whether this is a pi or text font.


ERRORS
------
"UNKNOWN FILE TYPE"             - This file is not a recognizable Mac Type1,
                                  Mac TrueType, or AFM file.
"READ ERROR"                    - Disk read error.
"WRITE ERROR"                   - Disk write error.
"INVALID AFM FILE FORMAT"       - Recognized AFM file has improper format.
"INVALID MAC TYPE 1 FONT FILE"  - Recognized Type1 font has improper format.
"INVALID MAC TRUETYPE FONT FILE"- Recognized TT file has improper format.
"CANNOT OPEN FOR READ!"         - File does not exist or cannot be opened.
"CANNOT OPEN FOR WRITE!"        - Disk write protected, directory in path does
                                  not exist, or file cannot be opened.

V1.4 CHANGES
------------
- Now generates INF files
- Now converts Mac TrueType to PC TrueType
- Extra character support for ATM v2.0 in PFM
- Automatic file type sensing.
- Command line interface with wildcard support.

REGISTRATION
------------
    A registration fee of $20.00 plus $4.00 S&H will get you a Windows
    version (Wrefont V3.0) which does everything this version does and
    more: you can generate AFM or PFM files from the font outlines
    (along with kerning from Mac screen fonts (FOND)), convert PC PFB
    files to MAC MacBinary files, convert binary PFB files into ASCII
    and back again, change or customize Type1 font encoding, and convert
    Mac TrueType to PC TrueType.

The documentation for FOOTBALL is completely contained in Windows help.

FOOTBALL was first written for color VGA monitors. However, its performance 
has been tested on an EGA system with no problems. Its has not been tested on 
CGA, Super VGA, or monochrome systems. Any information that can be provided
on FOOTBALL's performance on these systems, particularly the scroll bar
logic, would be greatly appreciated.

Six files should be included in the archive. They are:

FOOTBALL is ShareWare.  Therefore, the shareware version can be distributed
freely as long as ALL six files are included in their original form.

FOOTBALL should be stored in its own subdirectory. However, it can be stored
anywhere. It does not have to be stored in your path. The initialization file
MUST be stored in the FOOTBALL startup directory or in your path. The program
should work without the initialization file, but games and matches cannot be
stored or retrieved.

Please direct questions, comments, or bug reports to DDEMCP@ARCO.COM on 
E-mail, or write to:
