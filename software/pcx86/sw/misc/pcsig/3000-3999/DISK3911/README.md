      Dear ShareWare Vendor:
    
         This  document  contains our shareware distribution policy which
     applies to commercial vendors,  user groups,  BBS operators,  and/or
     individuals who wish  to  distribute  Pro  Football  EDGE!.  
     
         Possession of  this  document  entitles  you  to  distribute Pro
     Football EDGE!   as a "Shareware" product.   G & S Software reserves
     the right to deny  Future  distribution  rights  to  individuals  or
     organizations that abuse any of  the (4) Pro Football EDGE!   (PFE!)
     distribution policies listed below  or  engage  in  other  practices
     deemed unacceptable by G & S Software.
     
     --------------  DISK VENDOR DISTRIBUTION RESTRICTIONS  ------------  
                    
       1) Shareware distribution copies must contain all of the PFE!
          files in "unmodified form" just as they were received from
          G & S Software (Data compression is not an issue).   These
          include: pfe1.XXX, pfe2.XXX, readme.1st, and install.exe.
          Additional text and batch files may be added to conform to
          a vendors standard distribution methodology.
     
       2) Total charges for the distribution of Pro  Football  EDGE!
          Shareware diskettes must not exceed $6 (Excluding S&H).
     
       3) Distribution of  retail  or  registered  versions  of  Pro
          Football EDGE!  is not permitted.  You may only distribute
          the "Shareware version" disks which can be  identified  by
          the words "Shareware  Evaluation  Copy"  on  the MAIN MENU
          screen.   Please note that this is not a crippled  version
          of the program.   The ONLY software difference between the
          "Shareware version" disks and the fully registered program
          is  the  shareware  message  and  other messages promoting
          registration displayed within Pro Football EDGE!
      
       4) Misleading the customer into  believing  that he or she is
          purchasing an  "UNCONDITIONAL"  right  to  use  PFE!    is
          prohibited.   In particular,  the word "Shareware" must be
          used  in  the  description of PFE!   or the description of
          PFE!   must be  located  within  an  area  that is clearly
          identified as "Shareware" products.
     ____________________________________________________________________
     
         New  versions  of  Pro  Football EDGE!   will be available on an
     annual  basis  in  the  month  of  JULY.    These  releases  will be
     automatically sent to any  distributor  who requests an update.
