A detailed description of the program follows:


WYNDFIELDS FOR WINDOWS - version 1.1

  Recommended ZIP Name: WFW11.ZIP

  Short Description: Powerful Relational Database for Windows

  Description: Wyndfields is a relational database program for
               Windows, useful for keeping track of any type of
               structured information.  Data may be added, changed,
               removed, found, displayed, analyzed, and printed easily
               using the intuitive Windows interface.  Creating and
               printing mailing labels or detailed reports can be
               accomplished painlessly from within the program.
               Multiple indexes (ways of ordering your data) are
               maintained automatically for you, and several methods
               are available for extracting exactly the information
               you need from your files.  For more advanced users,
               Wyndfields also offers extensive string and math
               functions for use in searches and calculated fields,
               and its date and time tracking abilities are
               unsurpassed.  Several databases may be linked to each
               other so that you may pull together related information
               from each of them at the same time.

  New Features: Version 1.1 fixes several bugs present in version 1.0 which
                made it incompatible with Windows 3.1.

  System Requirements: Wyndfields for Windows requires a computer with
                       at least 1.5MB RAM, operating with Windows 3.0.
