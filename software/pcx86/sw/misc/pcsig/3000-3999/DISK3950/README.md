                  CBG Software License and Warranty Agreement
                               Shareware Version

This is a legal agreement between you, the end user, and CBG Software,
Incorporated.  By installing the software program, you are agreeing to be
bound by the terms of this agreement.

If you DO NOT agree to the terms of this agreement, DO NOT install the CBG
Software product onto your computer.  Either promptly erase the software
program disks or give them to another user to evaluate.

                          CBG Single User Software License

TEMPORARY GRANT OF LICENSE  ■  CBG Software, Inc. grants to you, for a
period of thirty (30) days beginning with the initial receipt of the software
disks, the right to use one copy of the enclosed CBG software product
(the PROGRAM) on a single terminal connected to a single computer
(single CPU).  You may not network the PROGRAM or otherwise use it on more
than one computer or computer terminal at the same time.  After the thirty
day evaluation period, you must either obtain a permanent license, as
described below, or remove the PROGRAM from your computer.

PERMANENT GRANT OF LICENSE  ■  After the thirty day evaluation period, a
permanent license for the PROGRAM will be granted upon receipt, and only upon
receipt, of the full registration fee as described in the registration form
accompanying the PROGRAM.  The permanent license shall have the same rights
and restrictions as the temporary license except that the thirty day
evaluation period is removed.

DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS  ■  You may make an unlimited number of copies of
the PROGRAM, provided that the original disks are copied exactly as received
by you, with no additions or modifications to any of the files on the PROGRAM
disks.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copying and distribution of the
disks.

COPYRIGHT  ■  The PROGRAM is owned and copyrighted by CBG Software,
Inc. and is protected by United States copyright laws and international treaty
provisions.  You must, therefore, treat the PROGRAM like any other copyrighted
material (such as a book or musical recording).  You may not copy any written
materials accompanying the PROGRAM.

OTHER RESTRICTIONS  ■  You may not rent or lease the PROGRAM, but you
may permanently transfer the PROGRAM and all accompanying written materials
provided that (1) you retain no copies of the program disks or written
materials and (2) the recipient agrees to all the terms of this Agreement.
Any such transfer must include all updates and prior versions of the PROGRAM.

DUAL MEDIA PROGRAM   ■  If the PROGRAM package contains both 3.5" and
5.25" disks, then you may use only the disks appropriate to your single-user
computer.  The other disks may not be used on any other computer or copied,
loaned, leased, sold, given or otherwise distributed to another user EXCEPT
as part of a permanent transfer as described above.

                                     NO WARRANTY

NO WARRANTY  ■  CBG Software, Inc. disclaims all warranties, either express or
implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability
and fitness for a particular purpose, with respect to the PROGRAM and the
accompanying written materials.  This warranty gives you specific legal rights. 
You may have others that vary from state to state.

NO LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES  ■  In no event shall CBG Software,
Inc. or its suppliers be liable for any damages whatsoever (including, without
limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss
of business information or other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or
inability to use this PROGRAM, even if CBG Software, Inc. has been advised of
the possibility of such damages.  Because some states do not allow the
exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages,
the above limitation may not apply to you.

                          U.S. Government Restricted Rights

The PROGRAM and written materials are provided with restricted rights.  Use,
duplication or disclosure by the US Government is subject to restrictions as set
forth in subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of The Rights in Technical Data and Computer
Software clause at 52.227-7013. Contractor/manufacturer is CBG Software,
Inc./9402 S. 69th East Avenue/Tulsa, OK 74133.
