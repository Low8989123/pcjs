       Getting involved in Trivia Shell


 ------------------------------             -------------------------------

     Hello, Welcome to Trivia Shell and thank you for choosing our game. 

     Trivia Shell is an interactive trivia game that allows you to test your 
knowledge in a variety of subject areas. Think you know all that there is to 
know about movies? Test yourself and amaze your friends by learning new facts 
from our files! Is state trivia your bag? We have it covered! You name the 
subject and chances are we have it, or we will have it.

     Trivia Shell can also be used as a study aid. You and your children can 
study geography, presidential history, science and more through Trivia Shell.

     Trivia Shell allows you to define the parameters of the game. You choose 
how the game will be scored, what questions you will answer, how many points 
you will get for correct or incorrect answers, whether you will get hints or 
not, and so on. You can control almost every aspect of your game play and we 
think that's important. So why don't you read on to learn the details of 
customizing Trivia Shell? We hope you enjoy playing the game that puts you 
first.

                             System Requirements
	
     To play Trivia Shell you must have an IBM PC or AT or 100 percent 
compatible machine with 640k RAM available. We recommend that you use a mouse 
(if you're using a mouse, you must use a 100 percent Microsoft compatible 
mouse driver). You must have an EGA or VGA video card installed and you must 
be using MS-DOS 2.0 or later. 

     Please remember to back up your copy of Trivia Shell and play using the 
back-up copies, reserving the original game disks for emergencies. See your 
DOS manual for information about backing up your disks.

                                 Screen Layout
	
      Trivia Shell is laid out on a menu system, similar to the one used in 
Microsoft Windows(TM). In case you are unfamiliar with this system, this 
section will explain it and teach you about getting around in Trivia Shell, 
with and without a mouse.

      On any given screen, there will be a menu at the top, a strip of topics
that allows you to get information, choose special preferences, load and save 
games, and quit playing Trivia Shell. You will find details on how to work 
with the menu items in the Setup and Starting a Game sections of the manual. 
The Info menu item contains information about the program, the author credits 
and the version number. 

      On the bottom of each screen there will a status bar that gives you 
important information, like on the right side, how much memory is currently 
available for Trivia Shell and the time, and helpful messages and instructions
for Trivia Shell on the left. Looking here will help keep you informed about 
the game at all times.

      Getting from place to place in Trivia Shell is pretty easy.

                           If you have a mouse! 

      Clicking on any of the menu items on the top of the screen will bring up
that menu. Clicking on buttons, like the Next or Previous buttons, will 
perform the action specified on each button. For example, the Previous button 
will take you to the Previous page. Clicking in check boxes will change their 
color from green to black or vice versa. This selects preferences. Green means
a feature is selected, black means it is not selected. See the Setup segment 
for further details on preferences. Sunken boxes containing text can be edited
using standard keys. You may delete and re-enter text using the Delete key, 
the Backspace key and arrows. We don't recommend using the numeric keypad. 

 ------------------------------   Page  1   -------------------------------

                           If you don't have a mouse! 

     All items can be accessed from the keyboard. Most items have titles. In 
each title you will see one underlined letter. Press and hold the Alt key and 
press and release the key for the underlined letter. This will activate the 
control just as if you had clicked on it with a mouse. You can move 
sequentially through the controls by pressing the Tab key. Depressing the Tab
key will highlight the activated command and it will turn white. At this 
point, pressing the Space key will activate the control. With a few minor 
exceptions, the Enter key corresponds to the Ok function and the Escape key 
corresponds to the Cancel function.

                         Whether or Not You Have a Mouse! 

    If a menu item or a button has a gray title, it is disabled and you won't 
be able to use it. If a menu item or button has a black title, it is enabled 
and you may use it.

                                  Setup
	 
   The Setup menu can be used to select and set-up your regular game 
preferences. These choices will be saved and kept even when you quit the 
program. You may also set individual player preferences for each game played. 
These will not be saved at the end of the game. Trivia Shell has certain 
default preferences that appear the first time you play the game. 

They include:

       Intermediate level of play
       Select Points option is off
       Humor Mode is on
       Display Answer mode is off
       The Randomize Questions and Sound options are on
       Timed Play is off (if you turn it on, the default time is 30 seconds)
       Allow Hints and the Hint Penalty are on
       Repeat Wrong mode is off
       The Icon Bonus and Icon Bonus Penalty are on

See Starting a Game and the individual feature descriptions for more details.

                                 Browse Mode	

       The Browse Mode is a feature unique to Trivia Shell. It allows you to 
take a sneak peek at Trivia Shell and also to use it as an educational tool. 
You can review questions and boost your knowledge in available topic areas. 
You will see a column on the left side with key words or numbers that are used
in the questions. On the right, you will see the number of questions that 
contain this word or number. If you don't have a mouse you can scroll through 
this list with the up and down arrow keys or the Page Up and Page Down keys.
If you do have a mouse, you can grab and hold the scroll thumb on the right to
cycle through the choices.

        Once you find a word you want to browse, activate the Browse button. 
This will bring up sample questions in the mode you chose in your setup. 
You may answer these if you want, but you will not get any points.

        You can continue and see all the questions with the Next and Previous
buttons or you can return to the Browse window with the Cancel button.

                             Starting a New Game	

        You can choose one, two, three or four players for a game of Trivia 
Shell. You can also choose the number of questions you will answer in a round
of Trivia Shell. After you do this, hitting Ok will bring up a new window.

 ------------------------------   Page  2   -------------------------------

        In the next section, you can enter game information for each player. 
You enter each player's name and choose the categories for each person to play
with.

        The Customize Setup button takes you to the Setup window, where you 
can really start to individualize Trivia Shell for every player. Here you 
alter your preferences for the current game. After each game, Trivia Shell 
will return to the default preferences noted earlier. After you have entered 
the information for each player, choose Ok. If you made a mistake or want to 
change a previous player's preferences, select Previous Player.

        If you decide not to start the game at this point, select Cancel. When
you are finished entering all the player information, hit Ok and the game will
begin.
 
        You may also choose to answer certain categories in a given game. Here
is another chance to really personalize your game play. You may choose one 
subject area, two, three and so on, or you may answer questions from all the 
subject areas in a potpourri round.

        When you begin playing Trivia Shell, you will notice that the question
window contains some new information. The upper left will tell you whose turn 
it is. The upper right tells you what category question you are currently 
trying to answer. Depending on what level you are playing, you will see a 
question and some answer choices or an answer blank. If you are playing in 
Hint mode, the Hint button will be enabled and you can click on it to get a 
hint. If you are using Timed Play mode, you will see a timer in the question 
box. For some of the questions there may be a reference. If there is a 
reference, the button will be enabled and you can click on it to see the 
reference.

       Below the actual question window, you will see a player status window. 
This status window lists the players' names, scores and some vital statistics.
The current player's stats will be highlighted.

       You will also notice that the menu above has changed. You may pause the
game with the Pause menu item. This is the only way to stop the timer in Timed
Play mode. You may also save the current game by choosing the Save Game menu 
item. Please note that there is only one saved game available per database. If
you have saved a previous game and decide to save a new game, the old one will
be erased.

                             Loading a Game	

      If you have previously saved a game, the Load Game menu item will return
you to where you were when you last quit Trivia Shell. You can play a new game
every day or go for a week-long master challenge game.

                              Level of Play	

      You can pick your level of difficulty in Trivia Shell. The Beginner mode
is a true/false game. Trivia Shell will give you a question and an answer. You
simply decide if it's true or false.

      When you've gotten too advanced for this level, you can switch to the 
Intermediate level, or if you're more daring - start out there. The 
Intermediate mode is a multiple choice game. Trivia Shell will give you a 
question and four answer choices. You pick the one you think is correct.

      For those real daredevil trivia buffs, the Advanced mode is a 
fill-in-the-blank game. You will be given a question and you have to type in 
an answer.

                         The Select Points Option	

     If you think you're still too advanced for standard trivia games, the 
Select Points option in Trivia Shell allows you to gamble on your knowledge. 

 ------------------------------   Page  3   -------------------------------

You can choose any number of points between 1 and 100 to add or subtract from 
your score. For example, if you choose 20 points and get the question right, 
you'll add 20 points to your score. If you get the question wrong, you lose 
those 20 points. If you don't activate this option, each question you get 
right will add 10 points to your score; there is no point penalty for wrong 
answers.

                                Humor Mode	

     Do you hate playing games that just beep at you, or tell you flat out 
that you're wrong? The Humor Mode adds a more personal touch to the game. If 
activated, Humor Mode will comment on your trivia skill - good and bad. It's 
the next best thing to playing with a friend.

                                Answer Mode
     
     The Display Answer option will do just that. If you get a question wrong,
it will tell you the right answer. If you get it right, it's like a pat on the
back. Display Answer will confirm your response. This is particularly useful 
if you want to use Trivia Shell as a learning aid; you'll never have to guess 
what the right answer was or search through reference books, you'll simply be 
told the right answer to store for future attempts.

                             The Randomize Option	

     The Randomize option will shuffle through all of the questions in the 
topic areas you've selected and give them to you randomly. You'll never have 
to wonder if you got a question right just because you've memorized it from 
playing Trivia Shell so often. This option helps ensure that each time you 
play Trivia Shell, you're entertained anew.

                                    Sound	

    The Sound option, if activated, gives you beeps and buzzes. Add an arcade 
feel to your matches!

                                   Timed Play	

    The Timed Play option puts the pressure on you. The timer ticks away as 
you wrack your brain for wisdom. You can set the timer anywhere from 5 seconds
per question on up.

                              Hints and Hint Penalties	

    The Allow Hints option activates a Hints button in the game. If you really
get stuck, use the button and Trivia Shell will give you a little help. The 
Hint Penalty option encourages you not to rely too heavily on the Hints 
option. If activated, you will lose 5 points for every hint you take. You can 
take it easy or you can work for those high scores.

                                  Repeat Wrong Mode	

    The Repeat Wrong option will bring the questions you missed back up. In 
Trivia Shell, you get a second chance.

                            Icon Bonus & Penalty	

    The Icon Bonus gives you brownie points for having a good memory.

    If this function is activated, you will see a small icon in the upper 
right-hand corner of the question window. Keep track of what you see. If the 
same icon comes up again, click on the Icon Bonus button. The last question 
you saw with the same icon will reappear. If you remember the correct answer,
type it in and score 20 bonus points. But we don't want to make it too easy 
for you, so if you have selected Icon Bonus Penalty and get the bonus question
wrong, you'll lose 20 points. You choose the level of difficulty of your games
and the level of rewards.

 ------------------------------   Page  4   -------------------------------

                                 High Scores	

     Here's where you begin to reap the rewards of your trivia wit. The High 
Scores window will show you the names of the top three scorers for each of the
three levels of Trivia Shell along with the date that each score was attained.
You can keep track of your friendly battles of wits without ever having to 
write down a point gained or lost!

                               Quitting the Game	

     As much fun as you've had playing Trivia Shell, we know you'll have to 
reluctantly take breaks to let your mind rest. If you are in the middle of a 
game and would like to save it, simply select the Save option from the menu at
the top of the screen. If you do not want to save, or if you have finished 
your game, simply select the Quit option from the menu. Trivia Shell will 
verify that you really want to quit; you answer and you're out.

     See Loading a Game to resume a saved game at a later time.

                                 For More Trivia

       Getting involved in Trivia Shell


 ------------------------------             -------------------------------

     Hello, Welcome to Trivia Shell and thank you for choosing our game. 

     Trivia Shell is an interactive trivia game that allows you to test your 
knowledge in a variety of subject areas. Think you know all that there is to 
know about movies? Test yourself and amaze your friends by learning new facts 
from our files! Is state trivia your bag? We have it covered! You name the 
subject and chances are we have it, or we will have it.

     Trivia Shell can also be used as a study aid. You and your children can 
study geography, presidential history, science and more through Trivia Shell.

     Trivia Shell allows you to define the parameters of the game. You choose 
how the game will be scored, what questions you will answer, how many points 
you will get for correct or incorrect answers, whether you will get hints or 
not, and so on. You can control almost every aspect of your game play and we 
think that's important. So why don't you read on to learn the details of 
customizing Trivia Shell? We hope you enjoy playing the game that puts you 
first.

                             System Requirements
	
     To play Trivia Shell you must have an IBM PC or AT or 100 percent 
compatible machine with 640k RAM available. We recommend that you use a mouse 
(if you're using a mouse, you must use a 100 percent Microsoft compatible 
mouse driver). You must have an EGA or VGA video card installed and you must 
be using MS-DOS 2.0 or later. 

     Please remember to back up your copy of Trivia Shell and play using the 
back-up copies, reserving the original game disks for emergencies. See your 
DOS manual for information about backing up your disks.

                                 Screen Layout
	
      Trivia Shell is laid out on a menu system, similar to the one used in 
Microsoft Windows(TM). In case you are unfamiliar with this system, this 
section will explain it and teach you about getting around in Trivia Shell, 
with and without a mouse.

      On any given screen, there will be a menu at the top, a strip of topics
that allows you to get information, choose special preferences, load and save 
games, and quit playing Trivia Shell. You will find details on how to work 
with the menu items in the Setup and Starting a Game sections of the manual. 
The Info menu item contains information about the program, the author credits 
and the version number. 

      On the bottom of each screen there will a status bar that gives you 
important information, like on the right side, how much memory is currently 
available for Trivia Shell and the time, and helpful messages and instructions
for Trivia Shell on the left. Looking here will help keep you informed about 
the game at all times.

      Getting from place to place in Trivia Shell is pretty easy.

                           If you have a mouse! 

      Clicking on any of the menu items on the top of the screen will bring up
that menu. Clicking on buttons, like the Next or Previous buttons, will 
perform the action specified on each button. For example, the Previous button 
will take you to the Previous page. Clicking in check boxes will change their 
color from green to black or vice versa. This selects preferences. Green means
a feature is selected, black means it is not selected. See the Setup segment 
for further details on preferences. Sunken boxes containing text can be edited
using standard keys. You may delete and re-enter text using the Delete key, 
the Backspace key and arrows. We don't recommend using the numeric keypad. 

 ------------------------------   Page  1   -------------------------------

                           If you don't have a mouse! 

     All items can be accessed from the keyboard. Most items have titles. In 
each title you will see one underlined letter. Press and hold the Alt key and 
press and release the key for the underlined letter. This will activate the 
control just as if you had clicked on it with a mouse. You can move 
sequentially through the controls by pressing the Tab key. Depressing the Tab
key will highlight the activated command and it will turn white. At this 
point, pressing the Space key will activate the control. With a few minor 
exceptions, the Enter key corresponds to the Ok function and the Escape key 
corresponds to the Cancel function.

                         Whether or Not You Have a Mouse! 

    If a menu item or a button has a gray title, it is disabled and you won't 
be able to use it. If a menu item or button has a black title, it is enabled 
and you may use it.

                                  Setup
	 
   The Setup menu can be used to select and set-up your regular game 
preferences. These choices will be saved and kept even when you quit the 
program. You may also set individual player preferences for each game played. 
These will not be saved at the end of the game. Trivia Shell has certain 
default preferences that appear the first time you play the game. 

They include:

       Intermediate level of play
       Select Points option is off
       Humor Mode is on
       Display Answer mode is off
       The Randomize Questions and Sound options are on
       Timed Play is off (if you turn it on, the default time is 30 seconds)
       Allow Hints and the Hint Penalty are on
       Repeat Wrong mode is off
       The Icon Bonus and Icon Bonus Penalty are on

See Starting a Game and the individual feature descriptions for more details.

                                 Browse Mode	

       The Browse Mode is a feature unique to Trivia Shell. It allows you to 
take a sneak peek at Trivia Shell and also to use it as an educational tool. 
You can review questions and boost your knowledge in available topic areas. 
You will see a column on the left side with key words or numbers that are used
in the questions. On the right, you will see the number of questions that 
contain this word or number. If you don't have a mouse you can scroll through 
this list with the up and down arrow keys or the Page Up and Page Down keys.
If you do have a mouse, you can grab and hold the scroll thumb on the right to
cycle through the choices.

        Once you find a word you want to browse, activate the Browse button. 
This will bring up sample questions in the mode you chose in your setup. 
You may answer these if you want, but you will not get any points.

        You can continue and see all the questions with the Next and Previous
buttons or you can return to the Browse window with the Cancel button.

                             Starting a New Game	

        You can choose one, two, three or four players for a game of Trivia 
Shell. You can also choose the number of questions you will answer in a round
of Trivia Shell. After you do this, hitting Ok will bring up a new window.

 ------------------------------   Page  2   -------------------------------

        In the next section, you can enter game information for each player. 
You enter each player's name and choose the categories for each person to play
with.

        The Customize Setup button takes you to the Setup window, where you 
can really start to individualize Trivia Shell for every player. Here you 
alter your preferences for the current game. After each game, Trivia Shell 
will return to the default preferences noted earlier. After you have entered 
the information for each player, choose Ok. If you made a mistake or want to 
change a previous player's preferences, select Previous Player.

        If you decide not to start the game at this point, select Cancel. When
you are finished entering all the player information, hit Ok and the game will
begin.
 
        You may also choose to answer certain categories in a given game. Here
is another chance to really personalize your game play. You may choose one 
subject area, two, three and so on, or you may answer questions from all the 
subject areas in a potpourri round.

        When you begin playing Trivia Shell, you will notice that the question
window contains some new information. The upper left will tell you whose turn 
it is. The upper right tells you what category question you are currently 
trying to answer. Depending on what level you are playing, you will see a 
question and some answer choices or an answer blank. If you are playing in 
Hint mode, the Hint button will be enabled and you can click on it to get a 
hint. If you are using Timed Play mode, you will see a timer in the question 
box. For some of the questions there may be a reference. If there is a 
reference, the button will be enabled and you can click on it to see the 
reference.

       Below the actual question window, you will see a player status window. 
This status window lists the players' names, scores and some vital statistics.
The current player's stats will be highlighted.

       You will also notice that the menu above has changed. You may pause the
game with the Pause menu item. This is the only way to stop the timer in Timed
Play mode. You may also save the current game by choosing the Save Game menu 
item. Please note that there is only one saved game available per database. If
you have saved a previous game and decide to save a new game, the old one will
be erased.

                             Loading a Game	

      If you have previously saved a game, the Load Game menu item will return
you to where you were when you last quit Trivia Shell. You can play a new game
every day or go for a week-long master challenge game.

                              Level of Play	

      You can pick your level of difficulty in Trivia Shell. The Beginner mode
is a true/false game. Trivia Shell will give you a question and an answer. You
simply decide if it's true or false.

      When you've gotten too advanced for this level, you can switch to the 
Intermediate level, or if you're more daring - start out there. The 
Intermediate mode is a multiple choice game. Trivia Shell will give you a 
question and four answer choices. You pick the one you think is correct.

      For those real daredevil trivia buffs, the Advanced mode is a 
fill-in-the-blank game. You will be given a question and you have to type in 
an answer.

                         The Select Points Option	

     If you think you're still too advanced for standard trivia games, the 
Select Points option in Trivia Shell allows you to gamble on your knowledge. 

 ------------------------------   Page  3   -------------------------------

You can choose any number of points between 1 and 100 to add or subtract from 
your score. For example, if you choose 20 points and get the question right, 
you'll add 20 points to your score. If you get the question wrong, you lose 
those 20 points. If you don't activate this option, each question you get 
right will add 10 points to your score; there is no point penalty for wrong 
answers.

                                Humor Mode	

     Do you hate playing games that just beep at you, or tell you flat out 
that you're wrong? The Humor Mode adds a more personal touch to the game. If 
activated, Humor Mode will comment on your trivia skill - good and bad. It's 
the next best thing to playing with a friend.

                                Answer Mode
     
     The Display Answer option will do just that. If you get a question wrong,
it will tell you the right answer. If you get it right, it's like a pat on the
back. Display Answer will confirm your response. This is particularly useful 
if you want to use Trivia Shell as a learning aid; you'll never have to guess 
what the right answer was or search through reference books, you'll simply be 
told the right answer to store for future attempts.

                             The Randomize Option	

     The Randomize option will shuffle through all of the questions in the 
topic areas you've selected and give them to you randomly. You'll never have 
to wonder if you got a question right just because you've memorized it from 
playing Trivia Shell so often. This option helps ensure that each time you 
play Trivia Shell, you're entertained anew.

                                    Sound	

    The Sound option, if activated, gives you beeps and buzzes. Add an arcade 
feel to your matches!

                                   Timed Play	

    The Timed Play option puts the pressure on you. The timer ticks away as 
you wrack your brain for wisdom. You can set the timer anywhere from 5 seconds
per question on up.

                              Hints and Hint Penalties	

    The Allow Hints option activates a Hints button in the game. If you really
get stuck, use the button and Trivia Shell will give you a little help. The 
Hint Penalty option encourages you not to rely too heavily on the Hints 
option. If activated, you will lose 5 points for every hint you take. You can 
take it easy or you can work for those high scores.

                                  Repeat Wrong Mode	

    The Repeat Wrong option will bring the questions you missed back up. In 
Trivia Shell, you get a second chance.

                            Icon Bonus & Penalty	

    The Icon Bonus gives you brownie points for having a good memory.

    If this function is activated, you will see a small icon in the upper 
right-hand corner of the question window. Keep track of what you see. If the 
same icon comes up again, click on the Icon Bonus button. The last question 
you saw with the same icon will reappear. If you remember the correct answer,
type it in and score 20 bonus points. But we don't want to make it too easy 
for you, so if you have selected Icon Bonus Penalty and get the bonus question
wrong, you'll lose 20 points. You choose the level of difficulty of your games
and the level of rewards.

 ------------------------------   Page  4   -------------------------------

                                 High Scores	

     Here's where you begin to reap the rewards of your trivia wit. The High 
Scores window will show you the names of the top three scorers for each of the
three levels of Trivia Shell along with the date that each score was attained.
You can keep track of your friendly battles of wits without ever having to 
write down a point gained or lost!

                               Quitting the Game	

     As much fun as you've had playing Trivia Shell, we know you'll have to 
reluctantly take breaks to let your mind rest. If you are in the middle of a 
game and would like to save it, simply select the Save option from the menu at
the top of the screen. If you do not want to save, or if you have finished 
your game, simply select the Quit option from the menu. Trivia Shell will 
verify that you really want to quit; you answer and you're out.

     See Loading a Game to resume a saved game at a later time.

                                 For More Trivia
