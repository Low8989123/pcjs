This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
900 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'INSTALL' at
the DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy
access to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.  All the programs are logically divided into thirteen
major categories with subcategories, making it easier to find just the
right software.

All of the programs have been scanned for viruses.  There are also three
online virus utilities that can be run from the CD-ROM which will scan,
screen and clean viruses.  Not only does this save hard disk space, but
also gives every user added security from viruses.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

Winner of the Optical Publishing Assn's Best Consumer Product Award.

Shareware for every imaginable need: Accounting Chemistry Educational
Engineering Games Hypertext Networks Programming Spreadsheets Utilities
Word Processing

Additional BBS file descriptions are available from PC-SIG so that the
CD-ROM can be set up quickly on a bulletin board.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 530K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
a graphics monitor (Hercules/EGA/VGA/SVGA).  A mouse is optional.

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

                                NickleWare
                             Bradley Nicholes
      

INTRODUCTION

	WindBase is an application that was designed to help simplify data 
collection, storage and retrieval.  With the help of WindBase, you can 
design custom data entry forms and at the same time create the database to 
match.  WindBase will also allow you to index and reindex your data by a 
single field or multiple fields.  This enables you to organize and retrieve 
your data much more easily and faster as well.  WindBase allows you to 
create, store and view multiple database files all at the same time. Then 
when you are ready to print your data, WindBase will print it in the same 
custom layout or let you reorganize the data to best fit your needs.



REGISTRATION

	WindBase is not public domain, nor is it free software.  You are 
granted a limited license to use this product on a trial basis.  You are 
also granted a license to copy WindBase, along with the documentation, for 
the trial use by other users.  If you wish to continue using the product, 
you must send $25 to:

                              NickleWare
                             P.O. Box 393
                          Orem, UT.  84059  USA

If you would like an original  disk or an update to the latest release of 
the software, please add $5 for shipping and handling.

	We encourage you to copy WindBase and share it with anyone who might 
be interested in an easier way to gather, store and retrieve information.



GETTING STARTED

	REQUIREMENTS -
		Microsoft Windows 3.1 or higher
		IBM compatible PC 286, 386 or 486

	Before proceeding, make sure that you have Microsoft Windows correctly 
installed.  Next create a directory called WINDBASE and copy the WindBase 
software (WINDBASE.EXE) into this directory.  WindBase is ready to be 
started.  Simply start WindBase from the RUN... menu selection of the 
Windows Program Manager or add it to a Program Manager group by following 
the directions for creating a group item in the Windows 3.1 User's Guide.



WHAT IS A DATABASE

	A database is a collection of similar data records stored in a common 
file or collection of files.  A database management system such as WindBase 
provides a means by which a user can easily store and retrieve this data.



CREATING A NEW DATABASE

	To create a WindBase database first select DATABASE DEFINITION and NEW 
from the FILE pulldown menu.  WindBase will create a blank database 
definition window and ungray the following menu selections:

    FILE Menu:
        DATABASE DEFINITION 
            SAVE...- Save a database definition and data files.

        DEFINE Menu:
            TEXT - This option creates a static text field in the current 
                database definition window.
            EDIT - This option creates an entry/edit field in the current 
                database definition window.
            CHECKBOX - This option creates a checkbox in the current 
                database definition window.
            BITMAP - This option creates a bitmap field in the current 
                database definition window.     
            STYLES - This option displays a popup window that allows the 
                user to modify the attributes of the currently selected 
                TEXT, EDIT, CHECKBOX or BITMAP field. 
            DELETE - This option deletes the currently selected TEXT, EDIT, 
                CHECKBOX or BITMAP field.
            TITLE - This option modifies the database title that appears 
                in the database window.
            FONT - This option changes the text font for the current 
                database definition window.


	Layout the database by selecting the desired fields from the DEFINE 
pulldown menu as described in the CREATING A DATABASE FIELD section.  Each 
of the newly created fields can be resized and placed in the database 
definition window where desired.
	After all of the database fields have been created and defined, the 
database layout can be saved and the database files created.  To do this, 
simply select DATABASE DEFINITION and SAVE... from the FILE pulldown menu.  
A SAVE popup window will appear prompting the user to enter a path and file 
name where the database files and associated layout files will be stored.  
The user only needs to enter the primary part of the file name (file name 
without the extension).  WindBase will add the extension of .WB for the 
database layout file, .DB for the database file and .IDX for the index file.  
Once the file name has been entered and the user has selected the OK 
pushbutton, the database definition and field layout files will be created.  
If the database files already exist in the specified path, Windbase will 
notify the user that the database already exists and the path or file name 
must to be changed.  Once a database definition has been saved and the 
database created, WindBase will only allow the database fields to be 
resized or repositioned.  No new database fields can be added to this 
definition.  If there is a need to add or delete a database field, this 
can be done as described in the CREATING A NEW DATABASE FROM AN EXISTING 
section and the DATA IMPORT AND EXPORT section.



CREATING A DATABASE FIELD

	By selecting the TEXT, EDIT, CHECKBOX or BITMAP options from the DEFINE 
pulldown menu, the corresponding field will be created in the currently 
selected database definition window.  The new field will be created in the 
upper left hand corner of the database definition window.  A style popup 
window will be displayed prompting the user to enter a name to identify the 
newly created field and modify any of the field attributes if desired.  
After the database field has been created, it can be moved and resized as 
explained in the MOVE AND RESIZING A DATABASE FIELD section.



SETTING ATTRIBUTES OF A DATABASE FIELD

	Each TEXT, EDIT, CHECKBOX and BITMAP field defaults to a specific set 
of attributes.  These attributes may be modified through the STYLES option 
in the DEFINE pulldown menu.  When the STYLES option is selected a popup 
window is presented that corresponds to the selected database field.  The 
EDIT, CHECKBOX and BITMAP fields require a field name that is later used 
in the creation of the database.  All other attributes in the styles popup 
windows are optional.



MOVING AND RESIZING A DATABASE FIELD

	Once a database field has been created, it can be moved or resized to 
the desired position and size by dragging and dropping with the mouse 
pointer or grabbing the field border and stretching it.
	To move the field, simply place the mouse pointer over the top of it 
and click the mouse button once.  A dotted line will appear around the 
field to indicate that it is now the currently selected field.  The mouse 
pointer will also change to a four direction pointer to indicate that the 
field may be moved.  With the four direction pointer over the top of the 
selected field, press and hold the left mouse button down and while hold 
down the button, move the mouse pointer to the desired position.  A database 
field may also be moved by using the arrow keys on the keyboard.  To do 
this first select the database field with the mouse as described above.  
Then use the arrow keys to move the database field in the desired direction.
	To resize a database field, select the field as described above, then 
move the mouse pointer over the border of the selected field.  As this is 
done, the mouse pointer will change from a four direction pointer to a two 
direction horizontal, vertical or diagonal pointer depending on the 
direction in which the field may be resized.  Then simply hold the left 
mouse button down and move the mouse in the direction indicated by the two 
direction pointer until the field is resized to the desired size.



DELETING A DATABASE FIELD

	Once a TEXT, EDIT, CHECKBOX or BITMAP field has been created, it may be 
deleted.  To delete a field, simply select it by placing the mouse pointer 
over it and pressing the left mouse button.  Once the field has been 
selected, a dotted line border will appear around it.  Then select DELETE 
from the DEFINE pulldown menu.  A confirmation popup window will appear 
asking that the user to confirm the operation.  Selecting the YES 
pushbutton, will delete the field.



CHANGING THE DATABASE TITLE

	To change the title that appears in the database window title bar, 
select the TITLE option from the DEFINE pulldown menu.  After making this 
selection a popup window will be displayed allowing the user to enter a 
database title.  After entering the database title, select the OK 
pushbutton and the database window title will change.



CHANGING THE DATABASE FONT

	To change the font for the database window text, select the FONT... 
option from the DEFINE pulldown menu.  After making this selection a popup 
window will be displayed allowing the user to select a new font.  After 
selecting the new font, select the OK pushbutton and the new font will 
appear in the database window.



OPENING A DATABASE

	To open an existing database the user must select OPEN DATABASE... 
from the FILE pulldown menu.  An open file popup window will be displayed.  
This popup window allows the user to change directories and select database 
files.  There are four types of files that WindBase creates.  The primary 
name of each of the four files of a database is the name specified by the 
user when the database was originally created.  The extensions for each 
of these files are as follows:

    .WB -	WindBase database layout file.
    .DB -	Database file.
    .IDX -	Database index file.
    .WBN - 	Database bitmap file.
    .PRN -	WindBase page layout file.


	When opening a database, any one of these files can be selected.  Once 
the database has been selected, a database window will appear with the 
current database layout.



OPENING A DATABASE DEFINITION

	An existing database definition can be opened by selection DATABASE 
DEFINITION and OPEN... from the FILE pulldown menu.  A database definition 
that has been opened for modification can not have new database fields 
created.  The only modifications that are allowed are resizing and 
repositioning of existing database fields.  Once all of the modifications 
have been completed, select DATABASE DEFINITION and SAVE... from the 
FILE pulldown menu.  If there is a need to add or delete a database field 
from an existing definition, this can be done as described in the CREATING A 
NEW DATABASE FROM AN EXISTING section and the DATA IMPORT AND EXPORT section.



CREATING A NEW DATABASE FROM AN EXISTING

	A new database definition can be created from an existing definition 
by selection DATABASE DEFINITION and OPEN AS... from the FILE pulldown menu.  
The user will then be prompted to select an existing database definition 
to use as the template for the new database definition.  Once a database 
definition template has been selection, a database definition window will 
appear containing all of the same fields that existed in the selected 
database definition template.  The user can then add, modify or delete 
database fields as described in the Creating A Database Field Setting 
Attributes Of A Database Field and Deleting A Database Field sections


DELETING A DATABASE

	To delete a database the user must open the database as described in 
the OPENING A DATABASE section.  Once the database has been opened and 
selected, pull down the FILE menu and select DELETE DATABASE.  A 
confirmation popup window will appear allowing the user to confirm the 
action.  If the OK pushbutton is selected, the database along with its 
associated files will be deleted.



DELETING DATABASE RECORDS ONLY

	To delete all of the database records without deleting the database 
definition, simply pulldown the FILE menu and select DELETE ALL RECORDS.  
A confirmation message box will appear prompting the user to confirm the 
delete all records action.  If the user selects the YES pushbutton, WindBase 
will then delete all of the records from the currently selected database 
without deleting the definition.


ENTERING AND EDITING DATA

	To enter and edit a record within a database the user must first open 
the database as described in the OPENING A DATABASE section.  Data can be 
entered into any of the EDIT fields, CHECKBOXes or BITMAP fields.  Once the 
desired data has been entered, select ADD from the RECORD pulldown menu.  
This will add the record to the database.
	Modifying a record can be done in the same manner.  After the data has 
been completely modified, select MODIFY from the RECORD pulldown menu.  
	Bitmap data can be pasted in from the clipboard or read in from a file 
by using the normal clipboard paste option under the EDIT pulldown menu or 
selecting the PASTE FROM A FILE option.  Also by double clicking on a 
bitmap field, the user will be presented with a popup menu which will allow 
a bitmap to be stretched to fit within the bounds of the field or in normal 
view.  The popup menu also provides the PASTE FROM A FILE functionality for 
reading in the bitmap data from a .BMP file.



MOVING AROUND A DATABASE

	Searching and browsing through the records of a database can be done by 
selecting SEARCH, PREVIOUS and NEXT from the RECORD pulldown menu.  To 
search for a specific record, simply enter in the data or part of the data 
into the field by which the database has been indexed.  Then select SEARCH 
from the RECORD pulldown menu.  WindBase will search the database for the 
first record that exactly matches or is the closest match to the data 
entered.  By selecting the NEXT or PREVIOUS options from the RECORD 
pulldown menu, the user will be able to step through each record one by one 
forward or backward.



DELETING A RECORD FROM THE DATABASE

	To delete a record from the database, simply select the record in the 
same manner as described in the MOVING AROUND A DATABASE section.  Once the 
desired record has been selected pull down the RECORD menu and click on the 
DELETE option.  A confirmation popup window will appear allowing the user 
to confirm or reject the action.  If the user clicks on the YES pushbutton, 
the record will be deleted from the databases.



DEFINING AN INDEX

	One of the selections under the FILE pulldown menu is the option to 
define or set a new default INDEX for a database.  After selecting this 
option, a popup window will appear that contains two list boxes.  The first 
list box on the left contains a list of the currently defined indexes for 
the selected database.  By highlighting one of the index names in the list 
box, the name will appear in the entry field at the top right-hand side of 
the popup window.  The second list box will display a list of the fields 
currently defined in the selected database with the selected index definition 
fields highlighted.
	A new index can be created by first entering in a new index name into 
the INDEX NAME entry field above the INDEX DEFINITION list box.  Then by 
dragging and placing the database field names within the INDEX DEFINITION 
list box into the desired order and highlighting them by click on them with 
the mouse, the user is able to define a new index definition.  After the 
new index has been defined, click on the DEFINE pushbutton beneath the 
INDEX DEFINITION list box and the index will be created and added to the 
current database index list.  Once an index has been defined, it can not be 
modified or deleted.  The only way to remove index definitions is by 
selecting the REINDEX option from the FILE/INDEX cascade menu.  This option 
will remove all of the defined indexes and recreate the PHYSICAL and PRIMARY 
indexes.



REINDEXING A DATABASE

	To reindex a database, first open the database as described in the 
OPENING A DATABASE section.  Once the database has been opened and the 
database window selected, pulldown the FILE menu and select REINDEX from the 
INDEX cascade menu.  This will remove all of the currently defined indexes 
for the selected database and restore the base PHYSICAL and PRIMARY indexes.  



LAYING OUT A PRINTER PAGE

	WindBase allows the user to print a database record in a different 
format than what was originally defined.  Creating a printer definition 
is similar to creating a database definition.  Select PAGE SETUP from the 
FILE pulldown menu.  A database window will appear with the current database 
definition.  When the page layout window is created, the working area is 
adjusted to reflect the current size of a physical printer page according 
to the printer definition.  The working area can be scrolled within the 
printer page definition window by using the scroll bars along the sides of 
the window.  If the printer page definition has not already been created, 
it will default to the current database definition.  The database fields 
can be moved and resized as described in the MOVING AND RESIZING A DATABASE 
FIELD section.  While in the printer page definition mode the user will not 
be able to create new EDIT, CHECKBOX or BITMAP fields, but the user may 
create new TEXT fields.  The user is also allowed to change the text of a 
CHECKBOX or any previously existing TEXT field.  Once the printer page has 
been laid out as desired, select DATABASE DEFINITION and SAVE... from the 
FILE pulldown menu.  The printer page definition will be saved and used 
whenever a record is printed from the corresponding database.



PRINTING A RECORD

	To print a record, first select the desired record as described in the 
MOVING AROUND THE DATABASE section.  After the desired record has be 
selected, pulldown the FILE menu and select PRINT.  The current record will 
be printed using the defined printer page definition.  (The printer page 
definition must have been defined as described in the LAYING OUT A PRINTER 
PAGE section.).



VIEWING / MANIPULATING MULTIPLE DATABASES

	Because WindBase was implemented as a multiple document interface 
application, it allows the user to open, maintain and view more the one 
database at a time.  As each database file is opened, WindBase creates a new 
database window and lays out the database on the working area.  Switching 
from one database to another is as simple as placing the mouse cursor over 
the desired window and clicking the left mouse button.  This will select 
that database and window as the current database.  All of the WindBase menu 
options will then apply to that database.  Each of the database windows can 
also be minimized to avoid cluttering up the desktop with too many windows.  
Then, as desired, each database window can be restored or minimized as the 
user moves from one database file to another.



DATA IMPORT AND EXPORT

	WindBase will allow the user to import or export data from or to a text 
file.  To import data from a text file, first open the database as described 
in the OPENING A DATABASE section.  Once a database has been opened, select 
IMPORT from the FILE pulldown menu.  The user will be prompted to select 
the text file containing the data to be imported.  Once the import file has 
been selected, an import window will appear allowing the user to set the 
type of delimiter that WindBase should look for to delimit each field of a 
database record.  After selecting a delimiter, the user should select the 
RESET FILE pushbutton.  At this point WindBase will read in and display the 
first record from the import text file.  The data import window also 
contains three options for importing the data.  These three options are 
importing a SINGLE record at a time, importing ALL records at one time or 
importing a specified number of records.  Once one of these options has 
been selected, the user can click on the IMPORT pushbutton to begin 
importing and adding the data to the database.
	There are also two other pushbuttons which allow the user to move 
through import data or cancel the import operation.  These two pushbuttons 
are SKIP and CANCEL.  By selecting the SKIP pushbutton, the current import 
record will be skipped and the next record will be read in and displayed.
	Data export is similar to data import.  By selecting the EXPORT menu 
option, the user will be prompted to specify an export file name after which 
an export window will appear that looks similar to the import window with 
the exception of the ADD RECORD TERMINATOR checkbox.  This checkbox 
instructs WindBase to add a carriage return and line feed to the end of 
each record regardless of the selected field delimiter.  This allows the 
resulting output to be written in a format that is more suitable for 
reporting.  As described above the user should specify the field delimiter 
and export option WindBase should use.  Then by clicking on the EXPORT 
pushbutton, WindBase will export the data into a text file.

SPECIAL FEATURES

	DRAG AND DROP - Whenever an item such as a database field is being 
repositioned within a database definition window , the item may be dragged 
and dropped.  This means that an item can be selected with the mouse 
pointer, and while holding the mouse button down, move the pointer to a new 
position.  When the mouse button is released the selected item will be 
placed at the mouse pointer position.

	CLIPBOARD - The clipboard is a convenient way of transferring data 
between WindBase and other Windows applications or between different 
WindBase databases or records.  To use the clipboard functions simply 
highlight any text that is displayed in an entry field, pull down the 
EDIT menu and choose COPY or CUT.  The COPY function will place a copy of 
the highlighted text in the Windows clipboard.  The CUT function also 
places the highlighted text in the clipboard but also removes it from 
the entry field.  To retrieve text from the clipboard, place the cursor 
at the position inside an entry field where the clipboard text should be 
inserted or appended.  Then pull down the EDIT menu and choose PASTE.  The 
clipboard text will be placed in the entry field at the cursor position.



ENHANCEMENTS

	The following is a list of the new features and enhancements that have 
been included in version 2.0 of WindBase:

    o Data Import and Export functionality.
    o Database Text and Printing Font Selection Per Database Definition.
    o Ability to Store and Retrieve Bitmap Graphical Data.
    o Addition of Windows 3.1 File Open, Save As... and Font dialogs


EXITING

	When you have finished using WindBase, you should exit via the EXIT 
selection from the main window's FILE menu.  If you forget and turn your 
computer off before exiting, WindBase can not guarantee that your database 
files have been saved completely.  It is very important that you always exit 
WindBase via this selection.
