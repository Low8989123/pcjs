The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We
recommend a 386 with a VGA monitor.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q4: How Do I Install ASCEND?

- Start Windows on your computer.
- Place the Bernoulli Shareware Program Disk in one of your Bernoulli
  drives.
- From the Windows' Program Manager Menu, pull down the File option.
- Select the Run option from the File menu.
- Enter D:\ASCEND\SETUP at the Command Line then press OK.
  (If you have inserted this program diskette in a different drive other
  than D, modify the above command accordingly, i.e., E:\ACSEND\SETUP, etc.)
- The ASCEND Setup program will now run.  Enter the drive location
  where you placed the ASCEND diskette.  (This field will default to A:\).
  Press TAB to advance to the next prompt.
- In the Destination Path field, enter the drive and path where you
  would like to install ASCEND. (This field will default to C:\ASCEND.)
  After you have entered the appropriate source and destination paths,
  select OK.
- ASCEND will now be installed in the appropriate path of your hard
  drive and a new program group will be created containing two icons
  (ASCEND and ASCEND Tools & Utilities).
- Double click on the ASCEND icon (the pyramid) to run ASCEND.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q5: What is the Best Way To "Explore" ASCEND?

- You may load "demo data" into ASCEND by performing the following steps:
- Quit ASCEND if you currently have it running. Run the ASCEND Tools &
  Utilities program. Choose Demo from the menu to turn the demo data on.
- When this process is completed and the ASCEND Tools & Utilities window
  is closed, run ASCEND by double clicking on the ASCEND icon.
- The demo data will now be loaded into the ASCEND program.  Each icon
  will have demo data loaded to experiment with.  You can add, delete,
  or move the demo data in anyway you desire.
- To go through the demo data again, simply reset the demo data from
  the menu in ASCEND Tools & Utilities.  When you are ready to input live
  data, use the menu option in ASCEND Tools & Utilities to remove the demo
  data.
- Even after live data is entered into the evaluation copy of ASCEND, it
  is still possible to load the demo data again.  By turning on the demo
  data from the ASCEND Tools & Utilities, the program will automatically
  retain any live data and will automatically restore the live data when
  the demo data is removed.
- ASCEND has extensive on-line help.  The entire ASCEND manual is contained
  in summary format in ASCEND's help files.  For a quick index of the
  subjects covered in the help, select the Help/Index menu from within
  ASCEND.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q6: How Does The 60-Day Evaluation System Work?

- All ASCEND program diskettes have been designed to run for 60-days
  from the time of installation onto a hard drive.  At the end of the
  60-days, the program "times out" and will no longer allow you access.
  This allows someone to "test drive" ASCEND for 60 days before their
  purchase.
- If you wish to continue using ASCEND beyond the 60-days, simply
  purchase a copy of ASCEND and you will receive special instructions
  and "key numbers" to enter into ASCEND that will "unlock" the program
  and your data.  Any live data that you input into ASCEND during the
  evaluation period can then be utilized once again.
- If you do not wish to purchase ASCEND to continue using it beyond
  the 60-days, simply erase the files contained in the ASCEND directory
  and remove the ASCEND directory from your hard drive.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q7: How Do I Order A Complete Working Copy of ASCEND?

- The software package can be purchased either through your local software
  dealer, direct from NewQuest, or through the Franklin International
  Institute.  Marketing inquiries should be directed to NewQuest Marketing
  at 1-800-877-1814 or 1-801-975-9992.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
