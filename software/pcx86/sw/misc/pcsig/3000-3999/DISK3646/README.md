The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We
recommend a 386 with a VGA monitor.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

## CLEAN.DOC

```
                          CLEAN.DOC, ver. 1.0
                          (c)1993 EFD Systems

CLEAN is a small utility designed for use with ASCII text file "books" produced
for TXTBook and GRFBook.  This utility will "clean up" the ASCII output from
some word processors in order to make them more fully compatible with TXTBook
and GRFBook.  This utility does three things:

1) Converts all "soft" carriage returns to "hard" carriage returns.  Some word
processors insist on using only a "soft" return (ASCII char. 13 only) at the end
of lines and reserve a "hard" carriage return (ASCII char. 13, char. 10 pair)
for use only at the end of paragraphs.

2) Expands all Tabs (ASCII char. 9) into an equivalent number of spaces.  The
actual number of spaces can be specified by the user.  8 is the default.

3) Removes all control codes (form feeds, etc.) from the file.  These should not
exist in an ASCII file but some word processors may insert them anyway.

To use this utility type : CLEAN myfile.txt [spaces]
"myfile.txt' is the name of the ASCII file that you wish to clean up.  Output
will always be written to myfile.ASC.  "spaces" is an optional number of spaces
to be used for a TAB, 8 is the default.  Hopefully, you will never need to use
this utility but it has been included just in case any problems develop.

## CRYPT.DOC

```
                            CRYPT, Ver. 1.0 (c) 1993
                        EFD Systems, All Rights Reserved

CRYPT is a simple file encryption utility designed to produce reasonably secure
documents which can only be read using TXTBook or GRFBook.  To use CRYPT, type:

                       CRYPT filename [password] /T or /G

              Example: CRYPT yourfile gobbldygook /T

"Password" is an optional user specified character string of 16 characters or
less.  A default password is built-in; however, security is greatly enhanced if
a password known only to the document's author is specified.  Either /T or /G
must be specified to indicate that the encrypted file will be used with either
(T)XTBook or (G)RFBook.  Encrypted output is written to either "filename.CRT"
(TXTBook file) or "filename.CRG" (GRFBook file).  A small index file,
"filename.NDX", is also produced as output.  This index file is less than 3k in
size, typically much less.  The encrypted text file and it's index must always
be distributed as a pair if the text is to be properly de-crypted and displayed
on the screen.  This file pair can be renamed as you see fit; however, text file
and index must always share the same name, varying only by file extension.  The
index file must always carry a .NDX extension.
```

## INDEX.DOC

{% raw %}
```
                      INDEX, ver. 1.5 (c)1993 EFD Systems
                              All Rights Reserved

INDEX is a simple (and somewhat crude) utility designed to help compile a
standard word/page type index or a table of contents for TXTBook and GRFBook
documents.  This utility can be used interactively, to index one word at a time,
or in batch mode by using DOS redirection to read and write to and from files.
Most word processors (WordPerfect, WordStar, etc.) have built-in features to
perform these tasks.  These built-in features are probably more convenient and
should be used if available; otherwise, use this utility.


* INTERACTIVE MODE

To use this utility interactively, type:  INDEX bookname.txt options

'bookname.txt' is the name of the ASCII document file.  Options MUST designate
the document type, either "T" (TXTBook file, 24 lines/pg), or "G" (GRFBook file,
29 lines/pg).  Option "E" can be added to echo as output the lines found
containing the given index word.

EXAMPLES:  INDEX mybook.doc g     (GRFBook file)
           INDEX mybook.doc te    (TXTBook file, echo lines)

In interactive mode, the user is prompted to enter each word to be indexed one
at a time.   Type "END" to exit the utility and return to DOS.


* BATCH MODE

Batch mode makes use of DOS redirection to read/write to/from files instead of
reading the keyboard and writing to the screen.  For batch mode use type:

                  INDEX bookname.txt options <wordlist >output

Wordlist is an ASCII file containing a list of the words that you wish to index,
one word per line.  Use "END" as the last word in the list, otherwise; the
program will hang at the end of the file waiting for input and you will have to
re-boot the computer since keyboard input is no longer recognized.  Output is
the name of the file that you wish to send the index results to.  "<" and ">"
are DOS redirection symbols.  See your DOS manual if you need more details on
DOS re-direction.  Note that the time required to index each word increases with
the size of the file.


* BUILDING A WORD/PAGE INDEX

This utility is a general purpose tool which can be used in a variety of
different ways depending upon the user's needs, preferences, skills and
imagination.  For example, to create a standard back-of-the-book word/page index
for a GRFBook document, any of the following options could be used.

Option 1

Use INDEX interactively by typing:

                               INDEX mybook.txt g

Manually type each word to be indexed.  Results are displayed on the screen and
must be manually copied or printed with the DOS Print Screen key.  After the
index has been built, edit the document file and manually add the index
information.  This option is good for short, simple documents.

Option 2

Use your editor/word processor to prepare an ASCII file containing a list of the
words you wish to index, one word per line.  Use DOS redirection to pipe the
prepared word list into INDEX.  Use DOS redirection again to send results out to
yet another file.  The command line should look something like this:

                   INDEX mybook.txt g <words.lst >results.txt

Use your editor to dress up the results stored in 'results.txt' and then merge
results.txt into the document using your editor; or, use the DOS copy command to
append results.txt to the end of the document file like this:

                     COPY mybook.txt+results.txt mybook.txt

This option is better for long documents.

Option 3

Any combination of the above options is also possible.  You can read a word list
from a file but display the results to the screen like this :

                         INDEX mybook.txt g <words.lst

Likewise, you can enter words interactively while re-directing the results to a
file like this :
                        INDEX mybook.txt g >results.txt


* BUILDING A TABLE OF CONTENTS

The [E]CHO option can be put to good use to help build a table of contents for a
document.  As you are preparing the document, use any unique character or string
of characters to mark the section headings that you would like to list as
entries in the table.  For example, in this document, an asterisk marks each
section heading.  Leave a blank page(s) in the document as a place holder for
the table of contents.  This is essential if you are to avoid changing all of
the document page numbers when the table of contents is merged in.  When the
document is almost finished, use INDEX with echo to find the unique character or
string and display the section headings followed by a comma and the heading page
number.

This file provides an example.  Exit to DOS now and type : INDEX index.doc ge
When prompted for a word to index, type an asterisk, [*], and press [ENTER].
Each heading, followed by it's page number, should be echoed to the screen.  As
was the case earlier, results can be re-directed to a file.  This allows the
table of contents to be refined and then merged into the actual document.  To
re-direct the table, use a command line similiar to this:

                         INDEX mybook.txt ge >table.txt


* NOTES

- To get a feel for how this utilty works, practice using it on this file.
  Start INDEX in interactive, GRFBook, echo mode by typing:

                               INDEX INDEX.DOC ge

  When prompted for the word to index, type: '*' <enter>.  A list of the major
  headings for this document (which all begin with '*') should be displayed on
  the screen.  Type: END <enter> to exit.

- Unique characters for identifying section headings and preparing a table of
  contents can be placed out of sight beyond column 80 and left in place as part
  of the document.

- Words are indexed without regard to capitalization (case-insensitive).

- Only exact matching words are indexed.  For example, SUPERSTITION is not
  considered to be a match for the index word SUPER.

- In interactive mode, all input is accepted on the top line of the screen. This
  may initially be somewhat confusing since the cursor is always located where
  the next output will take place.

- See TXTBOOK.DOC or GRFBOOK.DOC for license and disclaimer information.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

CLEAN is a small utility designed for use with ASCII text file "books" produced
for TXTBook and GRFBook.  This utility will "clean up" the ASCII output from
some word processors in order to make them more fully compatible with TXTBook
and GRFBook.  This utility does three things:

1) Converts any "soft" carriage returns to "hard" carriage returns.  Some word

of lines and reserve a "hard" carriage return (ASCII char. 13, char. 10 pair)
for use only at the end of paragraphs.

2) Expands any Tabs (ASCII char. 8 ) into an equivalent number of spaces.  The
actual number of spaces can be specified by the user.  8 is the default.

3) Removes any control codes (form feeds, etc.) from the file.  These should not
exist in an ASCII file but some word processors may insert them anyway.

To use this utility type : CLEAN myfile.txt [spaces]
"myfile.txt' is the name of the ASCII file that you wish to clean up.  Output
will always be written to myfile.ASC.  "spaces" is an optional number of spaces
to be used for a tab.  8 is the default.  Hopefully, you will never need to use
this utility but it has been included just in case any problems develop.

                              (c)1993, EFD Systems

TXTIndex is a simple (and somewhat crude) utility that helps an author compile a
standard word/page type index for TXTBook "books".  This utility can be used
interactively to index one word at a time or, by using DOS redirection, input
and output can be re-directed to/from files for batch mode operation.

Interactive Mode

To use the utility interactively type:  TXTIndex bookname
Bookname is the name of the "book" text file.  In this mode the user is prompted for one word at a time.  Type "END"
to exit the utility and return to DOS.

Batch Mode

To use the utility in batch mode type : TXTIndex bookname <wordlist >output
Wordlist is an ASCII file containing a list of the words that you wish to index,
one word per line.  Use "END" as the last word in the list, otherwise; the
program may hang when it comes to the end of the file.  Output is the name of
the file that you wish to send the index results to.  "<" and ">" are DOS
redirection symbols.  See your DOS manual for details.  Due to the simplist
algorithm used, this utility can take quite some time to index a large file.
