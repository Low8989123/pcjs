Block Breaker  Version 1.2

To install "Block Braker", resister BLOCK.EXE from the Program Manager menu.
After invoking "Block Breaker", please refer to "Help".


Major differences from the last version (Version 1.1)

Fixed the bug that the ball sometimes passed through Gold Block.
Fixed the bug that the reflection of the ball was unnatural.
Added "Help" on the menu.
