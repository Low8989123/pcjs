                            BOLO ADVENTURES 1.0

                            by William Soleau

                        Requires EGA and Brain Power


         Welcome to Bolo Adventures.  The game tests your problem
         solving abilities.  There are 40 floors (puzzles) which you
         must solve.

             On each floor, you have a man (BOLO), who tries to finds
         his way to the stairs, which will take him to the next level.
         The stairs are always protected by either monsters, lasers,
         snakes, blocks, balls, electric grills, water...etc...  Each
         floor has at least one solution to free Bolo from the confines
         of the room.  Some floors have many solutions, others only one.
         How many can you find?


             There are many different objects you'll see as you play.
         Some will help you, some won't, the only way to discover what
         they do is to test them out.  You can attempt the same room as
         many times as you want.  If you're stumped, then go to another
         room and come back later.

**NOTE** When first playing the game, run the Demo program to get a feel
         for how the game is played.  Press <D> from the Main Menu.


                            Some of the Objects
                            --------------------


         Boxes:     You can push these around the room to stop lasers,
                    monsters, make paths through water...?

         Balls:     You can roll these around to the room to stop lasers,
                    monsters, float in water...?

         Invisible
           Grills:  Makes your man invisible. (but not from the hazards)

         Electric
           Grills:  These fry you on contact!

           Lazers:  What do you think?

         Monsters:  These will electrocute you!
         & Snakes..

           Others:  There are many other objects which will assist you
                    in reaching the stairs.  You will learn the game
                    in a matter of minutes, but some floors will take
                    you hours.  The best way to learn is just to play.
                    Mr. Bolo is waiting!!!

                          -----------------

                               Scoring
                               -------

         You will notice at the bottom of the screen a score total
         running as you play the game.  When you have completed a
         puzzle, this score will be put in your personal scoreboard.
         This means that even after you've completed a puzzle (floor),
         you can try to better your point total.

         The score is computed by the number of balls and blocks left
         on the floor when you reach the stairs.  Also by the amount
         of moves with Mr. Bolo.  There are a few other variables which
         finally will compute your final score.  These variables include
         things like the number of times (snakes..if present on floor)
         burn up in the hot grills)  Needless to say, the more balls &
         blocks left on the floor and the least number of moves will
         count for a higher score.  Each player is asked to enter their
         own initials for the computer to create a personal score card
         when the game begins.  Once you've entered your initials, the
         game will have a record of all your high scores and attempts
         at each floor every time you play the game.


              This game is distributed as Shareware.  If you find this
         program worthy of your game collection and play it regularly,
         then a $12.00 registration fee is requested.  This registration
         will speed up the loading and exiting of the game.  Any single
         registration for any one of my games, will mean you get reduced
         prices for any of my other Shareware programs (There over 40).
         I'll send you full descriptions and details.  The registration
         can be found at the closing screen or in the file BOLO_REG.doc.

         the Shareware market.

                they flip down ramps, and put them into the proper columns
                to get points.  As the game progresses the tiles come
                faster & faster! Unlimited levels.  This is a challenging
                game for all!
 

   **********************************************************************


        Since you read down this far, I'll give you some
        hints for Bolo Adventures:


        If you don't want any, go right to the game NOW, or else read
        on......





                                    Hints





              While I won't give away any secrets, these are things you
         should be aware of.

         1.  Watch which way the currents are running in the water.
         2.  Sometimes the hardest looking puzzles actually have a
             very simple solution. Look at everything!
         3.  Avoid pushing blocks and balls against the edges of the
             room where you can't use them.
         4.  Mostly use the balls to stop lazers instead of blocks.
             Blocks are more versatile as you'll discover.
         5.  Nah....  that's enough........

             ENJOY......................

                                Version 1.0

                            by William Soleau

                        Requires EGA and Brain Power


         Here we go again!  40 more floors of the Bolo Adventures.


         Welcome to Bolo Adventures II.  The game tests your problem
         solving abilities.  There are 40 floors (puzzles) which you
         must solve.

             On each floor, you have a man (BOLO), who tries to finds
         his way to the stairs, which will take him to the next level.
         The stairs are always protected by either monsters, lazers,
         snakes, blocks, balls, electric grills, water...etc...  Each
         floor has at least one solution to free Bolo from the confines
         of the room.  Some floors have many solutions, others only one.
         How many can you find?


             There are many different objects you'll see as you play.
         Some will help you, some won't, the only way to discover what
         they do is to test them out.  You can attempt the same room as
         many times as you want.  If you're stumped, then go to another
         room and come back later.

**NOTE** When first playing the game, run the Demo program to get a feel
         for how the game is played.  Press <D> from the Main Menu.


                            Some of the Objects
                            --------------------


         Boxes:     You can push these around the room to stop lazers,
                    monsters, make paths through water...?

         Balls:     You can roll these around to the room to stop lazers,
                    monsters, float in water...?

         Invisible
           Grills:  Makes your man invisible. (but not from the hazards)

         Electric
           Grills:  These fry you on contact!

           Lazers:  What do you think?

         Monsters:  These will electrocute you!
         & Snakes..

           Others:  There are many other objects which will assist you
                    in reaching the stairs.  You will learn the game
                    in a matter of minutes, but some floors will take
                    you hours.  The best way to learn is just to play.
                    Mr. Bolo is waiting!!!

            <Q>uit        :    Main Menu  (quits program)

            <Esc>         :    Will bring up menus for selection
                               Quit/Give up/Main menu...



                               Scoring
                               -------

         You will notice at the bottom of the screen a score total
         running as you play the game.  When you have completed a
         puzzle, this score will be put in your personal scoreboard.
         This means that even after you've completed a puzzle (floor),
         you can try to better your point total.

         The score is computed by the number of balls and blocks left
         on the floor when you reach the stairs.  Also by the amount
         of moves with Mr. Bolo.  There are a few other variables which
         finally will compute your final score.  These variables include
         things like the number of times (snakes..if present on floor)
         burn up in the hot grills)  Needless to say, the more balls &
         blocks left on the floor and the least number of moves will
         count for a higher score.  Each player is asked to enter their
         own initials for the computer to create a personal score card
         when the game begins.  Once you've entered your initials, the
         game will have a record of all your high scores and attempts
         at each floor every time you play the game.


              This game is distributed as Shareware.  If you find this
         program worthy of your game collection and play it regularly,
         then a $12.00 registration fee is requested.  This registration
         will speed up the loading and exiting of the game.  Any single
         registration for any one of my games, will mean you get reduced
         prices for any of my other Shareware programs (There over 40).
         I'll send you full descriptions and details.  The registration
         can be found at the closing screen or in the file BOLO_REG.doc.

   **********************************************************************


        Since you read down this far, I'll give you some
        hints for Bolo Adventures:


        If you don't want any, go right to the game NOW, or else read
        on......





                                    Hints





              While I won't give away any secrets, these are things you
         should be aware of.

         1.  Watch which way the currents are running in the water.
         2.  Sometimes the hardest looking puzzles actually have a
             very simple solution. Look at everything!
         3.  Avoid pushing blocks and balls against the edges of the
             room where you can't use them.
         4.  Mostly use the balls to stop lazers instead of blocks.
             Blocks are more versatile as you'll discover.
         5.  Nah....  that's enough........

             ENJOY......................

compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed

by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word in the program
description.  A new utility, Narc, is implemented so you can look at the
program files and the author's on-line documentation without having to
first copy the program to your hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and
Narc, you can quickly find the program you want and review it to be
sure, without ever having to run it from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

Author Registration: $12.00 ($18.00 for Parts 1 & II)                   
Special Requirements: EGA.                                              
                                                                        
THE BOLO ADVENTURES is a series of forty arcade-like game puzzles       
involving an assortment of objects such as balls, blocks, laser beams,  
electric grills, monsters, snakes, bumpers, rivers, boats, etc.  Each   
game is an obstacle course that needs to be solved, in which you must   
use your logic and ingenuity in order to reach the end.  Some boards    
have multiple solutions, others only have one.  It may take hours just  
to solve one game puzzle, but it is quite challenging when competing    
against another player.  Your score is based upon the number of moves   
you made, the number of tries to solve the puzzle board, and the number 
of objects left on the screen.  Any game ends when you get stuck or     
electrocuted.                                                           
Program Title: Bolo Adventures Part II                                  
Author Version: 1.0                                                     
Author Registration: $12.00 ($18.00 for Parts I & II)                   
Special Requirements: EGA.                                              
                                                                        
You are Bolo and you're trapped in 40 floors of monsters, lasers,       
snakes, electric grills, and other assorted bad stuff in this arcade-   
style game. But unlike arcade games, BOLO ADVENTURES isn't a contest of 
how fast you can acquire carpal tunnel syndrome by hammering on your    
keyboard; it's a test of your resourcefulness. In BOLO, you use items   
from the game field to create your escape. Move blocks to block laser   
beams, place giant balls over water hazards, and use any of the game    
objects to quite literally "construct" your escape. There may be many   
different escapes from a floor, or just one. BOLO really tests your     
ingenuity. It seems that in many of today's games, little more than     
senseless violence is taught. A case could be made that this game       
actually helps build problem solving skills. It may be too tough for    
youngsters, but its definitely great for teens and adults.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
