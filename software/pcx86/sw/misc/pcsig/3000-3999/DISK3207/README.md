"This CD finally makes it possi ble to conserve your disk space and paper,
yet still have all the information you need to make an informed decision,"
said Kent.

All new and updated programs have been reviewed and tested by PC-SIG. Every
program goes through extensive virus checking using the most recent version
of VIRUSCAN from McAfee Associates, and other anti-virus software.
According to Kent, "In the ten ye ars we've distributed shareware, we have
never had a confirmed report of a virus on any of our distributed programs
or CD-ROMs."

               CMV.DOC       - Calliope documentation
               REGISTER.FRM  - Registration form
(Not included) CALLIOPE.SAV  - "Saved" session filename (created by the user)
               ROL2MIDI.EXE  - Conversion utility program
               STANDARD.BNK  - Instrument file (needed for .ROL conversion)
               *.ROL         - "Practice" .ROL files
               *.MDI         - Several "ready-to-play" midi music files

               VENDOR.DOC    - Vendor distribution agreement

Note: A music file with the extension ".ROL" is an Adlib format sound file.
".ROL"   files may be found on almost any Bulletin Board system or  may  be
purchased from many of the shareware distributors.  "ROL" files are usually
accompanied by a BANK file (i.e., STANDARD.BNK).   Bank files hold the data
for  the various instruments used by the music file.   A BANK file will  be
required in order to perform conversions from ROL to MDI format.   Once you
have  converted  to  MDI format,  the BANK files  are  no  longer  reuired.

In  case you don't read any further,  note that you may use any key on  the
command  line  as a switch to bypass the opening screen:  i.e.,   "CMV  X".

------------------
ABOUT THIS PROGRAM: (...and how to create music files)
------------------

Thank you for trying CALLIOPE MUSIC VISION (CMV).  This program was created
for use with a Sound Blaster sound board.   It will play single track  Midi
compatible music files.  Included with CALLIOPE is a program (ROL2MIDI.EXE)
which  allows  you  to easily convert a .ROL file into  a  Midi  compatible
(.MDI) file, which is a type 0 midi.   CALLIOPE IS NOT CRIPPLED IN ANY WAY.

To convert any .ROL file to MIDI format you will need the following:

 1 - The .ROL file(s) to be converted into MDI format.
 2 - The BANK file (instrument file, i.e., STARDARD.BNK, BIGBANK.BNK, etc.)

 Then do the following from the DOS prompt:

   C>ROL2MIDI filename /Bbankfile /Onewfile

   for example, to convert ROCKNROL.ROL to ROCKNROL.MDI using the
   STANDARD instrument bankfile: (.ROL files require Instrument bank files)

   C>ROL2MIDI rocknrol.rol /Bstandard.bnk /Orocknrol.mdi

   Note: Case is sensitive.

The  resulting  file is the only format that CALLIOPE  will  recognize  and
play.   MDI files do not require Bank (.BNK)  or instrument files once they
have been converted from their .ROL format into single track Midi's.    All
of  the  musical information is self contained in a  single  compact  file.

Several  pre-converted  files are included so that you may  experience  the
"Sight and Sound" of CALLIOPE immediately.  Simply copy all of the CALLIOPE
files  into  a  separate  directory  and  type  CMV  (then  press   ENTER).

IF YOU DECIDE TO REGISTER, YOU WILL RECEIVE OVER 100 PRECONVERTED FILES.

---------------------
HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
---------------------

    o  An IBM PC/XT/AT/386/486 or true "compatible" running
       MS-DOS or PC-DOS 3.0 or later.

    o  528K System Memory.

    o  CGA/EGA/VGA Video Adaptor.
       Note that screen activity may be sluggish on a CGA equipped
       XT system.

    o  One floppy disk drive or hard drive.

    o  A Sound Blaster Sound board.

    NOTE: No "drivers" are required to run CMV.

----------
BACKGROUND:
----------

Like  many  others before me,  when I first purchased my  sound  board,   I
rediscovered all of my old games which supported sound, and seemingly my PC
was  a whole new thing again.   Then,  I became interested in  the  board's
ability to play music (or simulate playing music).

Most of the available music players were good, but I found that I wanted to
know more about the music that was playing...not just the filename and it's
size.    I  also  wanted a display that was  dynamic  rather  than  static,
something  that presented me with lots of information,  and I  wanted  more
control of the file selection process too.

But there were so many music formats...rol's, mid's, mod's, cmf's and more.
For some reason "Midi"  music appealed to me,  but programs that play  Midi
music  were  mostly  for  multiple track Midi's  (.MID  files  -  Type  1).

Single  track  Midi's (.MDI - Type 0)  can be created  from  existing  .ROL
files.   There must be a "bizillion" rol files in the world, so this format
already   has   a   large  base  of  available   music   to   support   it.

Those are some of the reasons CALLIOPE was created.   Here is a list of the
features that CALLIOPE will provide.   I hope you like them well enough  to
make CALLIOPE your favorite Music Player.

--------
FEATURES:
--------

     MAIN FEATURES:

  -  Play up to 1000 songs, start to finish.
  -  Play a single song from the command line.
  -  Play any number of songs continuously.  
  -  Execute single or double replays instantly, or delayed.
  -  Save your session to a disk file.
  -  View the music names in the Queue.
  -  Play a "saved" session.
  -  Screen Saver option 

  File Selection Via a Popup scrolling window, plus:
  --------------------------------------------------

  -  Sort files by Name, Size or Date.
  -  Tag or un-tag single files or ALL files.
  -  Support for 1000 tagged files.

  A Play-Mode screen which provides the following information:
  -----------------------------------------------------------

  -  Shows the amount of available conventional memory.
  -  The I/O port address and IRQ location of your sound board.
  -  Name of the current directory and or sub-directory.
  -  Name of the music currently playing displayed in a scrolling panel.
  -  Name of the next three music files that are in the Music Queue.
  -  The total number of selections that you have made.
  -  The number of selections remaining to be played.
  -  The number of the current selection.
  -  The elapsed time for the current selection.
  -  The number of loops played if Music-Loop mode is active.
  -  The ESTIMATED time for all remaining songs to be played.
  -  The status of the AutoReplay toggle.
  -  The status of the MusicLOOP toggle.

     Note that the word ESTIMATED is emphasized.  Time estimates are
     based on an average-bytes-per-minute and readjust for each new song.
     It may be off by plus or minus 5 minutes (or more).  It's only an
     estimate.  Also note that all number counts STOP during a REPLAY and
     continue when regular play is resummed.

  File Buffer Information:
  -----------------------

  -  The current size of the buffer.
  -  The byte currently being processed in the buffer (ascending).
  -  The percentage of the buffer already processed.
  -  The mode of the current music: MELODIC or PERCUSSIVE.

  A Status window to advise you of any changes:
  --------------------------------------------
  -  The Status Window will keep you advised of program changes or errors.
  -  In addition, the lower portion of the Status Window will advise you
     if AutoReplay is active or not, since it is a delayed command.
  -  Plus various symbols to provide an alternate measure of music duration.
  -  Pointer-bar graphics across the top 2 rows track the music duration and
     the session duration.

  Active Play Controls are as follows:
  -----------------------------------

  -  Pause the music.
  -  Continue music from a paused state.
  -  Skip the current music (immediate).
  -  Interrupt music and Replay the CURRENT song.  This may be INSTANTLY
     or DELAYED and SINGLE or DOUBLE plays.
  -  Music-Loop mode locks the entire session in for continuous replay.
     This is also a reversable TOGGLE command.
  -  Cancel music play mode and return to the Main Menu.
  -  Cancel music play mode and return to the File Selection Window.
  -  During a REPLAY you may Pause, Continue, Exit or Cancel the REPLAY.
  -  Determine the song in the "nth" Queue position (upto the 9th position)

-----------------
CALLIOPE COMMANDS:
-----------------

I  tried to make CALLIOPE as intuitive as possible so that you can  use  it
"right out of the box".   However,  all software should contain at least  a
brief   explanation   of   the  available  commands,   so   here   it   is:

When  CALLIOPE is first invoked,  the file selection window will popup  and
search the current directory for all files with an extension of .MDI,   and
will  present  a list of these files within this window.   If  no  matching
files  are  found,  CALLIOPE will notify you of this via  a  popup  message
window,   allowing you to return to the DOS prompt.   While the  files  are
displayed, you may scroll the window up or down to view, select or deselect
files. Selected files are marked with a Musical Note symbol for easy recog-
nition.

--------------------
COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:
--------------------

You may play a single song from the command line by typing the program name
followed by a space, and the FULL name of the selection.   For example,  to
listen to RAINYDAY.MDI,  simply type CMV RAINYDAY.MDI (you must include the
MDI extension with the filename).  Upon completion, you will be returned to
the  DOS prompt.*  IMPORTANT NOTE:  If for some reason you exit  the  music
before it's completion and you find that a "stray" note refuses to end, you
may type "CMV RESET" from the command line to "kill"  the noise.   You will
be  returned  to the DOS prompt immediately after  CALLIOPE  silences  your
speakers or headphones.  *If you misspell "MDI" CMV will do a normal start.

As mentioned earlier, any single alphanumeric character on the command line
will allow you to bypass the opening screen ie.,  "cmv z", where "z" may be
any printable letter or number.

----------------
ALT + M Command: - File Selection Window:
----------------

The File Selection Window will AUTOMATICALLY POP-UP upon first invocation
of the program.  On slower machines, this may take a second or two.  Other-
wise, you may activate the File Selection Window by type Alt-M.

-------------------------------
FILE (Music) SELECTION COMMANDS: (While the File Selection Window is active)
-------------------------------

NOTE:  YOU MUST "TAG" A FILE IN ORDER TO PLAY IT UNLESS YOU ARE PLAYING A
SINGLE SELECTION FROM THE COMMAND LINE OR A "SAVED" SESSION.

Tag  one file at a time by pressing the RIGHT ARROW key,  or <Shift>  RIGHT
ARROW key.   Unshifted,  the highlighted bar will move down one file  after
each tag.   Shifted,  it will move up one file.  Un-tag is exactly the same
except using the LEFT ARROW key.

<Num  Lock> will produce the same effect as <Shift> Left or  Right  arrows.

Tag  all files using <Ctrl> RIGHT ARROW,  and un-tag all files with  <Ctrl>
LEFT ARROW.

Pressing RETURN after selecting files will immediately begin the Play  mode
and music will start.  If you press Escape after making a selection(s), the
selected files will be abandoned and you will be returned to the main menu.

Additionally, if you press RETURN without selecting any files, you will be
returned to the main menu.

----------
SORT FILES:
----------

Sorting is easy, just pick a number (as follows):

    1 = Sort by filename.
    2 = Sort by file size.
    3 = Sort by file date.

----------------
ALT + S Command: - Toggle the Request-To-Save
----------------

After selecting music from the File Selection Window, CALLIOPE will ask you
if  you wish to save the music to disk so that you may replay  them  later.
If you do not wish to be asked this question each time you make selections,
then press "Alt+S" to turn the "Save-Request" OFF.  You may toggle it ON or
OFF as desired.

If  the above command is "ON",  and you respond by pressing "Y"  (for  YES)
when  asked  to save your session,  a file will be created in  the  current
directory with the name "CALLIOPE.SAV".   This file will hold the names  of
all  of  the currently selected songs plus a count of the total  number  of
songs  in the file.   CAUTION:  IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A SAVED SESSION IN  THE
CURRENT DIRECTORY,  IT WILL BE OVERWRITTEN IF YOU RESPOND WITH "Y"   (YES).

After the file hs been sucessfully saved, your current selections will play
immediately.

If you do not wish to save the current session, you may press "N" (NO), or
simply press the ENTER key since "NO" is the default choice.

----------------
ALT + L Command: - Load a SAVED session from disk
----------------

To play a saved session,  start CALLIOPE then press ESCape to exit from the
File  Window,   then  type ALT + L.   The  music  will  start  immediately.

When  you press ALT + L,  Calliope will search the current directory for  a
file named "CALLIOPE.SAV".   If the file is not found, an error window will
be displayed.   If the file IS found,  the music  filenames will be  played
without hesitation.   

CAUTION: IF ANY OF THE FILES ARE MISSING, CALLIOPE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE
THE PROBLEM AND CONTINUE.   HOWEVER ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, SO IF THE PROGRAM   
STALLS, CHECK FOR MISSING FILES. IF CALLIOPE IS ABLE TO HANDLE THE FILENAME
ERROR ,OBVIOUSLY YOU WILL NOT HEAR THE MISSING SELECTION(S), BUT THE STATUS
WINDOW WILL DISPLAY  A "FILENAME MISSING"  MESSAGE  AND PLAY  WILL CONTINUE 
WITH THE NEXT SELECTION IN THE  QUEUE  IF ANY. (The error message will give
you the name of the missing file so that you may take corrective action).

          During Music Play, the following commands are available:
          -------------------------------------------------------

-------------
PAUSE Command: (P)
-------------

Pressing  "P"  will temporarily PAUSE the current music.   While  PAUSE  is
active,   the  CONTINUE command is highlighted and other commands  will  be
visually de-emphasized.   The elapsed time display will be blocked however,
the time will continue to count-down in the background.

NOTE:  Occasionally, when you select the PAUSE command, it may get stuck on
a note that refuses to be silent.  If this happens, use the "C"  command to
CONTINUE  and  then use the "P"  command again until the sound  fades  out.

----------------
CONTINUE Command: (C)
----------------

Pressing "C"  will CONTINUE music, or reverse a PAUSE command.   Music will
resume playing from the point that it was PAUSED.  If "C" fails, then press
the SPACEBAR.

------------
SKIP Command: (S - or you may press the Spacebar)
------------

Pressing "S"  will terminate the current music and will play the next music
in  the queue immediately.   You may also use this command to move  to  the
next song if the current song gets "stuck"  or just stops playing (probably
a corrupt file).   Skip is not available during REPLAY.  You may also press
the SpaceBar to invoke this command.

The term "skip" in this instance  means that  the music was aborted during
play rather than actually "skipped over" before being heard.

--------------
REPLAY Command: (R) - Single INSTANT Replay
--------------
     - or -
-------------------
DOUBLE PLAY Command: (D) - Double INSTANT Replay
-------------------

Pressing "R"  or "D" will instantly REPLAY the current music.   The program
will  bring  you  to  the INSTANT REPLAY screen,  and  you  will  have  the
opportunity  to Pause/Continue the REPLAY as you do in regular  play  mode.
You cannot select the REPLAY Command (R or D)  if AutoREPLAY (A or T)   are
currently active.  If you do, the word "C O N F L I C T" will quickly flash
in  the  Status  Window.    This is to remind you  that  you  have  already
requested a delayed REPLAY for the current selection.  If you must hear the
music again NOW,  then press "A"  or "T"  to deactivate automatic mode  and
then   press   "R"   or  "D"   for  Instant  SINGLE   or   DOUBLE   REPLAY.

Note  that if you decide to Exit the Replay screen with "X",  you  will  be
returned to the Main Menu, and any unheard selections will be lost.   Press
"Z" if you only want to cancel the current Replay.

------------------
AUTOReplay Command: (A) - DELAYED Single Replay.
------------------
     - or -
--------------
TWO-auto-PLAY's: (T) - DELAYED Double Replay. 
--------------

Pressing "A"  will invoke the AutoREPLAY Mode.   In this mode,  the current
song  is "flagged"  for REPLAY upon it's completion in regular  play  mode.
While the song is playing,  you may cancel or reinvoke AutoREPLAY as  often
as you wish by simply press "A".

Pressing  "A"  will toggle AutoREPLAY to an ON or OFF state.   You will  be
advised  of  it's current status on the bottom line of the  Status  Window.
All  of the same conditions found in the REPLAY screen apply here as  well.

"T"  is identical to "A"  (AUTOPLAY),  but will replay the selection TWICE.
The "T" command may be toggled ON or OFF at any time.  While "T" is active,
you cannot use the "H" (HIDE) command (explained later) or the "A" command.

---------------
ELAPSED Command: (E) - display the elaped session time.
---------------

-----------------
"Z" CANCEL REPLAY: (Z) - Cancel a Replay (During the Replay)
------------------

After a Replay has started,  you may wish to cancel it while it is playing.
Use  the "Z"  command for this.   Valid only during an Instant  or  Delayed
Replays.

-----------------
MUSICLOOP Command: (M) - Play the current selections forever.
-----------------

Pressing "M" will invoke the MusicLOOP play mode.  In this mode, the entire
music session will be replayed continously without interruption.   While in
this mode,  all of the other commands are still available unless your  have
invoked the "H" Hide command to blank the screen.

Pressing  "M"  will toggle MusicLOOP to an ON or OFF state.   You  will  be
advised  of  it's  current status on the bottom line of  the  screen.    In
addition,  the current Loop Number will be displayed.  Pressing "F"  or "X"
will  also terminate the MusicLOOP mode.   While MusicLoop is active,   the
Session  Tracking  graphic at the top of the screen  will  be  deactivated.
However, "Current Music" Tracking will continue.

------------
HIDE COMMAND: (H) - Screen Saver for "marathon" MusicLoops.
------------

Pressing "H"  will blank the screen provided that MusicLoop is ACTIVE.   To
return to your normal display simply press any key.   Note that you  cannot
invoke  the  Hide  command  if  a  Single  or  Double  Replay  is  pending.
This command will prevent phosper burn-in in case you fall asleep with your
earphones on and wake up on Thursday.

---------------------
KEYS 4 thru 9 commands: - Looking deeper into the music queue.
---------------------

While the music is playing, the next  three songs in  the  Queue  will  be
displayed in the Queue window.  If you have selected more that three songs,
then you may press NUMBER KEYS One through Nine (1-9)  to view the name  of
the song which currently occupies THAT position in the queue, up to the 9th
selection.

---------------------------
FILE WINDOW  [Exit] Command: (F)
---------------------------

Pressing "F" will terminate CALLIOPE's music play mode and return you to to
the  FILE SELECTION WINDOW where you may select more songs to play or  exit
to  the  Main  Menu.   This command will  terminate  MusicLOOP  if  active.

------------
EXIT Command: (X - or you may press the ESCape Key)
------------

Pressing  "X"  will shut down CALLIOPE's music play mode and return you  to
the  main menu.   On the other hand,  when the last song has  been  played,
CALLIOPE will exit the Play Mode and return you to the main menu.   At that
point  the,   the File Selection Window will pop-up  automatically.    This
command will terminate MusicLOOP if active.   You may also press the Escape
key to invoke this command.

-------------------
ENDING THE PROGRAM: (ESC - from main menu)
-------------------

Pressing  ESCape from the main menu will terminate CALLIOPE and return  you
to the DOS prompt (assuming the File Selection Window was not active).   If
the File Selection Window is active, pressing ESCape 3 times will terminate
CALLIOPE,   and  return you to the DOS prompt while displaying  a  low  key
share- ware screen and session statistics.

------
ERRORS:
------

If the Status Window displays "FILENAME.MDI Missing",  then THAT  selection
could  not be found in the current directory,  and as a result was  skipped
over.  This could happen if you erase or rename one or more song files from
your  CALLIOPE Directory  and subsequently LOAD a "Saved"  session.    When
CALLIOPE looks for the missing file to load and play...Oops.., but CALLIOPE
is smart enough to handle most errors of this type and will simply continue 
with the next selection.   The Status Window will advise you of the name of   
the missing file if this type of error ever occurs.

If a music file gets "stuck" at it's termination point and attempts to loop
itself and start over, CALLIOPE will force it to terminate, and display the
message "filename was PUSHED" in the status window.  "PUSHED"  means it was
forced  off  of the queue by the CALLIOPE Police who constantly  watch  for
this   sort   of   behavior.    Most  likely  you  will   never   see   it.

                             Some important notes:

 o  If the length of your path is exceeds 18 characters, only the last
    18 characters will be displayed.

 o  All graphics are text based and therefore do not require a VGA monitor.
    However, the program was created on a system with a VGA monitor.

 o  A music file larger that 65,520K will force an error condition, in
    which case you will be advised and returned to the main menu.

 o  Sometimes when a music file suddenly stops playing, it may be corrupt.
    Reconvert it from your original .ROL file and try again.

 o  CMV was created on a 386 16Mhz system, running DOS 5.0 with 640k
    memory.  The sound card was a Sound Blaster v1.5 (original).
    Programming language: QuickBasic version 4.5

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
