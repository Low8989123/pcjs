This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
900 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'INSTALL' at
the DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy
access to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.  All the programs are logically divided into thirteen
major categories with subcategories, making it easier to find just the
right software.

All of the programs have been scanned for viruses.  There are also three
online virus utilities that can be run from the CD-ROM which will scan,
screen and clean viruses.  Not only does this save hard disk space, but
also gives every user added security from viruses.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

Winner of the Optical Publishing Assn's Best Consumer Product Award.

Shareware for every imaginable need: Accounting Chemistry Educational
Engineering Games Hypertext Networks Programming Spreadsheets Utilities
Word Processing

Additional BBS file descriptions are available from PC-SIG so that the
CD-ROM can be set up quickly on a bulletin board.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 530K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
a graphics monitor (Hercules/EGA/VGA/SVGA).  A mouse is optional.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.


                      The PC-SIG Games CD-ROM
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now you can play a game a day fo over a year.  This CD-ROM is jammed
with over 380 shareware games of all types, designed to appeal to the
new generation of CD-ROM users out for fun.  The CD incorporates a
hypermedia interface and allows 250 of the games to be played directly
from the CD-ROM.

The hottest games in shareware are on this disk, including the
action/arcade games "Jill of the Jungle" and "Wolfenstein 3D," which
rival or surpass commercial PC and Nintendo for use of animation,
SoundBlaster audio, and VGA graphics.  There are also games designed to
teach children mathematics, spelling and even ecology.  All these games
for less than a dime each!

Over 250 of the games can be played directly from the CD without copying
them to a floppy or a hard drive.  Being able to run from the CD means
that users can explore games without using up valuable hard disk space
or spending time downloading and deleting files.  The hypermedia
interface makes it easy to browse the titles, read a one line
description or full review, and copy or start a game by clicking the
mouse or using the keyboard.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Outside the U.S.A. call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer in

                            --------------------------
                            SHAREWARE AND REGISTRATION
                            --------------------------

   SEE is SPONSORED SOFTWARE.  This means that you can use unregistered copies
   (i.e. those with advertising for products other than SEE in the INFO
   pull-down menu) free of charge and share complete, unaltered copies with
   your friends and associates.  It also means that informative advertisements
   pop up from time to time.

   "SEE Executive" is nearly identical to the sponsored version of SEE -- but
   without the advertisements.  "SEE Executive" is NOT shareware and may NOT
   be passed around.  For ordering information, see the file SEE.FRM.



                         -------------------------------
                         UPGRADING FROM EARLIER VERSIONS
                         -------------------------------

   The configuration file (SEE.CFG) is compatible with the configuration file
   from the previous version of SEE (v2.01, included in "The SEE Utilities
   Version 2.20").  So if you have a configuration file from version 2.01 of
   SEE, it will still work.  Nevertheless, you should run SEESETUP to see if
   there are any new configuration items you would like to change.

   The "SEE" program was previously accompanied by some other utilities. The
   GETKEY program is still included in the SEE package.  GETKEY is "freeware"
   and may be given away as long as it is not altered in any way.  The GO-MENU
   program is available in Pinnacle Software's "GO" product, while the other
   utilities (MIDNIGHT, SV) will be issued separately, at a later date, in a
   different utilities collection.



                                  --------------
                                  WHAT IS "SEE"?
                                  --------------

   SEE is a utility for viewing and printing text files. It can also display
   hex files in a format that makes it easy for you to visually scan the file.
   SEE's small size and low price (i.e. free for the Sponsor-Supported
   Software version; $12 for the Executive version) makes it ideal for
   inclusion with other software, so that the user can read the documentation
   files.

   SEE also lets you extract portions of text from the listing.  The extracted
   portion can be copied to the printer or to a text file.

   ===                                                                     ===
   ===                           HOW TO USE "SEE"                          ===
   ===                                                                     ===
   ===========================================================================


                                 -----------
                                 STARTING UP
                                 -----------

   At the DOS command prompt, enter SEE followed by the name of the file you
   want to view.  For example, the command:

   SEE SEE.DOC

   would display the file named SEE.DOC.

   SEE automatically detects the type of file being viewed and selects the
   appropriate display mode (text or hex).


   ---------
   WILDCARDS
   ---------

   If you specify a "DOS Wildcard", you will see a menu of file names that
   match. You can move the cursor to the file you want by using your arrow
   keys, then press Enter to see the file.

   For example:

   SEE *.INF

   would show you all files with the extension INF.

   If you omit any file specification, SEE assumes you mean *.* so that the
   following command would let you select from all files in the current
   directory:

   SEE


   -----------------------
   CROSS-DIRECTORY VIEWING
   -----------------------

   SEE normally looks for the files in your current drive and directory.
   However, you can look at another drive or directory by specifying the path
   name accordingly, as in this example:

   SEE D:\MYDIR\ACCOUNTS\PAYROLL.TXT


   ----------
   MONOCHROME
   ----------

   SEE can normally detect if you have a color display card or not, but no DOS
   program can detect if your monitor can actually display color.  (Some
   people have color display cards with monochrome monitors)  If SEE is
   displaying text in color and you want to force it to display in monochrome,
   add  /M  to the file specification.  For example:

   SEE MYFILE.TXT /M

   This would display the file MYFILE.TXT in black and white.

   You can configure SEE (using the SEESETUP program) to always start up in
   monochrome mode.  This will save you the bother of always having to specify
   the /M parameter.


   -------------
   OTHER OPTIONS
   -------------

   For a description of some other options, see the online help articles
   available from SEE itself.  To view these articles, start up SEE in the
   usual way (example:  SEE SEE.DOC) then press F1.



                                  -------------
                                  READING FILES
                                  -------------


   --------------
   SCROLLING KEYS
   --------------

   Once you have selected the file you want to read, you can scroll back and
   forth in the file a line at a time, using the arrow keys.  You can also
   jump back and forth a screen at a time, using the PgUp and PgDn keys.

   The Home and End keys position the file to the beginning and end,
   respectively.

   The spacebar key moves forward one screen each time it is pressed.  When
   you reach the end of the file, you are returned to the previous operation
   (i.e. the file selection menu, if you started SEE with DOS wildcards, or
   the DOS prompt otherwise).

   The left and right-arrow keys scroll text left and right one character at a
   time.  You can use these keys in conjunction with the Ctrl key to scroll
   five characters at a time.


   ---------
   THE L KEY  --  Jump to a line
   ---------

   The L key will ask you for a line number.  It will then jump to that line,
   positioning it at the first line of the viewing area.


   ---------
   THE F KEY  --  Find text
   ---------

   The F key will ask you for a text string.  If it finds that string in the
   text, it will jump there, highlighting the line the text is on.  The line
   is positioned in the middle of the screen, if possible.

   To search for the same text again, press the F3 function key.


   -------------
   THE ALT-Y KEY  --  Textify
   -------------

   The ALT-Y key lets you filter the display of data in "binary" (non-text)
   files such that only the words (and a little bit of extraneous material)
   show up.  This is useful for scanning a program or data file for helpful
   information, while removing most of the material that is intelligible only
   to the computer.

   The textify function only works in hex display mode.  You can force SEE to
   use hex display mode by starting it up with the  /X  switch, as in this
   example:

   SEE MYFILE.DAT /X

   In most cases this will not be necessary, since SEE automatically detects
   the difference between binary and text files.
                                             

   ---------
   THE C KEY  --  Copy part or all of the file to printer or file
   ---------

   The C key sends a copy of the file (or part of it) to your printer, or to
   another file.  See the section entitled "Copying" for details.

   While using the C feature, remember that the Esc key will always return you
   to your previous operation.  If you were looking at the help screens, it
   returns you to the viewing window.  If you were viewing text, it returns
   you to the file selection menu (if you started SEE with DOS wildcards) or
   the DOS prompt otherwise.

   The Copy command asks many questions in order to determine what you want to
   do.  To save time, you can use the SEESETUP program to specify default
   values to these questions, or skip them altogether (using a preselected
   value).


   -----------------
   THE FUNCTION KEYS
   -----------------

   F 1  displays the help screens.  See "Quick Help", above, for additional
        information about these screens.

   F 2  displays a "ruler" line, which lets you determine in which column text
        starts and ends.

   F 3  repeats the last Find operation (see "The F Key", above).

   F 4  sends a page eject character (ASCII 12, Hex $0C) to the printer.  You
        can select the printer number.  By default it is printer LPT1 (or the
        default printer number specified by SEESETUP).

   F 5  switches the display to 25 lines, in monochrome.

   F 6  switches the display to 25 lines, in color.

   F 7  switches the display to smaller letters, in monochrome, if you have
        the appropriate display card.  If you have a CGA, Hercules or MCGA
        card, nothing will happen.  If you have an EGA card, you will see 43
        lines on your screen.  A VGA display card will display 50 lines.

   F 8  does what the F7 key does, but uses color instead of monochrome.

   F 9  is not used.

   F10  calls up a menu for selecting SEE functions.  This takes a little
        longer than pressing a single letter key, but is easier to remember!
        The menu also includes a Help section which explains various SEE
        capabilities.



                                     -------
                                     COPYING
                                     -------


   When you are viewing a file and you press the C (Copy) key, SEE will ask
   you a few questions, then copy part (or all) of the file to the printer, or
   to another file.

   The questions let you specify:

   PORTION:      Which part of the file (some, or all) should be copied.

   DESTINATION:  Which printer you want to print to (LPT1, LPT2 etc.) or which
                 file you want to copy to (e.g. SAVE.TXT). If the file already
                 exists, you can overwrite it, or add to the end.

   The following two questions apply to printing only:

   CONVERSION:   Whether to convert extended characters or not.

   FORM-FEED:    Whether the printer should "page eject" after printing.

   The printer questions are discussed in more detail, below.

   NOTE:  Before you start printing, make sure your printer is turned on, is
   supplied with paper, and that the "Online" light is lit.  (On some
   printers, the Online light may be labelled "Ready", or something similar.
   Refer to your printer manual if you are not sure.)

   If at any time you wish to exit from the copying process, you can press the
   Esc key.  If you were printing, you may have to turn your printer OFF for a
   moment, then ON again, to reset it and clear its memory.

   The Copy command asks many questions in order to determine what you want to
   do.  To save time, you can use the SEESETUP program to specify default
   values to these questions, or skip them altogether (using a preselected
   value).


   -------------------
   PRINTER DESTINATION
   -------------------

   When you are asked to select a printer destination, choose the address of
   the printer to which you are copying the text.  You can choose any printer
   from LPT1 to LPT9.  (It is somewhat unusual to have a printer with an
   address higher than LPT2.)

   If you are not sure, select LPT1.  Most PC-compatible computers have their
   printer at that address.  Exception:  if your computer is sharing the
   printer with other computers on a network, check with your network manager
   before proceeding.


   ----------
   CONVERSION
   ----------

   Many documents (such as this one) make use of the special characters that
   are available on IBM-PC compatible computers.  Some printers, though
   (particularly older printers and very high speed printers), can not print
   these characters properly.

   If when you print, many of the characters come out wrong, you may have to
   have them "converted".  The conversion process replaces these characters
   with a "reasonable" substitution before printing them.  (Note that this
   affects only the printing; the document you are viewing is NOT changed.)

   For example, accented letters can not be printed on all printers.  So an
   accented "e" would be printed simply as "e", with no accent.  Line-drawing
   characters (for boxes) are also a problem for some printers.  So the
   vertical line character is replaced with the standard "split bar"
   character, which looks almost the same.

   ===========================================================================


   The SEE program is set up to use reasonable values for all of its
   operations. For example, it will detect the kind of display card you have
   and choose color or monochrome mode accordingly, using the same number of
   lines per screen that you had set before you called up SEE.

   However, you may wish to change some of the selections.  You can create a
   configuration file (named SEE.CFG) using the SEESETUP configuration program
   (SEESETUP.EXE).

   When SEE starts up, it looks in the current (i.e. logged) drive and
   directory for a file named SEE.CFG.  If it does not find it there, it looks
   in the SEE home directory (i.e. where the SEE.EXE file is located) for the
   file.  If it finds the file, it uses the values it specifies.  If it does
   NOT find it (in either the logged or home directory), SEE uses reasonable
   default values that are appropriate for virtually all machines.

   To start up SEESETUP, enter SEESETUP at the DOS prompt, or select "Setup"
   on the SEE pull-down menu.  Each configuration screen can provide you with
   detailed explanations of each configuration option -- press F1 whenever you
   need additional information.

      Product: SEE  (an ideal "freebie" for vendors to ship to customers!)

     Keywords: FILE VIEW PRINT LIST UTILITY FREEWARE
  Description: SEE is a utility for viewing and printing text files. It can
               display hex files in a format that makes it easy for you to
               visually scan the file.  SEE's small size and low price (i.e.
               free for the Sponsor-Supported Software version; $12 for the
               Executive version) makes it ideal for inclusion with other
               software, so that the user can read the documentation files. 
               SEE also lets you extract portions of text from the listing. 
               The extracted portion can be copied to any printer or to a 
               text file.
     See also: Files FILE_ID.DIZ and DESC.SDI for alternative descriptions.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
