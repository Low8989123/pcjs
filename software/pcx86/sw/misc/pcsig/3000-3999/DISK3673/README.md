Testimonial:
 "There is a real need among shareware vendors for a universal
Windows Application/File installer", says Thomas Bookhamer of
Shareware Outlet Inc., a Bellevue, Washington based shareware
vendor.  "All too often our support calls revolve around customers
trying to install Windows applications without a proper Windows
installer.  For this reason, along with the fact that we will be
doing a service not only for our customers, but also the authors,
we are customizing InWin 4.0 for each Windows application we
decide to carry that does not come with a proper install routine.
Due to a lower customer frustration level the authors will see a
higher registration rate, and we will be able to to free up a
significant amount of time for product research.  Everyone will
win with InWin."
