Special Requirements: A hard drive & one HPLaserJet softfont file. HP la
                                                                        
SFWARE FONT UTILITIES gives you the tools to download, rotate, compress,
expand, view, and perform special effects on the PCL softfonts used with
your Hewlett-Packard laser printer.  SFWARE is not a collection of      
fonts, but a set of font manipulation utilities.  It can even be set up 
to access the utilities from an integrated menu system.                 
                                                                        
If you don't already know, softfonts are fonts stored in files on your  
computer and sent to the memory of your laser printer each time you turn
it on.  Downloading softfonts to a laser printer is something lots of   
programs do, but SFWARE does a lot more.  It lets you take any existing 
font and use SFWARE's special effects to create some new, eye-catching  
fonts.                                                                  
                                                                        
The special effects available through SFWARE include bold, fill, convert
to fixed spacing, halftone, hollow, invert, mirror, outline, convert to 
proportional spacing, resize, reverse, shade, shadow, slant, stripe,    
3-D, hollow-3-D, and filled-3-D effects.  The effects can be tailored   
and combined in countless ways.  For example, you could take an existing
18-point Times font and make it hollow, slant it, and put a 3-D shadow  
behind it.  Before you actually use these fonts you can view them       
on-screen, or print reference sheets.                                   
                                                                        
Another added feature is the ability to use fonts on older HP laser     
printers.  Older printers don't normally support compressed fonts, but  
SFWARE can expand them for easy use.  In addition, for older HP printers
that won't do this automatically, SFWARE can change a portrait font to  
landscape.  This is a quick, easy way to create a big font collection   
from a small set of fonts.

1. Introduction

The Sfware softfont utilities from Small Planet Software are MS-DOS programs
distributed under a shareware license agreement. These utilities provide
extensive font manipulation capabilities for HP LaserJet softfonts.

The Sfware utilities allow you to download, rotate, compress, expand, view,
and perform special effects on softfonts. The effects provided include bold,
fill, convert to fixed spacing, halftone, hollow, invert, mirror, outline,
convert to proportional spacing, resize, reverse, shade, shadow, slant,
stripe, three-d, hollow-three-d, and filled-three-d. The effects can be
tailored and customized for any font with various parameters and shading
patterns. All of these features are provided by a set of standalone utilities.
The utilities have a standardized interface to make learning how to use them
as painless as possible.  Additionally, the features are available through an
integrated menu interface. The menu interface is provided by the SfShell
program. SfShell is described in another manual---this manual documents the
standalone utilities.

1.1. Getting Started

Sfware is ``shareware,'' and the author encourages archive maintainers to post
Sfware for downloading; you may have received your copy from almost anywhere
and almost anyone. Please make sure that you have a complete distribution
before you try to install Sfware.

1.1.1. Hardware Requirements

In order to use Sfware, you will need a PC, PS/2, or close compatible with
150KB or so of free memory. A hard disk is recommended, but not required. A
LaserJet+ or compatible printer is not actually required, but Sfware is
probably a little pointless without one! Note:  the original LaserJet printer
does not have the ability to use softfonts; the Sfware utilities cannot help
you use fonts with the original LaserJet printer.

If you want to use the SfShell program, you will need 300-400KB of free memory
and either a hard disk, a ram disk, or sufficient expanded memory for
swapping. You cannot use a removable (floppy) drive for swapping. The shell is
not required for any of the features available in Sfware, but it does provide
a user-interface for the Sfware utilities that is less intimidating than the
command line.

If you are running a version of DOS prior to 3.30, read the configuration
section carefully since you may have to do a little more work to get Sfware
installed.

1.1.2. Software Requirements

In addition to Sfware, you must have at least one HP LaserJet softfont file.

1.1.3. Packing List

Sfware is distributed in four archive files. The archives are named SFWverP1,
SFWverP2, SFWverD1, and SFWverD2. In each file, the ver is replaced by the
Sfware version number. Every archive contains a file called PACKING.xx that
lists the files that should be present in the archive.Please make sure that
you have complete archives before you proceed to install Sfware.

The ``P'' archives contain the Sfware programs and both are required in order
to install Sfware. The ``D'' archives contain documentation. The ``D1''
archive documents the SfShell interface, the ``D2'' archive documents the
individual utilities. Please refer to the file PRINTDOC in SFWverP1 for
instructions describing how to print the documentation.

1.2. Installation

1.2.1. Making Backups

Like any software package, it is always advisable to make backup copies of the
distribution diskettes or distribution archives. This is especially important
if you use an ``on the fly'' compression program to compress executable files
(e.g. PkLite). Sfware cannot be registered after it has been compressed---you
will need the original programs in order to register Sfware. There is no
compelling reason not to compress the programs after you have registered them.

1.2.2. Hard Drive Installation

Create a subdirectory on your hard drive for the Sfware utilities; it does not
matter what drive you install onto or what you name the directory.For the
purpose of this manual, the directory D:\SF is assumed.

Copy all of the files from the distribution diskette (or from the
distribution archive) into the Sfware directory.

1.2.3. Floppy Disk Installation

Copy all of the files from the distribution diskette (or from the distribution
archive) onto a floppy disk. This manual assumes that Sfware has been
installed in the directory D:\SF but it is not necessary to install Sfware
onto a hard disk.

Due to space limitations on floppy disks, it may not be possible to place all
of the files on a single diskette. If is the case, it is recommended that you
put SFSHELL.EXE and SFSHELL.HLP, on one floppy and all of the other utilities
on a second floppy. If you do not plan to use the shell, you will not need the
SfShell files on a diskette.

If you use a floppy-only system, you will only be able to use the SfShell
program if you have sufficient expanded memory (EMS) for SfShell to use a
swapping space when it runs the other utility programs.SfShell requires either
sufficient EMS or a non-removable disk for swapping.

Splitting the Sfware utilities across two floppies does not present any real
technical difficulties (aside from the location of swapping space) but you
should read the Configuration chapter carefully to make sure that you have set
things up properly. In particular, you will need to tell SfShell where the
utility programs are located.

1.3. Initial Configuration

Before you can use Sfware, you must run SfConfig to establish an initial
configuration.Please follow the `quick start' instructions in the READ.ME file
or read the Configuration chapter before trying to run Sfware.
2. Conventions Used in This Manual

The standalone utilities have a steeper learning curve than the SfShell
interface.However, if you are comfortable with command line utilities in
general, the Sfware utilities should not be too difficult to master.  The
advantages of mastering the learning curve are that the Sfware utilities have
a few more options when used from the command line than they do from within
the shell and the command line utilities allow you to work with groups of
files efficiently.

In terms of getting something done, all of the command line utilities are run
in the same general way. Basically, you type:

        UTILITY some-parameters some-options

wherever you type DOS commands (This is generally the DOS prompt, but many
user-friendly interfaces to DOS exist and if you are using one of them, you
can type these commands wherever you would type any general DOS command (like
DIR or WP).) .

The sections that follow will describe the conventions used in this manual for
describing what some-parameters and some-options are and how to enter them.

2.1. Typographic convensions

2.1.1. typewriter

Typewriter type is used within this manual to denote explicit words or
commands or filenames that you type exactly the way they appear in this
manual. In this manual, FRUIT means you type ``F'' ``R'' ``U'' ``I'' ``T'' ,
whereas a fruit (italics are described below) might mean apple, or pear, or
any specific fruit.

2.1.2. italics

Italics are used to name a general ``class'' of things. If a command in this
manual contains a word in italics, you should replace that word with a
concrete example of ``one of those things'' when you type the command. For
example, a fontname in this manual means any valid, existing softfont; you
should type the name of an existing font file.

Occasionally, italics are used for emphasis (as they are in general
typography) but it will be clear from the context when that is the case.

2.1.3. [[ brackets ]]

The stylized square brackets denote optional parameters. You should only type
what appears within the brackets when you want to use the associated optional
feature.

2.2. Semantic convensions

2.2.1. Parameter

Parameters are additional input, given on the command line, that you are
required to enter. You cannot omit any parameters.

2.2.2. Option

Options are additional input, given on the command line, that you are not
required to enter. You can omit any or all options.

2.2.3. filemask

A filemask is any valid DOS filename that may contain wildcard characters.The
wildcard characters are interpreted exactly the way that DOS interprets
them.Consult your DOS reference if you are unsure about what constitutes a
valid filename or how you can use wildcard characters to select groups of
files.

2.2.4. filename

A filename is any valid DOS filename. A filename must name a single specific
file, it cannot contain wildcard characters.

2.2.5. fontmask

A fontmask is exactly like a filemask except that it must name one or more
softfont files. The files whose names match a fontmask should contain LaserJet
softfonts.

2.2.6. fontname

A fontname is exactly like a filename except that it must name a LaserJet
softfont.

2.2.7. outname or outmask

An outname or outmask is any valid DOS filename or filemask. The file(s)
specified for an outname or outmask will be created if they do not exist. In
most cases, existing files with the same name will be replaced if they exist
(the replace option determines whether or not confirmation is required before
replacing an existing file).

When an outmask is used to decide what the name of each output file should be,
the Sfware utilities perform the same filename resolution stratagy that DOS
uses. First, any uses of `*' within the outmask are resolved to a string of
`?'s. Then each character from the input filename is compared against the
character at the same position in the outmask. If the outmask contains a `?'
at that position, the character from the input filename is used for that
position in the output filename. Otherwise the character from the outmask is
used in the output filename.

2.3. How parameters and options are used

Parameters and options come in two flavors: those with associated values
and those without. Parameters (or options) without associated values are
either present or absent; that provides all that is required to interpret
the option. The /w option on the DOS DIR command is an example of a
parameter without an associated value. If the /w option is present, it
means print a wide directory listing; if it's absent, don't print a wide
directory listing. Many Sfware utilities have parameters (or options)
without associated values.

Parameters (or options) that do have associated values have the general form:

        /parameter-name:value

In this case, parameters (or options) are introduced by a forward slash and
separated from the value by a colon. Spaces are not allowed anywhere in the
parameter-name or the value.

In the descriptions of parameters and options that have values associated with
them, the sample value given in the description tries to indicate what kind of
value is expected. These fall into four general categories:filenames or
fontnames, numbers, patterns, and ranges.  Filenames and fontnames are
described above, patterns are described in the pattern chapter, and ranges are
described in the range chapter. Numbers are indicated by # or % in the command
description. Numbers indicated by % should be in the range 0-100.

Parameters and options can be abbreviated to their shortest unambiguous
name.For example, the /device:filename option can be abbreviated to
/d:filename if no other option begins with ``d''. (It could also be
abbreviated to /de, /dev, etc.)

2.4. Common Options

There are a handful of options that almost all of the Sfware utilities
share.These options and their meanings are described below. Every utility
indicates whether or not it accepts these options without repeating the
description each time. This convention, in conjunction with the conventions
mentioned above, makes the process of describing each utility much easier and
directs the reader more precisely to the information that is specific to each
utility.

2.4.1. /@:

The /@ option specifies an input filename. The input file contains Sfware
commands.The format of the input file is discussed in the configuration
chapter.

2.4.2. /!:

The /!option specifies a message filename. If a message filename is given, the
Sfware utilities will write warning and error messages to this file.It is used
primarily by the SfShell program to capture error and completion messages.

2.4.3. /$

The /$ option displays registration information for the Sfware utilities.  If
you are using an unregistered program, this information will be displayed
automatically.Please register your shareware!

2.4.4. /replace

If the /replace option is used, existing files will be replaced without
warning.Not surprisingly, this option is only available on utilities that
create files. If the /replace option is not used, then the utility may or may
not replace files without warning depending on the setting of the ``replace''
option in the configuration file. Please consult the chapter on configuration
files for more information about the replace configuration variable.

2.4.5. /verbose

All of the Sfware utilities print regular progress messages. The /verbose
option causes many utilities to print more detailed progress messages.

2.4.6. /quiet

The /quiet option suppresses some informative messages. For example, the
/quiet option will suppress the %-complete messages in SfLoad.

2.4.7. Technically Speaking

Many chapters end with a ``technically speaking'' section. This section
describes, more technically, what Sfware does. You don't have to read it
unless you want to. If you find the material in the technically speaking
sections intimidating, just ignore it. On the other hand, if you find that
something is not performing exactly the way that you thought it was supposed
to, this section may help you figure out why Sfware is doing something other
than what you expected.

The ``real'' technically speaking section of this chapter concerns the
``switch character'' used to introduce command-line options and parameters.

Because it was easy to implement, Sfware can be told to accept either the
forward slash (``/'') or the hyphen (``-'') as the switch character.  This
is controlled by the ``SwitchChar'' configuration parameter.

If you use the hyphen as the switch character, you cannot enter any filename
that contains a hyphen because the hyphen will be interpreted as the start of
another option. However, you can switch between switch characters on the
command-line. If you enter /- when the foward slash is the switch character,
the hyphen becomes the switch character and, conversely, if you enter -/ when
the hyphen is the switch character, the forward slash becomes the switch
character.
3. Configuring Sfware and Using Command Files

In order to make Sfware easier to use, all of the programs read a
configuration file each time they are executed. This configuration file gives
you the flexibility to assign default values to many of the options and
parameters of each program.

3.1. Name of the configuration file

All of the utilities can share the same configuration file. However, rather
than hardcoding the name of the configuration file, Sfware relies on the
existance of a DOS environment variable to determine the name of the
configuration file. Each Sfware utility expects the DOS environment variable
SFCFG to name the complete drive, path, and filename of a suitable
configuration file. For example, if you make a configuration file called
SF.CFG and you put it in the D:\SF directory, the DOS command SET
SFCFG=D:\SF\SF.CFG would be appropriate.

If the DOS environment variable SFCFG is undefined, each of the utilities
looks for a configuration file with the same name as its executable file and
the extension .CFG. For example, SFFX.EXE looks for SFFX.CFG.

3.1.1. Special note for DOS 2.xx users

In versions of DOS prior to version 3.xx, it was not possible for a program to
find out the name or directory of its executable file.  If SFCFG is undefined,
the utilities will look in the current directory for configuration files. It
is especially important to define SFCFG if you are not using DOS 3.xx or
later.

3.2. Using SfConfig

Frequently, the most difficult part of installing new software is the task of
configuring it to work correctly in your system. This may be true of Sfware as
well. In an effort to make the initial configuration as painless as possible,
Sfware comes with the SfConfig program.  SfConfig should be run after the
SFCFG environment variable, discussed above, has been set.

SfConfig will create a configuration file initialized with appropriate
defaults and allow you to select, interactively, the laser printer that you
use, the print device that you use, and name of your softfont directory.These
are the most site-specific configuration options.

SfConfig can be run again to change any one of these values; it will not
change anything else in the configuration file that you have changed
manually since the first time that you used SfConfig.

The following three settings can be made from within SfConfig:

3.2.1. Laser Printer

The Laser printer selection helps Sfware decide if font compression should be
enabled. Later versions of Sfware may make more use of this option.

3.2.2. Printer Output

The most common selection for printer output is LPT1. However, you can select
LPT1-4, PRN, or any valid file or device for printer output.

3.2.3. Font Directory

Most users keep all of their softfonts in one directory. If this is the case,
you can tell Sfware always to look for fonts in that directory regardless of
what directory you are currently in. This becomes the default font directory.
However, even if you do select a default font directory, you can still
override it and use any directory you want by selecting a new directory with
``F4'' in SfShell or by specifying a fontdir on the command line.

3.3. Format of the configuration file

The configuration file is a plain ASCII text file, and it should be edited
with a program that will not insert extra formatting characters when the file
is saved (I recommend Multi-Edit by American Cybernetics).

Each line of the configuration file is divided into three parts as follows:

programid parameter=value

The programid is seperated from the parameter by one or more spaces and the
parameter is separated from the value by an equal sign (=).

The programid is optional but the parameter and the value are required
(actually, the value can technically be empty or blank but that is exactly
the same as not defining it at all).

Individual Sfware programs use the combination of programid and parameter as a
key to lookup the default value of each parameter. Any configuration line that
does not contain a programid automatically matches all programid's for that
parameter. Case is insignificant in the programid and parameter.

A simple example should make everything clearer. Given the following
configuration file:

        PROG APPLE=1
        PROG ORANGE=2
        APPLE=3
        OTHER ORANGE=4

The value of PROG APPLE is 1, PROG ORANGE is 2, ANYTHING-ELSE APPLE is 3,
OTHER ORANGE is 4, and ANYTHING-ELSE ORANGE is undefined (blank, or
non-existant).

Each possible configuration parameter is described in the sections that
follow.The section header lists only the parameter if the programid is the
name of the utility program that uses it. For configuration parameters that
make special use of the programid, both parts are listed.  The parameters are
listed in alphabetical order by parameter.

3.4. Compress

Usage: program COMPRESS=YES or NO
Used by: SfFx, SfRotate

The Sfware utilities that write new softfont files use this flag to determine
if the softfonts should be written in PCL4/5 compressed format or in the
older, non-compressed format. Compression can produce very dramatic decreases
in the amount of disk space required for a softfont.However, the compressed
fonts are only recognized by LaserJet printers that are PCL4 compatible. The
LaserJet Series II is not PCL4 compatible.Note, however, that the Sfware
utilities provide for decompression ``on the fly'' in most cases. Please
consult the section about downloading fonts for more information.

3.5. Device

Usage: program DEVICE=filename
Used by: SfLoad, SfShow

Names the output device for Sfware utilities that interact directly with the
printer. The most common value is LPT1, but any DOS file or device name may be
used.

3.6. Esc

Usage: program ESC=YES or NO
Used by: SfDir

Controls how SfDir displays font information. If ESC is YES, escape sequences
are displayed by default. Otherwise a readable, text description is displayed
by default.

3.7. FontDir

Usage: program FONTDIR=directory
Used by: SfShell, SfCmpr, SfFx, SfLoad, SfRotate, SfShow

Names the DOS subdirectory where HP LaserJet softfonts are located. This is
the default input and output directory for Sfware utilities that read or write
softfont files.

3.8. FontExtn

Usage: program FONTEXTN=ext
Used by: SfShell, SfCmpr, SfFx, SfLoad, SfRotate, SfShow

Names the default filename extension for softfont files. If you specify either
an input softfont name or an output softfont name that does not include an
extension, the Sfware utilities will append this extension to the filename.
Note: it is possible to specify that a file should not have any extension by
ending the filename with a period.

3.9. GraphBack

Usage: program GRAPHBACK=number
Used by: SfShell, SfView

Controls the background color in graphics mode. The following colors can be
used (they must be selected by number): 0=black, 1=blue, 2=green, 3=cyan,
4=red, 5=magenta, 6=brown, 7=light gray, 8=dark gray, 9=light blue, 10=light
green, 11=light cyan, 12=light red, 13=light magenta, 14=yellow, and 15=white.

3.10. GraphCard

Usage: program GRAPHCARD=cardname
Used by: SfShell, SfView

Tells SfShell what kind of graphics card you are using. By default, SfShell
tries to determine what kind of graphics card you have and adjust
accordingly.However, if it makes the wrong choice, you can force SfShell to
select one of the following: CGA, MCGA, VGA, EGA, EGA64, EGAMONO, IBM8514,
ATT, HERC, and PC3270.

A complete list of available graphics resolutions for each card/mode is
available under the section on ``GraphMode''.

3.11. GraphForg

Usage: program GRAPHFORG=number
Used by: SfShell, SfView

Controls the foreground color in graphics mode.

3.12. GraphGrid

Usage: program GRAPHGRID=number
Used by: SfShell, SfView

Controls the color of the gridlines in the graphics display.

3.13. GraphMode

Usage: program GRAPHMODE=number
Used by: SfShell, SfView

Controls the graphics mode number for the selected graphics card. It is
impossible for SfShell to know if you have selected a reasonable graphics
mode. The results of using an incorrect or invalid graphics mode are undefined
(and unpredictable!).

The following table lists all of the graphics cards and the modes
associated with them. In general, it is not necessary to specify a graphics
mode since the highest resolution mode is selected by default:

    Card    |  Mode   | Resolution          | Palette
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
    CGA     |  0      | 320x200             | 0
    CGA     |  1      | 320x200             | 1
    CGA     |  2      | 320x200             | 2
    CGA     |  3      | 640x200             | 3
    CGA     |  4      | 640x200 (default)   | 2 colr
    MCGA    |  0      | 320x200             | 0
    MCGA    |  1      | 320x200             | 1
    MCGA    |  2      | 320x200             | 2
    MCGA    |  3      | 320x200             | 3
    MCGA    |  4      | 320x200             | 2 colr
    MCGA    |  5      | 640x480 (default)   | 2 colr
    EGA     |  0      | 640x200             | 16 colr
    EGA     |  1      | 640x350 (default)   | 16 colr
    EGA64   |  0      | 640x200             | 16 colr
    EGA64   |  1      | 640x350 (default)   | 4 colr
    EGAMONO |  3      | 640x350 (default)   | 2 colr
    HERC    |  0      | 720x348 (default)   | 2 colr
    ATT     |  0      | 320x200             | 0
    ATT     |  1      | 320x200             | 1
    ATT     |  2      | 320x200             | 2
    ATT     |  3      | 320x200             | 3
    ATT     |  4      | 640x200             | 2 colr
    ATT     |  5      | 640x400 (default)   | 2 colr
    VGA     |  0      | 640x200             | 16 colr
    VGA     |  1      | 640x350             | 16 colr
    VGA     |  2      | 640x480 (default)   | 16 colr
    PC3270  |  0      | 720x350 (default)   | 2 colr
    IBM8514 |  0      | 640x480             | 256 colr
    IBM8514 |  1      | 1024x768 (default)  | 256 colr
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

3.14. Numbers

Usage: program NUMBERS=base
Used by: SfShow

The numbers parameter is used by SfShow to select the numeric base of the
numbers printed around the reference grid. Valid options are hex, oct, dec,
and none for hexadecimal (base 16), octal (base 8), decimal (base 10) and
no reference numbers respectively. The default value is hex.

3.15. Pattern name

Usage: PATTERN name=pattern-string
Used by: SfShell, SfFx

The pattern programid introduces named patterns. Any pattern that you plan to
use more than once or that is very complex should probably be saved in the
configuration file. There is a whole chapter devoted to patterns and pattern
strings. Please consult that chapter for more information about patterns.

The pattern created in the pattern chapter could be saved in the configuration
file with the name zig-zag by placing the following line in the configuration
file:

        PATTERN ZIG-ZAG=0;34;85;136

3.16. Quiet

Usage: program QUIET=YES or NO
Used by: SfDir

Controls the degree of verboseness of messages from SfDir. In the future,
other utilities may use this flag for the same purpose.

3.17. RefSet

Usage: program REFSET=symbol-set
Used by: SfShow

If the reference set is defined, the reference character for each position in
the font will be printed in the upper right hand corner of each cell on
SfShow's grid. For example, setting sfshow refset=8u would make SfShow print
the reference characters with the 8U symbol set.You must select a symbol set
that is available in your laser printer's line-printer font. If you don't want
reference characters to be printed, use sfshow refset=none.

3.18. Replace

Usage: program REPLACE=YES or NO
Used by: SfCmpr, SfFx, SfLoad, SfRotate, SfShow

Each of the Sfware programs that can create new files use this flag to
determine if existing files should be destroyed without warning. If you set
this flag to YES, you can shoot yourself in the foot; if you leave it NO, the
Sfware utilities will always make sure the safety is on!

3.19. Sentence

Usage: program SENTENCE=string
Used by: SfShell, SfView, SfShow

Identifies the sentence to be displayed on graphical font preview screens and
printed on the reference page. The default sentence is: The quick red fox
jumped over the lazy brown dog. I said (very loudly), ``THE QUICK RED FOX
JUMPED OVER THE LAZY BROWN DOG!'' How many times?0, 1, 2, or 3456789 times.

3.20. SwitchChar

Usage: program SWITCHCHAR=char
Used by: SfShell, SfCmpr, SfFx, SfLoad, SfRotate, SfShow, SfView, SfInfo

Identifies the switch character. It must be set to either ``/'' or ``-''.Under
MS-DOS, ``/'' is recommended. For more information about the uses of the
switch character, consult the ``technically speaking'' note at the end of the
Conventions chapter.

3.21. Style name

Usage: STYLE name=number
Used by: SfShell, SfShow, SfFx

The ``style'' of a softfont is one of the font parameters that is used to
distinguish between two otherwise identical softfonts. The values defined
by HP are ``upright,'' ``italic'' and ``oblique.'' Using SfFx to create
variations on a font can potentially create two fonts that are
indistinguishable from each other. For example, ``hollowing'' a softfont
does not change any of its font characteristics. The STYLE parameter tells
the SfFx what style value to use in the font header for each effect. In
this way, the printer will always be able to tell the old and new fonts
apart.  The name of the style must be one of the following: Bold, Fix,
Fill, Fill3d, HalfTone, Hollow, Hollow3d, Invert, Mirror, OutLine, Prop,
Resize, Reverse, Shade, Shadow, Stripe, Threed, and Tilt. The style value
can be any number between 0 and 255.If the effect changes some other
characteristic of the font, it is not necessary to change the style; this
is indicated with a style value of 0.

3.22. Typefaces

Usage: program TYPEFACES=filename
Used by: SfShell, SfInfo, SfShow, SfDir

The typefaces parameter names the file that lists typeface names. Every
softfont has a typeface number. A name is associated with each typeface
number; this is the name displayed by SfShell in the typeface column, and by
SfInfo, SfShow and SfDir. Because the number of typefaces is growing and is
subject to change, you can supply an additional typeface list that identifies
any and all typeface numbers. Sfware is distributed with the file
TYPEFACES.LST that contains all of the Hewlett Packard typeface names defined
as of PCL5. If you have an old or non-standard softfont, this name may not
accurately reflect the style of the characters contained in the font.

The typefaces file is a plain text file. Each line should begin with a
typeface number (typeface numbers 0 through 511 are valid as of PCL5; earlier
printers only recognize typefaces numbered 0 through 255).  The rest of the
line is the typeface name. Lines that begin with a semicolon are ignored. The
typeface numbers must be entered, one per line, in ascending order.

3.23. Sample File

This is a sample configuration file. This sample does not contain all of the
possible configuration variables because many require defaults that are
system-specific (graphics cards, program filenames, etc.) and many repetitious
lines have been deleted.

3.24. Command Files

The standalone utilities, whether they are run from the command line directly
or invoked automatically by SfShell, accept all of their input on the command
line. Since this imposes a severe limit on the amount of input that can be
provided, the utilities also accept input from a command file.

SfShell creates a command file automatically to communicate with the
standalone utilities and you can use them outside of SfShell, but
understanding what they are and how they work is not important to using
Sfware.Feel free to skip this section.

The standalone utilities accept the name of the command file on the
/@:filename option.

If a command file is used, the utility will read commands from the file as
if they were typed as parameters. The format of the command file is simple:
each line should begin with an asterisk followed by the name of the utility
followed by a space. The rest of each line is interpreted exactly as if it
were typed on the command line.  Because each line identifies which utility
it is for, the same command file can be passed to several utilites. Each
utility will only use the lines that are intended for it.

For example, the command file below downloads several fonts:

*sfload tr* /expand *sfload tr* /expand /landscape *sfload logo.sfp /expand

If this command file is saved as AUTOLOAD.CMD, I would tell SfLoad to execute
it by entering:

        SFLOAD /@:AUTOLOAD.CMD

In general, this ability is of little use beyond downloading fonts (every
morning, for example). However, the SfShell program makes extensive use of
this feature to pass parameters to child processes when it executes the
individual utilities to perform actions for the user.
4. SFLOAD: Downloading Fonts

The SfLoad program downloads fonts to the LaserJet printer. Downloading fonts
``teaches'' the LaserJet printer how to print a particular font.

4.1. Usage

        SFLOAD fontmask [[options]]

4.2. Options

4.2.1. /image

Downloading a softfont as an image has two advantages: first, it is the
fastest method and second, it should work for softfont formats that the Sfware
utilities are not otherwise equipped to handle. For example, if a new laserjet
printer, the Series IV perhaps, is developed with a new kind of softfont,
downloading will continue to work with that new printer as long as you select
the image option. The image option is the default.

If the image option is so great, why would I use anything else?  Good
question.There are two possible reasons. First, softfonts, especially large
softfonts, take up a lot of disk space. The LaserJet IIP, III, and IIIP
printers all support softfont compression (which provides substantial disk
space savings for large softfonts). However, the LaserJet Series II printer
does not support compression. If you have a LaserJet Series II printer and you
always use Sfware to download your softfonts, you can still take advantage of
the substantial space savings of softfont compression: compress all of your
softfonts on disk and expand them when they are downloaded. You can't use the
image option if you want to expand them when they are downloaded.

In a similar manner, softfonts can be rotated as they are downloaded if your
laser printer does not support auto-rotation of fonts.

4.2.2. /expand

When the expand option is used, softfonts that are in PCL4 compressed format
are expanded as they are being downloaded to the printer. This allows you to
keep compressed softfonts on disk even if your printer does not support
softfont compression.

4.2.3. /compress

When the compress option is used, softfonts are compressed using the PCL4
compression format as they are being downloaded to the printer.  I can't think
of a single good reason to use this option. It is provided only to satisfy the
author's compulsive desire to provide the greatest possible flexibility.

4.2.4. /portrait

The portrait option rotates the softfont to portrait orientation before
downloading it.This option has no effect if the font is already portrait.

4.2.5. /landscape

The landscape option rotates the softfont to landscape orientation before
downloading it. This option has no effect if the font is already landscape.

Note:downloading both orientations does not imply that you will be able to use
both orientations on the same page. The LaserJet Series II printer, for
example, cannot print both portrait and landscape fonts on the same page.

4.2.6. /temp

The temp option specifies that downloaded fonts should be made
temporary.SfLoad usually makes fonts permanent. Note: temporary fonts are
automatically deleted every time a printer reset command is used so this
option is of limited usefullness.

4.2.7. /id:#

The id option sets the starting font-id number. The default font-id is
zero.Every font must have a unique id number; if more than one font matches
the fontmask, the first font will have the specified id and every subsequent
font will have an id number one greater than it's predecessor.

4.2.8. /device:filename

The /device option specifies the output device. The output device is most
frequently LPT1. SfLoad uses the specified filename (which may name a device)
as the destination for downloaded fonts.

4.2.9. Other Options

The SfShow program accepts the /@, /!, /replace, /quiet, /verbose, and /$
options.
5. SFFX: Special Effects

Because they are many and varied, each special effect is described in its own
chapter (later in this document). All of the effects are produced by the SfFx
program. All of the effects are created in the same general way; basically you
enter:

        SFFX fontmask outmask effect-name effect-parameters effect-options

The font masks select which font(s) will be used as the source and destination
fonts.The effect-name indicates which effect to perform.

The SfFx program accepts the /@, /!, /replace, /quiet, /verbose, and /$
options.

Every effect with the exception of the proportional and fixed spacing effects
also accepts the /range parameter.

An online summary of the parameters and options of each effect is available by
typing SFFX HELP effect. You can also type SFFX HELP /RANGE and SFFX HELP
/PATTERN.

In the following chapters, where each effect is discussed, there are no
examples of the effects because it was necessary to limit the number of fonts
used in this document. This reflects a limitation in some LaserJet printers
that prohibits printing more than sixteen different fonts on a given page.

A second document called EXAMPLES.PCL is included in the Sfware
distribution.This file contains examples of some of the effects that are
possible.The corresponding document EXAMPL16.PCL is provided for those
printers that cannot print more than sixteen fonts per page.

Technically, every character within a softfont is defined within a
rectangle.The rectangle is subdivided into squares like a sheet of graph
paper.Inside the rectangle, some of the squares are black and some are white.
Because the squares are very small, the effect of printing them on a sheet of
paper is that they form the lines and curves that make up each charcter. In
the descriptions of effects that follow, it is sometimes necessary to describe
the way that ``squares'' within the rectangle are manipulated. The region of
the grid that defines the character (the black dots on the ``graph paper'') is
referred to as either the black area or the foreground, and the other
``squares'' are referred to as the white area or the background.

5.1. Ranges

Because the range option is available on almost every effect, it is described
once here rather than repeating it for every effect.

The range option is available on all of the effects except proportional and
fixed spacing. Specifying a range limits an effect to certain, specific
characters. For example, you could limit the range of an effect to all of the
uppercase letters.

The range command comes in three flavors:

5.1.1. /range:c-c

This is the ``letter-to-letter'' syntax, i.e. /range:a-z limits the scope to
the lowercase alphabet, /range:A-E limits it to the uppercase letters A, B, C,
D, and E.

5.1.2. /range:nn-nn

This is the ``ascii value-to-ascii value'' syntax, i.e. /range:33-47 limits
the scope to the punctuation symbols between ``!'' and ``/'', inclusive.  In
this syntax, the ascii value must be padded with zeros to make it at least two
digits long. For example, the range ``/range:0-9'' is in letter-to-letter form
and limits the scope to the decimal digits, ascii values 48 to 57, inclusive.
The range ``/range:00-09'' limits the scope to the control characters NUL to
HT (tab).

5.1.3. Mixed forms

The forms can be mixed, /range:00-@ limits the scope of the effect to the
first sixty-five ascii values, the null character (ascii 0) to @ or 00 to 64.

The range effect is limited to a specific, contiguous subset of the ASCII
character set. That is, you can specify any single range but you cannot
specify an ``exception range'' (e.g. do all the characters except the
lowercase letters) or two or more discontiguous ranges (e.g.  do all the upper
case letters and all the lower case letters).

5.2. Technically Speaking

Most fonts do not contain a real blank space character. The LaserJet printer
moves over by the default HMI everytime it encounters a character that does
not exist in the current font; most fonts rely on the fact that the default
HMI is exactly one space wide. This can create an unpleasant, choppy
appearance if a special effect (e.g.  halftoning) is applied that modifies the
white background of each character.

The SfFx program accepts the special option ``/_'' to correct this problem.The
``/_'' option forces SfFx to create a physical blank space character if the
font does not already contain one.
6. SFCMPR: Compressing Fonts

Compression, available in the LaserJet IIP and subsequent printers, allows you
to keep softfonts in a compressed format on disk. For fonts with large point
sizes, this can achieve a very significant space savings.

6.1. Usage

        SFCMPR fontmask [[options]]

6.2. Options

6.2.1. outmask

If an outmask is not specified, the input fontname will be used (i.e.by
default, SfCmpr replaces the input font with a compressed or expanded version
of the same font).

6.2.2. /expand

The /expand option expands compressed fonts. If the input font is not
compressed, this option has no effect. If neither /expand nor /compress are
specified, /compress is assumed.

6.2.3. /compress

The /compress option compresses fonts. If the input font is already
compressed, this option has no effect. If neither /expand nor /compress are
specified, /compress is assumed. Only PCL4 compatible LaserJet printers can
use fonts in compressed format.

6.2.4. Other Options

The SfCmpr program accepts the /@, /!, /replace, /quiet, /verbose, and /$
options.
7. SFROTATE: Rotating Fonts

Softfonts come in two orientations: portrait and landscape. Newer LaserJet
printers are capable of ``automagic'' internal font rotation but older
LaserJets and some compatibles do not have this ability. Sfware provides the
ability to convert from one orientation to the other. The SfRotate program can
convert from one orientation to the other.

7.1. Usage

        SFROTATE fontmask [[outmask]] [[options]]

7.2. Options

7.2.1. outmask

If an outmask is not specified, the input fontname will be used (i.e.by
default, SfRotate replaces the input font with a rotated version of the same
font).

7.2.2. Other Options

The SfRotate program accepts the /@, /!, /replace, /quiet, /verbose, and /$
options.
8. SFSHOW: Showing Fonts

Showing a font with SfShow creates a reference page that displays every
character in the font. The reference page includes all of the font
characteristics, the font selection sequence and a chart of all of the
characters in the font.

8.0.1. What's to Show?

Every softfont can contain up to 256 different characters numbered from 0 to
255. Most fonts don't define all 256 different characters. The character chart
is a grid that has ``spaces'' for each of the possible characters.If there are
some character positions in the font that are not used, the spaces for those
characters will be blank in the chart.

For small fonts, the character chart is a 16x16 grid on a single page.If the
font is larger than about 36pt (or has some very tall or very wide
characters), the characters may be too large to fit into the spaces in a 16x16
grid. In this case, multiple reference pages may be printed for the font. When
multiple reference pages are required, SfShow attempts to use the minimum
number of pages.

8.1. Usage

        SFSHOW fontmask [[options]]

8.2. Options

8.2.1. Downloading Options

In order to create a reference page, SfShow must first download the
softfont.The following options control how each font is downloaded---they have
precisely the same meaning as the SfLoad options with the same names:/image,
/compress, /expand, /portrait, and /landscape.

8.2.2. /id:#

The /id option allows you to specify the font-id number that should be used
for the temporary font downloaded in order to print the reference page.Since
temporary fonts are deleted automatically whenever a printer reset is
performed, it is not generally necessary to use this option.The default value
for this parameter is 16384.

8.2.3. /gridoff

The /gridoff option supresses grid lines on the reference page.

8.2.4. /device:filename

The /device option specifies the output device. The output device is most
frequently LPT1. SfShow prints to the specified filename.

8.2.5. /refset:set

For decorative or special purpose fonts, it may be helpful to have an
additional reference character printed (in plain ASCII) next to each symbol in
the chart. The /refset option allows you to specify the character set to use
for reference marks on the printout. If reference marks are used, the
reference character for each position in the font will be printed in the upper
right hand corner of each cell on the grid. For example, using the /refset:8u
option would make SfShow print the reference characters with the 8U symbol
set. You must select a symbol set that is available in your laser printer's
lineprinter font.If you do not want reference characters to be printed, use
/refset:none.

8.2.6. /numbers:base

The /numbers option allows you to specify the numeric base of the reference
numbers printed around the grid. Valid options are hex, oct, dec, and none for
hexadecimal (base 16), octal (base 8), decimal (base 10) and no reference
numbers respectively. The numbers configuration variable (discussed in the
configuration chapter) is provided to specify a default number base.

8.2.7. Other Options

The SfShow program accepts the /@, /!, /replace, /quiet, /verbose, and /$
options.

8.3. Technically Speaking

When multiple reference pages are required, SfShow attempts to use the minimum
number of pages, however, there are a few ``hidden'' constraints on how it
selects the first character for each page. In particular, it will not skip
characters on any single page (i.e. if the font defines ABCEFG but not D,
SfShow will not print ABCEFG on a reference page without an intervening blank
space where the D would be if it was defined. It wouldn't be difficult to
provide this option but it would make numbering the grid much more difficult
(read ``impossible'').
9. SFVIEW: Viewing Fonts

Viewing a font is the on-line equivalent of printing a reference page.SfView
displays every character in the font on a grid similar to the printed output
of SfShow. It can also display a sentence in the font.A graphics adapter is
required to view fonts. The following adapters are supported at this time:
CGA, MCGA, VGA, EGA, EGA (Mono), PC3270, IBM 8514, AT&T, and Hercules.

9.1. Usage

        SFVIEW fontfile [[options]]

Unlike the other Sfware utilities, SfView is interactive. When you run SfView,
a something like the following will be displayed:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The Grid Display Picture Cannot be Shown in this Version of the Manual
                          It is a Graphics Image
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Figure 9.1.SfView grid display

9.2. Options

The SfView program accepts the /$ option.

9.3. Running SfView

The keys described below allow you to change the range of characters
displayed, the quality of the display, and the format of the display.

9.3.1. ``Esc''

You can leave at any time by pressing ``Esc'' .

9.3.2. ``PgUp'' / ``PgDn''

Pressing ``PgDn'' moves the range of characters displayed forward by one
``screenfull.'' If ASCII 255 is currently in the display, pressing ``PgDn''
has no effect. Pressing ``PgUp'' moves the range of characters displayed
backward by one screenfull. If ASCII 0 is currently in the display,
pressing ``PgUp'' has no effect.

9.3.3. ``Alt'' + ``A''

If you are displaying the font in a graphics mode that has the same number of
pixels-per-inch both horizontally and vertically across the display, the
``Alt'' + ``A'' key combination is not available.

If the number of pixels-per-inch horizontally and vertically is not the same,
(i.e.the display has a non-square aspect ratio) it is impossible to display
the characters without some distortion because the softfont is defined with
the same number of pixels-per-inch both horizontally and vertically.

There are two kinds of distortion: stretch-distortion and ``reduced
resolution'' distortion.If every pixel of each character is displayed, the
letters will be stretch-distorted by the fact that the pixels are ``closer
together'' on the screen in one direction than the other.  Alternatively, some
rows or columns of pixels can be removed to avoid stretch distortion;
characters drawn this way suffer from distortion because they are printed at a
reduced resolution.

The ``Alt'' + ``A'' key-combination alternates between these two types of
distortion.

9.3.4. ``Alt'' + ``S''

Sometimes it is more useful to look at a font in the context of a sentence
than it is to look at each individual character. This allows you to see how
the characters interact with each other on the ``printed page.''The ``Alt'' +
``S'' key-combination alternates between the grid display and the sentence
display. The sentence display looks like this:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The Sentence Display Picture Cannot be Shown in this Version of the Manual
                          It is a Graphics Image
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Figure 9.2.SfView sentence display

9.3.5. ``Other''

Pressing any other key changes the range of characters displayed to begin with
the key you pressed.
10. SFINFO: Displaying Softfont Information

If you have difficulty printing a particular font, SfInfo can help pinpoint
the source of the problem. SfInfo displays the contents of the softfont header
and the header of each character in the font. In addition, SfInfo examines the
font looking for possible printer incompatibilities.New printers have a much
more relaxed opinion about what constitutes a valid font. A font that works on
a LaserJet III may not work on a Series II; SfInfo will be able to tell you
why.

10.1. Usage

        SFINFO fontmask [[options]]

10.1.1. Other Options

The SfInfo program accepts the /$ option.

10.2. Running SfInfo

Running SfInfo displays a panel something like the following:

            Figure 10.2.Additional Character Information Panel

The scrolling list of characters displays the class, orientation,
leftoffset, top-offset, width, height, delta-X, and data sizes of every
character in the font. These are technical measurements in the softfont and
can be ignored by most users.

The left-offset, top-offset, width, and height fields are PCL coordinate
system dots.The delta-X field is in 1/4 dot units. The data size is in
bytes.For compressed fonts (class 2 characters), this is the data size of the
compressed character, not the expanded character.

10.2.3. ``F5''

Pressing ``F5'' displays any additional information present in the font
header. The most common use of this area is font copyright information.The
special effects program in Sfware uses this area to describe what effects have
been performed on the font.

Not all fonts have additional information in the header.

10.2.4. ``F6''

When the font is scanned, it is frequently possible to recognize that it is
not valid for some printers. The LaserJet III printer (and, presumably,
printers that follow it) have a very relaxed set of guidelines as to what
constitutes a valid font. Older printers, the LaserJet Series II in
particular, have very stringent requirements. SfInfo recognizes these
incompatabilities and will display a warning message for each problem that it
finds. If the problem can easily be corrected, the appropriate action is
described.
11. SFDIR: Softfont Directory Listings

The SfDir program provides a useful alternative to the standard DOS DIR
command for softfonts. SfDir prints the font characteristics of each softfont
that matches the fontmask.

11.2. Usage

        SFDIR fontmask [[options]]

11.3. Options

11.3.1. /esc

If SfDir is run with the /esc option, it prints the LaserJet escape sequence
required to select each font instead of a textual description of the font
characteristics. In the escape sequence, a raised dot is used to represent the
ESC character (ASCII 27d).

11.3.2. /noesc

With the /noesc option, SfDir prints a textual description of the font
characteristics for each font that matches the fontmask. This is generally the
default.

11.3.3. Other Options

The SfDir program accepts the /quiet, /verbose, and /$ options.
12. The Bold Effect

Emboldening a font makes it appear darker on the page. Adding a large amount
of boldness to a font will cause it to blur and become difficult to read. In
professional typography, the characters in a bold version of a font have
different shapes and proportions. This is beyond the ability of Sfware. A
normal font made bolder with Sfware will not look the same (and probably will
not look as good) as a real bold version of the original font.

12.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask BOLD [[options]]

12.2. Options

12.2.1. /bold

The /bold parameter controls how much darker the characters are made to
appear.The larger the number, the darker the characters will be.  For best
results, the amount of boldness should be small with respect to the size of
the font. It's difficult to define ``small'' in this context; one-tenth of the
point size of the font (or less) is probably a good estimate. Experiment and
see what looks most pleasing to the eye.

12.2.2. /range

The range option limits the scope of the effect. Please refer to the SfFx
chapter for more information.

12.3. Technically Speaking

The bold effect locates ``edge'' pixels (that is, pixels that are on a 
border of the character) by scanning horizontally across each row of 
pixels. Every time a pixel position is found that is currently off and 
adjacent to, but not surrounded by, pixels that are on, the pixel is turned 
on. This has the effect of adding pixels to the border of the character. 
The appropriate font and character parameters are updated so that the 
original character shape (now surrounded by a border) prints in the same 
position as the original. In other words, the left offset is incremented by 
one, the baseline is incremented by one, and the character bounding box is 
expanded. If an amount of boldness greater than one is specified, the above 
algorithm is iterated to produce the correct amount of boldness.
13. The Fixed Spacing Effect

Fixed spacing uses the same width for each character in the font.  This is the
opposite of proportional spacing in which each character is given a width
appropriate to its appearance. In a fixed spaced font, all characters have the
same width. The fixed spacing effect creates a fixed spaced font from a
proportionally spaced font. This can be useful if you need to line up columns
of characters, for example, although it's generally better to use a font
specifically designed for fixed spacing.

13.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask FIX [[options]]

13.2. Options

There are no options for this effect.

13.3. Technically Speaking

In the fixed spaced version of the font, all characters have the maximum cell
width. Bitmaps that are narrower than the maximum cell width are adjusted to
print as if they were centered in a box as wide as the maximum cell width.
14. The Fill Effect

Filling a font creates outlined characters filled with a user-specified
pattern.

14.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask FILL /pattern:pattern [[options]]

14.2. Parameters

14.2.1. /pattern

Patterns can be specified directly or by using names defined in the
configuration file.The Patterns chapter describes how to create patterns; the
Configuration chapter describes how to save and name patterns.

14.3. Options

14.3.1. /range

The range option limits the scope of the effect. Please refer to the SfFx
chapter for more information.

14.4. Technically Speaking

Patterns are described in more technical detail in the Patterns chapter.
15. The Halftone Effect

Halftoning a font can produce a wide variety of results. It is one of the most
general effects in SfFx's repertoire. In brief, it allows you to specify the
fill patterns for both the foreground and the background of two different
regions of each character. This can create, for example, half-inverted
characters.

15.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask HALFTONE /start:# /stop:# /blackbot:pattern
                                       /whitebot:pattern [[options]]

15.2. Parameters

Every character is divided into two areas, a selected area and a non-selected
area.Within each area, two shading patterns are applied--one to the currently
black portion of the character cell (the character itself) and one to the
white portion of the character cell ( everything else).

Please refer to the Patterns chapter elsewhere in this manual for more
information about patterns.

15.2.1. /start

The /start parameter specifies where the selected area begins. This value
should be expressed as a percentage from the top of the tallest character in
the font. For example, specifing 25 begins the selected area 1/4 of the way
down from the top of the character, similarly, 50 selects a position halfway
down the character and 67 selects a position 67% of the way down from the top
of the character.

15.2.2. /stop

By analogy with /start, this option specifies where the select region ends.The
/stop value should be larger than the starting value.  The area between the
start position and the stop position is the ``selected region'' of the
character.

15.2.3. /blackbot

The /blackbot pattern replaces the foreground (black) area of the selected
region.The /blackbot parameter can be abbreviated to /bbot.

15.2.4. /whitebot

The /whitebot pattern replaces the background (white) area of the selected
region.The /whitebot parameter can be abbreviated to /wbot.

15.3. Options

15.3.1. /blacktop

The /blacktop pattern replaces the black areas of the non-selected
region.Please refer the the Patterns chapter elsewhere in this manual. The
/blacktop option can be abbreviated to /btop.

15.3.2. /whitetop

The /whitetop pattern replaces the white area (everything in the cell that
isn't black) of the non-selected region. The /whitetop parameter can be
abbreviated to /wtop.

15.3.3. /_

The /_ option forces a ``space'' character to exist. It may be particularly
useful with this effect. For more information, consult the technically
speaking section of the SfFx chapter.

15.3.4. /range

The range option limits the scope of the effect. Please refer to the SfFx
chapter for more information.

15.4. Technically Speaking

This effect forms the heart of several effects in SfFx. For example, the
``shade'' effect is nothing more than the halftone effect applied to a
selected region from 0% to 100% of the character! If you understand the
concept of a pattern (discussed in the Patterns chapter), it shouldn't be too
difficult to understand the halftone effect.

Note:in any effect that changes the background pattern, it may be necessary to
turn off ``kerning'' within the word processor or other program that you use
to print the font. Normally, causing two characters to overlap by a small
amount (for example a capital ``T'' followed by a lowercase ``o'') is not
noticable because they only overlap in the ``white'' background. However,
after you have changed the background to a pattern other than plain white, the
effect of overlapping two characters by even a small amount may be
undesirable.
16. The Horizontal Fade/Mist Effect

Fading a font with this effect ``smudges'' out the leading or trailing edge of
each character.

16.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask HFADE /to:% [[options]]

16.2. Parameters

16.2.1. /to

The /to parameter determines what percentage of the character is faded out.A
fade factor of 100% applies the fade all the way across each character so that
a 100% black saturation is achieved in the last column of pixels. Fade factors
below 100% apply the fade more rapidly so that a 100% black saturation is
achieved before the edge of the character.Conversly, fade factors above 100%
draw the fade out so that it never reaches saturation.

16.3. Options

16.3.1. /back

By default, a horizontal fade begins with 0% black on the left edge of the
character and proceeds towards 100% on the right edge (at a rate determined by
``fade percent.'' See above). If backwards fading is selected, the fade
proceeds from right to left instead of left to right.

16.3.2. /range

The range option limits the scope of the effect. Please refer to the SfFx
chapter for more information.

16.4. Technically Speaking

The fade effect examines each pixel in the bitmap and decides randomly if the
pixel should be turned off. In any given column,
100*ColumnNumber*(FadePercent/100)/CharacterWidth percent of the pixels are
turned off.
17. The Hollow Effect

Hollowing a font produces an unfilled outline of each character.

17.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask HOLLOW [[options]]

17.2. Options

17.2.1. /range

The range option limits the scope of the effect. Please refer to the SfFx
chapter for more information.

17.3. Technically Speaking

The hollow effect and the outline effect are very closely related. The only
difference is the placement of the outline. In the hollow effect, the existing
perimeter of each character is left in place and the interior is ``scooped
out''. For the outline effect, the entire character is erased and a new
perimeter is added just around the character.In effect, an outlined character
is a hollowed bold character (see the technically speaking section of the bold
effect for more details).

It should also be noted that the hollow and fill effects are closely related.A
hollowed character is a filled character with a pattern of 0.
18. The Invert Effect

Inverting a character creates a ``reverse video'' effect. However, the choice
of patterns in this effect can dramatically change the result.

18.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask INVERT [[options]]

18.2. Options

Both of the options for this effect are patterns. See the Patterns chapter
elsewhere in this manual for more information.

18.2.1. /black

This pattern replaces all of the black areas of the character.

18.2.2. /white

This pattern replaces all of the white areas of the character.

18.2.3. /_

The /_ option forces a ``space'' character to exist. It may be particularly
useful with this effect. For more information, consult the technically
speaking section of the SfFx chapter.

18.2.4. /range

The range option limits the scope of the effect. Please refer to the SfFx
chapter for more information.

18.3. Technically Speaking

Since the black and white patterns default to black and white, respectively,
in practice, if neither the black nor the white pattern is specified,
inverting has no effect.

See the technically speaking section of the halftone effect for more
information.
19. The Mirror Effect

Mirroring a font creates characters that are upside down.

19.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask MIRROR [[options]]

19.2. Options

19.2.1. /adj

The /adj parameter changes the relative position of the (virtual) mirror
across which each character is rotated. A value of zero specifies that the
mirror is on the baseline, values larger than zero move the mirror above the
baseline, smaller values move it below.

19.2.2. /range

The range option limits the scope of the effect. Please refer to the SfFx
chapter for more information.

19.3. Technically Speaking

If you plan to use a font and its mirror to create a special display effect
(by placing one above the other), you may find that the descenders on the
original font overlap the ``descenders'' (now ascenders!)on the mirrored font.
This is where it is helpful to change the mirror baseline adjustment. By
making the adjustment roughly equal to the number of pixels in the descenders
of the original font, you can move the mirrored font ``down'' a little so that
the mirrored descenders don't overlap the descenders on the original font.
20. The Mist Effect

Misting a font ``smudges'' each character.

20.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask MIST /mist:% [[options]]

20.2. Parameters

20.2.1. /mist

The mist percent determines what percentage of the character is misted (faded)
out.Larger mist percentages remove more pixels than smaller ones.  A 100% (or
larger) mist percent removes all trace of the character.

20.3. Options

20.3.1. /range

The range option limits the scope of the effect. Please refer to the SfFx
chapter for more information.

20.4. Technically Speaking

This effect is identical to the horizontal and vertical fade effects with the
exception that the fade percentage is calculated once and does not vary for
each row or column in the bitmap.
21. The Outline Effect

Outlining a font produces an unfilled outline of each character.

21.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask OUTLINE [[options]]

21.2. Options

21.2.1. /range

The range option limits the scope of the effect. Please refer to the SfFx
chapter for more information.

21.3. Technically Speaking

See the technical discussion of the hollow effect for more information.
22. The Proportional Spacing Effect

Proportional spacing is the opposite of fixed spacing. In a proportionally
spaced font, each character is only as wide as its printed image, plus a small
border. The proportional spacing effect creates a proportionally spaced
version of a fixed spaced font.

22.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask PROP

22.2. Options

There are no options for this effect.

22.3. Technically Speaking

In the proportionally spaced version of the font, all characters are four dots
wider than the natural width of the bitmaps required to print each character
(two dots on each side). Note: in many fonts, conversion from proportional
spacing to fixed and back to proportional will yield a proportionally spaced
font that is not as attractive as the original font since conversion to fixed
spacing effectively destroys any special spacing information. For example, in
many fonts the tail of a lower case letters like ``j'' and ``g'' are allowed
to ``hang back'' below the character that precedes them. When a font is
converted from fixed spacing to proportional spacing, there is no way to
insert this kind of aesthetic hint automatically.
23. The Resize Effect

Resizing a font creates characters that are larger or smaller than the same
characters in the original font. The characters can be scaled uniformly
(creating more or less accurate renditions of the original characters with the
same proportions) or non-uniformly (creating elongated or widened characters).

23.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask RESIZE /width:% /height:% [[options]]

23.2. Parameters

23.2.1. /width

The /width parameter specifies the width of each resized character as a
percentage of its original size. Values less than 100 make the characters
narrower, while values larger than 100 make them wider.

23.2.2. /height

Like the width, the new height specifies the height of each resized character
as a percentage of its original height.

23.3. Options

23.3.1. /range

The range option limits the scope of the effect. Please refer to the SfFx
chapter for more information.

23.4. Technically Speaking

In practice, this effect has few uses. Unlike more modern font scaling
technology (which relies on mathematical descriptions of each character) SfFx
has only the bitmap description of each character to work with.As a result,
gross changes in the size of a character create ``jagged'' edges and very poor
quality letters. Making fonts larger generally works better than making them
smaller. As a rule of thumb, you probably won't like the results if you try to
resize a font by more than a factor of two. If you hold one dimension constant
(100%), it may be possible to stretch or compress the other dimension by a
larger factor without significant loss of detail.
24. The Reverse Effect

Reversing a font creates backwards characters.

24.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask REVERSE [[options]]

24.2. Options

24.2.1. /range

The range option limits the scope of the effect. Please refer to the SfFx
chapter for more information.

24.3. Technically Speaking

The reverse effect simply rotates each bitmap through its center. The left
offset and delta-x values of each character are adjusted to keep the correct
amount of space ``in front of'' and ``behind'' each character.
25. The Shadow Effect

Shadowing attempts to produce the effect that you would get if all you could
see on the page were the shadows from an embossed image of the original
character. It's a bit difficult to describe, but it is one of my favorite
effects.

25.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask SHADOW /x:# /x:# [[options]]

25.2. Parameters

25.2.1. /X

The /x parameter controls the width (in dots) of the shadow to the right or
left of the original character. Positive values create a shadow on the right
hand side of the character, while negative values create a shadow on the left.
This value should be small relative to the total width of the character.

25.2.2. /Y

By analogy with the /X parameter, the /y parameter controls the height of the
shadow above or below the character. Positive values create shadows below the
character, negative values above. This value should be small relative to the
total height of the character.

25.3. Options

25.3.1. /range

The range option limits the scope of the effect. Please refer to the SfFx
chapter for more information.

25.4. Technically Speaking

The effect is produced by moving a copy of the character over and down by the
specified amounts and then removing all dots that fall within the original
character (including all of the original character).  For small offsets, this
works fine; however when the offsets become larger than the widths of the
strokes that make up the chacter, the effect falls apart.
26. The Shade Effect

Shading a font replaces all off the ``black'' areas of a font with the
specified shading pattern. This effect changes dramatically depending on the
pattern that you select.

26.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask SHADE /pattern:pattern [[options]]

26.2. Parameters

26.2.1. /pattern

All of the black areas of each character are replaced by the specified
pattern.Please refer to the chapter on patterns elsewhere in this manual for
more information about patterns.

26.3. Options

26.3.1. /range

The range option limits the scope of the effect. Please refer to the SfFx
chapter for more information.

26.4. Technically Speaking

Patterns are described in more technical detail in the pattern chapter.
27. The Slant Effect

Slanting is a poor-man's version of italics. In practice, italic fonts are not
just slanted versions of the upright characters. But slanting will suffice in
a pinch and it does allow you to produce oblique characters (slanted
backwards), which are occasionally useful.

27.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask SLANT /deg:# [[options]]

27.2. Parameters

27.2.1. /deg

The /deg parameter specifies the amount of slant in degrees. A positive value
causes the characters to slant toward the right. A negative value causes the
characters to slant toward the left.

27.3. Options

27.3.1. /range

The range option limits the scope of the effect. Please refer to the SfFx
chapter for more information.

27.4. Technically Speaking

This effect is produced by calculating how far over each row of pixels must 
be moved in order to produce a slant of the requested angle.Using a little 
bit of trigonometry, it is easy to calculate how far over the top row must 
be moved.  Each row below the top must be moved over some fraction of the 
total height of the character.  Rows below the baseline must be moved in 
the opposite direction.  Considering that this algorithm does nothing more 
than slide rows of dots back and forth, it should be easy to see that large 
slant values may produce jagged, non-contiguous characters.
28. The Stripe Effect

Striping places alternating white and black horizontal lines across each
character in the font.

28.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask STRIPE /black:# /white:# [[options]]

28.2. Parameters

28.2.1. /black

Selects the width (in dots) of the black stripes.

28.2.2. /white

Selects the width (in dots) of the white stripes.

28.3. Options

28.3.1. /range

The range option limits the scope of the effect. Please refer to the SfFx
chapter for more information.

28.4. Technically Speaking

In each character, the stripes are adjusted so that a black stripe begins 
at the baseline. This assures that the stripes will line up when characters 
are placed next to each other. Note: a similar effect with vertical stripes 
can be created with the shade effect using an appropriate pattern.
29. The Three-D Drop Shadow Effect

Three-D drop shadows create a patterned shadow-image of each character that
appears to be below the original. It is possible to change the apparent
``distance'' of the shadow by changing the offsets used to create it.

29.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask THREED /X:# /Y:# /pattern:pattern [[options]]

29.2. Parameters

29.2.1. /X

The /x parameter controls the distance (in dots) of the shadow to the right or
left of the original character. Positive values create a shadow on the right
hand side of the character, negative values create a shadow on the left.

29.2.2. /Y

By analogy with the /X parameter, the /y parameter controls the distance of
the shadow above or below the character. Positive values create shadows below
the character, negative values above.

29.2.3. Pattern

The pattern specified is applied to the areas used in the shadow.

29.3. Options

29.3.1. /range

The range option limits the scope of the effect. Please refer to the SfFx
chapter for more information.

29.4. Technically Speaking

The original character is moved left or right and up or down by the distances
specified. If necessary the character cell is enlarged to accommodate the new
character. The character is then shaded with the specified pattern and the
original character is painted back into the character cell at its original
position.
30. The Tilt Effect

Tilting creates characters that have a ``tilted'' baseline. Each character in
the font can be rotated by an arbitrary angle. You cannot rotate a character
by more than 90 degrees. The tilt effect in combination with rotating,
mirroring, and reversing can produce a font that is effectively tilted by any
angle.

30.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask TILT /deg:# [[options]]

30.2. Parameters

30.2.1. /deg

The /deg parameter specifies the amount of tilt in degrees. A positive tilt
value creates a font with a baseline that runs down and to the right.A
negative value creates a font that runs up and to the right.

30.3. Options

30.3.1. /range

The range option limits the scope of the effect. Please refer to the SfFx
chapter for more information.

30.4. Technically Speaking

This effect is one of the most time consuming to run (on a 12pt font it may 
require evaluating three trigonometric functions, a square root, and 
several floating point and integer operations more than one and a half 
million times---and it's worse for bigger fonts). It creates a new 
character box large enough to hold the ``tilted'' original box and performs 
a trigonometric translation of every pixel into the new box.  Although the 
effect makes some small changes to the top offset and left offset values 
for each character (in an attempt to correct for translation errors 
inherent in translating from one square grid system to another), the 
character dimensions are basically unchanged.

This effect creates a rotated font, but you still need a sufficiently flexible
typesetting program to set the rotated text. Simply creating a rotated font
will not, for example, cause your run-of-the-mill word processor to print it
on an angle!

The horizontal spacing in a tilted font is sometimes imperfect. It is unclear
why this is the case. Hopefully, a future version of Sfware will correct this
problem.
31. The Hollow Three-D Drop Shadow Effect

Hollow Three-D drop shadows are simply a combination of the three-d drop
shadow effect and the hollow effect. It is a limitation of the algorithms used
to create the three-d drop shadow effect that it is not possible to hollow a
three-d character. This effect is provided to circumvent that limitation.

31.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask HOLLOW3D /X:# /Y:# [[options]]

31.2. Parameters

31.2.1. /X

The /x parameter controls the distance (in dots) of the shadow to the right or
left of the original character. Positive values create a shadow on the right
hand side of the character, negative values create a shadow on the left.

31.2.2. /Y

By analogy with the /X parameter, the /y parameter controls the distance of
the shadow above or below the character. Positive values create shadows below
the character, negative values above.

31.3. Options

31.3.1. /range

The range option limits the scope of the effect. Please refer to the SfFx
chapter for more information.

31.4. Technically Speaking

This option is exactly the same as the three-d drop shadow effect except that
the shadow is always solid black and instead of painting the original
character back into the cell, a hollowed version of the original character is
painted back in.
32. The Filled Three-D Drop Shadow Effect

Filled Three-D drop shadows are simply a combination of the three-d drop
shadow effect and the fill effect. It is a limitation of the algorithms used
to create the three-d drop shadow effect that it is not possible to create a
filled three-d character. This effect is provided to circumvent that
limitation.

32.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask FILL3D /X:# /Y:# /pattern:pattern [[options]]

32.2. Parameters

32.2.1. /X

The /x parameter controls the distance (in dots) of the shadow to the right or
left of the original character. Positive values create a shadow on the right
hand side of the character, negative values create a shadow on the left.

32.2.2. /Y

By analogy with the /X parameter, the /y parameter controls the distance of
the shadow above or below the character. Positive values create shadows below
the character, negative values above.

32.2.3. /pattern

The pattern specified is applied to the original character.

32.3. Options

32.3.1. /range

The range option limits the scope of the effect. Please refer to the SfFx
chapter for more information.

32.4. Technically Speaking

This option is exactly the same as the three-d drop shadow effect except that
the shadow is always solid black and instead of painting the original
character back into the cell, a pattern-filled version of the original
character is painted back in.
33. The Vertical Fade/Mist Effect

Fading a font with this effect ``smudges'' out the top or bottom edge of each
character.

33.1. Usage

        SFFX fontmask outmask VFADE /to:% [[options]]

33.2. Parameters

33.2.1. /to

The /to parameter determines what percentage of the character is faded out.A
fade factor of 100% applies the fade all the way down each character so that
100% black saturation is achieved in the last row of pixels.Fade factors below
100% apply the fade more rapidly so that a 100% black saturation is achieved
before the bottom of the character.Conversely, fade factors above 100% draw
the fade out so that it never reaches saturation.

33.3. Options

33.3.1. /back

By default, a vertical fade begins with 0% black on the top row of the
character and proceeds towards 100% on the bottom row (at a rate determined by
``fade percent.'' See above). If backwards fading is selected, the fade begins
with 0% black on the bottom row of the character and proceeds towards 100% on
the top row.

33.3.2. /range

The range option limits the scope of the effect. Please refer to the SfFx
chapter for more information.

33.4. Technically Speaking

See the technically speaking section for the Horizontal Fade/Mist effect.The
vertical fade algorithm is a natural analog of the horizontal fade algorithm.
34. Patterns

34.1. What are patterns?

Patterns change the appearance of many effects. A pattern is a rectangular
region of on-and-off dots that is repeated across and down to cover the region
being filled. The pattern is specified as a series of numbers separated by
commas and semicolons. The binary representation of the numbers separated by
commas indicates the dots that are on and off in each row and semicolons
separate rows.

34.2. How do I create one?

Creating a new pattern is not difficult. The best way to begin is with a piece
of graph paper and a pencil. Experiment until you have something that you like
and then follow the directions below.

For example, suppose that you wish to create a zig-zag pattern. Here is one
possibility:

      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |   |   |   | * |   |   |   | * |   |   |   | * |   |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      | * |   | * |   | * |   | * |   | * |   | * |   | * |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |   | * |   |   |   | * |   |   |   | * |   |   |   |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |   |   |   | * |   |   |   | * |   |   |   | * |   |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      | * |   | * |   | * |   | * |   | * |   | * |   | * |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |   | * |   |   |   | * |   |   |   | * |   |   |   |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

34.2.1. Isolate a ``generating region''

Isolate the smallest region that can be used to generate the pattern.  This
region, when repeated to the right and down, should create the entire
pattern.In this case, the smallest acceptable region is this:

      +---+---+---+---+
      |   |   |   |   |
      +---+---+---+---+
      |   |   | * |   |
      +---+---+---+---+
      |   | * |   | * |
      +---+---+---+---+
      | * |   |   |   |
      +---+---+---+---+

Note:there is frequently more than one smallest region that will produce 
the pattern. I have intentionally chosen this region because it is not the 
upper-left hand corner. Usually the upper-left hand corner contains a 
generating region, but not always.

34.2.2. Round to 8-dots

The region used to generate the pattern must be an even multiple of eight dots
wide. Repeat the smallest region to the right until it is a multiple of eight
dots wide. You must repeat the entire pattern (for example, if the region is 6
dots wide, you will have to repeat it until it is 24 dots wide). In this case
the smallest region a multiple of eight dots wide is this:

      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |   |   | * |   |   |   | * |   |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |   | * |   | * |   | * |   | * |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      | * |   |   |   | * |   |   |   |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

34.2.3. Use zeros and ones

Redraw the pattern using zeros for ``off'' dots and ones for ``on'' dots.If
the pattern is more than eight dots wide, write the zeros and ones of each row
in groups of eight as you copy the pattern.  In our example, the result is
this:

      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | = 00000000
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |   |   | * |   |   |   | * |   | = 00100010
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |   | * |   | * |   | * |   | * | = 01010101
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      | * |   |   |   | * |   |   |   | = 10001000
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

Treat each group of eight digits in each row like a binary number.  Using a
calculator or a conversion chart (there is a conversion chart in the online
help facility for SfShell), change each eight digit binary number into a
decimal number. If the rows have more than one group of eight digits, separate
the resulting decimal numbers with commas.  Our example becomes:

      00000000 = 0
      00100010 = 34
      01010101 = 85
      10001000 = 136

34.2.5. Rewrite

Use the decimal numbers to create the pattern command. Optionally, you may
wish to add the pattern to the configuration file (as described below).The
decimal numbers for each row are separated by commas and the rows are
separated by semicolons. The pattern we set out to create can be specified as
follows:

      0;34;85;136

Remember that you can use preview to look at the pattern before creating a
font with it. This is a good way to check that you did the conversion
correctly.

34.3. Saving the pattern

Alternatively, the patterns may be saved in the configuration file and
selected by name. Read the Configuration chapter for more information.

34.4. Previewing Patterns

It is possible to preview any pattern by running SfFx with the following
options:

        SFFX /PREVIEW pattern

One ``screenfull'' of the pattern will be displayed.

34.5. Technically Speaking

The fact that patterns are used for so many effects makes it apparent that
Sfware really needs a pattern editor and a better mechanism for storing
patterns. These are planned additions but Sfware is already beginning to
suffer from ``creeping featurism'' (in the author's opinion, at least) and it
has been decided that these changes will just have to wait until the next
release.

However, in view of the fact that creating patterns by the above method is 
very tedious, a simple program (PATTERN.EXE) has been added to Sfware that 
eliminates most of the ``hard parts.'' Please consult the file PATTERN.DOC 
for more information.

36. Contacting the Author

36.1. By Mail

You can reach the author by mail at the following address:

        Norman Walsh    
        #42I Southwood Apts 
        Brittany Manor Dr 
        Amherst, MA 01002

36.2. Electronically

If you have access to electronic mail, the fastest way to reach the author is
to send electronic mail to walsh@cs.umass.edu. In this case, electronic mail
implies access to Internet domains (through BITNET or UUCP, for example). This
is possible from CompuServe and from several of the large national BBS systems
as well as many colleges and universities.
37. Glossary

ASCII

ASCII stands for the American Standard Code for Information Interchange.  Text
files are usually referred to as being ``plain ASCII'' if they contain no
additional formatting information. The CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files on
your boot disk are examples of a plain ASCII files. The spreadsheets, database
files, or word processing documents produced by large application programs are
generally not plain ASCII.

baseline

The baseline is an imaginary line upon which each character rests.  Characters
that appear next to each other are (usually) lined up so that their baselines
are on the same level. Some characters extend below the baseline (``g'' and
``j'', for example) but most rest on it.

bitmap

A bitmap is an array of dots. If you imagine a sheet of graph paper with some
squares colored in, a bitmap is a compact way of representing to the computer
which squares are colored and which are not.

In the context of softfonts, the dots are always black and white. In a
bitmapped softfont, every character is represented as a pattern of dots in a
bitmap. The dots are so small (300 dots-per-inch, usually) that they are
indistinguishable on the printed page.

bounding box

Every character in a bitmapped softfont is represented as a pattern of dots in
a rectangular grid. The bounding box is an imaginary box just large enough to
hold the character. The box is as wide as the widest row of dots and as tall
as the tallest column of dots.

character

A character is an individual symbol in a font. The letter ``A'' is a
character.So is a period. All of the printed symbols that can appear in a font
are characters. They can also be called glyphs.

child process

When one program directly runs another program (as when SfShell runs SfFx to
perform a requested special effect), the program that is run (SfFx in this
case) is called the child and the program that did the running (SfShell) is
called the parent.

command line

When you type a command at the DOS prompt, you are entering information on 
``the command line.'' Command line parameters and command line options are 
things that you type after the name of the command. For example, if you 
type ``edit letter.txt'', ``edit'' is the command and ``letter.txt'' is a 
command line parameter.

decimal

Decimal refers to the number base composed of ten symbols (0-9).  Normal,
ordinary math is performed in decimal (which can also be referred to as base
10).

device

A device is a special piece of hardware that exists (either physically or
logically) and can send and/or receive data. Your printer is a device.So is
your modem. Your computer also includes several logical devices (for example,
the NUL device which is an infinite sink and a empty source--that means you
can always write to it (it never fills up) and you can never read from it (you
always get ``end-offile'')).

download

Downloading is the process of transferring information from one device to
another.This transferral is called downloading when the transfer flows from a
device of (relatively) more power to one of (relatively) less power.Sending
new fonts to your printer so that it ``learns'' how to print characters in
that font is called downloading.

EMS

EMS memory (also called LIM EMS) is expanded memory in your computer.  EMS
exists outside of normal DOS main memory. You must have a device driver to
provide support for EMS. If it is available, Sfware uses EMS memory to store
font and action lists as well as for swapping when SfShell runs the other
utilities.

file

A file is a collection of information stored on your disk. All the data that
you ever save to disk is saved in a file. You can write to files and read from
files.

filemask

A filemask is a DOS filename which may include the ``wildcard'' characters *
and ?. The wildcard characters in a filemask allow you to select a group of
files. Please consult your DOS reference for more information about wildcard
characters.

font

A font is a collection of symbols that have similar characteristics.  The 
symbols in a font have a fixed typeface, size, weight, style and symbol 
set. For example, upright, bold Times Roman at 10pt is a font.Contrast with 
typeface.

fontdir

In the context of this manual, a fontdir is the filemask ( optionally
including a path) that identifies LaserJet softfont files. For example, if you
keep all of your softfonts in the directory d:\fonts then d:\fonts\A*.SFP is
one example of a valid fontdir. The canonical font directory would be
d:\fonts\*.*.

glyph

A glyph is a more general term for a symbol that can appear in a font.Usually
we refer to individual symbols in a font as characters (because they are
things like ``A'' and ``&''). However, since any arbitrary smear of ink can
occur in a font, a more general term is sometimes used.

hexadecimal

Hexadecimal refers to the number base composed of sixteen symbols ( 09,A-F).
Hexadecimal is frequently used in computing because 256 different values can
be represented in only two digits. Hexadecimal is sometimes called base 16.

HMI

HMI is an abbreviation for horizontal motion index. This is the width of the
space that the LaserJet printer leaves when an undefined character is printed.
Many font designers take advantage of this behavior by defining the HMI to be
exactly the width of a space and not defining a space character in the font.

kerning

Kerning refers to slight changes in the spacing between characters. Some
letter combinations (``AV'' and ``To'', for example) appear farther apart than
others because of the shapes of the individual letters. Many sophisticated
word processors move these letter combinations closer together automatically
(compare ``AV'' with ``AV'', for example).

laserjet

Laserjet is a trademarked name for laser printers made by Hewlett Packard.In
this document, it simply means an HP LaserJet printer or a compatible laser
printer from some other manufacturer.

mask

See filemask.

memory, expanded

See EMS.

memory, extended

Extended memory is memory above the 1 megabyte boundry in your computer.Sfware
cannot directly use extended memory. Many programs exist which map extended
memory as expanded memory. For more information about expanded memory, see
EMS.

memory, main

Main memory is the DOS memory below 640K in your computer. This is the area
where normal DOS programs run. The DOS chkdsk program, for example, reports
the amount of main memory that is free.

octal

Octal refers to the number base composed of eight symbols (0-7). Octal is
sometimes called base 8.

pathname

A pathname is a filename (please consult your DOS reference for more
information about what constitutes a valid DOS filename) with its associated
drive and path. For example, if tr100.sfp is the name of a file in the
directory \fonts on drive d:, then

        d:\fonts\tr100.sfp

is the pathname of tr100.sfp.

scalable font

A scalable font, unlike a bitmapped font, is defined mathematically and can be
rendered at any requested size (within reason). Sfware can download and show
scalable fonts but other manipulations (including on-screen previewing) are
not possible (at this time).

selection sequence

Your laser printer can print many different fonts. Some of the fonts are built
in, some may come from a cartridge and many can be downloaded.In order to tell
the laser printer which font you want text to be printed in, you must send it
a selection sequence. The selection sequence describes, in a well defined,
precise manner, the typeface, symbol set, height, width, style, and degree of
boldness that you want.

softfont

A softfont is a bitmapped or scalable description of a typeface or 
font.They can be downloaded to your printer and used just like any other 
printer font. Unlike built-in and cartridge fonts, softfonts use memory 
inside your printer. Downloading a lot of softfonts may reduce the printers 
ability to construct complex pages.

symbol set

The symbol set of a font describes the relative positions of individual
characters within the font. Since there can only be 256 characters in any
font, and there are well over 256 different characters used in professional
document preparation, there needs to be some way to map characters into
positions within the font. The symbol set serves this purpose.It identifies
the ``map'' used to position characters within the font.

typeface

A typeface is generic term for a collection of symbols with a similar
style.Times Roman and Helvetica are typefaces. Contrast with font.

The Sfware utilities allow you to download, rotate, compress, expand, view,
and perform special effects on softfonts.  The effects provided include bold,
fill, convert to fixed spacing, halftone, hollow, invert, mirror, outline,
convert to proportional spacing, resize, reverse, shade, shadow, slant,
stripe, tilt, three-d, hollow-three-d, and filled-three-d effects.  The
effects can be tailored and customized for any font with various parameters
and shading patterns.

Sfware is distributed in five archive files: SFW11AP1, SFW11AP2, SFW11AD1,
SFW11AD2, and SFW11AEX.  The 'P' archives contain the programs and the 'D'
archives contain documentation.  The 'EX' archive contains an example of
the special effects that Sfware can produce.

Print the example page from the SFW11AEX archive file (EXAMPLES.PCL or
EXAMPL16.PCL) on your LaserJet printer for a sample of Sfware's effects.
You can print the examples by entering the command

    COPY EXAMPLES.PCL /B PRN

at the DOS prompt.  You must print the examples page on an HP LaserJet
compatible printer.  The example pages are essentially identical.  The
EXAMPL16.PCL page uses only 16 fonts.  Some LaserJet printers (notably, the
HP LaserJet Series II) can only print sixteen different fonts on any given
page.  If your printer has this limitation, EXAMPLES.PCL may not print
correctly.
