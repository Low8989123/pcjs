      This shareware game requires 256-color VGA graphics (320 x 200 pixels),
  a mouse, and a computer with CPU speed 10 megahertz or faster.  It attempts
  with every screen to acclimate the user to cold metallic scenery.  The game
  places a premium on quick thinking and reflexes, but its real purpose is to
  provide players with sensory enjoyment.
