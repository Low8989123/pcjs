  We are now ready to unpack the printer driver for MS Word 5.X or MS 
  Works and put this driver into your MS Word subdirectory. After that is 
  done, you will be given the option of printing a copy of the installa-
  tion instructions that must be followed to add these soft fonts to Word
  or Works. Once these fonts are properly installed into Word, they will 
  appear any time you attempt to change fonts (<Esc><Format><Character>
  option).

  Installing our driver for MS Word is fairly simple. Installing the 
  driver in Works is easy. Our Word driver adds information to your 
  existing driver, so you will not lose any fonts you already have. 
  Installing our driver is a two step process. You merge our font infor-
  mation to your existing driver, and then select this updated driver 
  from within Word. For more information print the full installation 
  instructions next.

                      USING ESF FONTS WITH OTHER PACKAGES

 All ESF fonts follow the standard HP format for soft fonts. They will work
 with any application program that recognizes 3rd party HP format fonts. If
 your word processor or desktop publishing program is not mentioned here, 
 check your user manual to see how to add soft font support to your appli-
 cation. This document describes how to add these fonts to: PC Write, Q&A,
 Ventura, Windows, WordStar 5.5/6.0, and WordStar 2000. Note these are 
 general instructions. See your particular word processor manual for complete
 details.


**Using ESF Soft Fonts With PC Write

  The PC Write program (version 2.71 or greater) fully supports soft fonts
  for laser printers. A shareware utility available from QuickSoft called
  FONT SELECTOR will examine HP format soft fonts and make up printer 
  drivers for PC Write. Note that PC Write does not download soft fonts for 
  you. We suggest a tool like our TSR Download to help in the managing and 
  downloading of your soft fonts.


**Using ESF Soft Fonts With Q&A

  The Q&A program and Q&A Write fully support 3rd party HP format soft 
  fonts. To use soft fonts with Q&A you need a copy of their QAFONT.EXE 
  program. If you are using an existing font description file such as 
  HPLASERJ.FNT, QAFONT can add the new descriptions to this file. If you 
  would like to use a new font file name (i.e. MYFONTS.FNT), QAFONT will 
  create this new file to hold the font descriptions. (Reminder: If you are 
  using a new filename, remember to re-install the printer and type the new 
  name on the "Font File Name" line of the "Special Printer Options" 
  screen).

  The QAFONT program may accompany your Q&A program or you may have to call
  Symantec Product Support to get a copy. Note that Q&A does not download 
  soft fonts for you. We suggest a tool like our TSR Download to help in the
  managing and downloading of your soft fonts.



**Using ESF Fonts With Ventura

  All LaserJet fonts on this disk are compatible with Ventura Publisher. To
  use these fonts in Ventura they must first be converted into Ventura for-
  mat. To convert these fonts you need your Ventura Disk #11. (This disk 
  number changes with each new release.) Check out your Ventura manual- the
  "Adding new fonts for the HP LaserJet Plus" section for more details.

  Step 1) Build new VFM files. (Ventura Font Metric width tables) Find the 
  Ventura program HPLTOVFM.EXE. Run this program for each soft font found in
  this set.

  HPLTOVFM SM180PRN.USP /F=SYMBOLS /N=37 /P=18 /W=N

  Where /F= is the typeface name which MUST start with a capital letter
        /N= is the typeface number (look these up in you Ventura manual)
        /P= is the point size of the font
        /W= weight of the font, N=normal, I=italic, B=bold, T=bold italic

  Step 2) Make an ASCII text file that lists the name of each VFM file 
  created in step 1. (Must end in ".LST".) One file name per line. The file
  names must be listed in point size order smallest to largest, with styles
  listed in: normal, italic, bold, bold italic order.

  Step 3) Use the Ventura VFMTOWID.EXE program and the LST file from step 2
  plus the VFM files to create a width table.

  VFMTOWID ESFSHARE.LST

  Where ESFSHARE.LST is the list file created in step 2,

  Step 4) Create a HPLJPLUS.CFN file as described in your Ventura manual. 
  Download the soft fonts to your printer.

  Step 5) Merge the width tables and clean up. Run Ventura and select 
  Options - Add Remove Fonts - Merge Width Table.


**Using ESF Soft Fonts With Windows 3.0 & 3.1

  1) make sure your soft fonts are unpacked and stored on your hard disk
  2) start Windows
  3) At the Main menu double click on the Control Panel icon
  4) Now double click on Printers, *make* sure you *don't* click on Fonts
     by mistake. (The Fonts Icon deals with screen not printer fonts.)
  5) Make sure you have a LaserJet or DeskJet printer installed and active
     You can *not* use the scalable driver for either printer. (Neither
     supports soft fonts.)
  6) IF you have Windows 3.0, click on Configure (doesn't apply in Win 3.1)
  7) In the next menu click on Setup
  8) At this menu click on Fonts, then click on Add Fonts, and finally give
     a drive and path for them
  9) You will now see a list of fonts. Click on each font you want to
     install. Then click the Add button. Each font will appear on the left 
     side of your screen. You can make these fonts Permanent at this point
     or leave them as Temporary. (DeskJet owners *must* make each font 
     Permanent. Temporary DeskJet soft fonts are not supported by the 
     current Windows driver.)
 10) That's it. The fonts are installed in Windows.


  Some applications will not automatically recognize soft fonts installed
  into Windows. These program want to you reconfigure the printer before 
  they will recognize these new fonts. Word for Windows is an example of 
  this type of program. To get Word for Windows to recognize the new fonts,
  at the File Menu:

    1) Click on "Printer Setup"
    2) Click the button "Setup"
    3) Click "Ok", then click "Ok" again.


**Using ESF Fonts With WordStar 5.5/6.0

  Fonts can be added to WordStar using two utility programs supplied by 
  MicroPro. The WordStar Customizing/Printer manual explains how to do 
  this. Basically, you run the LSRFONTS program from the WINSTALL menu and
  add fonts to your WordStar printer data file. Then you run the PRCHANGE 
  file to move these new definitions to your current printer driver. Note 
  that WordStar does not download soft fonts for you. We suggest a tool 
  like our TSR Download to help in the managing and downloading of your 
  soft fonts.


**Using ESF Fonts With WordStar 2000

  The WordStar 2000 program has a built in tool that lets you add soft font
  information to any existing printer driver. First determine what printer
  driver your document is using. Then, from the main WS 2000 menu press A 
  for Additional, then select HP Fonts. Follow the instructions here and 
  add new font information to your driver. Note that WordStar does not 
  download soft fonts for you. We suggest a tool like our TSR Download to 
  help in the managing and downloading of your soft fonts.

  
**Using ESF Fonts With Other Programs

  The ASCII text file FONTS.TXT, available to registered users, specifies 
  the font selection strings and character width tables necessary to access 
  these soft fonts. This information can be used to install these fonts in 
  other applications.

  We are now ready to unpack the printer driver for WordPerfect 5.1 and put
  this driver into your WordPerfect subdirectory. After that is done, you 
  will be given the option of printing a copy of the installation instruc-
  tions that must be followed to add these soft fonts to WordPerfect. Once
  these fonts are properly installed into WordPerfect, they will appear any
  time you attempt to change the base font (<Ctrl><F8> option).

  Installing our driver for WordPerfect is fairly simple. Our driver adds 
  information to your existing driver, so you will not lose any fonts you 
  already have. Installing our driver is a three step process. You add our
  font information to your existing driver, then activate those fonts for
  your particular printer, and finally re-install this updated driver from
  within WordPerfect. For more information print the full installation 
  instructions next.
