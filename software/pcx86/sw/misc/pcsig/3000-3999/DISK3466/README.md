This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
900 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'INSTALL' at
the DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy
access to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.  All the programs are logically divided into thirteen
major categories with subcategories, making it easier to find just the
right software.

All of the programs have been scanned for viruses.  There are also three
online virus utilities that can be run from the CD-ROM which will scan,
screen and clean viruses.  Not only does this save hard disk space, but
also gives every user added security from viruses.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

Winner of the Optical Publishing Assn's Best Consumer Product Award.

Shareware for every imaginable need: Accounting Chemistry Educational
Engineering Games Hypertext Networks Programming Spreadsheets Utilities
Word Processing

Additional BBS file descriptions are available from PC-SIG so that the
CD-ROM can be set up quickly on a bulletin board.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 530K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
a graphics monitor (Hercules/EGA/VGA/SVGA).  A mouse is optional.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.


                      The PC-SIG Games CD-ROM
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now you can play a game a day fo over a year.  This CD-ROM is jammed
with over 380 shareware games of all types, designed to appeal to the
new generation of CD-ROM users out for fun.  The CD incorporates a
hypermedia interface and allows 250 of the games to be played directly
from the CD-ROM.

The hottest games in shareware are on this disk, including the
action/arcade games "Jill of the Jungle" and "Wolfenstein 3D," which
rival or surpass commercial PC and Nintendo for use of animation,
SoundBlaster audio, and VGA graphics.  There are also games designed to
teach children mathematics, spelling and even ecology.  All these games
for less than a dime each!

Over 250 of the games can be played directly from the CD without copying
them to a floppy or a hard drive.  Being able to run from the CD means
that users can explore games without using up valuable hard disk space
or spending time downloading and deleting files.  The hypermedia
interface makes it easy to browse the titles, read a one line
description or full review, and copy or start a game by clicking the
mouse or using the keyboard.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

                    SHAPE SHOOTER 1.0
                    
           Copyright (C) 1991  Craig P. Thompson

                    Way Out West-ware
                    P.O. BOX 353
                    Gilbert, AZ  85234
                    
SHAPE SHOOTER is a powerful graphics designer and animator that
enables programmers to quickly produce high quality graphics
for use in games and other applications requiring animation.

Even if you are not a programmer, you can have fun designing
your own animation sequences.  The Microsoft QuickBasic (tm)
source code (DEMO.BAS) is included to illustrate how to use 
the data that SHAPE SHOOTER produces in your own QuickBasic (tm)
programs.

To get started, try loading the shapes TEX1.WOW, TEX2.WOW, and
TEX3.WOW into the first three frames and select F8 to animate 
them.  Then you will be ready to create your own Kung-Fu thugs,
Cosmic Conveyances, and Jungle Slime to use in your own programs.

SHAPE SHOOTER is the copyrighted property of Craig Thompson of
Way Out West-ware, and is distributed as SHAREWARE.  You are
granted a limited license to use SHAPE SHOOTER and to copy and
distribute it, provided that the following conditions are met:

        1.  No fee may be charged for such copying and
            distribution aside from a nominal disk copying
            fee.

        2.  SHAPE SHOOTER may only be distributed in its
            original, unmodified form, complete with data
            files and this documentation.

You are encouraged to make copies of, and allow others to make
copies of this program - but only if all original files are
complete and unmodified.  We retain all other rights.  In no
case do we give the right to make, copy or distribute modified
versions of, or works derived from, the executable or document
files.

As SHAPE SHOOTER is SHAREWARE, if you decide to keep the program
beyond a two or three day evaluation period, you must register
it by sending a check or money order for $10.00 to
Way Out West-ware at the above address.

Alternatively, you can become a registered user of the latest
release of SHAPE SHOOTER and receive a disk full of demo shapes
by sending $15.00 to Way Out West-ware.  Please make a
note of the version you currently have and whether you would
like 3½" or 5¼" diskettes.

Thank you in advance for supporting the SHAREWARE concept.
I would also like this opportunity to thank God for giving me
the ability to write this program, and my wife Robyn Leah for
her undying patience during the many hours I spent in front of
the computer.

                    SHAPE SHOOTER 1.0
                    
           Copyright (C) 1991  Craig P. Thompson

                    Way Out West-ware
                    P.O. BOX 353
                    Gilbert, AZ  85234

                    Help / Documentation
                    
SPACE = PEN UP/DN

      Press the SPACE bar to move your 'Pen' up or down.  With
      the Pen Down, pressing the cursor keys results in drawing
      in the current color.  With the Pen Up, you are free to
      move the cursor around in the frame without drawing.

DEL   = DELETE

      Press the Delete key to toggle between the DRAW and DELETE
      modes.  In DELETE mode, pressing the cursor keys deletes
      areas of your shape like a pencil eraser.

C     = CIRCLE

      Press C to mark the center of the circle.  Then move the
      cursor to any point on the perimeter of the circle, and
      press C again to complete the circle.

L     = LINE

      Press L to mark the first endpoint of the line.  Then move 
      the cursor to the second endpoint and press L again to
      complete the line.

F     = FILL

      Press F to fill an area within the frame with the current
      color.
      
      NOTE:  You must be sure that the area you want to fill is 
      completely bordered by pixels of the current (fill) color.  
      Otherwise, the color will 'leak' out filling the whole frame.
      Be CAREFUL using this option!  It is a good idea to
      save the frame you are working on before using FILL.

      Also, make sure the Pen is Up, and the cursor is positioned 
      on a pixel of some color other than the current (fill) color 
      prior to pressing F.

F1  = FRAME
      
      Press F1 to jump to another FRAME.  Up to 64 frames can
      be edited at one time with this version of SHAPE SHOOTER.
      
      Press shift-F1 to dynamically resize the current FRAME.
      The maximum (default) frame dimensions are 64,48 but you
      may wish to reduce these when designing small shapes.

F2  = COLOR

      Press F2 to change the current COLOR.  The sixteen color
      choices are shown at the bottom of the screen.

      Press shift-F2 to change the current COLOR in the opposite
      direction.

F3  = SHIFT

      Press F3 to SHIFT the shape in the current frame one pixel
      up, down, left or right.  If you shift part of a shape off
      the edge of the frame, that portion of the shape is lost,
      and will not reappear when you shift the shape the opposite
      direction.

F4  = ANIMATE

      Press F4 to enter ANIMATE mode.  The first frame will appear
      in the upper right corner of the screen.  Now use the up and
      down cursor keys to see the shapes you have created (and the
      shapes you have loaded (F6) into any of SHAPE SHOOTER's 64
      frames.

      Define the animation sequence to SHAPE SHOOTER by pressing
      the Enter key on the frames you want to include, in the order
      you would like them displayed.  If you make a mistake, you
      can delete the latest frame from the sequence by pressing
      the Delete key.  Should you really botch things up, you can
      start over by pressing the Esc key.

      When you have defined the animation sequence, press F4 again.
      You should see your shapes zipping along in the sequence you
      established just like the Saturday morning cartoons.

      At this point, you can increase the animation delay by
      pressing the "D" key, decrease the delay by pressing the
      "d" key, or exit ANIMATE mode by again pressing F4.

F5  = SAVE

      Press F5 to SAVE the current frame to a disk file.  You can
      specify the drive and path in addition to the filename.  If
      you do not specify an extension, '.WOW' will be used (for
      Way Out West-ware).

F6  = LOAD

      Press F6 to LOAD a shape from disk into the current frame.
      You can specify the drive and path in addition to the
      filename.  If you do not specify an extension, '.WOW' will
      be used (for Way Out West-ware).  To load several shapes
      from disk, use F6 to load the first one, then use F1 to jump
      to another frame, then repeat the process.

F7  = COPY

      Press F7 to COPY the current frame to another frame.  This
      is useful for making slight changes to a basic shape for
      animation.  After you enter the number of the destination
      frame, the frame you copied TO becomes the current frame.

F8  = GEN DATA

      Press F8 to GENERATE DATA statements to be used in your own
      Microsoft QuickBasic (tm) programs.  Enter the name of the
      file in which you would like SHAPE SHOOTER to place the 
      CURRENT FRAME data.  You can choose to Append the data to an
      existing file, or create a new file.  You should not append
      data to a program that was saved in QuickBasic's fast Load
      and Save format.  
      
      If you are creating a new file, SHAPE SHOOTER will prompt
      you for a FILE Comment.  This is translated into a QuickBasic
      label in your program.  Do not put any spaces in the file
      comment.  It is useful if you need to use the BASIC restore
      command to reset the data pointer to a particular block of
      DATA statements.

      Finally, you will be prompted for a FRAME comment.  This can
      be any sentence you choose to comment the data statements
      for the current frame.

F9  = CLEAR

      Press F9 to CLEAR (erase) the shape in the current frame.
      SHAPE SHOOTER asks you to confirm that you want to clear
      the frame by pressing Y.  Pressing any other key aborts this
      function.

F10 = FLIP

      Press F10 to FLIP the shape in the current frame from left
      to right.

      Press shift-F10 to FLIP the shape from top to bottom.

ALT-H = HELP

      This function needs no explanation since you must have
      pressed it to see this information.  Press ESC to resume
      editing.

ALT-D = DOS

      Press ALT-D to spawn a DOS shell.  Here you can issue DOS
      commands, then type EXIT (and press the Enter key) to
      resume editing.

ESC   = QUIT

      Press ESC to exit SHAPE SHOOTER.  Remember to save (F5) any
      frames you have updated before exiting SHAPE SHOOTER.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
