  DAYO, what is it?

     DAYO is a multiuser, personal computer based, business application
  consisting of many programs (called modules). The many facets of a
  business are broken down into these modules, ie: Inventory Control,
  Point of Sale (POS), Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, General
  Ledger, Smart Reports, and many more. A company may elect to use all
  or just some of the DAYO modules. The most popular modules are Inventory,
  POS, Accounts Receivable and Smart Reports. DAYO was created to run
  on PC networks like Novell (tm) and LANtastic (tm), but are often
  used on 'standalone' personal computers.


  Is DAYO an integrated system?

     The entire DAYO application is totally integrated, which means there
  is NO additional effort applied to re-entering data once entered into
  any one module, ie: customer, vendor and item information.


  Who was it written for?

     DAYO was written with the user in mind. Compare it to others and you
  will see the difference in the screen design, and the greater available
  of data. Users include retailers, distributors, suppliers, manufacturers,
  consultants and attorneys. Any business or organization that sells
  a product or service can use DAYO.


  Is DAYO easy to use?

     Despite the many configuration options, the applications are easy
  to operate, and by default are ready to go at time of installation!
  But should you desire to change DAYO to operate differently, you can.
  There are hundreds of configurable settings easily modified from within
  the modules.


  Who wrote DAYO?

     DAYO was written by Thomas (Tom) Johnson, a graduate of the University
  of South Carolina at Aiken (B.S., 1985). Tom's experience includes
  programming for the college, the army (he is a former Army Officer),
  manufacturing companies, major computer sales and service companies,
  and years of special programming & consulting. Whenever necessary,
  outside consultants were used to help develop some of the modules,
  ie: General Ledger.

   DAYO BUSINESS APPLICATIONS                                       Page: 2



  What was DAYO written in?

     DAYO is entirely written in Clipper (tm), a fourth generation language.
  It consists of 27+ modules/programs, and over 250,000 lines of code.


  What about documentation?

     There is plenty of DAYO documentation (user manuals). Every DAYO module
  has its own document file and printed manual. There are over 3500
  pages of documentation; all found on disks accompanying the modules.
  The documentation is always accessible from within the modules by
  pressing the F1 key. The documentation is also pre-formatted and 'paginated';
  ready to be printed on your printer. Note, set your printer to print
  extended ASCII characters, to print at 6 lines per inch, and to print
  at 10 or 12 pitch. Printed manuals are supplied with registration.


  What are the names of the modules?

    Current Modules:

    Inventory         Back Orders             Smart Reports
    Point of Sale     Accounts Receivable     Materials Requirement Planning II
    Price Book        Accounts Payable        Menu
    Quotes            General Ledger          Clock
    Index             Look Up Databases       Payroll
    Passwords         End of Period/Purge     Bar Codes 3 of 9
    Time & Billing    Little POS              Update & Conversion
    Simple POS        Rental POS              Refunds & Returns POS

    Soon to be Released:

    Report Writer     Graphic Reports         Contact Management
    Upgraded MRP      Personal Calendar


  So how does it work?

     DAYO is essentially divided into two key parts, Accounts Receivable
  (AR) and Accounts Payable (AP). Key DAYO AR modules include POS, Quotes
  and AR. Inventory and AP are the two major components of AP. AR is
  the process of creating invoices, billing, and the maintenance of
  the receivables (unpaid invoices). AP is your inventory, purchasing,
  and the maintenance of your payables (what you owe your vendors or
  creditors).

     Initially, you would enter/type in your inventory items, vendors,
  and customers. Note, you can do this 'on the fly' too...

     The inventory module is used to maintain your inventory and vendors.
  Use it also to create purchase orders and later to receive purchase
  orders into inventory. Your inventory can consist of products or services,
  or a mixture of both.

   DAYO BUSINESS APPLICATIONS                                       Page: 3



     With quantity in inventory, you can create invoices or work orders
  with the Point of Sale (POS) module. Note, you can set the POS configuration
  to ignore inventory quantities (allow you to invoice with no regard
  to what is onhand in inventory).

     Use Quotes to create a listing of inventory items/products at user
  determined prices for your customers. These quotes can later be transferred
  into POS without any re-entry of data.

     At a schedule determined by the user, invoices are posted into AR,
  and receipts of purchase orders are posted into AP. This posting is
  merely the pressing of a menu option and can be performed daily, weekly,
  monthly or whenever...


  How hard is it to get something changed?

     Once changes are agreed upon, they are usually done within 72 hours!
  If the user has a modem, the changes/modifications can be delivered
  almost immediately! TJS LAB charges a maximum of $35.00 per hour for changes,
  but 'price breaks' are given if the change is to be permanently incorporated
  into the system.


  What about support?

     It is the policy of TJS LAB to give DAYO users 1 year of limited
  telephone support (407) 291-3960 between the hours of 9:00am to 5:00pm
  Monday through Friday EST.  We will answer and provide solutions to
  all problems relating to DAYO. Check with your local distributor for
  additional support and/or services.


  Can I get a demonstration of this program?

    Check with a local Shareware Distributor, and ask for a Shareware,
  Demonstration or Show disk(s). DAYO can be found on most BBSs, Compuserve,
  and our own Board (407) 292-4921 (2400-8-N-1). The Shareware versions of
  DAYO can be found from SHAREWARE Disk Distributors like PC-SIG
  (800-245-6717 operator 2225) or PsL (800-242-4775).



  Requirements

    DAYO requires DOS 3.3+, 640K, a hard disk with plenty of disk space,
  and an IBM (tm) compatible PC.

  DAYO APPLICATIONS DESCRIPTIONS:


  INVENTORY

    DAYO Inventory is a Multiuser Inventory Control, Purchasing, and Vendor
 Maintenance application. Use DAYO Inventory to create and maintain an
 inventory of any product. Create and print purchase orders on a standard
 printer or a Hewlett Packard LaserJet (tm). Receive purchase orders into
 inventory, with the option of printing receivers ('key recs'), and inventory
 tags/price labels. Maintain a Vendors database complete with the vendors
 purchasing history. With the exception of the initial and ongoing data entry
 of new product and vendors, DAYO Inventory is totally menu driven. Since DAYO
 Inventory is multiuser, it is capable of operating on most of the PC based
 networks, ie Novell (tm). Other features include Reports, Labels, Lists, and
 a Graph. A simple database management module is also included to provide you
 with additional means to modify, view, and report your data. The ability to
 upgrade your system is available with the addition of supporting DAYO
 products (ie: DAYO POS, DAYO EOP, DAYO AP, and more...).


  POS & Billing & Invoicing

      DAYO POS (Point of Sale) is a Billing and Invoicing application for any
  size business. It is the DAYO module that permits you to invoice out your
  products while keeping an accurate record of all your 'sales'.  Features
  include:  Multiuser (ie: Novell), Registers, Quote Interface (to DAYO
  Quotes), Templates, Back Orders, Data Entry Validation, Cash Drawers (Serial
  or Parallel), Databases are dBase (tm) compatible, HP Laser Special
  Invoices, Preprinted Invoices, Standard Invoices, Packing/Shipping Lists,

  may be printed to a standard printer, or to a Hewlett Packard (tm) Laserjet
  or compatible. It requires the presence of DAYO Inventory and DAYO POS
  (Point of Sale) programs/databases.

      Customers are invoiced (with DAYO POS), using the price in the inventory
  database (INV.DBF), or with one of the special Price Book methods:

      Fixed          -  Fixed Price for a Unique Item + Customer (1st Priority)
      Margin         -  'Cost Plus'                              (2nd Priority)

   DAYO BUSINESS APPLICATIONS                                       Page: 5


  QUOTES

      DAYO Quotes creates sales order quotes based on the DAYO Inventory,
  Customer, and other DAYO databases. Quotes can be printed on a standard
  printer or a Hewlett Packard (tm) Laserjet compatible printer. The quote can
  be printed on a pre-printed form, on the Laser printer in a special laser
  format, or as a standard/default form. DAYO Quotes closely models itself
  after the DAYO POS (Point of Sale) application and is totally integrated
  with that application. Templates (kits or bundles), are supported.


  INDEX

      DAYO INDEX is a program designed to manage the indexing of the DAYO
  databases. DAYO applications all have multiple indexes, and because it is
  recommended that they be reindexed at least once daily, DAYO Index was
  created to simplify this process.


  PASSWORDS

      DAYO PASSWORDS provide DAYO Business Application users with a system of
  database security through the use of passwords. Its use is optional, but
  recommended in areas where more than one person has access to the data.


  DAYO BACK ORDERS

      DAYO BACK ORDERS is the maintenance module for the processing of all
  your customers/sales backorders. DAYO BO (working with DAYO POS) determines
  and manages the filling (allocation) of your customers backorders. It does
  this through an allocation process that determines what backordered items
  are 'fillable' because of receipts into the inventory. Creates the same type
  invoices as DAYO POS.

      DAYO AR is the 'final chapter' to the processing and maintenance of all
  your Receivables. DAYO AR includes routines to handle cash receipts,
  customers, invoice types, terms, taxcodes, sales persons, and more. Many

  to print Statements (ie: SMART, 90, 60, 30 days), and another one to create
  and print 'non' standard invoices (not applicable to DAYO POS). HP Laser
  forms are provided as an option for Statements and Invoices.


  AP (ACCOUNTS PAYABLE)

      DAYO AP is the 'final chapter' to the processing and maintenance of all
  your Payables. DAYO AP's key mission is to process/post your purchase orders,
  however, many other routines have been provided, ie: Expense Maintenance,
  1099 MISC Forms, Purchase Clearing, Vendor Maintenance, Hand/Manual Checks,
  Batch Checks, Recurring Checks, Unlimited Bank Accounts, Unlimited Check
  Printing Formats and over 21 Reports.

   DAYO BUSINESS APPLICATIONS                                       Page: 9


 ■ DAYO RENTAL POS

      DAYO RENTAL POS (Point of Sale) is a Billing and Invoicing application
  for any business that rents items, equipment, or services, ie: Videos,
  Tapes, Furniture, Tools, Appliances, etc. This program requires the regular
  DAYO POS module for its reports and configuration settings. It is by default
  a multiuser system, allowing almost unlimited numbers of users to have the
  ability to simultaneously invoice using this one program on a PC based
  LAN/Network. It can however, be run (like all DAYO products) as a
  'standalone' application.


  DAYO BAR CODE 3 of 9

      DAYO BAR CODE prints 3 of 9 bar codes onto an Epson (tm) or IBM (tm)
  compatible dot matrix printer. It is integrated with the DAYO Inventory and
  the DAYO Customer databases. It can be used as a standalone application if
  you just have a limited number of labels to print, or have no use for an
  inventory control or account receivable application. Labels are printed onto
  standard labels (3.5 by 15/16 inches at 6 lines per inch). The inventory bar
  code label consists of an item number, its bar code, with the option to also
  print the vendor item number, description, unit of issue, weight, and
  bin/location. The customer bar code label consists of a customer number, its
  bar code, with the option to also print the customer's name and telephone
  number.


 ■ DAYO LITTLE POS

      DAYO Little POS consists of only the invoicing routines found in the
  main DAYO POS application. It requires much less memory, increases
  security (keeps users out of Configuration), and is recommended for
  network users (where memory is always at a premium). Requires DAYO POS or
  DAYO Billing & Invoicing.


 ■ DAYO SIMPLE POS

      DAYO Simple POS, like Little POS, consists of only the invoicing
  routines found in the main DAYO POS application. It was created for
  fast paced counter sales, where prices are fixed, and invoices can
  be quickly processed. Does not allow for selecting customers; all sales
  are credited to a CASH account. Requires DAYO POS or DAYO Billing &
  Invoicing.


 ■ DAYO RETURNS & REFUNDS POS

      DAYO Returns & Refunds POS was created to make return and/or refund
  invoices easier. Under normal DAYO POS settings, the option to return
  something may not always be possible (ie: the inventory override option
  is turned on). Requires DAYO POS or DAYO Billing & Invoicing.
