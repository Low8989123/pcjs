```
Version 2.0

-  SOUND BLASTER support added. Has an intro theme and
   great sound throught the entire game!

-  Libraries added so you can do research on items or
   people or just about anything.  This is good because
   sometimes the citizens don't exactly give you real
   complete info.

-  All input is now done with the left mouse button.
   Helps alleviate some of the confusions.

-  No problems with the royal purchaser.

Version 1.8
-  Problems with reading in the proper icon caused
   players much grief in battling the evil end
   monsters!!  But I've wiped out any trace of that
   buggy little critter. (how embarassing!)

-  Problems when you fought monsters with your hands
   has been eradicated.

-  Boss creature databases where corrupt, fixed that.

-  Better looking graphical tiles.

-  Difficulty levels added (yay!)

Version 1.5
-  Totally reprogrammed user interface.  Everything
   is completely mouse-driven.  The only time you
   have to touch the keyboard is when you run
   the program.  Makes it much easier to play and
   get into, you DON'T have to worry about all
   the different keys!

-  Lots of more original monsters to deal with.

-  You can now bribe and talk to creatures not just
   attack them.

-  Levers allow you open and close doors further down
   in the dungeons.

-  More modular layout allows easier inclusion of
   player enhancements and monster additions.

-  Monsters are better balanced.

-  Eliminated problems with the weapons data base.

-  Easier quest layout for the player.

-  Character creation allows for multiple characters
   to be used, in different quests.
