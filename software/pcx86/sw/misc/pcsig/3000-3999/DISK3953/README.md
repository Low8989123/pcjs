The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

                          212-427-1805 (data)


	DFF is available free of charge to the general public. You may not
charge for its use without the written permission of the author. Feel
free to distribute this program freely provided that no fee is charged
for such copying and distribution, and that it is distributed ONLY in
its original, unmodified state. No `shareware registration' is asked
for or expected. Of course, if you want to send something anyway  well
I am not crazy... 

	DFF is a fast file finder. It can search one or more drives for one
or more filenames. It will work fine on both local and `Network'
drives. It does all of the things that Norton's (tm) "FF" will do plus
a few additional things. I originally wrote DFF because FF was so slow
on large network drives. It used to make me crazy to stare at a blank
screen for endless seconds wondering what was going on while the
network server squeaked away madly. DFF displays the current
subdirectory that it is searching, so you always know what it is
doing.

	By default DFF searches for a file from the "root" directory of the
current drive. If your search argument includes a path, DFF will only
search `under' that path. You can tell DFF to search specific drives,
specific paths, scan across multiple drives or any combination.
Command line switches can be given anywhere on the command line. If
two switches conflict, the last switch given takes precedence.


Below are the possible command line switches:

 /D	-	Search All Drives Starting With The Current Drive
 /C	-	Search All Drives Starting With Drive C:
 /Dx	-	Search All Drives Starting With Drive 'x'
 /M{#}	-	Limit Matches - Default Is One
 /N	-	Non-Stop Mode - Do Not Pause After Full Screen
 /Q	-	Quiet... Do Not Display Search In Progress


Redirection:

	If you want to capture DFF's output, just redirect it to any file.
DFF will continue to write to BOTH the screen and your output file. If
you are redirecting it, DFF will not pause after every screen. In the
example below, DFF will search for two files on all drives starting
from C: - its output is sent to "capture.lst".

		DFF /C weird.com fanny.flg >FOUND.LST    
Examples:


DFF zazupit.d*		-	Search Only Current Drive

DFF .\sludg.*		-	Search From Current Directory

DFF ..\Snit.*		-	Search Start From Parent Directory

DFF zazupit.d*    /M 	-	Stop After First Match

DFF zazupit.d*    /M3	-	Stop After 3 Matches

DFF zazupit.d*    /C	-	Search All Drives Starting With C:

DFF zazupit.d*    /D	-	Search All Drives Starting With Current

DFF zazupit.d*    /Dd	-	Search All Drives Starting With D:

DFF d:\zazupit.d* /D	-	Search All Drives Starting With D:

DFF this that     /C	-	Search For This.* and That.* on All Drives
                                   Start with C:

Changes From DFF.exe Version 1:

-	Screen Pause added. DFF now pauses after every screen full of data
   and waits for the user to press a key to continue. This can be
   disabled by the /N(onstop) switch. DFF examines the Video table to
   determin the number of lines per screen.

-	Quiet mode added. Although DFF was originally written to display
   the directories it searched, some people found this irritating. The
   /Q(uiet) switch will make DFF less verbose.

-	Matches Limit. The /M(atches) switch was added to allow the user to
   limit the search to the first xxx matches. In really large network
   environments this can be really handy.

-	Redirection. DFF version 1 wrote to a log file specified by a
   command line argument. Most users preferred to simply redirect the
   output. DFF now sense redirection and adjusts its output
   accordingly. 

-	DFF version 1 started searching multiple drives with the /D(rives).
   Adding a "+" to the /D would tell DFF to start searching from drive
   "C:". I don't know where I cam up with that particular bit of
   logic. Although /D+ works the same way, the /C switch tells DFF to
   search multiple drives starting with drive C:. A /DC would also do
   the same thing.  

-	Additional logic was added so that DFF would search with the same
   wild card expansion as DOS - Specifying "FOO" would search for
   "FOO.*", and "FOO*" would search for "FOO*.*".


Changes From DFF.exe Version 2:

-	DFF2 was still born. A a last minute typo in my "make" file caused
   the /D switch to be disabled. Although this error was caught within
   24 hours, it seemed prudent to release DFF under a new version
   number.

                    Composing Messages for MCI Mail
                    ========= ======== === === ====

                 by Pete Maclean, 8th September, 1990.



Preparing outgoing messages
--------- -------- --------
When you use MCI Mail in terminal mode, it prompts you for every element that 
is required in an envelope:  Tos, CCs, Subject, etc.  When preparing a message 
for Emma to upload to MCI, you must compose not only the text of your message 
but the envelope as well.

Outgoing messages should be created, one per file, using a word processor or 
editor that produces text in pure ASCII.  Here is a simple example:

     To:  Emma Peel
     To:  John Steed
     Cc:  Mother
     Subject:  Dead mice

     The message text starts here and continues...

Every message must have an envelope and a text.  Messages sent to other MCI Mail 
subscribers may also have one or more attachments (as described below).  Each 
message starts with an envelope that serves to identify the addressees and the 
subject.

The basic components of an envelope are addresses and a subject.  Addresses are 
specified as TO:'s and CC:'s.  An envelope must start with a TO: address.  That 
is followed by as many more TO:'s as you need and then, optionally, some CC:'s.  
The envelope is normally completed by a single SUBJECT: line but this may be 
omitted.  The envelope must contain no blank lines but must be separated from 
the message text by a blank line.

Do not include a FROM: line.  MCI Mail adds that on your behalf as well as 
inserting a line recording the time and date that the message was mailed.

Each line of an envelope begins with a keyword, such as "to" or "subject", 
followed by a colon.  MCI is case insensitive; you can write in uppercase, 
lowercase or any mixture.  Any amount of blank space may separate the colon and 
the text that follows.

You must use exactly one TO: or CC: line per addressee.  Extra information may 
be necessary to complete each address as discussed below for the various 
possible cases.

It is a good idea to make a template envelope for each correspondent or group 
to whom you'll frequently be sending messages.  Then, when the time comes to 
post a piece of mail, you need only insert the envelope at the start of the 
message and perhaps edit the subject field.



Templates
---------
Emma is accompanied by a batch of template message files to guide you in 
composing your own.  These files are:

     COMPUSRV.MSG    a model for sending to a CompuServe subscriber.
     FAX.MSG         for taking advantage of MCI's fax dispatch.
     INTERNET.MSG    for sending to an Internet mailbox.
     MCI_MBOX.MSG    for addressing another MCI-Mail subscriber.
     PAPER.MSG       for generating paper messages.
     TELEX.MSG       for directing a message to a telex machine.



Addressing Other MCI Subscribers
---------- ----- --- -----------
If the addressee's name is unique among MCI Mail subscribers then it is 
sufficient to provide the name alone, but it must be spelled precisely.  If you 
know the party's MCI Mail ID then it is wise to include that too.  If the name 
is not unique then some other item of information must be included and the ID is 
the surest.  Follow the name with a slash and then the ID as in:

     To: Emma Peel/123-4567


Fax Machines
--- --------
List the name of the person to whom the fax is directed on the TO: or CC: line 
followed by "(fax)".  Then add a line giving the fax number as in this example:

     TO:  Beautiful Zelda (fax)
          Faxno:  415-555-5555


Telex Machines
----- --------
Again list the name of the intended recipient on the TO: or CC: line then add 
the full telex number and answerback as in:

     To: John Steed
         TLX: 123456789 BROLLY



CompuServe Subscribers
---------- -----------
Put the subscriber's name on the TO: or CC: line then complete the address as 
in this example:

     To: Miles Pickens
          EMS: COMPUSERVE
          MBX: 22222,222

The MBX: line carries the CompuServe ID of the addressee.



Paper Mail
----- ----
When a message is to be printed and hand delivered, a suitable address must be 
given.  Here are two examples:

     To:       John Smith (PAPER <options>)
               Company:  First Class Widgets
               Line1:    1750 Meadow Road
               Line2:    Suite 100
               City:     Anytown
               State:    Virginia
               Code:     22102

     To:       Jane Brown (PAPER <options>)
               Company:  British Widgets
               Line1:    40 Queen Street
               City:     London
               Code:     W1A 2F
               Country:  England

Any field that is not needed in a given address may be omitted, but a foreign 
address must include the Country.

The <options> field can contain such standard MCI options as "receipt", "onite",
etc.



Internet Mail
-------- ----
Here is a template for sending mail via MCI to the Internet.  The Internet 
address follows the "mbx:" on the third line.

               To:  An Internet mailbox (ems)
                    EMS: internet
                    MBX: tom@internet_site.dom



Sending to AT&T Mail and TeleMail
------- -- ---- ---- --- --------
MCI Mail has X.400 links to AT&T Mail and TeleMail.  Addressing mail to users of 
these particular systems is a bit more difficult than other cases so I'm taking 
the liberty of omitting instructions here.  If you need the information, connect 
to MCI Mail in terminal mode and enter a command such as:

          HELP ADDRESS ATTMAIL
     or   HELP ADDRESS TELEMAIL



More on addressing messages
---- -- ---------- --------
You may direct a message to addressees in any combination of the above 
categories.  For example, you might send a message TO: another MCI subscriber 
with a CC: to someone else's fax machine and another CC: to a third person via 
telex.  Sometimes, if I have a very urgent message for someone, I'll send copies 
to his MCI mailbox, his fax machine and his Internet mailbox -- given, of 
course, that he has all three.

Some people have written companion programs to compose messages for Emma.  I 
find my word processor to be sufficent for the purpose.

The foregoing sections provide only the rudiments of MCI Mail addressing.  
Addresses can get much more complex.  For more information on creating 
addresses (except for faxes) see The Complete MCI Mail Handbook by Stephen 
Manes (Bantam Books, 1988).



Attachments
-----------
Attachments are PC files that are sent along with a message.  They are permitted 
-- indeed they make sense -- only for messages that are directed to other MCI 
Mail subscribers.  Furthermore, in order to retrieve a message with attachments, 
a recipient must use Emma, Lotus Express or some other special interface 
program.  Attachments are not accessible to subscribers who use MCI Mail in 
terminal mode.

Attachments are specified by envelope lines that have special meaning to Emma.  
Here is an example:

          To: John Steed/283-6437
          Subject: New software.
          Attach:  EMMA.ASM
          Attach:  EMMA.COM

          Here are the source and executable of the latest version of
          Emma.

When Emma receives a message with attachments, it writes each one to a file of 
the same name (that is the name given by the sender) provided that no similarly 
named file already exists.  When there is a name conflict, rather than risk 
overwriting an existing file, Emma creates another file called ATTACHED.xxx 
where "xxx" is replaced by some unique extension.  A notice is appended to the 
incoming message alerting the user to each attachment and indicating what file 
it has been stored on.  Here is a copy of the message shown above as it might 
look when received by Emma:

          Date:     Sat Feb 13, 1989  1:23 pm  PDT
          From:   * Pete Maclean / MCI ID: 263-7215

          TO:       John Steed / MCI ID: 283-6437
          Subject:  New software.
 
          Here are the source and executable of the latest version of
          Emma.

          ATTACHMENT: EMMA.ASM
          STORED ON FILE: EMMA.ASM
          ATTACHMENT: EMMA.COM
          STORED ON FILE: ATTACHED.376



Some tips for composing messages
---- ---- --- --------- --------

* No line in any part of a message should have more than 80 characters.

* Messages may contain only printable ASCII characters.  (That means characters 
  you can see plus carriage returns, linefeeds, tabs, and formfeeds.  Use 
  formfeeds to indicate page boundaries in faxes and paper letters.)

* Each outgoing message must be saved on a separate .OUT file.

* Avoid saving a partially composed message on a file called ANYTHING.OUT.
  Should you forget about it, it may get sent before you intend it to be.

* Don't forget the blank line between the envelope and the text.

* When replying to a message you can extract the lines that specify the From: 
  address and insert it in the envelope of your response, changing the "From" 
  to "To".

* Attachments may be included only with messages sent to MCI mailboxes.

                                    Emma
                                    ====

                         Documentation for version 2.2

                              by Pete Maclean
                              -- ---- -------

(Note for users upgrading to 2.2:  a summary of new features is given at the end 
of this document.  There is also a new section on using Emma with an MNP modem.)

I have prepared this document to accompany Emma, the PC/MS-DOS version of my MCI 
Mail utility published by PC Magazine.  While this document is intended to be a 
complete user's guide to Emma, users may benefit from also reading my original 
article about it in PC Magazine (Issue 19, November 14, 1989).  Note that there 
is a special version of Emma available for the Atari Portfolio palmtop computer.

Each time you run Emma it attempts to connect to MCI Mail, upload any messages 
you have prepared to your outbox, and download any messages waiting in your 
inbox.  Emma can handle messages of all kinds including those to be sent to fax 
machines, telex machines, Internet mailboxes, CompuServe subscribers and other 
networks via X.400 gateways.

Without a program like Emma, one connects to MCI Mail in what is called 
"terminal mode."  Terminal-mode operation involves a lot of manual work and 
bypasses one of MCI's most powerful features, the ability to ship arbitrary 
files to other MCI subscribers.  Emma connects to MCI Mail in a different manner 
called "batch mode."  With Emma, you never have to manually interact with MCI's 
computers; Emma becomes your own private MCI agent.

Thanks to a script-file mechanism, Emma can be configured for use in any part of 
the world.  It already has supporters in Canada, Hong Kong, Taiwan and many 
European countries.  If you are using it outside the U.S.A., you may have to 
write your own script file or find another user who has created a suitable one.  
Emma correctly handles messages that contain accented letters and other 
characters from the extended PC character set (that is, with codes of 128 and 
above).

Emma has one major limitation compared to other agent programs:  it has no 
built-in error-correction capability.  Thus it is an ideal utility only for 
those people with suitable error-correcting modems, specifically modems that 
support MNP.  Without such a modem, you should consider using Emma only if you 
normally experience a negligible number of transmission errors when connecting 
to MCI Mail.  Emma does have error-detection capability and guarantees that when 
it completes delivery of a message that message will be free of errors.  Should 
a transmission error intrude, Emma aborts the session.  No data is lost in such 
an event, but any message being transferred at the time must be transferred 
again.

Emma is designed to operate with modems that use the Hayes AT Standard Command 
Set.  Should you have a modem that requires a different command set, you can 
still use Emma but you will have to write a special script to enable it to work 
with that modem.

Before running Emma for the first time, you must customize a script for the 
program to follow in connecting to MCI Mail.  You will do best to start off with 
one of the standard script files included in this package.  Select one as 
follows:

          MNP.CSF      if you have an MNP modem, otherwise
          800.CSF      if you connect, or plan to connect, to MCI Mail on a
                          tollfree number,
          LOCAL.CSF    if you connect, or plan to, via a local telephone number,
          TYMNET.CSF   if you want to connect to MCI Mail via TYMNET.
     or   DATAPAC.CSF  to connect via Canada's DataPac network

Use the DOS COPY command to copy the selected file to a file called EMMA.CSF.  
Then edit EMMA.CSF using an editor or word processor that produces ASCII output, 
and follow the instructions contained within it.



Running Emma
------- ----
Early versions of Emma required a companion program, Bess, to provide 
communication services.  Bess has now been integrated into Emma providing extra 
convenience for almost all users.

To run Emma, enter at the DOS prompt:

          C>emma

Emma must be able to find its script, EMMA.CSF, so normally you should run it in 
the directory where that file resides. 

An alternate method is to set up a batch file to take care of the whole job.  I 
use a batch file that looks like this:


          D:
          CD \MCI
          EMMA

The first command switches to the directory where I manage my electronic mail.  
I call my batch file 1.BAT so, at any DOS prompt, all I have to do is type a 
'1' and press Enter.

Once logged into the MCI Mail system, Emma looks for messages to be uploaded.  
It searches the current directory for files named with an extension of "OUT".  
Hence every message you create should be stored on such a file, e.g., PETE.OUT, 
SALLY.OUT, etc.  When Emma has successfully delivered a message to MCI it 
renames the corresponding file to give it an extension of "MLD" (for mailed).

Having completed any uploads, Emma downloads any waiting messages and appends 
them to a file called MAIL.IN.  As each message is transferred, Emma displays 
the envelope on your screen so that you can know at once who has sent you mail.  
If you miss any of this information, there is no loss since it is all preserved 
in MAIL.IN.

Once Emma has completed its work, you can inspect any new messages by reading 
MAIL.IN with a word processor or a browsing program.  You may want to extract 
certain messages and save them on other files.  After reading your mail it's a 
good idea to delete or rename MAIL.IN so that when you next connect to MCI the 
file will contain only your new mail.



Preparing Outgoing Messages
--------- -------- --------
The format of outgoing messages is described in a separate document file, 
COMPOSE.DOC.



Things to remember when running Emma
------ -- -------- ---- ------- ----

* When you run Emma it must be able to find its script file, EMMA.CSF.

* You can abort a session at any time by pressing the Escape key.  Emma
  ignores any other keyboard input.

* If your modem is not powered on or is disconnected, Emma will probably
  complain about a timeout error.  This is because it sends a command to
  the modem and receives no response.

* If MCI Mail sends an error message to Emma that message will be 
  displayed on your screen.  The only things that MCI is likely to complain
  about are:
               - misformatted envelopes
               - messages directed to unknown addressees
               - messages with ambiguous addressees
               - data damaged by transmission errors

* If MCI Mail rejects a message then Emma terminates the session.  Any
  other messages awaiting transmission are left as they are.  Correct the
  problem or rename the message before running Emma again.

* A "checksum error" is an almost certain indication of a transmission
  error.  If you see one reported, try running Emma again.  If the error
  happens again, you are probably getting connections that are too noisy.

* If you suffer a lot of aborted sessions because of transmission errors a
  good trick to get cleaner connections is to run at a lower speed.  For
  example, should you get frequent failures at 2400 bps, try 1200.  Message
  transfer will take a little longer but, as long as you connect directly
  to MCI Mail, the cost will be the same.

* After you upload a long message or attachment, it may take MCI a considerable
  time to respond, close to two minutes in the worst cases.  This effect is
  internal to MCI Mail; there is nothing that Emma can do to expedite matters.
  If you send a file of several kilobytes, be patient waiting for the
  transaction to complete.  Do not assume that the session is hung if nothing
  happens for a while.

* Without an MNP modem it is unwise to use Emma to send messages or attached
  files that exceed 10 KB.  The chances of the transmission being aborted by
  an error grow with the length of the transaction.  Likewise, if you want to
  transfer several files of substantial size as attachments, you should attach
  each one to a separate message.

* Be very careful if you use WordStar to edit MAIL.IN.  Should you do a save
  to MAIL.IN then WordStar pads the end of the file with Control-Zs, characters
  that some programs including WordStar interpret as end of file markers.  If
  Emma then appends further messages to MAIL.IN these messages appear after
  the Control-Zs so that WordStar will fail to "see" them.  This phenomenon
  may occur with certain other editors as well.

  To be safe, no matter what editor/word processor you use, it is very good
  practice to clear out and delete MAIL.IN each time you read your new mail.
  And in particular never do a save to MAIL.IN.



Writing Scripts
------- -------
Emma needs a script file for four purposes:

     1. To tell it which COM port and what line speed (1200, 2400,...) to use.

     2. To give it the sequence of modem commands and expected responses 
        required to connect to MCI Mail.

     3. To tell it how to login to the MCI systems, which means providing
        your username and password.

     4. To inform it of other options that you may choose.  See the discussion
        of "Advanced Options" below for details of these.

Normally, Emma looks for a script file called EMMA.CSF ("CSF" for connect 
script file), but you can override that by providing Emma with an alternate 
name as a command-line argument.  For example:

          C:\MCI>EMMA REG

tells Emma to use the script on file REG.CSF.  The extension of a script file 
is assumed to be "CSF".

Script files are composed of simple commands written one per line as in the 
following example:

          C     "Calling MCI Mail on an 800 number^M^J"
          P  1  "2400"
          T     "ATDT1-800-234-6245^M"
          R 40  "CONNECT"
          B
          D  2
          T     "^M"
          R 25  "name:"
          T     "username/batch,1ST/password^M"
          M
          R 10  "CLR DTE^M^J"

This is a barebones script to connect to MCI and run a mail-exchange session.  
It serves as an illustration of the most important commands but, in practice, 
you would want a slightly fuller script such as one of those distributed with 
Emma.

Each command is identified by a single letter.  Here is a complete list:

          B - autoset bps
          C - display a comment
          D - delay for a number of seconds
          K - sends a BREAK signal
          L - enable logging of the session to a file (see advanced options)
          M - conduct a mail-exchange session with MCI
          P - configure the COM port to be used for communication
          Q - select quick mode (see advanced options)
          R - wait for an expected reply to arrive
          S - specify an alternate message separator (see advanced options)
          T - transmit a given string

Any command may take up to two arguments:  a numeric argument written as a 
decimal integer and a string enclosed in double quotes.  Command letters and 
arguments are separated by white space, that is spaces and/or tabs.

The command:

          P  1  "2400"

tells Emma to use COM1 and set the speed to 2400 bps.  Every script must contain 
a 'P' command which should appear before any 'T' or 'R' commands.

The command:

          T     "ATDT1-800-234-6245^M"

tells Emma to transmit the given string, a dial command for the modem in this 
example.  Any control characters that are required in strings must be expressed 
using the common keyboard-equivalent notation.  Thus:

          ^M   means a carriage return (Control-M or Enter)
          ^J   signifies a linefeed (Control-J)
          ^L   indicates a formfeed (Control-L)
          ^P   indicates a DLE (Control-P) used as an escape code by some PSNs.

and so on.  Emma ignores any literal control characters included in strings.  
There is one exception to this rule:  horizontal tabs are accepted.

The command:

          R 25  "name:"

tells Emma to wait up to 25 seconds for the string "name:" to be received.  If 
the expected characters do not turn up in the allotted time, Emma aborts the 
session with a timeout diagnostic.

The 'B' command is for the benefit of speed-adjusting modems.  It tells Emma to 
look at the characters arriving from the modem and to decode a speed if such is 
present.  A typical modem response would be "CONNECT 1200".

The 'M' command initiates a session between Emma and MCI Mail using MCI's 
proprietary mail-exchange protocol (MEP2).

The operation of the rest of the basic commands should be evident from the 
above example.  More advanced commands are described below.

You should never have to write a script from scratch.  But if you connect to 
MCI internationally or have a weird modem, you will need to edit one of the 
scripts provided.



Advanced Options
-------- -------

(*).  You may include comment lines in script files for documentation purposes.  
Emma recognizes any line that starts with an asterisk or a semicolon as a 
comment.  Don't confuse these internal comments with the external kind, that is 
comments that are written to the user's screen via the 'C' command.

     C    "This is a comment that is written to the screen^M^J"
     *    This is an internal comment that Emma ignores


(*).  Emma can be run in an optional quick mode designed to minimize connection 
times for those users who have to pay hefty line charges.  In quick mode, Emma 
disconnects very quickly from MCI when there are no messages to be delivered; it 
does not wait for all the commentary that MCI usually sends indicating the 
numbers of messages sent and received.  Quick mode is selected by including a 
'Q' command in your script file.  Here is an example:

     Q    "There are no messages waiting in your INBOX^M^J"

The argument is a string defining a line that Emma can recognize as signifying 
that MCI has no messages waiting for download.  The string must include one 
entire line including the terminating CR and LF.  When Emma spots the given 
line, and if it has no messages to upload, then it terminates the session.  Most 
users who want to use quick mode will do best by copying the above example 
exactly.

I chose to require that the user include the line explicitly in the 'Q' command 
because wiring it into the program might lead to incompatibilities with 
foreign-language versions and future revisions of MCI's system.

There is a means that Emma could use to determine automatically the number of 
INBOX messages, but taking advantage of that would substantially increase the 
connect time!

The 'Q' command may be placed anywhere in your EMMA.CSF before the 'M' command.


(*).  You may select how messages are separated in the MAIL.IN file.  By 
default, Emma adds three blank lines after each message.  If you want something 
different then add an 'S' (for separator) command to your script file.  The 
argument is a string defining the separator text.  Here is one example:

    S  "^M^J*************************************************************^M^J"

The 'S' command may be placed anywhere in your EMMA.CSF before the 'M' command.


(*).  Three options are available on the 'M' command:  send-only, 
attachment-overwrite and ASCII-mode.  Each option is selected by including a key 
letter in a string argument.

In send-only mode, Emma sends MCI any outgoing mail without downloading INBOX 
messages.  The feature is selected thus:

     M    "S"

Send-only mode is intended for users with secretaries who create and dispatch 
mail but who do not handle incoming messages.

Normally, when Emma receives an attachment with a name that matches an existing 
file, it generates a new name for the attachment of the form ATTACHED.xxx.  By 
selecting attachment-overwrite mode, you instruct Emma to store attachments 
under their original names even if such files already exist.  This option is 
useful for those people who update remote files by MCI.  You select this option 
by editing your 'M' command to read

     M    "O"

Finally, Emma's ASCII mode is provided for users of WordStar and similar editors 
that bend high bits to their own uses.  The effect of selecting this option, by

     M    "A"

is that all messages are stripped down to 7-bit characters before transmission.  
(This stripping applies specifically and only to message texts and not to 
attached files.)

You may combine options as in this example:

     M    "AOS"

The option letters may appear in the string in any order.


(*).  Emma's screen output can be redirected allowing the program to be used in 
a more automated fashion.  You can, for example, invoke Emma from a batch file 
and have it run "silently," that is with no screen output.  You can discard the 
output completely by redirecting it to the null device, e.g.

                    EMMA >NUL:

Or you can redirect it to a file, e.g.

                    EMMA > OUTPUT

Warning:  don't carelessly redirect to a file named, say, EMMA.OUT.  Emma would, 
of course, treat that file as a message to be sent to MCI.


(*).  For the benefit of those who want to invoke it from batch files, Emma 
terminates with one of the following exit codes:

          0 => Emma completed successfully but received no new mail
          2 => file i/o error (no new mail received)
          3 => script error (no new mail received)
          4 => user interrupt, i.e. user pressed Esc  (no new mail received)
          5 => timeout (no new mail received)
          6 => protocol error (no new mail received)

          100 => Emma completed successfully and received some new mail
          102 => file i/o error (after new mail was received)
          103 => script error (after new mail was received)
          104 => user interrupt (after new mail was received)
          105 => timeout (after new mail was received)
          106 => protocol error (after new mail was received)

Note that exit codes 1 and 101 are not used.  Emma adds 100 to whatever exit 
code it would otherwise use if it has downloaded any new messages to MAIL.IN.  
See the file, SAMPLE.BAT, for a model of how you might use these exit codes.


(*).  Emma can create a transcript of each session it conducts with MCI Mail.  
If you want a transcript for troubleshooting or any other reason, you must tell 
Emma by adding an 'L' command to your .CSF file.  The argument is the name of 
the file to which you want the log written, for example:

     L    "emma.log"

It is best to put this command near the beginning of the script file.  In future 
versions, I may add options for selecting different levels of logging.


(*).  The K command tells Emma to transmit a standard BREAK signal on the COM 
port.  (A BREAK consists of approximately 385 milliseconds of SPACE.)  It is 
included for compatibility with certain foreign packet switch networks that 
require such a signal as a trigger for setting PAD parameters.


(*).  Suppose you love Emma but are wary about keeping your MCI password in a 
script file that someone else might look at.  Or suppose that you use Emma on a 
portable PC and need a different dialing code every time you run it.  Emma can 
help.  Place a question mark in front of any string argument and Emma displays 
it on the screen as a prompt for you to type in the "real" string you want used.  
For example, to avoid putting your password in your .CSF file, you could set up 
the appropriate section of it as follows:

     R  15   "name:"
     T       "your_username"
     T       "/batch:1ST/"
     T     ? "^M^JPlease type your password (and press Enter):  "
     T       "^M"
     R 20    "COM^M^J"

You can use this facility with any script command although it is not obviously 
useful with any but 'T'.  Note that while you press Enter to terminate the 
string that you type in, the Enter itself (i.e. a carriage return) is not 
included in the string.  You may type in strings of up to 80 characters; 
anything typed beyond this limit is quietly ignored.

You can use the Escape key to abort a session while typing a string just as you 
can at any other time.

You can even go one step further with this mechanism.  When Emma reads the 
response to a prompt, it reads standard input (not the keyboard directly).  Thus 
you can redirect input from a file.  For example, set up your EMMA.CSF with null 
prompts (?"") and create a file, RESPONSE, containing the responses, one per 
line.  Then start Emma with the command:

     EMMA <RESPONSE

This would allow you, for instance, to set up a totally generic script file for 
Emma then have some other application query the user for dialing code, username, 
password, etcetera, write that information out to a file and then invoke Emma as 
above (perhaps via a batch file).



Using Emma with an MNP Modem
----- ---- ---- -- --- -----
With a properly configured MNP modem, Emma should work with perfect reliability.  
Unfortunately, setting up your MNP modem with all the correct options may not be 
trivial, especially since there is no uniformity among modems for the AT 
commands that select MNP features.  Start with the MNP.CSF model script 
provided, and make sure that your modem is sent the appropriate commands to 
select:

     Flow control:  local birectional XON/XOFF.

     Disable bps-rate adjustment.

     Reliable mode (forces modem to make an MNP link or nothing).

     Enable data compression during MNP connections.

Note that the last option is usually a default but the other three are not.

By disabling the bps-rate adjustment, you can take advantage of higher 
throughput thanks to MNP compression.  If you select this option then set the 
port speed to a bps rate higher than that of the modem, for example 9600.  Also 
be sure that you do not have a B command in your .CSF script.  Should Emma 
complain about overrun errors then reduce the port speed; on slow PCs, Emma may 
not be able to keep pace with 9600 bps.



General Tips
------- ----
If you want to keep a thorough record of your outgoing messages, it is a good 
idea to put a CC: line in each envelope to send yourself a courtesy copy.  There 
is a charge for this but it gives you a copy of each message timestamped by MCI 
and complete with the message identifier.  This can serve as a "certificate of 
mailing."



Troubleshooting Tips
--------------- ----
If MCI finds faults with a message, an explanation will be displayed on your 
screen.  (Unless, of course, you have redirected Emma's screen output.)

The most common problems are with misformatted envelopes.  For a message to be 
delivered, the subscriber must be exactly identified.  If you address a message 
to a name that's not unique, the IDs of all MCI subscribers with the name are 
listed:  

      At least one problem with envelope 
      608 More than 1 MCI Mail user matches recipient information
      MCI ID   Name         Organization       Location
      000-0000 Zoltan Shah  Whizzo Chocolate   New York, NY
      111-1111 Zoltan Shah  Sunshine Desserts  Fresno, CA

Select the right one and edit your message to include the ID.  Remember that the 
name should be separated from the ID by a slash, as in Zoltan Shah/111-
1111.  In fact, an ID alone is a perfectly acceptable address.
	
If MCI objects to something else in the envelope of a message, you may receive 
a response such as:

     At least one problem with envelope 
     610 Improper information in the envelope 
     SUBJECT:  EMMA
     This text is part of the message...

In this case, the blank line needed to terminate the envelope is missing.  Other 
causes might be a mistyped keyword or the appearance of lines in an order that 
MCI cannot handle.

Some errors offend MCI so much that it stops responding, such as a message with 
two or more addresses on a line.  A message may be addressed to any number of 
people, but each address must be on a separate To: or Cc: line.

And, if you receive either a Checksum error or Malformed data message, you can 
be almost certain that a transmission error has ruined your session.  Just try 
again.

With an MNP modem, Emma should be perfectly reliable.  If it proves not to be 
then consider the following possible problems:  (1) You are not configuring the 
modem so that it establishes an MNP connection with MCI.  (2) You have the modem 
configured for the wrong type of flow control.  Emma uses Control-S/Control-Q 
flow control.  If you set the modem for hardware flow control or any other 
flow-control option then you are very likely to see errors.  (3) If your PC is 
on a LAN the network software may steal sufficient processor time that Emma 
misses characters coming in on the serial port.  Should you suspect this, verify 
it by temporarily unloading the network software and seeing what happens.



Notes for International Users
----- --- ------------- -----
Emma is the only publicly available agent software for MCI Mail that is 
"internationalized."  As such, it has users all over Europe and Asia.

To use Emma from a foreign location, you will likely need to make substantial 
modifications to a script in order to complete the connection.  The most 
important thing to remember in doing so is that the connection must be set up 
with no echoing.  This is different from terminal-mode connections and may 
entail changing PAD parameters for foreign packet switch networks.

Should Emma give you the diagnostic:

     ***Protocol failure: unrecognized message received***

after completing a login to MCI, it is almost certain that echoing is the 
problem.  Determine what has to be done to turn it off.



New Features In Version 2.2
--- -------- -- ------- ---
Version 2.2 brings two new features to Emma:  DataPac compatibility and 
saving/restoring of the COM port.

The standard way of connecting to MCI Mail from Canada is via DataPac and then 
through a gateway to TYMNET.  Earlier versions of Emma failed to operate via 
DataPac due to some strange echoes apparently produced by that network.  The new 
version is designed to discard these stray echoes and is accompanied by a script 
file, DATAPAC.CSF, designed for such access.

Emma now saves the entire state of the COM port that it uses and restores that 
state before terminating.  This feature was added for users who run Emma in a 
multitasking environment such as DESQview.

FV - Verbose Archive Directory Lister                              Version 1.45
-------------------------------------                             June 23, 1993



Purpose:  To display the names and attributes of files contained within archive
          files with extensions of ARC, ARJ, ZIP, PAK, DWC, LZH, ZOO, LBR,  and
          most self-extracting COM and EXE files created by archive utilities.



Format:   FV  [d:][path]filespec[.ext] [filespecs ... filespecs]
                                       [/p] [/b] [/w] [/r] [/c] [/x]
                                       [>outfile]



Notes:    If no operands are entered, a display of the program's command format
          is displayed.

          The drive and path are optional. The filespec may contain the
          wildcard characters * and ?.  All archive files matching the file
          specification are processed.

          If the filespec extension is omitted, all known archive extensions
          are checked.

          The 'filespecs' operand limits the display to filenames within the
          archives which match this file specification. There may be up to
          eight 'filespecs'.

          Use the /p parameter to pause the display when the screen fills.

          Use the /b parameter to suppress the d:\path information in the
          display.

          Use the /w parameter to display member names only in a 5-up display.

          Use the /c parameter to display archive and file comments for ZIP
          files.

          The /r redate option changes the archive file date to be the latest
          date of the files within the archive.

          The /x option converts a self-extracting (.EXE) file to a new archive
          file with the proper extension and format in the current directory.

          Self-extracting files for the ARJ format is not supported.

          The date format for LU .LBR files varies.  The format used by FV
          adheres to the LU86 standard.

DocuPower Pro  2.0
##################

After you create Word for Windows documents, how do you find them? You know
they're on your hard drive, or on the LAN file server... somewhere. If only 
you could remember the file name, or the directory - you might actually be 
able to get some work done.

DocuPower Pro  breaks the eight character DOS file name barrier! 

Give long, descriptive names to your documents - up to 45 characters long. 
DocuPower Pro is a total document management solution that makes it easy to 
quickly access your work. On stand-alone PCÆs as well as across networks, it 
can completely organize your documents. Best of all, it integrates seamlessly
into WinWord. 

Check Out These Incredible Features 
###################################

* Break the eight character DOS file name barrier. With DocuPower Pro you can 
  give your documents real, meaningful descriptions - up to 45 characters long! 

* Assign enhanced DocuPower Pro descriptions while maintaining your original 
  file names. YouÆll never misplace a file again. Use DocuPower Pro descriptions 
  for fast access, or, if you prefer, look at the regular path and file name.

* Get organized - itÆs fast and easy. Create an unlimited number of folders for 
  your documents, and give each folder its own descriptive title. 

* Each folder holds an unlimited number of document descriptions. Add as many as 
  you like, because theyÆll be displayed in alphabetical order. Simply touch the 
  keyboard to jump immediately to any part of the list.

* Lightning fast folder list display! See hundreds of files instantly.

* Toggle folder list displays instantly between DocuPower Pro document 
  descriptions and DOS file names.

* One file can appear in multiple folders simultaneously. This enables you to 
  organize the same material in different ways while avoiding version control 
  problems. 

* Because itÆs tightly integrated into Winword, DocuPower Pro will automatically 
  prompt you every time you save a new file. So youÆre never more than one 
  keystroke or mouse click away from adding your new work directly to a folder. 

* Sophisticated folder management allows you to create, rename, or delete entire 
  folders. Plus you can easily move documents from one folder to another. 

* Print single or multiple copies of a document directly from any folder - you donÆt 
  need to open the file first. 

* Print all documents in a folder with just one command.
 
* Fax documents directly from a folder.

* Insert the contents of one document into another. Clicking the "Insert" button 
  lets you perform automated document assembly.

* Integrated File Find and Text Search utilities find the files you need fast. 
  Select multiple entries from the list of files found. Open all selected files 
  at once, or add all selected files directly to any DocuPower Pro folder.

* Integrated file management functions enable you to make directories, copy, 
  rename, delete or move files. The file management window is easy and intuitive 
  to use - a dual list box with file names on the left, and your descriptions on 
  the right. Do it all without ever leaving Winword or DocuPower Pro. 

* Print a detailed folder status report. List document descriptions and file names 
  for all documents in any folder (or just list descriptions which have invalid file 
  paths). 

* Free DocuPower Pro Tool Kit includes powerful WinWord macro utilities: Close All 
  Open Files; Display Date On Menu; Exit Windows; Restart Windows; List All Files 
  In Directory; Run Program (Command Line); Windows System Status.

* Additional tool kits are available to meet specialized needs. The WriterÆs Tool 
  Kit includes the following utilities: Font Minder, Text Jumper, BookMark Lister, 
  Edit Templates, Open Most Recent Files, Print All Open Files, Compare Documents 
  and Winword INI Changer.

Danger! 
Beware of Conventional Document Management Systems 
##################################################

DocuPower Pro is unique. Because we do it all, and do it safely. All document 
management systems are not alike. To appreciate our revolutionary design, itÆs 
important to understand the dangers of conventional document management systems. 
These programs also allow you to assign descriptive names to your files. However, 
to keep track of what description goes with which file, they take control of your 
computer. First, they create their own DOS directories for your documents (for 
example C:\MEZ001A2). Next, they rename each file at the DOS level with their own 
proprietary file names, like L000310.DOC. Finally, the new directory structure and 
proprietary file names are indexed and tracked by their database engine.

And thatÆs the problem with conventional systems - they take too much control away from 
you. As long as your descriptive names are viewed from inside their program, everything 
is fine. But if you want to find a file on your own, youÆre out of luck. Just try 
figuring out what C:\MEZ001A2\L000310.DOC means!

This can be a real problem. If you need to copy directories or files to a diskette, 
youÆll be stuck. The names that the document management program assigns are totally 
meaningless to you. So using any file management program becomes impractical. 
Backing up your data also becomes either difficult or impossible. How can you back up 
your documents when you donÆt know where they are or what theyÆre named?  

We believe that the benefits offered by these programs are outweighed by the price you 
have to pay. ItÆs just never worth it to give up complete control of your system. 

DocuPower ProÆs Revolutionary Design
####################################

Unlike ordinary document management systems, DocuPower Pro enhances rather than 
replaces your existing directory structure and file names. YouÆll always have it 
both ways. Assign long, descriptive names to your documents. Retain your original 
directory structure and file names. DocuPower Pro puts you in complete control.
 
DocuPower Pro gives you the power you need to always be in charge of your documents. 
Try it yourself and see what it's like to always have your files at your fingertips.

Call Today!
###########

DocuPower Pro costs only $59.95 (hundreds less than other document management 
systems). It is optimized for use on stand-alone PCÆs as well as networks. 
(Discounted prices are available for site licenses). Your satisfaction is guaranteed. 
If you arenÆt completely happy with DocuPower Pro, we will promptly refund your money. 
A fully functioning demo is also available. We accept Visa, MasterCard and American 
Express. To order, or for more information call 718-375-2997.

For Microsoft Word For Windows 2.x

FILEWARE is an award winning suite of thirteen file maintenance, 
document management & program launching utilities which integrate 
seamlessly into Microsoft Word for Windows 2.x. It provides the many 
commonly requested features that Microsoft "forgot" to include. After 
auto-installation to the "File" or "Tools" menu, the Fileware system
is never more than a mouse click or keystroke away. NOW YOU CAN DO 
EVERYTHING YOU NEED WITHOUT EVER LEAVING WORD FOR WINDOWS...

FORGET FILE MANAGER. Make directories; delete, rename, copy or move files. 
Because it's integrated into WinWord, Fileware  is the easiest, safest way 
to manage files - on stand-alone PCÆs or over networks.

FORGET PROGRAM MANAGER. Launch programs instantly with "Run 
Buttons", a customizable toolbox of pushbuttons (or type a 
command on the convenient "Quick Run" line).

FORGET EIGHT CHARACTER DOS FILE NAMES. "Fast Files" keeps a 
customizable list of document descriptions close at hand. Just 
point and click to open the files you want.

FORGET COMPLICATED DIRECTORY PATHS. "Directory Jump" gives you 
pushbutton access to the directories you use the most. Just one 
click jumps you anywhere on your PC... or across your network.

ABOLISH REPETITIVE KEYSTROKES. Close all open files at the same 
time with just one command. Options include "Close Without Saving" 
& "Prompt To Save".

PROTECT YOUR CONFIDENTIAL DATA. "Word Lock" provides password 
protection for the complete Word for Windows application (not 
just certain files).

EDIT DOCUMENT TEMPLATES instantly even if you don't know which 
directory they're in.

EXIT WINDOWS when you're done working with just one click.

Fileware is a powerful yet inexpensive suite of utilities. 
It was chosen one of the "48 Best Add In" products by PC Magazine;

features that were left out of Word for Windows." In "Hacker's Guide to
Word for Windows" (Addison Wesley) Woody Leonhard (creator of WOPR)writes,

management companies in the world. The time required for the creation of 
customized leases was cut from over 2 weeks to under 20 minutes per 
lease!

We can save your company time and money while improving and 
standardizing the quality of your output. Call us today at 
718-375-1261 for more information.

Sincerely,

Daniel Goodman, President
Total System Solutions, Inc.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Outside the U.S.A.: Call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer near

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
