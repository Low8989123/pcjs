This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
900 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'INSTALL' at
the DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy
access to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.  All the programs are logically divided into thirteen
major categories with subcategories, making it easier to find just the
right software.

All of the programs have been scanned for viruses.  There are also three
online virus utilities that can be run from the CD-ROM which will scan,
screen and clean viruses.  Not only does this save hard disk space, but
also gives every user added security from viruses.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

Winner of the Optical Publishing Assn's Best Consumer Product Award.

Shareware for every imaginable need: Accounting Chemistry Educational
Engineering Games Hypertext Networks Programming Spreadsheets Utilities
Word Processing

Additional BBS file descriptions are available from PC-SIG so that the
CD-ROM can be set up quickly on a bulletin board.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 530K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
a graphics monitor (Hercules/EGA/VGA/SVGA).  A mouse is optional.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now you can play a game a day fo over a year.  This CD-ROM is jammed
with over 380 shareware games of all types, designed to appeal to the
new generation of CD-ROM users out for fun.  The CD incorporates a
hypermedia interface and allows 250 of the games to be played directly
from the CD-ROM.

The hottest games in shareware are on this disk, including the
action/arcade games "Jill of the Jungle" and "Wolfenstein 3D," which
rival or surpass commercial PC and Nintendo for use of animation,
SoundBlaster audio, and VGA graphics.  There are also games designed to
teach children mathematics, spelling and even ecology.  All these games
for less than a dime each!

Over 250 of the games can be played directly from the CD without copying
them to a floppy or a hard drive.  Being able to run from the CD means
that users can explore games without using up valuable hard disk space
or spending time downloading and deleting files.  The hypermedia
interface makes it easy to browse the titles, read a one line
description or full review, and copy or start a game by clicking the
mouse or using the keyboard.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

Sloop Manager, version 1.2b                        by Sloop Software
(c)Copyright 1991 Sloop Software                     a member of the ASP

Sloop Manager is the complete graphical replacement for MS Windows 3.0
Program Manager.  It has virtually all the features of Program Manager plus
a host of new ones.

Features include:
  - the ability to create folders (groups) within folders
  - move or copy items from folder to folder using drag/drop
  - run command with browse button which also stores last twelve commands
  - associate command that allows multiple programs to be associated
    with a single extension
  - save location and size of folder as well as item positions
  - use virtually any icon on the system to represent items
  - display items as icons or just names
  - password protection
  - multi-select capability in adding, deleting, moving or
    copying folder items
  - startup folder may be used to remove need to edit WIN.INI
  - simple, easy to use icon browser dialog
  - command bar for quick access to often used commands
  - customizable popup run menu

Installation:
  To install Sloop Manager or to install a new version of Sloop Manager, 
  follow the steps below.  Note that you may import any folders created 
  with our Folders program, provided it is version 3.1 or later.

  Important: If installing over an old version of Sloop Manager, it is 
  suggested you backup your sloopman data directory, just in case there 
  is a problem during the install process.

  1. Insert the Sloop Manager, disk 1 into the appropriate drive.

  2. From Program Manager, or Sloop Manager (if running), select the Run 
     command and type in a:install.exe.  If using the b drive, substitute
     a: with b:.  

     If you are currently running Sloop Manager as the shell, you will be
     able to restart Windows with Program Manager as the shell at this 
     point.  After restarting, run the install program again.  Re-installing
     is not possible while Sloop Manager is running as the shell.

  3. Follow the directions for installing or re-installing the software.
     The install program will copy all needed files to your system and, if 
     re-installing, update the Sloop Manager system to run with the new
     version.

  Should this process fail for any reason, follow the instructions for the 
  manual install process in the file trouble.txt.

  Note that the program will not run under Real mode of Windows.

  If you converted an existing Folders system to Sloop Manager, you may 
  delete your folders data directory and the files FOLDERS.EXE,
  FOLDERS.HLP and FOLDERS.INI, if you so desire.  This will remove Folders
  from your system as it is not needed if you have Sloop Manager.


Uninstalling Sloop Manager:
  1. Edit the SYSTEM.INI file, found in the Windows directory, using an
     editor like Notepad.
  2. Find the line which reads: shell=sloopman.exe
     Change the line to read: shell=progman.exe
  3. Save and close the SYSTEM.INI file.
  4. Restart Windows.  Program Manager should now start as the shell.

TROUBLESHOOTING INFORMATION

Automatic install process fails:  Should the install program provided fail
for any reason, follow the procedure for manually installing the program 
given below.  Note that you will be unable to convert an existing Folders 
system using the manual install procedure.

No previous version installed:
1. Copy the files sloopman.exe, and sloopman.hlp to your Windows directory.
   Copy the file slpman.ini to sloopman.ini to your Windows directory and
   rename it sloopman.ini.  Copy the files bwcc.dll and smtools.dll to your
   Windows systems directory.

2. Create a subdirectory of your Windows directory called SLOOPMAN.  Note
   this step may be skipped.  Any existing directory may be used instead.

3. Copy the files sloopman.fl1, sloopman.icl, grpconv.exe, and smtrash.exe
   to the Sloop Manager data directory created in step 2.

4. Edit the file sloopman.ini in the following manner using a text editor
   such as Notepad.  Under the section name [Folders Directory] edit the 
   path= line to read: 
	path=<directory>\ 
   where  <directory> is the directory created in step 2.  Note the 
   backslash at the end of the name.  An example line would be: 
	path=c:\windows\sloopman\

5. If you want to use Sloop Manager as the shell, edit the system.ini file
   with an editor such as Notepad.  Change the shell= line to read 
        shell=sloopman.exe

6. You may convert and install your Program Manager groups into Sloop 
   Manager at this point.  Run the program grpconv.exe located in your 
   sloopman data directory. 

7. Finally, from the File Manager, using the associate command under the
   File menu, associate sloopman.exe with FL1 files.

Previous version installed:
1. If currently using v1.2x, simply copy the files sloopman.exe and
   sloopman.hlp to your Windows directory.  Copy the file smtools.dll
   to your Windows system directory.

2. If using v1.1x or earlier, follow the procedure for no previous version
   installed.  You will be unable to maintain your old version.

That's it.  You should now be able to run Sloop Manager as you would any 
program.  Or, if installed as the shell, simply restart Windows.


Subfolder item accidentally deleted:  Should you accidentally lose a 
subfolder item, either by deleting it with the Delete Item command rather
than the Delete Subfolder command or through some other misfortune, the 
folder can be recovered.  To recover a lost folder, follow the steps below.

1. Open the file sloopman.ini with  a program such as Notepad.  This file
   should be in your Windows directory unless moved by you.

2. Under the section [Folder List], find the name of the folder you wish to
   recover.  To the right of the equal sign will be a DOS file name with a 
   name similar to FLDxxxx.FL1, where xxxx is some number.  Make a note of 
   this name.  Close the INI file.

3. From the folder you wish to restore the lost folder to, select the Add
   Item command.  Go to your sloopman data directory, which was created 
   when the program was installed.  Find the file whose name you recorded
   in step 2.  Select it and hit OK.

4. In the name input box which appears after you hit OK in step 3, enter
   the name of the lost folder.  Click on OK.

A new folder icon representing the lost folder should now appear.  It may
now  be treated in the same manner as any other folder.


Deleting a folder whose password you've forgotten:  If you need to delete a
folder, but have forgotten the password the following procedure may be 
followed to remove it from the Sloop Manager system.

1. Select the folder you wish to delete and execute the Properties command.
   Make a note of the file name.

2. Delete the item using the Delete Item command.  Save the parent folder.

3. Go to your sloopman data directory and delete the file whose name you 
   made a note of in step 1.

4. Restart Sloop Manager.  The folder should now be deleted.


Icons appear scrambled:  Should the icons used to display folder items not 
appear correctly, do the following.  First, check what video mode you are 
running in.  Specifically, the number of colors being provided.  Sloop 
Manager supports up to 32000 color modes.  It does not support CGA (4 color)
mode.  

Should you be running in 256 or 32000 color mode and the icons are
scrambled, try this fix.  Edit the file SLOOPMAN.INI with an editor like
Notepad.  Under the section [Defaults], find the line which reads: 
Color mode=0.  Edit it to read:

	Color mode=256 
               or 
	Color mode=32000

This forces the program to run in 256 or 32000 color mode.  Note that it 
will no longer run properly in 16 color mode.  To run in 16 color mode 
change the 256 in the line to 16 or to 0 for auto-sense mode.  If you are
still unable to get the icons to appear correctly, contact customer support.


System crash occurs when starting Windows with Sloop Manager as the shell:
Provided with the program is a file called slpman.exe.  Copy this file to 
your Windows directory.  Edit the system.ini file with Notepad or 
equivalent.  Change the line which reads 'shell=<whatever>' to 
'shell=slpman.exe'.  Restart Windows.  Sloop Manager should now be able to 
run as the Windows shell.
