     9/9/92  Registration for CHEMICAL for Windows Version 1.50

     CHEMICAL for Windows is a Public Domain Program and should  
     not be sold for more than the distribution cost. The latest 
     version is available from the author. CHEMICAL for Windows 
     is written in Borlandc C++.

     The source code is available so users can modify the code.
     However, the source code is not public domain and should not
     be distributed.  
     
     This is a list of other programs that are available:

     CHEMICAL for DOS is similiar to CHEMICAL for Windows, but does
     not require a fast 386 or 486 computer. Atoms are selected
     from a Periodic Table (using the A command) and electron
     orbital information retrieved. The Atoms are then bonded
     (using the B command). The chemical is displayed as it is
     being constructed. The chemical can be viewed from different
     directions by using the up and down cursor keys and the V
     command. If desired the Hybrid and Ionize commands can be used
     to alter the orbitals before bonding. This program is written
     in Turbo PROLOG and requires a graphics monitor and 640 Kbytes 
     of RAM.
  
     CHEMVIEW for DOS is a companion program that shows 3-dimensional
     animation of the models generated with CHEMICAL. CHEMVIEW
     requires an EGA/VGA board and monitor. CHEMVIEW is written in
     Turbo PROLOG with the graphics routines written in Turbo C.
    
     CRYSTAL for DOS is companion program that places atoms on a
     lattice framework to form crystal structures. The structure is
     defined by a text file. A text editor is built into the
     program. The text file is converted to a image that is shown
     rotating in three dimensions. An EGA or VGA monitor is
     required. This program is written in Turbo PROLOG and uses
     the Turbo PROLOG Toolbox.
     
     BIOCHEM for DOS is a companion program that combines files made
     with CHEMICAL for DOS into larger molecules.  Chemical groups can
     be bonded together using Covalent, Ionic, Hydrogen, or Peptide
     bonds. BIOCHEM works with a CGA, EGA, or VGA monitor. This 
     program is written in Turbo PROLOG with subroutines in Turbo C.

     PLANETS computes information relating to the position,
     distance, magnitude, orbit view, skyview, etc. for the major
     planets, four minor planets, and  halley's comet on a specified
     date and time. Also, orbital data for any desired planet or
     comet can be entered and saved in a disk file. Skyview and
     orbital views can shown in  forward or backward motion. The moons
     for each planet can be displayed. This program requires a
     graphics display and 256K bytes of memory. The latest
     version is 4.1. This program is written in Turbo PASCAL version 
     5.0.
