This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
900 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'INSTALL' at
the DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy
access to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.  All the programs are logically divided into thirteen
major categories with subcategories, making it easier to find just the
right software.

All of the programs have been scanned for viruses.  There are also three
online virus utilities that can be run from the CD-ROM which will scan,
screen and clean viruses.  Not only does this save hard disk space, but
also gives every user added security from viruses.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

Winner of the Optical Publishing Assn's Best Consumer Product Award.

Shareware for every imaginable need: Accounting Chemistry Educational
Engineering Games Hypertext Networks Programming Spreadsheets Utilities
Word Processing

Additional BBS file descriptions are available from PC-SIG so that the
CD-ROM can be set up quickly on a bulletin board.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 530K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
a graphics monitor (Hercules/EGA/VGA/SVGA).  A mouse is optional.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.


                      The PC-SIG Games CD-ROM
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now you can play a game a day fo over a year.  This CD-ROM is jammed
with over 380 shareware games of all types, designed to appeal to the
new generation of CD-ROM users out for fun.  The CD incorporates a
hypermedia interface and allows 250 of the games to be played directly
from the CD-ROM.

The hottest games in shareware are on this disk, including the
action/arcade games "Jill of the Jungle" and "Wolfenstein 3D," which
rival or surpass commercial PC and Nintendo for use of animation,
SoundBlaster audio, and VGA graphics.  There are also games designed to
teach children mathematics, spelling and even ecology.  All these games
for less than a dime each!

Over 250 of the games can be played directly from the CD without copying
them to a floppy or a hard drive.  Being able to run from the CD means
that users can explore games without using up valuable hard disk space
or spending time downloading and deleting files.  The hypermedia
interface makes it easy to browse the titles, read a one line
description or full review, and copy or start a game by clicking the
mouse or using the keyboard.

        Ever wanted to print out computer keyboard symbols, pi charac-
        ters, or dingbats on your Laser printer? You say you don't know 
        what these are? (Look below to see them!) This package presents 
        limited portrait versions of 10 point computer symbols and ding-
        bats fonts. Both soft fonts can be downloaded to any laser 
        printer that accepts HP format fonts. These symbols allow you to 
        generate laser printed documentation with clear references to 
        specialized symbols.

        All symbols in both fonts are mapped into familiar keys. (You 
        enter the ASCII character shown below to get the specified spec-
        ial symbol to print.) Please note that you must enter these let-
        ters exactly as they appear to get the appropriate symbol. To use 
        the symbols, download them as your secondary font.  Then use 
        control-N to select the secondary font and control-O to return to 
        your primary font.

                      Downloading Soft Fonts To A LaserJet



                                     SUMMARY

        DOWNLOAD.EXE  is  an  IBM PC utility  program  that  manages  the 
        process  of downloading soft fonts to a LaserJet printer.   DOWN-
        LOAD can send a font to any MS-DOS device or to a disk file.  You 
        have optional control over the ID number of the font, whether  it 
        is permanent or temporary, and whether it is a primary or second-
        ary font.


                              FONT CHARACTERISTICS

        All  soft fonts have three characteristics associated with  them.  
        Each  font must have a unique ID number, 0 - 15.  This  lets  you 
        select  a  soft font through software or the front panel  of  the 
        printer. Each font must be defined as either temporary or perman-
        ent.  Temporary fonts are deleted whenever the LaserJet is reset.  
        Most  software that controls the LaserJet sends a  reset  command 
        out  first, thus deleting all temporary fonts.  Finally,  a  font 
        may  be defined as either primary or secondary.  (Note that  only 
        one  primary and one secondary font can exist at one time.)   The 
        LaserJet lets you switch between primary and secondary fonts with 
        simple control characters.  Control-N selects the secondary font, 
        while control-O selects the primary font.  Embedding these  char-
        acters in you text file lets you switch between fonts.


                                RUNNING DOWNLOAD

        First,  if you forget how to run DOWNLOAD, or need  help,  simply 
        type  DOWNLOAD followed by a carriage return.  The  program  will 
        print  a  help list for you.  To run download you must  at  least 
        specify  the name of the soft font to send to your printer.   You 
        can  optionally  specify the device to send the  file  to,  LPT1, 
        LPT2, LPT3, COM1, or COM2.  In addition, you can optionally  con-
        trol the three font attributes specified above.  To invoke  DOWN-
        LOAD type:


        download fontname [device id perm prim]

        where  the arguments between the two braces are optional and  the 
        arguments are as defined below:

        fontname = the full name of the file to download
        device   = optional printer port: LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, COM1, COM2, 
                   or a disk file name
        id       = optional unique soft font ID number (0 - 15)
        perm     = optional make font Permanent or Temporary (P/T)
        prim     = optional make font Primary or Secondary (P/S)


                      Downloading Soft Fonts To A LaserJet



        The  DOWNLOAD program defaults to printer port LPT1, and  assigns 
        the soft font ID 0, and permanent - primary status.  Thus:

        download tr100rpn.usp

        sends  the Times Roman 10 point regular font, (tr100rpn.usp),  to 
        the LaserJet as font id 0, and makes it permanent and the primary 
        font.

        download tr100bpn.usp lpt1 1 p s

        sends  the bold faced Times Roman font to the LaserJet  via  LPT1 
        and assigns it font id 1, permanent and secondary status.


                                   DISTRIBUTION

        This program is provided free of charge to all who are interested 
        in  it.  It may be freely exchanged as long as no fee is  charged 
        for it.  Please distribute this package with BOTH this documenta-
        tion file and the executable program.  This program and  documen-
        tation  are copyright 1987 by Gary Elfring.  All rights  are  re-
        served.  Commercial use is strictly prohibited.

        An enhanced version of this program, which lets you use wildcards 
        for  the  font names or supply a list of fonts  to  download,  is 
        supplied free of charge with all fonts libraries I sell.  Or  you 
        can purchase the enhanced downloader and source code (written  in 
        C),  for  a small fee separately.  I offer a  number  of  special 
        downloadable fonts including computer symbols, pi characters  and 
        dingbats,  an LCD font,  a Helvetica like font, and credit cards.

Description:

     FONTID and FONTPM - Utility programs to simplify downloading of
                         fonts to HP LaserJet II and Plus.

     These programs replace the BASIC routines supplied by HP with each
     soft font package.  The advantage of these routines over the HP
     ones is that they are command line driven, so that you may
     construct a batch file to download a set of fonts automatically.

Usage:
     This set of three commands downloads a font to the LaserJet.
        FONTID nn >PRN
        COPY /B hpfont PRN
        FONTPM nn >PRN

Parameters:
        nn              a font number.  Any font number allowed by HP
                        is permitted (1-32767 on LaserJet II)
        hpfont          name of an HP font file.  E.g., HV120RPN.USP.  Paths
                        are allowed.

Operation:
        FONTID sends the escape sequence to the printer to assign the
               number to the font.
        FONTPM marks the font as permanent.

Sample batch file to download fonts:

 ECHO OFF
 CLS
 REM
 REM   This is LOAD.BAT, which downloads Prestige Elite fonts.
 REM   Only USASCII fonts are downloaded to conserve space.
 REM
 echo Loading Prestige Elite 7 point, 16 pitch, Regular, Portrait
 fontid 20 >PRN
 COPY /B D:\U\HP\PR070R16.USP PRN > NUL
 fontpm 20 >PRN
 rem
 echo Loading Prestige Elite 10 point, 12 pitch, Regular, Portrait
 fontid 21 >PRN
 COPY /B D:\U\HP\PR100R12.USP PRN > NUL
 fontpm 21 >PRN
 rem
 echo Loading Prestige Elite 10 point, 12 pitch, Bold, Portrait
 fontid 22 >PRN
 COPY /B D:\U\HP\PR100B12.USP PRN > NUL
 fontpm 22 >PRN

                     Soft Fonts for the HP LaserJet+


Having recently gained access to a LaserJet+, I decided to play around with
the printer's ability to store fonts downloaded from the PC.  Here are my
first three attempts:

    TINY.SFP     -- VERY small type, barely readable.
    LARGE.SFP    -- large, bold letters (somewhat crude).
    LARGEHLW.SFP -- large, hollow letters.

Use of these files is best explained via example.  Let us assume that the
LaserJet+ is attached to LPT1.  To use the tiny font, enter:

              COPY TINY.SFP LPT1

This will download the font to your printer (as font 0), then make the tiny
font the primary font.


WARNING:  I actually don't use a LaserJet+, but a Dataproducts LZR-1200
          in HP LaserJet+ emulation mode.  I have no way of guaranteeing
          that what works on an imitation will work on the real thing.
          If you have problems, feel free to contact me on Gene Plantz' BBS.

              HELP FOR NEW USERS & PROBLEMS YOU MIGHT HAVE 
                        FROM PC PLUS CONSULTING

     Public domain software is actually very easy to use if you are familiar
with a few basic "DOS" commands. These commands are "COPY", "DISKCOPY", "DIR",  
"TYPE", "FORMAT", & a few others.  None of the disks are "bootable", which
means that you cannot place the disk in your computer and turn it on.
     The first thing is to make a backup copy of your disk with the following
command:
     A>DISKCOPY A: B:  <enter> - (will copy all files from 'A' to 'B')
     In the event that you get some sort of error message when using "DISKCOPY",
you will then have to use the "COPY" command to make a backup of your original
disk. Place a blank FORMATTED disk in the "B" drive and enter the following
command at the "A>" prompt: 
     A>COPY *.* B:  <enter> - (will copy all files from 'A' to 'B')
     Now put the original disk away and use the working copy.  The next thing
to do is see what files are on the disk.  Place the working copy in the "A"
drive and enter the following command:
     A>DIR   <enter> - will display the filenames
     Now you will see many different filenames.  A filename consists of two
parts; the filename & the extension.  The filename will be on the left (up to
8 characters long) & the extension will be just to the right (up to 3
characters long).  You will be looking for certain extension names; which
will tell you something about that type of file.  

******************************************************************************
*      IMPORTANT.....IMPORTANT.....IMPORTANT.....IMPORTANT.....IMPORTANT     *
*----------------------------------------------------------------------------*
* EXE - a program file - type in the name & press the enter key.             *
* COM - a command file - type in the name & press the enter key.             *
* BAT - a batch file - many uses, type in the name & press enter key.        *
* BAS - a "BASIC" program. Needs GWBASIC or BASICA to run the program.       *
* ARC - a archived file - needs to be unarchived, contains many files.       *
* DQC - a compressed file - needs to be uncompressed to be readable.         *
* DOC - A DOCUMENTATION FILE - instructions about the program - READ THIS    *
* TXT - A DOCUMENTATION FILE - instructions about the program - READ THIS    *
******************************************************************************

     You may also see files like READ.ME or README.1ST or just README. These
are all documentation files that will tell you about the program or how to
work the program properly.

VERY IMPORTANT:  READ DOCUMENTATION FILES FIRST BEFORE RUNNING THE PROGRAM!!!

===============================================================================

     To view a documentation file on your screen, use the "TYPE" command.
With your program disk in the "A" drive enter the following command:
     A>TYPE filename.ext  (enter) - where filename would be README.DOC
            or whatever the filename is that you wish to view.
     This will display the documentation to the screen.  To stop the text
from scrolling by, press "CTRL S" (the CTRL key and "S" key at the same
time), any other key to resume scrolling. To obtain a printout of the
documentation simply replace the "TYPE" command with the "DOS" command
"COPY". Turn your printer on and enter the following command:
     A>COPY filename.ext PRN <enter> - where filename would be README.DOC or 
                                       whatever file you wish to print.

===============================================================================

     An "EXE", "COM", or "BAT" file extension means that when you  
enter the filename, the computer will do something.  For instance,
if the filename were "POKER.EXE", or "POKER.COM, or "POKER.BAT" you would
enter the following at the "A" prompt:
     A>POKER  <enter> - the poker program would now come up on the screen.

===============================================================================

     Another type of file (a little tricky to run) is a "BASIC" file. These
types have the "BAS" extension.  Any file with this extension must be run with
the "BASIC" interpreter.  That simply means that you must have a copy of
"GWBASIC.EXE" if you have a clone, or "BASICA.COM" if you have an "IBM". These
2 files (GWBASIC & the "BAS" file) must reside together or be able to find
each other.  An easy way to do this is to simply copy "GWBASIC.EXE" to the 
disk that contains the "BAS" files. When both files are together &
this disk was in the "A" drive you would enter the following command:
     A>GWBASIC POKER  <enter> - the poker program would now be "running"
                                & you would be playing the game.

===============================================================================

     Another important file is one with an "ARC" extension.  This means it is
an archived file & contains many smaller files within it. This is done so 
all the files will fit on to the disk(s) you received. You must extract the
files with a special program.  The program most commonly used is called 
"PKXARC.EXE". To extract files from a file called "TEST.ARC", enter the
following command: 
     A>PKXARC TEST B:   <enter> - this would extract all the files and place
them on a disk that was in the "B" drive.  You must have a FORMATTED blank disk
in the "B" drive when issuing this command. You could copy the "ARC" files & 
the program "PKXARC.EXE" to your hard drive & enter the following command:
     C>PKXARC TEST   <enter>  -  this will extract all the files from an
                                 archived state. Then you will see some of
                                 the different filenames mentioned above when
                                 you use the "DIR" command.

===============================================================================

     Hopefully this help sheet will enable you to understand & use your disks.
If all this still sounds like "GREEK", then we strongly suggest that you 
purchase the following disks:

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
