Definition of Shareware
 Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software
 before buying it. If you try a Shareware program and continue
 using it, we expect you to register. Individual programs differ
 on details -- some request registration while others require 
 it, some specify a maximum trial period. With registration, you
 get the simple right to continue using the software and an 
 updated program.

 Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software,
 and the copyright holder retains all rights, with a few 
 specific exceptions as stated below. Shareware authors are 
 accomplished programmers, just like commercial authors, and
 the programs are of comparable quality. (In both cases, there
 are good programs and bad ones!) The main difference is in the 
 method of distribution. The author specifically grants the 
 right to copy and distribute the software, either to all and
 sundry or to a specific group. For example, some authors 
 require written permission before a commercial disk vendor may
 copy their Shareware.

ASP Ombudsman Statement 
 "Bradley J. Smith is a member of the Association of Shareware 
 Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to  make sure that the shareware 
 principle works for you. If you are  unable to resolve a 
 shareware-related problem with an ASP member by contacting the
 member directly, ASP may be able  to help.  The ASP Ombudsman
 can help you resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member,
 but does not provide  technical support for members' products.
 Please write to the ASP Ombudsman at 545 Grover  Road, Muskegon,
 MI 49442 or send a CompuServe message via CompuServe Mail to
 ASP Ombudsman 70007,3536."
