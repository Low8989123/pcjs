                        BALLOON CHALLENGE  v1.0
                        ________________________

                        Program by William Soleau


                    Requires:  EGA/VGA

              Requires Files:  Balloonc.ov0  Balloonc.ov1
                               Balloonc.ov2  Balloonc.ov3
                               Balloon1.jft  Balloon2.jft




                                OBJECTIVE

       The objective of Balloon Challenge is to get your 25 colored
       balloons as high as you can on the game board.  The higher the
       balloon goes, the higher the points awarded.  The player with
       the highest score at the end of the game is the winner.


                                GAME PLAY

       At the start of a new game, the computer will decide who goes
       first.  The computer always plays the Yellow balloons.  At the
       bottom of the screen you will see your 25 balloons ready to be
       launched.  There will be a white square drawn around the first
       balloon.  Using your <Arrow Keys> move the marker to select the
       balloon you want to launch into the sky.  To release the balloon,
       press the <Spacebar> key.


                                GAME OBJECTS

       There are many different objects in the sky that you will have to
       either utilize or avoid, in your quest to get the balloon as high
       into the sky maze as possible.  There are Airplanes, Dark Clouds,
       Bonus Clouds, Directional Clouds and Hurricanes.


       Airplanes:     will destroy your balloon if you hit one.  They
                      continue to move one space at a time across the sky
                      for each turn.

       Dark Clouds:   will stop the balloons from going higher.

       Directional:   will send the balloons in the direction of their
       Clouds         arrow.  Once a balloon has hit one of these
                      clouds, the arrow will change to the other direction.

       Hurricanes:    will move your balloon to a random place on game
                      board, and it will continue to climb higher if it
                      is able to do so.

       Bonus Points:  If you can get your balloon to go through one of
                      these clouds marked with a '10', then you will get
                      an extra 10 points added to your score.  These bonus
                      clouds can only be captured once per game.



                                  SCORING

       Points are awarded for all the balloons which are located on the
       game board.  Every row higher is worth 5 points.  Since there
       are 15 rows, a balloon that reaches the very top will have a
       value of 75 points.

       Once all the balloons have been released by both players, the
       game will be over.  The player with the highest score will be
       the winner.

       All balloons that are stuck on their launching pad because of an
       object directly above them, will be considered a grounded balloon
       because they will not be able to reach the first row.  They will
       be automatically removed by the computer.


                              KEYS / OPTIONS

       All key definitions are shown below the game board at all times.

                <D>irections   <O>ptions   <N>ew Game   <Q>uit

       The <O>ption key brings up a menu which allows you to toggle the
       Sound on or off.  There is also some information about Soleau
       Software and our EGA/VGA games.

                              OBJECTIVE

      The objective of Bolo Box is to flip all the tiles on the game
      board back to the color gray in as few moves as possible.


                              GAME PLAY

     Select one of 50 puzzles by pressing the <S>elect Puzzle key.  The
     puzzle will load itself onto the game board.  A yellow square will
     be located in the upper left hand corner of the board.  Use the
     <Arrow Keys> to move the marker to the desired place on the board
     where you want to flip the tiles.  To mark that tile, press the
     <Spacebar> key.  This will turn the yellow marker to green.

     If you make a mistake and want to un-mark the tile, then press
     the <Spacebar> again.


     To designate the direction of the flips, press the <Arrow keys>
     either:  Up / Down / Right / left.

     Starting at that tile, the other tiles in that row or column
     will flip over to the opposite color (Red or Gray).



                           SOLVING PUZZLE

     On the left side of the screen, the computer will tell you how
     many moves you have to solve the puzzle.  If you solve the puzzle
     in that many moves or less, the computer will consider the puzzle
     solved and it will be recorded as  * Solved *  in the Status Box.


                            OPTIONS / KEYS

     All key designations are shown at the bottom of the screen at all
     times.  By pressing the <O>ption key, you get the following.

                       <T>oggle Sound (On/Off)
                       <S>olutions  (Puzzles 1 - 10 only)
                       <G>ames by Soleau Software.



                               SOLUTIONS

     In this Shareware version of Bolo Box, we have provided solutions
     to the first 10 puzzles.  By pressing the <O>ption key and then
     selecting <S>olutions, you will see how the computer solves the
     current puzzle on the game board.

     Bolo Box puzzles get harder as you go along.  You don't have to
     solve them in order, but by trying out the first one or two, you
     can get an idea how the game is played.

The brand new PC-SIG World Of Windows is a must-have for Windows users.
In order to produce the best possible Windows collection PC-SIG has made
an alliance with the acclaimed Windows OnLine BBS. So not only do you have
access to the collecting and weeding out efforts for which PC-SIG is
famous, but also the huge volume of fonts and sound files and the in-depth
software reviews of the world's best Windows BBS.

This CD contains every one of the best Windows shareware programs
available, 350+ in all, over 900 TrueType fonts which can be used
without royalties, 429 ATM fonts, over 2,000 sound files in .WAV,
.VOC, .SND, .SOU, .MID format and 2,794 icons! A major computer
catalog is offering a collection of 250 fonts for $49.95. They have
great prices on hardware and software, but this time they can't
touch us.

As if the files aren't enough, we thought you would want to preview
and use these sounds, fonts, icons and programs directly from the CD,
without taking the time and space to unarchive them. So we have
included a font previewer and installed, a sound player and an icon
manager. Over 200 of the programs can be run simply by clicking on
them in the File Manager. Nobody else offers you anything close to
this type of access.

We're not done yet. In add to all the Windows riches described above,
this CD also contains the text and programs from the July-August
issue of Shareware Magazine. This is the second in a six-volume PC-SIG
Encyclopedia of Shareware CD-ROM series (Games was the first). Each
volume includes the programs from a section of the PC-SIG Library plus
all the text and every program from the current issue of Shareware
Magazine. Software reviews for this issue cover over 100 programs
including games, communications, printing, text editors and more. 124
of the programs mentioned in the magazine are included, plus 225
programs updated since the May-June issue.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
