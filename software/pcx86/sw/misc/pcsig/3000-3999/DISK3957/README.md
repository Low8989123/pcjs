	HardTrack V1.2 Release information


        Copyright 1993, Jim Olsen SUPERWARE, All Rights Reserved.


        --------------------------------------------------------------------
        Thank You For Evaluating HardTrack!

        HardTrack is the easiest and quickest Hard Drive Auditing
        Software you'll ever see. It's small, can be used on a Hard Drive
        for file change tracking, or use HardTrack from a FLOPPY for
        software audits. Review the user's guide at HardTrack's main
        menu, or in the file HDT.DOC.

                                        Jim Olsen SUPERWARE <ASP>.

        --------------------------------------------------------------------
	Installing HardTrack V1.2.

        For Hard Drive installation, just copy HDT.EXE to a DOS path
        directory. Follow these steps:

        -  Identify a DOS path directory. Type PATH at the DOS prompt.
           Look for a suitable directory, such as C:\UTIL or C:\DOS.

        -  Copy HardTrack to your HardDrive. Type:
                Copy A:\HDT.EXE C:\UTIL\QD.EXE
                or   B:\HDT.EXE C:\UTIL\QD.EXE
              Where: UTIL is the DOS path Directory you've chosen.

        -  If you do not have LIST.COM, you may also copy HDTLIST.EXE
           to the same DOS path directory.

        -  Type HDT at the DOS prompt. Press enter and you can review
           Hardtrack instructions by pressing 'H' - How to use HardTrack.

        -  You may use Hard Track from a floppy. Refer to PC Adminstrator
           mode in the online user guide.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	New Features in HardTrack V1.2

	- For Extremely Large Drives, documented how to correct out of
	  memory conditions.

        --------------------------------------------------------------------
	New Features in HardTrack V1.1

        - Added Mouse support. The mouse moves the cursor UP or DOWN.
          The left mouse button simulates pressing ENTER.
