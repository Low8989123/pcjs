This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
900 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'INSTALL' at
the DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy
access to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.  All the programs are logically divided into thirteen
major categories with subcategories, making it easier to find just the
right software.

All of the programs have been scanned for viruses.  There are also three
online virus utilities that can be run from the CD-ROM which will scan,
screen and clean viruses.  Not only does this save hard disk space, but
also gives every user added security from viruses.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

Winner of the Optical Publishing Assn's Best Consumer Product Award.

Shareware for every imaginable need: Accounting Chemistry Educational
Engineering Games Hypertext Networks Programming Spreadsheets Utilities
Word Processing

Additional BBS file descriptions are available from PC-SIG so that the
CD-ROM can be set up quickly on a bulletin board.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 530K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
a graphics monitor (Hercules/EGA/VGA/SVGA).  A mouse is optional.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.


                      The PC-SIG Games CD-ROM
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now you can play a game a day fo over a year.  This CD-ROM is jammed
with over 380 shareware games of all types, designed to appeal to the
new generation of CD-ROM users out for fun.  The CD incorporates a
hypermedia interface and allows 250 of the games to be played directly
from the CD-ROM.

The hottest games in shareware are on this disk, including the
action/arcade games "Jill of the Jungle" and "Wolfenstein 3D," which
rival or surpass commercial PC and Nintendo for use of animation,
SoundBlaster audio, and VGA graphics.  There are also games designed to
teach children mathematics, spelling and even ecology.  All these games
for less than a dime each!

Over 250 of the games can be played directly from the CD without copying
them to a floppy or a hard drive.  Being able to run from the CD means
that users can explore games without using up valuable hard disk space
or spending time downloading and deleting files.  The hypermedia
interface makes it easy to browse the titles, read a one line
description or full review, and copy or start a game by clicking the
mouse or using the keyboard.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

                A WORD (OR TWO) ABOUT "SHAREWARE"

Many programs have recently been distributed using the
"shareware" concept.  Whiplash Software uses this distribution
method in order to make its products known to a vast number of
users cost effectively.  Unlike other companies, Whiplash
Software does not DEMAND payment from individual users.  You are
invited to contribute whatever you feel the software is worth, be
that nothing or the requested $15.00 registration.  If enough
users support this method of distribution, then they will
continue to see good products at affordable prices.  No doubt you
have heard all this before and chances are you're either the kind
of person who will register shareware programs or you are not.  
To us at Whiplash Software, it is a simple question of fairness.
We have worked several very hard and long hours to bring you
these image files at a very reasonable price.  We hope our faith
in you to repay our hard work is not misplaced.

By the way, don't forget that when you register Whipware Clip Art
Volume One, you receive Volume Two free!

                          INTRODUCTION

PFS: First Publisher has been around for nearly two years under
the name of Clickart Personal Publisher and Logitech Publisher. 
Under the name First Publisher it is one of the fastest selling
software programs on the market today.  Its ease of use combined
with low price make it the program of choice in the low-end
desktop publishing arena.  

Whipware Clip Art Volume One will give you additional images,
boxes, borders and art based fonts to use in First Publisher. 
Combining these images with those you should already have, will
give you a strong graphics gallery.

                 HARDWARE/SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

Whipware Clip Art Volume One images will work on any IBM PC, XT,
AT or PS/2 compatible machine equipped with 512k of available
memory, a hard disk drive (or two floppy drives) and a graphics
card using MS-DOS 2.1 or higher.  YOU MUST ALREADY OWN PFS: FIRST
PUBLISHER VERSION 1.0 OR 2.0 IN ORDER TO USE WHIPWARE CLIP ART
VOLUME ONE!  If you don't own a copy of First Publisher, by all
means buy one!

                          INSTALLATION

Whipware Clip Art Volume One can be installed by simply copying
the files containing the extension .MAC to the drive/directory
where you keep First Publisher.

Whiplash Software recommends that you store your image files in
their own subdirectory.  While this is not absolutely necessary,
it helps eliminate mixups between First Publisher .MAC files and
.PUB files.

To install Whipware Clip Art Volume One on a hard disk you can
use the DOS copy command.  Assuming you followed the instructions
which came with your First Publisher program, you should have
First Publisher stored in a directory named "C:\PUB".  To copy
the Whipware Clip Art Volume One .MAC files from a floppy drive
to your First Publisher directory, place the Whipware disk in
Drive A: and type...

                       COPY A:*.MAC C:\PUB

All the image files will be copied to your First Publisher
directory and can be called up when you need them.

If you want to use a special directory for your image files, copy
them to that directory instead of First Publisher's default
directory.  At Whiplash Software we use a directory named
C:\PUB\MAC.

If you are unfamiliar with this process, see your DOS manual for
more information on creating subdirectories.

To install Whipware Clip Art Volume One on a floppy based system
is even easier.  Just insert the disk in Drive B: any time you
want to call up an image file.  Just be sure to let First
Publisher know the Drive/Path where the files will be located.

PAGE-5



                             BACKUPS

It's important to make a backup copy of your Whipware Clip Art
Volume One disk.  To do so, place your original program disk in
Drive A:.  Put a blank, formatted disk in drive B: and type...

                          COPY A:*.* B:

If you have a hard disk, you can replace the B: with your drive
designation.

Making a backup will protect you in the event of a disk drive
crash.

Users who don't heed this advice may face the need for a
replacement disk and if registered, can obtain one for $5.00 from
Whiplash Software.

                      USING THE IMAGE FILES

Whipware Clip Art Volume One image files are stored in the First
Publisher .MAC file format.  You may load each image file by
clicking open the FILE Menu (Strike F1 if you are mouseless) then
select GET GRAPHICS.  The file dialog box will pop up showing the
file names and current drive/path designation.  Type in the name
of the drive/path where you have stored the Whipware Clip Art
Volume One files (Do nothing if the Whipware files are in the
default directory) and select the file you want to work with.

Whipware Clip Art Volume One files work just like the graphics
files which came with your First Publisher package.  You can
select any image (or portion thereof) on a Whipware page and save
it as a First Publisher .ART file by clicking the ART menu
(Strike F7) and then select SAVE ART.  After selecting an image,
you can crop, flip, invert or print that image.  See your First
Publisher manual for more information on selecting/manipulating
ART files.

That's all there is to it!  If you've used the graphics files
available from Software Publishing Corp., you can use Whipware
image files.

We hope you enjoy using these files and invite you to send your 
comments with your registration.  Look for more great clip art
for First Publisher available from Whiplash Software soon!
