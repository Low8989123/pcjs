yet still have all the information you need to make an informed decision,"
said Kent.

All new and updated programs have been reviewed and tested by PC-SIG. Every
program goes through extensive virus checking using the most recent version
of VIRUSCAN from McAfee Associates, and other anti-virus software.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

ROCKFORD!

Version 2.5

INTRODUCTION

Need a business card?  Rockford!'s your program. Using Rockford! with 
Microsoft Windows 3.x, you can design professional-looking business 
cards in just a few minutes. It's far easier to design your cards in 
Rockford! than by following the traditional path of going to your 
printer and trying to pick out a business card design from a book.

If you hired a graphic designer to create a business card, you'd 
spend much more than you did for this program, and the results might 
not be as good.  Using Rockford!, you have complete control over the 
entire design process. Since you see your card on the screen, as it 
will appear when printed, you can make as many changes as you like, 
as often as you like.

PROFESSIONAL USERS

If you're a graphic design professional, or the owner of a small 
print shop, Rockford!'s your answer too. Instead of your customers 
trying to figure out what they want their cards to look like by 
looking in your book, they can see the design on paper--before you 
send it to the printer. The result is far fewer costly returns. You 
have a happy customer and cash in your pocket.

There's even more.  Using Rockford!, you can print sheets of your 
customer's designs, then copy them onto card stock.  Just cut the 
cards and you can offer 1-hour business card service. Rockford! 
doesn't take the place of a true print shop, but being able to offer 
your clients a quick set of 100 cards while they wait can mean the 
difference between a sale and a walk-out.

OTHER USES FOR ROCKFORD!

Rockford! isn't limited just to business cards. Clubs can use 
Rockford! to produce membership cards. Used with readily-available 
pin-back card holders, Rockford! can produce ID cards. Many users also 
use Rockford! to create humorous or gag cards. Use your imagination.

See the Feature section information about Rockford! Professional, 
which includes special features just for professional use.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Rockford! requires an 80286 or 80386 computer or better, with at least 
2 MB of RAM. You also need Microsoft Windows 3.x, or a later version, 
plus a hard disk and mouse. For printing, any Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 
or compatible printer with at least 2.5 MB of memory is your best 
choice. For best results, a font-scaling program, such as Adobe Type 
Manager, is strongly suggested. Rockford! does not support the 
SuperPrint font scaling software.

Rockford! does support PostScript devices.  However, clip art images 
will not print on these printers in most cases. If you use a 
PostScript printer, you must have matching screen fonts for your 
PostScript fonts. If you use Adobe Type Manager, your system must be 
set up properly to download fonts as needed.

IMPORTANT PRINTER NOTES:

You'll get best results with Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printers, using 
TrueType or Adobe Type Manager fonts. However, other printers may work 
with Rockford! PostScript printers can print Rockford!'s cards, but 
cannot print clip art images. HP DeskJet users can use Rockford!, but 
may have to use the Shift commands in the Layout menu to shift the 
layout up about .25" on the page to prevent the bottom row of cards 
from running over to the next page. See the information below.

DOT-MATRIX PRINTERS

Dot-matrix printers are not directly supported by Rockford! Generally, 
clip art images will not print at all, or may print in the wrong 
location. However, there is a solution. An addon product, Laser Twin 
from Metro Software, can emulate Hewlett-Packard LaserJet output on 
popular dot-matrix printers.

To use this program, you select the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet Series II 
printer driver in Windows, printing to a file instead of directly to 
the printer. (See your Windows manual for instructions on how to do 
this.) Then, from DOS, you install Laser Twin and copy the file to the 
printer. (See the Laser Twin manual for instructions on how to do 
this.) Your output will work just fine, and even clip art images will 
print correctly.

For information or to order Laser Twin, contact:

Metro Software
1870 W. Prince Road
Suite 70
Tucson, AZ  85705
602-292-0313
800-621-1137

Laser Twin sells for about $100 and will work with other programs as 
well.
 
LANGUAGE NOTES

Rockford! was written in Microsoft Visual Basic 1.0. To use it, as with 
any Visual Basic program, the file VBRUN100.DLL, included on your 
distribution disk, is required.

If you downloaded this program from a BBS, you should be able to find 
the file on that BBS. You can also download it as VBRUN100.ZIP on the 
OsoSoft BBS at (805) 528-3753.

PROGRAM LIMITATIONS

Due to a documented bug in Visual Basic, do not drop to DOS while 
Rockford! is minimized. Exit Rockford! before dropping to DOS or 
running DOS programs in Windows!

LICENSE INFORMATION

contact George Campbell, president of OsoSoft, before including any 
OsoSoft program on such a disk.

Finally, you may not charge a fee larger than $6.00 to distribute the 
shareware version of any OsoSoft program.

INSTALLATION

If you have manually installed other Windows software, you can 
probably skip this section, although it's a good idea to read it in 
any case.

To install Rockford!, first create a directory especially for the 
program. If you need help with the DOS MKDIR (MD) command, see your 
DOS manual.

Now, copy all the files included with Rockford! into your new 
directory. You can use the DOS command line, the Windows File 
Manager, or another Windows shell program to do this. Finally, copy 
the VBRUN100.DLL file on your distribution diskette into your Windows 
home directory.

Now, start up the Windows Program Manager, if it's not already on the 
screen. If you use another program shell, such as the Norton Desktop 
Manager,  you'll need to consult that program's instructions on 
manually installing a new program.  Otherwise, with Program Manager, 
follow the instructions below:

1. Click once on the program group where you want the Rockford! 
   icon to appear. 
2. Click the Program Manager's File menu command.
3. Click the New command. 
4. Click OK in the next dialog box to 
   create a new program item. 
5. Type Rockford!, then press the <Tab> key. 
6. Type the Path to your Rockford! directory, then type ROCKFORD.EXE.
7. If you're using Windows 3.1, you also should enter the path to the 
Rockford directory in the "Working Directory" field.

Your entry should look like this (with your own path information):
C:\ROCKFORD\ROCKFORD.EXE

NOTE: On a few laptops and desktop systems, Rockford may cause keyboard 
problems in it's default installation. If this occurs, change the line 
above by adding NF to the end of the line. Now your line will look like 
this:

C:\ROCKFORD\ROCKFORD.EXE NF

See the section below on the Flashing Scroll Lock LED for more 
information.

7. Check your information, then click OK.
8. The Rockford! icon will appear in the program group box you selected. 
   You may have to use the scroll bars to find it, but you can then drag 
   the icon to a new location.
9. Remember: in order to save your new Program Manager screen, you must 
check the Save Changes box when you exit Windows after loading Rockford!

This completes the installation of Rockford! on your computer and 
into Windows.

STARTING ROCKFORD!

To run Rockford!, start Windows, then double click on the Rockford! 
icon. That's all there is to it. However, if you use another program 
shell in Windows, you may have to use a different technique to start 
the program. Consult your shell program's manual for detailed 
information.

THE ROCKFORD! INTERFACE

When you start Rockford! for the first time, there will be a delay 
while the program creates its font list and prepares the rest of the 
program. A notice will appear on your screen as the program loads. If 
you have a large font library, this may take up to a minute.

From then on, Rockford! will load the font list from a file it 
creates. If you've added or deleted fonts, you'll be notified when 
Rockford! starts and have an opportunity to rebuild the font list. 
It's best to do so, since you'll want your list to be accurate.

Next, you'll see the Rockford! screen, which is maximized to take up 
the entire Windows screen. Unlike many other Windows programs, 
Rockford! uses command buttons and drop-down list boxes to perform 
most functions. The commands you need to create card designs are 
always right on the screen, grouped according to function. Tradition 
Windows menus duplicate most button functions, and offer some 
less-used commands.

FLASHING SCROLL LOCK LED

Due to a missing feature in Visual Basic, I was forced to flash your 
Scroll Lock LED on and off rapidly.  

On some systems, or with some other software running, this may cause 
difficulty with text editing. If this happens, simply add the 
parameter NF to the command line entry in the Program Manager's 
Properties dialog box.  Put a space between .EXE and NF Example:

If your NumLock LED flashes, press the <NumLock> key to stop the 
flashing.

C:\ROCKFORD\ROCKFORD.EXE NF

This will solve the problem, but you'll have to press the Shift key to 
force Rockford! to update the line number when you move the cursor to 
a new line with the mouse.

EDITING AND DISPLAY BOXES

You'll see two windows on the screen.  At the top is the text-editing 
box. Here, you'll enter and edit all the text to be included on your 
card. Just below it is another box, where a WYSIWYG display of your 
card appears. You can't edit directly in this WYSIWYG box.

Editing Text in Rockford!

Rockford!'s editing box works much like your Windows word processing 
program. You can simply type your text in the box. To position the 
cursor in your text, either use the cursor keys or click the mouse 
cursor where you want to type. If you select text by dragging with the 
mouse, new text you type replaces the selected text.

Normally, to save time, Rockford! updates the WYSIWYG display when 
you change formatting in any way or when you press the <Enter> key 
when typing text. If you want continuous updates, click the File menu 
and click on the Auto Updating Enabled command. This will place a 
check-mark next to the command and Rockford! will update the WYSISYG 
display whenever you move to a new text line. Try it both ways.

As you type, the font, size, alignment, and other formatting options 
on the current line carry over to the next line of type when you press 
<Enter>.

You are limited to 20 lines of text in Rockford!

LEFT SIDE BUTTONS

On the far left of your screen is a vertical row of buttons, in three 
groups. These buttons handle basic file and printing operations.

The Text Group

This group has just two buttons:

[Edit] -- This button returns the cursor to the text editing box. 
Since Rockford! always returns control to this box, you'll rarely, if 
ever have to click this button.

[Exit] -- Click this button to leave Rockford!  You'll be asked to 
confirm this choice.

The Card Group

Several buttons make up this group, which deals with files and your 
card design as a whole.

[Update] -- This button updates the WYSIWYG display. To prevent 
excessive delays, some commands used in Rockford! do not 
automatically update this display. Any time you want to see an 
updated version of your card, just click this button. Note: you can 
also update your display by moving the cursor to a new line of text 
in the editing box, or by clicking anywhere in the WYSIWYG display.

[Clear] -- This button clears your current card from the screen and 
from memory. You'll be asked to confirm this command. 

[New] -- This button clears your current card and prepares Rockford! 
for an entirely new card, with no filename attached.

[Load] -- The Load command lets you retrieve an existing card design 
from your hard disk. You'll see a typical Windows file opening dialog 
box, listing the files available.  Normally, your card designs will 
have the file extension .CAR, unless you specify a different 
extension.

[Save] -- Saves the current card with the current filename. No 
prompting takes place, and the design on the screen at the time of 
the save overwrites any previous data. If no filename has been 
assigned to the current card, the Save As dialog box will appear.

[Save As] -- Allows you to assign a new name for a card design.  If 
you're creating several variations of the same card, be sure to use 
this command to prevent overwriting a previous design. If you enter a 
filename without an extension, Rockford! will add the .CAR extension.  
It's best to stick to the default extension to avoid making changes 
in the dialog box when you load designs. 

[Print] -- This button drops the file menu down, highlighting one of 
the available printing options. Click the mouse on the one you want 
to use.

[AddPic] --This button opens a dialog box for loading graphical 
images.  You'll see a list of files in the BMP (Bitmap) format, 
including clip art files shipped with your copy of Rockford!. 
Rockford! can only use images in Windows BMP format. While Rockford! 
will display 256-color or 256-gray scale images, it will reduce those 
images to 16 colors or grays. Your printout will be at the 16 color or 
gray level.

To preview clip art images, click on a clip art file in the filename 
box. If you click just once, you'll see a preview of the image in the 
size it will appear on your card. If it's too small or too large, you 
can scale it later from within Rockford!. If you click on an invalid 
file, Rockford! will simply ignore your selection. By clicking on 
additional clip art filenames, you can preview all the graphics you 
have available.

To load an image onto your card, double click on the file name you 
want to load, or click OK to load the current image. If you click 
Cancel, no image will load.  


The Layout Group

[Horiz] -- This button selects the Horizontal card layout. This is 
the default, and appears when you start Rockford! You won't need to 
press this button unless you've changed to the vertical format. If a 
card already exists on the screen, you'll be asked whether you want 
to clear the design.

[Vert] -- This button switches to a Vertical layout. Notice that 
you'll see less of the text editing box in this format. Use the 
scroll bars to view more of your text. This command clears the card, 
after allowing you to confirm or deny.

[Margins] -- This button lets you set customized margins for your 
card. These margins affect only the top and sides, and do not alter 
the position of any borders. The default is .1 inch. If an offset has 
been added with the next button, that offset is added to the margin 
automatically.

[Offset] -- This button controls the spacing between the card edge 
and the borders drawn with the Border Type list box. The default is 
0, and this command has no effect if the card design has no border.


RIGHT SIDE COMMANDS

On the right side of the editing and WYSIWYG screens are three other 
groups of commands. These deal with text formatting and graphics. 
Some of these are buttons, while others present options in list boxes 
for easy selection.  Starting from the top:


Text Attributes (Insert Within Line)

These buttons allow you to insert boldfacing, italics, etc. within a 
line of type on your card. When you click one of these buttons a 
code, such as <Bold>, is inserted in your text, telling Rockford! to 
change the attributes for all characters following the code. To 
remove such a code, simply use normal editing tools to delete it in 
the text editing box.

HINT: You'll get the best results if you use these inserted commands 
sparingly. If you want to format an entire line, use the commands in the 
next group of commands.

NOTE: You cannot place two formatting codes next to each other. At 
least one character or space must separate formatting codes.  For 
example, to add boldfacing AND italics, insert a bold code before a 
space, then an italic code just before the word to be italicized. 

[Normal] -- This inserted <Norm> code shuts off all other codes. For 
example, to boldface a single word, insert a <Bold> code immediately 
before the word, then a <Norm> code immediately following the word.

[Bold] -- Inserts <Bold> in your text.  Any font may be boldfaced.

[Ital] -- Inserts <Ital>.

[Underline] -- Inserts <Under>.

[Subscript] -- Inserts <Subs>.

[Superscript] -- Inserts <Supr>

NOTE: [Superscript] and [Subscript] allow you to position text above 
or below the current line. Text size is reduced to 66% of the 
original text. This will affect line spacing on your card.

NOTE: You cannot use any of the above buttons on lines which have the 
Split at Tilde attribute, (See below). If you try, you'll see a 
message box telling you this.

[Bullet] -- This button inserts a standard bullet character at the 
current cursor position in the text editing box. Use it to create 
bulleted lists on your card. You can insert bullets anywhere in your 
text.

Text Attributes (Whole Line)

Unlike the previous set of commands, these commands affect an entire 
line, and offer a great deal of control over your formatting. You should 
use these commands whenever possible, rather than the inserted commands.

[Line] -- Displays the current line number, as determined by the 
position of your cursor in the text editing box.

[Dupe Previous] -- This button allows you to repeat the formatting of 
the line above the current line. This is useful whenever you want 
duplicate formats on several lines.  Just format the first line to 
contain that format, then move to the next line and click this 
button. All line attributes will be duplicated.

[Font] -- This drop-down list box displays the current font, and 
allows you to change a line to another font. Click on the arrow to 
drop down the font selection list.  Scroll through the list, then 
click on your font selection.  You'll see a sample of your selected 
font in a box just below this list box.

[Size] -- Displays the current size for the font used on the current 
line. Click the arrow to drop down a list of available font sizes for 
the line. Sizes range from 4 to 36 points, in one-point intervals for 
the smaller fonts.  If you want a font size (whole numbers only) not 
shown on the chart, just enter the number in the size display area 
and press <Enter>.

HINT: Changing the font size of a blank line affects line spacing.  
Use this trick to adjust line spacing in 1-point intervals.

[Border] -- Another list box, this one offers five options for card 
borders, ranging from none, to single, double, bold, and thin/thick 
double lines. The current selection shows in the display area. To 
change, click the down arrow.

[Align] -- This control affects the alignment of the selected line. 
The current setting shows in the display area. To change, click the 
arrow, then select your option. You can choose, left or right 
aligned, centered, or split lines.

NOTE: For split lines, you need to insert a tilde (~) in the text box 
where you want the line to split. Rockford! will automatically 
separate the two halves of the line. You cannot insert internal 
formatting codes in split lines.

Normally, lines are split with the left half being aligned with the 
left margin and the right half aligned with the right margin. By 
inserting spaces before or after the text, you can create custom 
alignments, such as blocks of text centered on both sides. Experiment 
to create a card that looks right to you.

[Style] -- Four check boxes control text attributes for the entire 
line. The Normal box, when checked, overrides all the others.  You 
may, however, check as many of the others as you wish, creating even 
Underlined Bold Italic text.

NOTE: You can turn off any of these attributes within a line, by 
using one of the inserted buttons described above.

[Rev.] Makes text on the line reversed, with white letters on a black 
background. You can increase the width of the black section by adding 
spaces before and after the text.

The Graphics Objects Group

This group controls line drawing, plus positioning and scaling of 
both line drawing objects and inserted clip art images.

[Object] -- This drop-down list box allows you to select an 
individual object for editing. As a default, the word PIC shows in 
the display area, identifying a clip art image as the current object. 
If you do line drawings, each line, box, or circle gets an object 
number, which appears on the WYSIWYG screen with the object. To 
manipulate an object, click the down arrow, then select the object of 
your choice. You may create up to 12 line-drawing objects.

[Width] -- This box controls the width of line drawing elements. 
Widths range from 1 to  24 pixels on the screen, which translates 
roughly to point measurements on the printer. If you change the 
current setting, it will affect the current object, if present, or 
the next object you draw. 

[Draw] -- This check box enables line drawing.  Click it before 
attempting to create a line. Rockford! will automatically select the 
next available object number.

[Line], [Box], [Circle] -- These options, only one of which can be 
highlighted, determine the type of object you want to draw.

Draw [Black] or [White] Options -- These options control the color of 
the object you are going to draw, or change the color of an existing 
object. Black is the default color.


DRAWING AN OBJECT

To draw an object in the WYSIWYG screen, first select the type of 
object ([Line], [Box],[Circle]), then set the width for the lines 
used to draw the object. Next click on the [Draw] checkbox. Move the 
mouse pointer inside the WYSIWYG display and depress the left mouse 
button at the starting point of a line, the upper left corner of a 
box, or the center of a circle.  While holding the button down, drag 
the mouse pointer to a new location.  A rubber-band image of your 
object will appear as you draw. Draw slowly for best results.  When 
the object is approximately the right size, release the left mouse 
button to place your object on the screen. A number will appear next 
to the object to identify it. Don't worry if size or positioning 
aren't exactly correct.  You can move or size any object later.

NOTE: Rockford! does not check to make sure your object is within the 
boundaries of the card. That's your responsibility. Objects extending 
past the card's edges WILL print outside the card's boundaries.

[Move], [Size] Options -- These two options determine whether the 
scroll bars (see below) move or size the current object.

[Scroll Bars] -- Both horizontal and vertical scroll bars are 
available to control positioning of graphical elements.  Depending on 
which of the option buttons above has the highlight, you can 
manipulate objects in .01 inch increments.


MOVING AN OBJECT OR CLIP ART IMAGE

Start by selecting the object in the [Object] list box.  Next, click 
on the [Move] option button.

To move the object in .01" increments, click on the [Up], [Down], 
[Left], or [Right] arrows on the appropriate scroll bar.

To move the object in .1" increments, click the scroll bar regions 
between the arrows and the position button on the scroll bar.

To move the object in larger increments, click and drag the position 
button on either scroll bar.

Dragging a Clip Art Image

You can also move a clip art image by dragging it around the screen 
with the mouse. To do this, click the left mouse button somewhere 
near the center of the image. Then, with the mouse button held down, 
drag the image to a new location.  This technique is most useful for 
large movements, and is less precise than moving an image with the 
scroll bars. What works best is to position the image roughly with 
the mouse, then use the scroll bars for precise positioning.


SCALING A LINE DRAWING OBJECT

First, select the object you want to resize, then click the [Size] 
option button. Then, use the  scroll bars, as described above to 
alter the size of the object. The increments are the same as when you 
move an object. 

SCALING A CLIP ART IMAGE

First, select the PIC object in the [Object] list box.

Click the [Size] option button.

Use the scroll bars with the same increments as described above to 
change the size of your image. The horizontal bar increases or 
decreases the horizontal dimension.  The vertical bar alters the 
vertical dimensions. The upper left corner of the image remains 
fixed.  Once the image is the size you want, you can re-position it 
with the [Move] option.

NOTE: For true proportional scaling of images, use the Graphics 
Scaling command on the main menu to display the scaling submenu. 
You'll find a complete description of this submenu in the section of 
this manual on Menu Commands.

[Erase Selected] -- This button erases the current image, as 
identified in the [Object] list box. This erasure is temporary.

NOTE: If you want to change to a new clip art image, you must first 
delete the current one, as described above.

[Restore] -- This button restores objects deleted with the [Erase 
Selected] button. Objects remain in memory unless removed by the 
[Clear] button, the [Draw] command is given, or until a new file is 
loaded.

[Erase All] -- This button removes all graphical elements from the 
screen. As with the erase selected button, the image remains in 
memory, and can be restored with the Restore button.


MENU COMMANDS

Some, but not all button and list functions are duplicated in 
traditional Windows menus. Other functions, less-often used, are 
offered only in menus.   For duplicated instructions, see the 
information in the section above for the equivalent button command. 
Here's a rundown:

FILE MENU

New Card Design -- Clears the current card and set up for a new 
design.

Open Card File -- Open an existing .CAR card design file.

Save Current Card -- Saves the current card with the current 
filename.

Save Current Card As... -- Allows you to save the current design 
under a different filename.

Insert Graphic File -- Lets you select a clip art image for insertion 
in your design.

Print Card Layout -- This command, whether selected here, or after 
pressing the Print button, prints your design in it's actual size, 
and as a double-sized image, with crop marks. The double sized image 
allows the printer to increase the resolution of your design to 600 
dots per inch, which is perfectly adequate for business card 
printing, especially when using the thermographic printing process.

In Rockford! Professional, you may specify the heading text which 
prints at the top of the layout sheet. This lets you customize your 
layouts with an advertising message. This heading prints in the 
default font.  You can change this with the first command in the Font 
menu.

Print Sheet of Cards -- This command prints an entire sheet of 
actual-sized cards. In the horizontal format, you can print 10 cards 
per sheet. In vertical format, you're limited to 9 cards per sheet. 
In both cases, thin lines on the page indicate the cutlines for the 
sheet. Any good, sharp paper cutter will produce professional-looking 
cards.

This feature allows you to print your own cards quite quickly, by 
feeding card stock paper through your laser printer.  As an 
alternative, you can print onto regular paper, then copy your sheet 
on a copier loaded with card stock.

Copy shops, printers, and graphic designers can use this feature to 
produce an instant set of cards to give customers for use while they 
wait for the cards to arrive from the printer.

NEW FEATURE!

Rockford! can now print on pre-scored card stock for even faster 
instant cards. See the section on this feature later in this manual 
for more information.

Print Four-Up Camera-Ready Layout -- This command prints your cards as a 
block of four cards on the page. Many printer shops prefer this format. 
You may choose whether or not to include crop marks. Check with your 
print shop for its preference.

MULTIPLE COPIES

All the print options allow you to print multiple copies, using your 
printer's built-in multiple copy command for increased speed. Just enter 
the number of copies you want.

NOTE: If you plan to print multiple copies, be sure to change your 
Printer Setup in Windows to the Manual Feed option BEFORE starting 
Rockford! Changes made after Rockford! is running don't take effect 
until you re-start the program.

Exit -- Quits Rockford!, with a confirmation box.


EDIT MENU

To use this menu, you must first highlight text in the text-editing 
box by dragging the mouse over the text you want to use.  Then, give 
one of the commands, or its keyboard shortcut.

Copy -- Sends a copy of selected text to the Windows Clipboard.  Use 
<Ctrl>+<Ins> as a shortcut.

Cut -- Removes selected text from the editing box, then stores it in 
the clipboard.  <Shift>+<Del> is the keyboard shortcut.

Paste --  Copies text from the Windows Clipboard to the current 
cursor location in the editing box..  Shortcut: <Shift>+<Ins>.

Auto-Updating Enabled -- This command, referred to above, is normally 
off. Click it to add a check mark and enable updating whenever you change 
lines in the text editing box.


LAYOUT MENU

This menu duplicates the buttons in the Layout group.

Horizontal -- Changes design to the horizontal format.

Vertical -- Changes design to a vertical format.

Use Pre-scored Card Stock -- Sets Rockford! up to use pre-scored card 
stock for printing. This new feature lets you print cards on special 
paper which has the cards pre-cut. This is a check-style command. When 
it is checked, you can print on pre-scored stock. When it is not 
checked, you'll print in the regular format. When this command is 
checked, you can print only full sheets of cards.

Pre-scored card stock dimensions:

Orientation: Horizontal
Cards Per Sheet: 10
Card Size: 2" by 3.5"
Top Page Margin: .5"
Bottom Page Margin: .5"
Side Margins: .25"
Space Between Columns: 1"

PRE-SCORE NOTES: 

1. Due to variations in printers and inconsistencies in paper alignment, 
you cannot use borders when printing on this material. The Border 
selection option will be grayed-out if this option is checked.

2. The Vertical card orientation is not available when using 
pre-scored stock.

3. Pre-scored cards are attached to the backing sheet with small, 
unscored areas of paper. You can simply tear the cards from the sheet, 
but you'll get cleaner cards if you use a single-edged razor blade or 
utility knife to cut the cards free.

4. ALWAYS feed pre-scored card stock manually, and have it exit from 
the back of the printer. You need the straightest possible paper path.

At this time, pre-scored card stock is available from only one source, 
Paper Direct, a company that specializes in custom paper for laser 
Printers. It is available in White, Cream, and Light Blue colors. 
Packages of stock contain 75 sheets and produce 750 cards. The stock 
costs about $20 per package, or less if you order in quantity.

For your convenience, here is the ordering information:

Stock Number    Color
PS1212          White

Paper Direct also sells a wide variety of unscored card stock suitable 
for use with Rockford's regular card-printing options.

Disclaimer: OsoSoft has no businees connection with Paper Direct. This 
information is offered only for your convenience.

Margins -- Sets margins for card text.

Border Offset -- Changes the offset for card borders from the edges of 
the card design.

PAGE SHIFTING COMMANDS

Shift Page Horizontally -- Shifts the whole card layout to the left or 
right. This command brings up a dialog box letting you enter an 
amount, in inches to shift the whole page to the left or right. 
Positive numbers move the page to the right; negative numbers move it 
to the left. Use this command on pre-scored stock to set up a perfect 
alignment for your printer. Small numbers, like .05, are usually all 
you'll need. Be sure to make a test printout when using this command.

Shift Page Vertically -- Use this command to shift the card layout up 
and down on the page. Positive numbers move the layout down; negative 
numbers move it up.

SPECIAL NOTE FOR HP DESKJET USERS:

Use the Shift Page Vertically command to shift your page up .25 inches 
if you're having trouble with cards printing off the paper. Experiment 
with this command until you get the results you want.


FONTS MENU

Rebuild Font List -- This command updates your Rockford! font list. 
Use it if you delete or add new fonts. NOTE: You won't need this 
command unless you ignore Rockford!'s option to update the font list 
when you start the program.

Make Current Font Default -- this command sets all empty lines of a 
card design to the font currently shown in the font selection list 
box. Lines already having another font name will not change.  This 
command also sets the font for printing the descriptive lines on 
printed layout sheets.

Insert Character Styles in Line -- This command opens another menu, 
which allows you to insert character formatting commands inside text 
lines in the editing box.  These functions are the same as those in 
the top group of buttons at the right of the screen.  


PICTURE SCALING MENU

The functions in this menu are not duplicated with on-screen buttons. 
Here you can re-scale a clip art image you've added to your design.  
All scaling percentages affect the image as it currently appears -- 
not the original image.  Just click on the percentage of change you 
want.

Custom -- This button brings up an input box which lets you enter a 
customized scaling percentage for your clip art image. Type in a 
value between 1 and 500 to scale your image, then click OK.  
Remember, these figures are percentages and, in most cases values 
ranging from 25% to 250% are most likely to give the effect you want.


HELP MENU

Help with Rockford!  <F1> -- This command opens a new window, which 
presents help information for Rockford!  On the left of this screen 
is an index of topics covered in the main help screen.  To get help 
on a topic, just click on the topic's name.  You can scroll through 
the list with the scroll bar to find other topics. Once the program 
finds the topic, the index name will appear highlighted at the top of 
the screen to the right, with the help information below. If your 
information cannot be read all on one screen, use the vertical scroll 
bar next to the help screen to move through the information.

NOTE: You can also press <F1> at any time to call the help screen.

About Rockford! -- Displays an information box showing version 
and other information for Rockford!

OsoSoft Program Info -- OsoSoft offers several other programs which 
may interest you. This command displays a window which lets you learn 
about these other applications. You can also use it to order OsoSoft 
products.

To view information on a program, click the [Info] button next to that 
program's name.

To order, enter the quantity desired for each product. Then fill 
out your name and address information and mark the appropriate disk 
size box with an X. Click the [Print] button to print the form or the 
[Cancel] button to return to Rockford!


TUTORIAL SECTION

In this section of the manual, you'll go through the process of 
creating a business card, using all the features of the program. Just 
follow the steps below.

After starting Rockford!, select a format, either horizontal or 
vertical for your card. You can either click on the appropriate 
button, or use the Layout Menu.

If the current font displayed under the Font box is not the one you 
want to use for most of the text in the card, choose another font. 

Now, enter text for your card in the text editing box. Press <Enter> 
after each line. Subsequent lines will be in the same format used in the 
previous line. Insert a single blank line anywhere you want vertical 
spacing. You can alter the font size of this line to adjust the 
spacing. The WYSIWYG display will be updated each time you press 
<Enter>.

To change fonts or other attributes for a line of text, click inside 
that line in the text editing box. Then, using the command buttons and 
lists on the right of the screen, select a font, size, alignment, and 
any character formatting you want on that line.

Remember: You can use the [Dupe Previous] button to duplicate the 
formatting of the line preceding the current line.

If you need split lines, with text on both sides of the card, move 
the cursor to the line to be changed, then insert a tilde character 
(~) where you want the line to split, and type the right side of the 
line.  Of course, you can do this when you first enter the text for 
the line as well.  To split the line, select "Split Line at Tilde" in 
the [Alignment] list box. 

HINT: Rockford! updates the WYSIWYG display whenever you press 
<Enter>, change a formatting option, or when you click the 
[Update] button or click anywhere in the WYSIWYG display.  To avoid 
delays, always use the mouse to move from one line to another.  Just 
click with the cursor where you want to work. Using the cursor keys 
means that the WYSIWYG display updates after each <Cursor Up> or 
<Cursor Down> keypress.

You can adjust the position of characters on your card by inserting 
spaces at the beginning or end of text.  Experiment to get just the 
effect you want. Click the [Update] button to view your changes.

Once all your text is in place, you may want to add lines, circles, 
or boxes, using the tools in the Graphics Tools group of commands.  
See the instructions above for details. Remember: you can alter or 
delete any graphical element at any time.

LINE, BOX and CIRCLE HINTS:  Don't forget that you can draw in white, 
as well as in black. You can erase part of a line or other object by 
drawing over it in white. This allows a great deal of flexibility.

You may want to add a clip art image to your card. To do this, click 
the [AddPic] button, or use the "Insert Graphic File" command in the 
File menu.  Select your graphic from the file list in the dialog box, 
then click OK to place it in the upper left-hand corner of the card. 
Remember, clicking once on a filename in this dialog box lets you 
preview your clip art images. Once you find the image you want, click 
OK or double-click on the filename.

You can use any of the tools described earlier to position and size 
your image. Remember, if you change either the height or width of an 
image, you'll affect its proportions. To size an image without 
altering its proportions, use the commands in the Graphic Scaling 
menu.

If you'd like a border around your card, select one in the [Borders] 
list box at the right of the screen. Your chosen border will appear 
in the WYSIWYG box. NOTE: occasionally, thick border lines will 
appear broken.  Don't worry...this will correct itself in a future 
update, and printing will always be correct.

NOTE: Borders are not available when using Pre-scored Card Stock.

If you want your border to be farther from the edges of the card, use 
the [Offset] button or the Offset command in the Layout menu. Enter a 
new measurement, but keep in mind that .1 inch moves the border quite 
a bit.  Experiment.  Remember that you can always change these 
measurements later.

Similarly, you can use the [Margins] button or command to move the 
text in from the border or card edges.  Again, make changes in small 
increments.  A change of .01 inch will make a noticeable difference.

Check your card design frequently, making changes wherever necessary. 
Once you're completely satisfied,  Use the [Save] button or command 
to save your card. Then print a card layout sheet and inspect the 
results.

NOTE: Due to differences in resolution between screen images and 
printed output, you may notice minor differences in your card.  Check 
your printout, then make changes in your design to produce the 
results you want.


EDITING YOUR DESIGNS

Once you've designed a few cards, you can save them to use as 
templates for future card designs. 

Editing Text

To replace existing text with new text, the easiest way is to 
highlight existing text by dragging over it with the mouse, one line 
at a time. Once the text is highlighted, just type your new text, 
which will automatically replace the highlighted text.

Controlling Line Spacing

You can make fine changes in the spacing between lines of text. To do 
this, make sure there's at least one blank line between the lines you 
want to change. Then, position the cursor on a blank line and change 
the font size for that line.  You'll see the changes on your screen.  
You can make changes in 1-point (1/72") intervals. If you need a font 
size smaller or large than those offered in the font size list, 
simply type it in the display area of the list. Rockford! does not 
accept fractional font sizes.


Placing Text Beside Clip Art Images

You'll often want to position text next to or around clip art images. 
To do this, use the [Alignment] options. For example, to position 
text to the right of an image, choose the Right Aligned alignment 
option, then add spaces after the text to move it left to the 
position you want. Similarly, use the Left Aligned option to position 
text to the left of an image. This time, however, place your spaces 
to the left of the text.

To wrap text on both sides of an image, insert a tilde (~) where you 
want the text to break, then choose the Split at Tilde alignment 
option.  Once again, pad the text with spaces to achieve the position 
you need.


Working with Split Lines

Rockford!'s ability to split lines is very powerful, letting you 
position blocks of text on both sides of the card.  Normally, the 
right half of the line is left-aligned, while the right half  is 
right-aligned. Often, however, you'll want to center blocks of text 
or manipulate the alignment in other ways. As described above, use 
spaces to pad the text until it's aligned just the way you want. 
Click the [Update] button to view your changes.  It only takes a few 
seconds to completely re-align your card.


Printing Samples

When working with complex card designs, it's always a good idea to 
print occasional samples of your design for checking.  As mentioned 
above, your printed image may vary slightly from the image in the 
WYSIWYG screen. After printing a sample, you can make changes to 
correct slight misalignments.

NOTE: You should always print a sample on plain paper before printing 
on pre-scored card stock to make sure alignment is correct. If it is 
not, use the Shift commands in the Layout menu to make adjustments.


ROCKFORD! TIPS AND HINTS

As with all software, there are a number of tricks and techniques you 
can use to save time and effort.  Here are some ideas for using 
Rockford!: Printing

Printing layout sheets and sheets of cards takes time. Rockford! and 
Windows have to compose graphical pages before a page emerges. You'll 
need a little patience.

If you're printing sheets of cards for instant use, you'll get the 
best results by printing on pre-scored stock.

For maximum quality when printing Rockford! card designs, be sure 
your laser printer has a good toner cartridge.  If you can set print 
density, choose a medium or dense setting to achieve dark blacks for 
reproduction.  If you're sending your card to a printer as 
camera-ready copy, select a high-quality paper for printing. Special 
papers designed just for camera-ready copy are available at office 
supply stores.

Rockford! can handle color and gray-scale clip art images, but the 
final output will depend on how your printer interprets the colors in 
your clip art.  You'll get the best results by far if you choose black 
and white line drawings, rather than color or gray-scale images.

Creating Multi-Color Cards

You can use Rockford! to produce multi-colored cards. Simply design a 
complete card, with graphics and all text elements.  Then, delete 
information which will not print in a color and print a layout sheet 
showing just the material for one color. Print a sheet for each color 
to be used on your card.  Rockford! prints accurate registration 
marks on its layout sheets for easy alignment by your print shop.

Working With Clip Art Images

Rockford! accepts Windows BMP (bitmap) files. Graphics programs, such 
as Windows PaintBrush, supplied with Windows, can create these tiles.  
You can convert other file types to BMP files, using any of a number 
of format conversion programs, such as HIJAAK, Publisher's PaintBrush, 
and others.

The size of your image is important.  Art for business cards is quite 
small, almost never exceeding 1" in any dimension.  Since Rockford! 
deals with 300 Dot Per Inch (DPI) printers exclusively, it's clear 
that a 300 X 300 pixel image will print as a 1" square.

While Rockford! can handle much larger images, it's usually better to 
scale large images in a program specifically designed to do that.  
Windows PaintBrush can handle preliminary scaling quite well. If you 
have a scanner, you can create your own clip art in minutes.  Simply 
scan the image, then use your scanner software, or a program like 
Zsoft's Publisher's Paintbrush,  to produce a BMP file approximately 
300 pixels in each dimension. Naturally, tall narrow images will use 
other dimensions, but you get the idea. While black and white line 
images reproduce best in Rockford!, it's worth experimenting with 
grayscale or color images.  Just save them as BMP files, then pop them 
onto your card.

You can also create clip art images with any paint program which can 
produce one of the file types that Rockford! supports. Creating 
custom logos isn't difficult at all. Also, a number of clip art 
libraries are available, both commercially and as shareware.  Most 
often, however, these images will need conversion to a supported 
format.

Finally, if you're not happy with the way an image prints in 
Rockford!, remember these tips:

Very thin lines often don't print well, and don't reproduce well in 
some printing processes, such as thermography. 

Large black areas may present problems for your laser printer, and 
sometimes don't reproduce as completely black. 

Reducing a large image to business card logo size often results in 
loss of detail. 

Increasing the size of tiny images, such as Windows .ICO icon files 
usually results in jagged lines on your printout. 

Keep your images simple for maximum impact. 

Complex line drawings usually don't work as well as iconic art which 
attracts, but doesn't confuse, the eye. 

For best results, set the density adjustment on your printer to a 
medium or dense setting. The darker your blacks, the better your card 
will look.


Lines, Boxes, and Circles

You cannot draw a graphical element which extends into a clip art 
image. The line will end at the edge of the image. You can, however, 
overwrite text with a line graphic. Let the WYSIWYG display be your 
guide. Be careful not to let lines, boxes, or circles extend past the 
card's borders. Always check the WYSIWYG display for conflicts.

Use the [Update] button to see the results of your changes. As you 
draw and move lines, text may not appear if it has been overwritten.  
Update to see the actual image.

Use the [Draw White] option to create special effects. Combining 
thick lines with intersecting white lines can create interesting 
effects. You can create quite complex drawings using the line drawing 
tools alone, including simple logos.

You can also draw boxes or circles around existing text on your 
design. It's best to first create the text, then follow up with 
lines, boxes, and circles.  Use the positioning scroll bars for 
precise sizing and placement.


TIPS FOR INSTANT BUSINESS CARDS

Since Rockford! can produce sheets of business cards, ready for 
cutting, you can use it to create small batches of cards for any 
purpose. Many professional users offer their clients a set of 50-100 
cards to get them by until their printed or thermographed cards are 
ready. Individual users can use this feature to produce their entire 
set of cards, avoiding the print shop altogether.

Here are a few tips to get the best results:

*Use the darkest setting available for your printer.

*Select a good quality card stock paper, but make sure your printer 
can handle this material. Not all laser printers can cope with heavy 
paper. For Hewlett-Packard LaserJets,  a 50 - 67 lb. paper works just 
fine.

*Select the feed option for your printer which sends the paper on the 
straightest path possible through the printer. Usually this means 
using the rear output tray. NOTE: You MUST use this feed option with 
pre-scored card stock!

Printing takes time. You'll get things done most quickly if you print 
a sheet of cards on regular paper, then copy that sheet on card stock 
with a high-quality copier.

Don't settle just for white card stock. If you're an individual user, 
your local copy center can supply this material in several patterns 
and colors. Using a colored or patterned paper will make your card 
stand out.


DESIGNING EFFECTIVE BUSINESS CARDS

Rockford! doesn't design your business card.....You Do! With 
Rockford!, your options are almost unlimited, and you can quite 
easily produce either an excellent card which will produce a powerful 
impact on those who receive it.  On the other hand, you can just as 
quickly produce an ugly, ineffective card.

The best way to get ideas for business card designs is to study cards 
others use. Go through your own collection of business cards or visit 
a copy center or print shop and look at their samples. Which cards 
jump out at you?  Which cards present an effective appearance?  Which 
ones do you think are loud, garish, or inappropriate? By looking at 
many card designs, you'll soon develop an eye for good design.

Still, there are a few basic principles to think about:

Make the card fit your profession. Doctors, lawyers, and other 
professionals usually use conservative card designs with few 
embellishments. On the other hand, if you're a gardener or a 
musician, you may choose a bright, lively card design which grabs the 
recipient's attention immediately and makes him or her remember your 
name.

Don't overdo the use of fonts. While it's amazingly easy to include 
multiple fonts using Windows, Rockford! and Adobe Type Manager, try 
to resist the temptation.  Typically, your best bet is to choose one 
attractive font for your name, company name, or other main lines, 
then use a simpler font, such as Helvetica for details, such as 
address and telephone number information.

Similarly, watch your use of graphics.  A garish or highly ornamental 
graphic is usually not the most effective tool in card design.  
Instead, select a company logo, or a simple line drawing which will 
catch the reader's eye without shocking him or her. Most companies 
have discovered that a highly-memorable icon logo is far more 
effective in reminding people about the company than an ornate image.

The same thing applies to line, boxes, and circles. Keep your design 
simple for best results. Don't let a too-bold line object overpower 
your card. After all, you want your customers or clients to remember 
your name or company name....not a line.

Finally, if your card needs to display several items in a list, try 
using Rockford!'s bullet feature.  It's automatic and effective.


WHY REGISTER  YOUR COPY OF ROCKFORD!?

It's tempting to simply use Rockford! as you find it -- a complete 
shareware program that may not cost you a cent. If you choose this 
option, nobody will come to your home or place of business and arrest 
you.

Still, there are a lot of good reasons to pay the modest fee I ask 
for registration.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
