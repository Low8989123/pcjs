PC-SIG Version: S1.0                                                    
                                                                        
Program Title: Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure                                 
Author Version: 1.20                                                    
Author Registration: 3 episodes for $35.00                              
Special Requirements: EGA/VGA, 28086+ system, and a high density drive. 
                                                                        
What's green with red spots, has suction cup hands, and an overbite like
Bart Simpson? Of course, the answer is Cosmo! A young alien on his way  
to visit Disney World with his parents. That is, until their ship is    
struck by a blazing comet, forcing them to land on an uncharted planet. 
                                                                        
While his Dad repairs the ship, Cosmo heads off to explore the strange  
planet. Upon returning, both his Mom and Dad are gone and big, scary    
alien footprints are all around his ship! Oh no... have Cosmo's parents 
been taken away? Possibly to be eaten? Well, Cosmo is off to the rescue.
Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure is an epic journey across a forbidden planet   
full of dangers and surprises. Can he save his parents in time? Cosmo is
a lovable extraterrestrial (alien) with a special ability: he has hands 
that work like suction cups! He can cling to walls, ledges, and all     
sorts of other things.                                                  
                                                                        
No game in Apogee's history has displayed such amazing multi-scrolling  
graphics technology similar to games found on the Super Nintendo. With  
top-notch EGA/VGA animated graphics, huge animated creatures, and nearly
two megabytes of colorful graphics.                                     
                                                                        
Amazing Features: Breathtaking EGA/VGA compatible graphics and          
animation, full-screen, Parallax-scrolling (an IBM PC first!); ad Lib   
music with 10 full-length theme songs; over 20 unique and surprising    
creatures; Cosmo has many tricks, like scaling walls with his suction   
hands; massive levels, yet easy to explore; self-running demonstration  
mode; almost 2MB vivid EGA/VGA animated graphics; joystick support,     
save/restore, built-in hints; and a lot more.
