2. Product Overview

The ultimate file transfer and synchronization program.

Sync-It is a must have program for those of you who use more
than one computer and need to frequently transfer files between
them, without the hassle of connecting cables. 
 
It's the perfect program for computer users who frequently
switch between portables and desktops and need the latest
versions of their important files updated on both PCs. 
 
Or, if you frequently transfer files between PCs... desktops,
notebooks/laptops or network whether at home or in the office,  
In-Sync is the answer.  Better yet if you frequently transport
files between offices, it's the ideal solution.  
 
Connecting cables or a modem is often impossible, cumber-some,
inconvenient or impractical.  Sync-It eliminates the tedious task
of transferring files between PCs using cables, modems or DOS
commands.  

With Sync-It you can use any removable media such as floppy disks
as a transfer media. 
 
Sync-It even keeps track of files which have been deleted from one
PC with the option to delete these from your other PC as well.
This is ideal if you use programs such as a personal information
manager and need to keep these files completely synchronized
(identical) on two PCs. 
 
Transfer Utility 
 
The Transfer Utility is used each time you want to transfer files
from one PC to another, using a transfer media such as floppy
diskettes.  You can be as selective as you want in determining
which files or directories you want to keep synchronized.  All
of the files which you have created, changed or have been copied
in the directories you want to keep synchronized are copied to
the transfer media. 
 
If you need to keep files such as a database or personal
information manager totally synchronized (identical) between
two PCs, the "Synchronize" feature assures that files deleted
from one PC are also deleted from the other. 
 
Optional file compression minimizes the number of disks needed for
transferring files and our split file technology assures that the
largest files can be transferred even when using floppy disks. 

Update Utility 
 
The Update Utility, restores the files you transferred from the
transfer media onto the other PC, making sure only the most recent
files are updated and that all files are synchronized. 
 
Major Benefits 
 
- Keeps the latest versions of files on multiple PCs updated. 
- No cables to attach. 
- Easy to install, setup and use. 
- Splits large files onto more than one diskette. 
- Compresses files during file transfers to minimize the number
  of diskettes needed. 
- Option to delete files which have also been deleted from another
  PC, keeping such things as databases 	and PIMs completely
  synchronized. 
- Automatic protection against updating files which were changed
  on  both PCs. 
- Transfer media can be any removable storage device. 
- Does not interfere with backup programs. 
- On-line documentation and help facility. 
- Unlimited technical support for registered users. 
 
Major Uses 
 
1. To keep your latest files updated between PCs. 
 
2. To keep databases such as Personal Information Managers
   synchronized on two PCs. 
 
3. To transport data between cities or offices. 
 
4. To transfer files from one PC to another. 
 
3. System Requirements

Windows 3.0 or higher, DOS 3.0 or higher, IBM« PC/XT/AT,PS/2«

	- Network Computing 


The Problem 

If you're like most people, you know how important it is to
regularly back up your hard disk.  But like most people, you
probably don't.  Why?  Because back up is a chore.  It's 
non-productive and traditional backup software - although fast-
requires too much effort, making backup easy to ignore.   
 
Even if you backup once a week or month, all of the files you
have created or changed since your last backup are still exposed.
These files are usually the most important at the time and if 
lost causes the greatest productivity loss.  
 
The Solution 

Its SitBack, a memory resident backup program that keeps your
most recently created and changed files backed up automatically,
in the background, without lifting a finger or exiting the 
programs you are working with.   
 
You remain 100% productive and at the same time 100% protected.   
 
Its perfect for professionals who have more important things
to worry about than the usual hassle involved with other backup
programs, but who's data is critical and time sensitive. 
 
How It Works 

SitBack works when your not by backing up your newly created and
changed files each time your computer is just sitting idle for
an amount of time you can specify.  So your hard disk is kept 
currently backed up throughout the day... automatically and in
the back-ground. 
 
Or you can schedule backups at specific times of the day or week.  
 
Either way it's the perfect utility for those who want complete
peace of mind, without the hassle. 
 
Easy To Use/Setup 

SitBack is easy to install and setup.  Just tell SitBack which
drives, directories or files to backup, how frequently and to 
where.  Once it's setup, the rest is left to SitBack.
You probably won't even know its there.   
 
Major Uses 

It's the perfect companion even if you already own but only
periodically use another backup program or tape drive.
