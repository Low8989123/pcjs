The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

Definition of Shareware

Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try
software before buying it. If you try a Shareware program
and continue using it, you are expected to register.
Individual programs differ on details -- some request
registration while others require it, some specify a maximum
trial period. With registration, you get anything from the
simple right to continue using the software to an updated
program with a printed manual.

Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial
software, and the copyright holder retains all rights, with
a few specific exceptions as stated below. Shareware authors
are accomplished programmers, just like commercial authors,
and the programs are of comparable quality. (In both cases,
there are good programs and bad ones!) The main difference
is in the method of distribution. The author specifically
grants the right to copy and distribute the software, either
to all and sundry or to a specific group. For example, some
authors require written permission before a commercial disk
vendor may copy their Shareware.

Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software.
You should find software that suits your needs and
pocketbook, whether it's commercial or Shareware. The
Shareware system makes fitting your needs easier, because
you can try before you buy. And because the overhead is low,
prices are low also. Shareware has the ultimate money-back
guarantee -- if you don't use the product, you don't pay for
it.

Drag and Drop Printing is a "shareware program" and is
provided at no charge to the user for evaluation.  Feel free
to share it with your friends, but please do not give it
away altered or as part of another system.  The essence of
"user-supported" software is to provide personal computer
users with quality software without high prices, and yet to
provide incentive for programmers to continue to develop new
products.  If you find this program useful and find that you
are using Drag and Drop Printing and continue to use Drag
and Drop Printing after a reasonable trial period, you must
make a registration payment of $15.00 to FLFSOFT, INC.  The
$15.00 registration fee will license one copy for use on any
one computer at any one time.  You must treat this software
just like a book.  An example is that this software may be
used by any number of people and may be freely moved from
one computer location to another, so long as there is no
possibility of it being used at one location while it's
being used at another.  Just as a book cannot be read by two
different persons at the same time.

Commercial users of Drag and Drop Printing must register and
pay for their copies of Drag and Drop Printing within 30
days of first use or their license is withdrawn.  Site-
License arrangements may be made by contacting FLFSOFT, INC.

Anyone distributing Drag and Drop Printing for any kind of
remuneration must first contact FLFSOFT, INC. at the address
below for authorization.  This authorization will be
automatically granted to distributors recognized by the
(ASP) as adhering to its guidelines for shareware
distributors, and such distributors may begin offering Drag
and Drop Printing immediately (However FLFSOFT, INC. must
still be advised so that the distributor can be kept up-to-
date with the latest version of Drag and Drop Printing.).

You are encouraged to pass a copy of Drag and Drop Printing
along to your friends for evaluation.  Please encourage them
to register their copy if they find that they can use it.
All registered users will receive a copy of the latest
version of the Drag and Drop Printing system.

VARIOUS HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ENVIRONMENTS INTO WHICH THIS
PROGRAM MAY BE PUT, NO WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE IS OFFERED.  GOOD DATA PROCESSING PROCEDURE DICTATES
THAT ANY PROGRAM BE THOROUGHLY TESTED WITH NON-CRITICAL DATA
BEFORE RELYING ON IT.  THE USER MUST ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK

     Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure that the
     shareware principle works for you.  If you are unable
     to resolve a shareware-related problem with an ASP
     member by contacting the member directly, ASP may be
     able to help.  The ASP Ombudsman can help you
     resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member, but
     does not provide technical support for members'
     products.  Please write to The ASP Ombudsman, at 545

Quick Start

Running Drag and Drop Printing is quite simple.  First you
must execute the Drag and Drop Printing program.  This may
be done in one of three ways:

       Select RUN from the program manager menu.  This will
       cause the run dialog to be displayed.  Enter
       <DRIVE>:\<DIR>\DDP.EXE.  Substitute the drive and
       directory where you installed Drag and Drop Printing
       for <DRIVE> and <DIR> in the previous example.  Once
       you have entered the command line, press O.K.  If
       you have problems executing Drag and Drop Printing
       using the RUN command, please refer to your Windows
       User Guide.
       
       Opening file manager, selecting the subdirectory
       where Drag and Drop Printing is located and then
       double-clicking on the DDP.EXE program.
     
       Adding Drag and Drop Printing to your startup group.
       This is the most efficient method to install Drag
       and Drop Printing.  This will cause Drag and Drop
       Printing to be executed each time that you start
       Windows.  If you need further help in adding program
       items to groups, please refer to your Windows User's
       Guide.

After you have executed Drag and Drop Printing it will
appear as an icon on your desktop.  To print text files with
Drag and Drop Printing use the following procedure:

       Open file manager.
     
       Select the subdirectory that contains the file you
       wish to print.
     
       Select the file you wish to print by clicking on it.
     
       Once the file is selected, drag the filename from
       the File Manager to the top of the Drag and Drop
       Printing icon and release it.
     
While you are dragging the file from File Manager to
the Drag and Drop Printing icon, the file will be
represented by one of two icons.  The first icon is what
File Manager uses to represent files.  As you drag the file
across the desktop, the file will change to a circle with a
slash through it (the international symbol for Do Not
Enter).  The Do Not Enter icon is displayed whenever the
file is on top of something that will not accept it.  When
the filename is placed on top of Drag and Drop Printing, the
icon will change back to a file icon, indicating that Drag
and Drop Printing will accept the file.  For more
information on the drag and drop technique, see Dragging
Icons to Perform Tasks in your Windows User's Guide.

Menu Options

Setup

The setup dialog allows you to specify the page heading,
page footing and print margins.  A Page heading is a line of
text that will be printed at the top of each page.  A page
footing is a line of text that will print at the bottom of
each page.  To add a page heading or footing:

       Enter the desired text in the Heading or Footing
       box.
     
       Select the check box to the right of the Heading or
       Footing box to select the text to be printed.  If
       the Heading or Footing box is not selected, the
       heading or footing will be saved when OK is
       selected, but it will not be printed.  (A check box
       is selected if you see an 'X' in the box).
     
       Choose the OK button.
     
The following special characters may be used in the Heading
or Footing:

     %d Current Date
     %t Current Time
     %f Full file name (including path)
     %p Current page number
     
The vertical bar character (|) separates the heading and
footing into text to be left justified, centered and right
justified.  Any text to the left of the first vertical bar
will be left justified.  Any test to the right of the first
vertical bar will be centered.  Text to the right of a
second vertical bar will be right justified.  The vertical
bar must be separated by at least one space.

For example:

Left justified text | Centered test | Right justified text

Will print:

Left justified text           Centered Text      Right justified text

Another example:

| | Page %p

Will print:
						       Page 1

Font

You can use the Fonts menu option to display the Fonts
dialog.  The Fonts dialog allows you to modify the Font,
Font Style and font Size for the entire document.  These
changes only apply to the documents being printed, they do
not actually modify the contents of the file.  Your Fonts
selection will be stored in the DDP.INI file and used each
time you use Drag and Drop Printing.

To change the Font, Font Style or Font Size using the Fonts
dialog:

       In the Font box, type or select a Font Name.
     
       In the Fonts Style box, type or select a Style.
     
       In the Size box, type or select a Font Size.
     
       Choose the OK button.

Print Setup

The Print Setup dialog allows you to select a printer,
change paper orientation, size and source.  The Options...
button will allow you to further configure your printer.
The options available on the Options... button will depend
on the specific printer.

To modify the printer click on either the Default Printer or
on the Specific Printer.  If you select Specific Printer, a
list of installed printers will be displayed.  Select one
from the list.  The printer selection is only stored for
this Windows session.  The next time you restart Windows
Drag and Drop Printing will use your default printer.

To modify the paper orientation, select either Landscape or
Portrait.  Landscape printing has the wider edge of the
paper as the top and Portrait has the narrow edge of the
paper as the top.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Outside the U.S.A.: Call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer near
you.

#$+ Overview

QRead lets you read text files quickly and easily in the 
Microsoft Windows 3.1 environment. Text files can be shown 
on the screen in any font you choose, and QRead will 
automatically adjust the type size or the line structure to 
fit the window. The display changes, but not the file 
itself. QRead accesses your file in a "read only" manner.  

Qread also provides tools to help with browsing and 
management of your text files. You can search for a text 
string, place a bookmark, copy information to the clipboard, 
and delete files. You move through the file by using the 
mouse to click on the scroll bars, or by using keys, such as 
the arrow keys and the PageUp and PageDown keys.

The operation and settings of QRead can be customized and 
remembered. This customization can be remembered on a file-
by-file basis if you desire.

#$+K Installation And Quick Start

The simplest installation of QRead consists of one step - 
copy the file qread.exe to your disk. No other files are 
necessary to get started.

The first time you enter QRead it will use default settings. 
The first time you exit QRead it will save the environment 
that you have in place at the time of exit. This environment 
is stored in the file "qread.ini" in your windows directory. 
Unless you choose to store settings information, qread.ini 
will be the only file that QRead writes to your disk. (The 
sections on the Entry / Exitt menu item and the Store menu 
items explain how QRead stores settings information.) 

If you want to be able to use on-line Help, you must also 
copy the file qread.hlp to your windows directory. 

To install QRead as a program item (using icons, etc.), 
refer to the section on Windows Program Manager.

#$+K Licensing And Distribution

QRead is a Shareware program and is provided at no charge to 
the user for EVALUATION. All rights are retained by the 
author. Feel free to share this program with your friends, 
but please do not give it away altered or as part of another 
system. If you try a Shareware program and then continue to 
use, you are expected to register and become a licensed 
user.

If you are using QRead after a reasonable evaluation period 
(30 days for commercial use), send your name, address and 
the license fee of $20 to:

    DS Products
    P.O. Box 342
    Westford, MA  01886

The $20 fee will license one copy for use on any one 
computer at any one time. You must treat the licensed 
software just like a book.  An example is that this software 
may be used by any number of people and may be freely moved 
from one computer location to another, so long as there is 
no possibility of it being used at one location while it's 
being used at another, just as a book cannot be read by two 
different persons at the same time. Site License 
arrangements may be made by contacting DS Products.

Registered users will receive:
    a key that disables the registration reminder window,
    support (via CompuServe [70731,1673] or regular mail 
        for 90 days),
    notice of upgrades, and
    a clear conscience.

Anyone distributing QRead for any kind of remuneration must 
first contact DS Products at the address below for 
authorization. This authorization will be automatically 
granted to distributors recognized by the ASP as adhering to 
its guidelines for shareware distributors, and such 
distributors may begin offering QRead immediately. DS 
Products must still be advised, however, so that the 
distributor can be kept up to date with the latest version 
of QRead.

The essence of Shareware is to provide users with quality 
software without high prices, and yet to provide incentive 
for programmers to continue to develop new products. 
Shareware is a distribution method that allows you to try 
before you buy. Shareware has the ultimate money back 
guarantee -- if you don't use the product, you don't pay for 
it.

#$+K Disclaimer

Users of QRead must accept this disclaimer of warranty: 
"QRead is supplied as is.  The author disclaims all 
warranties, expressed or implied, including, without 
limitation, the warranties of merchantability and of fitness 
for any purpose. The author assumes no liability for 
damages, direct or consequential, which may result from the 
use of QRead."

#$+K ASP Ombudsman

QRead is produced by a member of the Association of 
Shareware Professionals (ASP). ASP wants to make sure that 
the shareware principle works for you. If you are unable to 
resolve a shareware-related problem with an ASP member by 
contacting the member directly, ASP may be able to help. The 
ASP Ombudsman can help you resolve a dispute or problem with 
an ASP member, but does not provide technical support for 
members' products. Please write to the ASP Ombudsman at 545 
Grover Road, Muskegon, MI 49442 or send a CompuServe message 
via CompuServe Mail to ASP Ombudsman 70007,3536.

#$+K Open

When you select a file using the Open dialog box, QRead 
attempts to open the file and copy the entire file into 
memory. QRead uses this memory image to format and display 
the "open" file. No changes are ever made to the file on 
disk. Technical note: After the copy has been made, Qread 
actually closes the file. That is, the file is immediately 
closed as far as the operating system is concerned. 

QRead places no limit on file size ("huge" pointers are 
used), but the open command will fail if you do not have 
enough memory available.

Only one file is open at a time. If you ask to open a new 
file when there is already a file open, the new file is 
copied into memory replacing the memory image of the 
previously open file.

Whenever QRead opens a file, it checks to see if there is a 
file with the same name and path name but with the ".qfs" 
extension. If there is, QRead will read the stored settings 
info from the .qfs file and update the settings.

#$+K Open (continuous)

This menu item performs the same function as Open, but 
continues to display the dialog box after the Open command 
has completed. This is useful if you want to quickly browse 
through many files. It is also useful in conjunction with 
Delete. That is, you can quickly open a file, delete it if 
necessary, and then open the next file.

#$+K Close

Close "erases" the file from memory - it gives back the 
memory to Windows.

There is another effect of close. When you invoke the close 
menu item, the current settings will be stored in the ".qfs" 
file, if you have checked "On close and exit, store settings 
for file" in the Entry/Exitt dialog box. 

Scroll bars and some menu items are disabled if there is no 
file open.

#$+K Delete the open file

Delete asks you to confirm that you "really want to do this" 
before deleting the open file. If you are pretty sure 
already, for example when you are browsing through files, 
you can speed up the delete process by using the hotkey 
"Delete" and then "Enter" to confirm the deletion.

#$+K Exit

When you exit QRead, if you have a file open, AND if you 
have checked "On close and exit, store settings for file" in 
the Entry/Exitt dialog box, the current settings will be 
stored in the ".qfs" file.

#$+K As saved

QRead offers three views of your file - As saved, With 
adjusted type, With adjusted lines. Only one of the three 
views can be selected at a time, but you can switch between 
the views at any time. When you switch, your position in the 
file is preserved. You will find the same first character 
displayed in the upper left corner of the window.

The As Saved view displays the text file in the standard 
way, using the embedded new line characters to separate 
lines of text, but with the power of "fancy fonts." If a 
line is too long to fit in the given window with the given 
font, you have three choices: resize the window, change the 
font, or use the horizontal scroll bar (provided only in 
this view).

This view is good for viewing formatted text, like poetry or 
computer program listings. Don't forget to select a fixed 
pitch font, like Courier, to keep the formatting exact. If 
your text is most unformatted, but has occasional formatting 
using tab or space characters, try the "With adjusted lines" 
view.

#$+K  With adjusted type

QRead offers three views of your file - As saved, With 
adjusted type, With adjusted lines. Only one of the three 
views can be selected at a time, but you can switch between 
the views at any time. When you switch, your position in the 
file is preserved. You will find the same first character 
displayed in the upper left corner of the window.

The With adjusted type view displays the text as large as 
possible in the given window. That is, QRead automatically 
adjusts the type size to display the longest line in the 
largest type possible, within the limits of the chosen 
typeface. This view is good if you like things big.

The type size calculated may change when the window is 
resized OR when the longest line changes. As you scroll 
through a document, therefore, the type size may change. If 
this effect annoys you, you may want to use the adjusted 
type view to set a type size when you first open a file, and 
then switch to one of the other views to lock in that type 
size.

#$+K With adjusted lines

QRead offers three views of your file - As saved, With 
adjusted type, With adjusted lines. Only one of the three 
views can be selected at a time, but you can switch between 
the views at any time. When you switch, your position in the 
file is preserved. You will find the same first character 
displayed in the upper left corner of the window.

The With adjusted lines view holds the type size constant 
and reformats the lines of text to fill the window. Remember 
that the reformatting occurs only in QRead's memory, and 
that no changes are made to your text file on disk. This 
view is good for reading books and articles in the large 
type sizes without having to use large windows.

QRead fills lines one word at a time, using the space 
character (usually) to determine the end of a word. Qread 
will stop filling a line if it finds a blank line, a line 
that begins with a space, or a line containing a tab.  The 
reformatting will preserve the paragraph structure of your 
text file, therefore, if a new paragraph is denoted by a 
blank line, a line indented with spaces, or a line indented 
with a tab character. Lines containing a tab character are a 
special case.

When QRead finds a line (in the text file) containing one or 
more tab characters, it displays that line exactly AS 
STORED. The rationale is that someone put tabs in the text 
file for formatting purposes (perhaps for a table), and so 
QRead should try to preserve the format even if it means 
that a line might get clipped EVEN IN THIS ADJUSTED LINES 
VIEW.

The result of the algorithms described above is that QRead 
should handle most text files and preserve their paragraph 
structure and tables. If you are creating a text file to be 
read in QRead adjusted lines view, use blank lines or lines 
indented with spaces to denote paragraphs. Save the tabs for 
your tables.

Trivia note: QRead reformatting occurs on a page by page 
basis; the whole file is not reformatted at once. This 
causes one effect that you may find surprising. When 
scrolling backward, QRead may not choose the same word to 
begin a line as it did when you were scrolling forward. 
Don't worry, no words are lost. 

#$+K Increase type size

Choosing this menu item will increase the type size, UNLESS 
you are in the "With adjusted type" view. You can use the 
numeric key pad "+" to pump up your type size.

#$+K Decrease type size

Choosing this menu item will decrease the type size, UNLESS 
you are in the "With adjusted type" view. You can use the 
numeric key pad "-" to shrink your type size.

#$+ Repaint

If the display ever looks bogus, try a repaint.

#$+K Find

Find always starts its search from the current character 
position which, in case you didn't know, is the character 
displayed in the upper left corner of the window. The search 
string is limited to 25 characters. 

If the search string is found, QRead moves the current 
character position to show the found text at or near the 
first line, and highlights the found string. The 
highlighting remains on until there has been an 
unsuccessful search AND the display has been repainted. 

#$+ Find Next

The Find Next menu item is disabled until you have 
successfully used Find. The Find Next Search starts just 
after (or just before) the last successful Find.

#$+K Copy page to clipboard

The clipboard provides a way to get data out of QRead. This 
menu item copies the contents of the window to the clipboard 
AS TEXT. The text is copied from the memory image of the 
file, so the formatting of the clipboard text will match the 
formatting of the original file. (Remember that if you are 
in the "With adjusted lines" view, the image you are viewing 
has been reformatted.) You can then paste the clipboard text 
into a receiving program for further processing, such as 
printing.

You can also use the Windows provided copy to clipboard 
functions (using PrintScreen or Alt+PrintScreen) to copy 
QRead data AS GRAPHICS. You can then paste the clipboard 
graphics into a receiving paint program to print the screen 
with formatting and fancy fonts.

#$+K Place bookmark

There is only one bookmark and you use this menu item to 
place it just before the current character position (the 
character at the upper left of the window). Once you move 
away from the current character position, the bookmark 
disappears, but it is remembered and will be displayed if 
you choose the "Go to bookmark" menu item.

The bookmark can be remembered in a ".qfs" file. Refer to 
the "Store settings for file" menu item.

#$+ Remove bookmark

If you tire of having a bookmark and you just can't stand 
the thought of having it around, use this menu item.

#$+ Go to bookmark

This menu item moves to the bookmark and displays the 
bookmark at the top of the window. Trivia note: If you 
experiment with control panel and change your window colors 
you will find that the bookmark is not always the same color 
as the highlighted text used to show the search string.

# $+K Launch another QRead

Choosing this menu item will launch another instance of 
QRead (which might be used to read another file). The new 
instance will start up using qread.ini, so its window may 
not look exactly like the one that preceded it.

# $+K Launch companion App

This menu item will launch an application to be used in 
conjunction with QRead. For example, you can use QRead to 
browse through a file and then launch an editor to change 
the file.

The default application is the Windows editor, Notepad. 
Notepad will be launched with the file name of the open file 
as an argument. 

You can change the application that will be launched, but 
you must edit your qread.ini file to do so. Insert a line in 
qread.ini to specify the application. For example, to launch 
the application "yourapp" with the open file name as an 
argument, you would add the following line to qread.ini:

App1=yourapp %FileName%

Note: The test for %FileName% is case sensitive. Hint: You 
might want to use this feature to print (via DOS) until I 
implement printing under windows.

#$+K Fonts

Qread asks Windows for the names of all your installed fonts 
and displays those names in the Fonts dialog box. When you 
select a font, QRead finds the available sizes, or if the 
font is scalable, QRead uses a list of sizes from 8 to 24 
points. QRead then asks the Windows font mapper for a font 
with the selected name, selected size, and Regular style. 
The result is a new, beautifully formatted display with the 
font you selected, usually.

The font mapper will return substitutes for certain 
decorative fonts. As a design decision to keep QRead lean 
and mean, a minimum of font information is stored, and that 
results in the elimination of a small number (I hope) of 
fonts. Let me know what you think.

#$+K Tabs

Since QRead has no idea where the tabs were set when the 
text file was created, the Tabs dialog box allows you to 
recreate the settings.  The tabs can be set to divide the 
page into columns (as might be useful for tables), or they 
can be set every N character positions (as might be useful 
for a computer program listing).

#$+K Entry / Exit

This command brings up the Entry/Exit dialog box. The 
settings here control the entry and exit behavior of QRead. 
You can choose from the common option groups by using the 
right half of the dialog box, or "roll your own" group by 
changing the individual options on the left side.

The Entry / Exit dialog box should perhaps be marked "handle 
with care." Since these settings control the entry behavior 
of the program, if you forget what you asked for here, you 
can get totally confused about QRead's behavior. 

For example, if you normally use QRead in the "Memory-less" 
mode, QRead will come up with the default settings and it 
will not open any files. But if you forget that you checked 
"Remember last" the last time you used QRead, you could get 
confused as to why your font, tabs, or even view mode are 
different from what they normally are.

If you normally use the "Remember last" mode, you expect 
that on entry QRead will be as it was when you left it. But 
if you are opening a file that has a ".qfs" file, don't 
forget that the stored settings in the .qfs file will 
override your last settings.

The "Remember many" mode is useful if you use Qread to work 
with lots of files and you like to customize the display of 
each file. But try not to be surprised when you find .qfs 
files all over your disk. You might even say, "I don't 
remember creating that file" and you would be right. QRead 
did! To avoid creating lots of small files, use the "store 
settings for file" item on the Options menu only when you 
need it.

I recommend choosing your favorite mode of operation for 
QRead and then minimizing your use of the Entry/Exit menu 
item. If you do get confused, you can always retrieve 
default settings, and custom settings from the Options menu.

#$+K Registration info

This command allows you to enter your name and the key that 
you receive when you register your use of QRead. The info 
will be written to your qread.ini file. The next time you 
enter QRead with your registration info in qread.ini, you 
will bypass the registration reminder.

Save your registration letter, because if you destroy or 
corrupt the qread.ini file, you will have to reenter your 
registration info.

#$+K Load default settings

Choose this menu time to revert to the default settings. The 
settings affected are: View mode, Font settings, and Tab 
settings. The bookmark is not affected.

#$+K Load custom settings

If you have previously stored custom settings, you created a 
qread.cus file in your windows directory. This menu item 
loads the stored custom settings from that file. The 
settings affected are: View mode, Font settings, and Tab 
settings. The bookmark is not affected.

#$+K Store custom settings

You can customize QRead by setting up your preferred 
environment and then choosing this menu item to store the 
settings. You can then use the Entry/Exit menu item to 
arrange for loading of the custom settings, rather than the 
default settings, on entry to QRead.

The default settings are good for unformatted text files, 
such as articles or books, so you might want to set up the 
custom settings for formatted files, such as poetry or 
computer program listings. Then you could use the hotkeys 
for default and custom settings when switching between the 
two types of files.

The custom settings are stored in the file qread.cus in your 
windows directory. The settings stored are: View mode, Font 
settings, and Tab settings.

#$+K Store settings for file

Once you have the settings the way you like for the file 
that you are reading (the open file), you can store the 
settings by choosing this menu item. The settings are stored 
in a file with the same name and path name but with the 
".qfs" extension. Your text file is not modified.

Whenever QRead opens a file, it checks for the associated 
.qfs file. If one exists, QRead will read the stored 
settings from the .qfs file and update the settings. The 
settings stored are: View mode, Font settings, Tab Settings, 
and bookmark.

You can set up QRead to automatically create .qfs files on 
close or exit (by using the Entry/Exit menu item) but this 
menu item allows you to explicitly create a .qfs file.

#$+K How to use Help

This menu item takes you directly to the "how to" section of 
the Windows help program. You can also get these 
instructions after you are in the help program by choosing 
its Help menu item.

#$+K Help on QRead

This menu item lets you use the hypertext features of the 
Windows help program to read the qread.hlp file.  The same 
information is also available in the file qrhelp.txt if you 
want to print the help info and read it at a less "hyper" 
pace.

#$+K About QRead

The About dialog box displays some info about QRead 
including the copyright message, the version number, and the 
name of the user licensed to use QRead.
#$+K Qread Command Line

QRead will look for one argument on the command line. It 
will interpret the argument as a file name, and try to open 
the named file. This file specified on the command line 
takes precedence over the "open last file" setting.

#$+K Windows Program Manager

You can create a program item for QRead in the Windows 
Program Manager by using the File menu, and the New menu 
item. If you want to create many specific program items for 
QRead, one for each file you typically read, here are my 
suggested steps. 

First, make a copy of your QRead item by using the File 
menu, and the Copy menu item. Then use File, Properties to 
change the description, command line and icon. Change the 
description to mention the file name. Change the command 
line to supply the file name (using the full path name) as 
an argument. Finally, change the icon to the open file icon 
(the one with the "writing" on the book).

When you click on one of these specific program items, QRead 
will start up and open the specified file. If there is an 
associated ".qfs" file, QRead will also load the appropriate 
environment. 

#$+K Deinstallation

If you want to deinstall QRead, follow these steps. First, 
delete qread.exe from the directory where it "lives." Next, 
delete qread.ini, qread.cus, qread.hlp from your windows 
directory. Finally, delete all the ".qfs" files you or QRead 
have created.

#$+ What's new in this version

Version 1.0.1 is the first version released to the public.

The SPACE bar can now be used to do a "PageDown."
The horizontal scroll bar is reset after view mode changes.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
