PC-SIG UPDATES PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM

For Immediate Release


PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM UPDATED TO INCLUDE A NEW USER INTERFACE AND MORE
THAN 800 MB OF PROGRAMS June 21, 1992, SUNNYVALE, CALIF. - PC-SIG, Inc.
today announced availability of The Eleventh Edition of the PC-SIG Library
on CD-ROM.  The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM contains over 800 megabytes of
shareware and includes more than 300 new programs, 550 updated programs,
and the addition of 75 megabytes of Windows 3.x shareware.  The
user-interface has been completely re-engineered to take advantage of the
HyperWriter! hypermedia and multimedia authoring system from NTERGAID, Inc.

The implementation of HyperWriter! provides significant performance and
ease of use enhancements.  Programs can access and download much faster
than with previous editions.  Programs have been reorganized and indexed
for better referencing.  Users just c lick with a mouse, or point with the
cursor, on a program name to see a complete description of the program.
Downloading or copying a program is handled automatically by HyperWriter!
Addition of a preview option is especially important for anyone who uses
images, icons, or fonts.  "You can preview the whole library of images to
find the right one," according to Bruce Kent, product development manager.
"This CD finally makes it possi ble to conserve your disk space and paper,
yet still have all the information you need to make an informed decision,"
said Kent.

All new and updated programs have been reviewed and tested by PC-SIG. Every
program goes through extensive virus checking using the most recent version
of VIRUSCAN from McAfee Associates, and other anti-virus software.
According to Kent, "In the ten ye ars we've distributed shareware, we have
never had a confirmed report of a virus on any of our distributed programs
or CD-ROMs."

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, Eleventh Edition has a list price of $179.

Upgrades from previous editions are available for $99.

Users of PC-SIG's Essential Home & Business Collection CD-ROM can upgrade
for $120.

PC-SIG CD-ROMs are distributed worldwide through a network of distributors
and resellers. Based in Sunnyvale, Calif., PC-SIG, Inc. markets and
supports one of the world's largest collections of shareware for IBM PCs
and compatible systems.  PC-SIG also publishes Shareware Magazine, which is
devoted solely to shareware.  The magazine is availa ble by subscription
and on newsstands nationwide.

I  wanted to use my computer to keep a diary of goings on in my life and to
document my own personal history.  I started using  a  word  processor  for
awhile to write my opus but there are drawbacks: You have to name each file
daily  or  search  for  the  end of the file if you use a single file for a
month, the disk space taken up by some word processors was bigger  than  it
needed  to  be,  I had to enter the date everyday manually, getting a print
out was a pain of printing a bunch of individual files, and it was easy for
someone else to get ahold of my data disk and  read  it.   So  OMNIDay  was
born:

The  program is MSDOS compatible, runs on 256K RAM, uses IBM graphics/laser
printers, mono or colour monitor, and can operate on one/two or  hard  disk
drives.   The  User  can  set  the colours, printer codes, and default data
drive. There are no 'crippled' features or options.


Program Features:


        * Handles up to 10 Users.
        * Optional encryption of data
        * 10,000 encryption possibilities (User defined)
        * PassCode entry to protect privacy
        * Automatic entry of text date line
        * Modifiable PassCodes  & encryption  options
        * Dynamic data file (only as large as entries)
        * Entries can be from 1 to 5000 lines
        * The ability to change  history  (Alter  Entry)
        * You define printer codes
        * You name data file, screen colours, and data drive
        * Word Wrap & Scroll toggle on/off
        * Common word processor commands used
        * On line Help available  (F1)
        * The  ability to make history vanish (Erase Entry)
        * Reminisce feature allows you to 'thumb' through entries
        * Data files automatically install
        * Full  featured  full  screen  editing  of  entries
        * Works  with  TSR  spell check/thesaurus  programs
        * Prints out entire opus or selected dates
        * You name the opus and enter your name into program
        * Date formats for France, Britain, Germany, Italy and America
        * Much more!


Getting Started:

DO   NOT  INSTALL  THE  PROGRAM  IF  YOU  ARE  ALREADY  USING  IT  SEE  THE
INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO UPGRADE THE PROGRAM

The following files MUST be on the same disk or sub directory:

                                   OMNIDAY.EXE
                                   DAYDAT.DBT
                                   DAYDAT.DAT
                                   PRINT.SET
                                   COLOUR.SET

Type OMNIDAY to start.

When you first bring up the program you will be  requested  to  select  the
User for this session.  Select the New User for first time Users, otherwise
use the Arrow keys to select the User and hit the return key to proceed. Up
to 10 Users can use the system at once.


QEMM.SYS And Other Extended Memory Managers:

Occaisionally a problem will  be  incurred  by  a  person  using   QEMM.SYS
or other extended memory manager.  This has to do with the way that the SYS
file  manages  memory vs the way that the program wants to use the extended
memory (The program will attempt to use extended memory  automatically,  if
it is available).

On  the distribution disk there is a program called UNIEMM.COM (This can be
renamed to any legal file name EXCEPT the name of the EXE program).  If you
attempt  to run the program and get a DOS ERROR or RUN ERROR message at the
top of the  screen,  use  the  UNIEMM utility to  start  the  program.   It
will  tell  the  program  you  are  using  an extended memory that has this
anomoly and command  the  program  to  remain  in  low  memory  instead  of
switching  to  extended  memory.   After  passing these instructions to the
program, the program will start  with  no  other  commands  needing  to  be
entered.


First Time Users:

When you first start the program, the computer will bring up the New Set Up
screen  first.   Just  enter  the  info  requested.  When you name the Disk
Drive, the program will automatically copy the data files to that drive for
you ! So Have A Disk In The Drive And Ready !  The program will not do  any
further  copying on its own.  In order to create new data disks simply copy
the files fro the name you selected with the DAT  and  DBT  extension  onto
your new data disk.

Colours:

         Color    Letter

File  Name:

Any 8 character name , except TEMP and DAYDAT, can be used.  If the name is
already used the program will ask you to select a new name.

Data Drive:

The drive where you will keep your data disk.  ex A,B,C,D etc.

PassCode:

Any  number  between  -999  and  +9999.   This number will get you into the
system and supply the seed for the data encryption.  You  can  change  this
later  if  you want. Sometimes the number you select will not work with the
algorithm in the system (See Data Encryption below).   If  the  number  you
select will not work the computer will tell you and you will need to select
a new number.

Title:

A  25  character  title  for  your  opus  {Do  Not Include 'The' or 'Of' In
Title}.  ex Personal Journal, Diary, Thoughts, etc.  This  will  appear  on
the screen and on print outs.

Author:

Your name up to 25 characters.  This will appear on the screen and on print
outs.

Date Format:

You have the following choices:

                A=American MM/DD/YY {Default}
                B=British  DD/MM/YY
                F=French   DD/MM/YY
                G=German   DD.MM.YY
                I=Italian  DD-MM-YY

Next/Second+ Time Users:

The  program  will  ask you for your PassCode.  You have three tries before
the system aborts.  You do not have to enter +, but you do have to enter -.

The Main Menu will appear next.

The System:

Is designed using KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) so not much  information  is
needed to get started. Here are a few notes to help you use the system:

Universals:

The ESC key will take you back one menu.

The  box  in  the  upper  right  hand  corner  of  the  screen will contain
information on how to move around, and data entry tips.

The last line of the screen will tell you what the highlighted option does.

All menu entries can be selected with the light bar,  or  by  pressing  the
first letter of the option.


General Editing Notes:

The  screen  will  display only 20 lines of text at a time but by using the
down arrow key or Page Down key you can continue on.  Up to 3000 lines  can
be used.

Hitting  the  F1  key will bring up these instructions while you are in the
program.

******Once the help Screen appears you can exit the program by hitting  the
ESC  key,  any other key returns you to the system.  Great for when you are
interrupted or as a Boss Key since the entire screen is covered.

continue, then you can use the PageUp key to look at  the  previous  entry,
PageDown for next or Home to Exit.

Print Entries:

You  will  be  allowed  to  select the from and to dates for the print out.
This is inclusive.  Check Printer Set Up codes prior to printing.

Utilities:

Build For Speed:

Resequences  entire  opus  file.

Crunch File:

Reduces the size of the file by smashing out blanks and empty  opus  lines.
DOES NOT HURT OR CHANGE DATA.

Default Set Up:

Set  Colours,  Default Data Drive, File Name, Author & Title Lines.  If you
change file names you MUST copy the file before changing the File Name.  If
you enter "ZZZZZZZZ" for the file name it will destroy  all  the  data  and
remove  you  from the system.  This is a security feature.  Not even Norton
Utilities can bring back the file or data after you do this.

New PassCode:

This allows you to change your  PassCode.   Any  number  between  -999  and

+9999. This number will get you into the system and supply the seed for the
data  encryption.   Sometimes  the number you select will not work with the
algorithm in the system (See Data Encryption below).   If  the  number  you
select will not work the computer will tell you and you will need to select
a  new  number.   The  program  will then Transmorgify the data for the new
PassCode.

Printer Set Up:

This allows you to customize the printer codes used by the program.   These
codes  can be found in your printer manual.  The codes that the program has
when originally distributed are for the Epson FX100.  You will need to know
the code for 10 cpi (Pica), 12 CPI (Elite), Enlarged, Condensed (17CPI) and
Double High/Wide.  If your printer cannot  handle  double  high/wide  DON'T
PANIC,  just  leave it blank; the program will use Enlarged for that entry.
You do not have to enter the ESC part of the code,  the  program  will  add
that automatically. You can enter the letter ESC code or the number it does
not  matter: ie ESC code 119 can be entered as "119" or "w".  (Do not enter
any " "s!)

Opus On The Go:

This  lets  you add any entries you may have made with a different computer
to your existing opus.  {I use it when traveling}.  ust enter the  location
and sub directory and the filename (without the DAT extension).

**NOTE**   The  PassCode for the Opus you are adding the existing opus MUST
be the same.  The files with the DAT and DBT extensions must be in the same
location.

Shell To DOS:

You can exit temporarily to DOS by  using  that  option  on  the  Utilities
Menu.   The program will swap itself to expanded memory or disk if there is
space  {about  300K}.   If  not  the  file  COMMAND.COM must be on the same
directory or disk as the other program files to do this.  You  must  return
to  the  subdirectory/drive  of OMNIDay prior to entering EXIT to return to
the program. It will leave 256K RAM free.

HOW TO UPGRADE:

Upgrading  from  previous  versions  to 2.27 is necessary to save your user
info and opus files.

1.   Rename  your  OLD  COLOUR.SET  to  COLOUR.OLD.  ie  RENAME  COLOUR.SET
COLOUR.OLD

2.   The  only  files  you  need  from  this  version  are  OMNIDAY.EXE and
COLOUR.SET.  (Copying the DOCs is optional).  Copy those files to your work
area.

3.   Start  the program, and select New User from the openning screen, then
type in UPGRADE in the Author name.  The program will then upgrade your old
users file.  You will need to select the Default Set Up  entry  and  chnage
the Date Format, if you want to change from American.

TSR Thesaurus  Spell Checkers:

If  you  do  not  have a TSR thesaurus already, I heartily recommend Thesaur

Plus,  by  fellow  ASP  author  Derrick  Burgess.   Even  if you have a TSR
thesauraus I still recommend that you take a look at Thesaur Plus.  What is
Thesaur Plus?  In the words of the author:

    "Thesaur Plus is a pop-up Thesaurus, whenever you need a different word
or  a  different  shade of meaning than the word that comes to mind, pop-up
Thesaur Plus  and  get  just  the  word  you  wanted,  but  couldn't  quite
remember!"

It  works excellently with OMNIDay and has a registration price of only $20
(even less if you help build it's dictionaries).  It can't be beat!

I will try to maintain the latest version,  as  convieniance  to  users  of
OMNIDay   and   will   send  it  out for $3 (to cover P&H).  I would rather
have you contact Derrick himself, since he  will  ALWAYS  have  the  latest
version:
                         Derrick Burgess
                         23311 Schoolcraft St.
                         West Hills, CA  91307

He  charges  $6.00 for the latest version of Thesaur  Plus,  $5.00 of which
is applied toward registration.

I am still looking for, but have yet to find,  a  Shareware  spell  checker
that  is  a TSR.  In the meantime the Borland product Turbo Lightening will
have to fill the gap.  It works well with OMNIDay and does a very good  job
of checking your spelling errors.


                                Data Encryption

I am not going to go into  an  extensive  history  of  Data  Encryption  or
explain  all  the  implications of it 90% of Users don't care or won't read
it. Simply:

        1.  I wanted to make the system  private  for  each  individual,  a
PassCode  was a start, but the data file could have been read by any number
of other programs, so I needed a way to 'scramble' the file's text.

        2.  I wrote an algorithm to do the job, but then when  you  figured
out one person's code you code strip the entire system.

        3.   The  algorithm  is  now  different  for  each person using the
system. There are some numbers that will NOT work with the coding,  if  you
enter one of these the system will let you know so you can change it.  This
in itself helps to make the data more secure since the 'bad' numbers follow
no  logical  sequence.  For  any given person there will be approx 1800 bad
numbers out of the 10,998 possible PassCodes.  {I  apologize,  in  advance,
for anyone who finds that their 'lucky number' won't work.}

        4.   Using  no  encryption  (PassCode  0)  makes  the system faster
(because the system doesn't have to encrypt and decrypt for on  screen  and
print operations) but it removes the security of the data.

        5.   NO ENCRYPTION SCHEME IS UNBREAKABLE OR UNSOLVABLE.  It took me
3 hours to break a text file one of my beta testers sent me.   I  know  the
algorithm,  I knew the possibilities, and I worked with a 80386 system; but
even if I did not I could have broken it eventually.

        6.  Once you are in the system, if you are using encryption, do not
leave without exiting the system. {The quickest way is to hit F1 then ESC}

        7.  When choosing a PassCode avoid the "easys" ex  333,222,-999,555
and  things  like  your  phone  number,SSANs, etc.  This makes breaking the
code easier.

        8.  Write the PassCode down and keep it in a safe  place,  for  you
(if you forget) or for posterity (should something happen to you).




                        Notes On Keeping A Journal/Diary

1.   Set  aside a time every day to write in the journal and try to keep to
it.

2.  Make sure you reflect for a few minutes prior  to  writing,  this  will
give you a chnace to compose your thoughts.

3.   WRITE  EVERYDAY!   Even it is only "Nothing Happened", it keeps up the
habit and when you go to Reminisce or Print  it  out  you  don't  have  any
missing spaces of time.

4.   Be  as honest in the diary as you are to yourself.  If you are not you
are writing a novel, not a diary.  Besides with the encryption  option  the
chances of it falling into the wrong hands are reduced.

5.   Part  of  the  uniqueness of a diary/journal is that it is in your own
words and syntax, making the  entry  grammatically  correct  and  perfectly
spelled  takes  away from the authenticity of a true diary. {This is why no
spell checker or thesaurus is included in the program.}

6.   Your first few entries should 'introduce' the names used in the diary.
You might forget who Billy Joe Bob is in a few years, so a brief  character
sketch would probably help.

7.  Remember "He who controls the  present,  controls  the  past.   He  who
controls the past controls the future" (George Orwell, 1984) when you go to
Alter or Delete an entry.

8.  Every now and then, flip through what you've written and take a look at
what's happened.

9.   If  you  prefer,  and  want  to  be reminded to make entries, have the
program start when you boot up your computer.  {Add it to the AUTOEXEC.BAT}
Then, write about the previous day.

10.  Enjoy!


Technical Assistance & Latest Versions:

Both registered and unregistered Users can obtain technical  assistance  by
calling (219) 563-HOME (4663).  Unregistered Users will need to provide the
name  and address of where they obtained the software from in order to gain
this assistance.  This will let us go back to  that  company  if  they  are
distributing an older version and it helps us track who is distributing the
program.   The  number is manned (by a human) from 6:00 to 9:00 PM EST, all
other hours by an answering machine.

                            *******************

Unicorn Software Support conferences exist on the following BBSs:

** The Kokomo BBS:      317-457-9100
** The RoadHouse BBS:   317-784-2147  (FIDONET 1:231/290)

Both  BBSs  allow  first  time  downloads and will  always have  the latest
versions of Unicorn's software. Unicorn Software programs are available via
"File Request"  from  The RoadHouse BBS (1:231/290). You can FREQ the magic
name "UNICORN" from 1:231/290 for information on Unicorn Programs and their
FREQable "magic" names.)

                            *******************

Also, we monitor the Shareware conference on the following networks:  RIME,
Intelec, NANet, MediaNET, and NAPNet.

The regional  hub  for  RIME  in  Indiana  (IBM-NET)  will  upload  any  of
Unicorn's files to the net on request:

** IBM-Net BBS:  317-882-5575

The  regional  hub  for  Intelec,  NAPNet,  and MedaiNet will upload any of
Unicorn's files to the net on request:

** Media Net  317-547-6204

                            *******************

All  of  Unicorn's  programs  are  also  available  through  the  Shareware
Distribution Network  (SDN),  and may be downloaded  from any  SDN location.
The Central Indiana SDN contact point is:

** Someplace BBS  317-353-9981  (FIDONET 1:231/120)

                            *******************

The above listed BBSs will always have the latest versions within hours  of
release.  Additionally, these BBSs have proven to be reliable and worth the
cost  of every minute of connect time.  Even if you are not looking for our
latest versions:  Give Them A Call!

Other Unicorn Programs:

All programs are MSDOS compatible, run on 256K RAM, use IBM  graphics/laser
printers,  mono  or colour monitor, and can operate on one/two or hard disk
drives (except DayMaster & CompUser which require a hard  or  high  density
drive).   The  User  can set the colours, printer codes, default data drive
and data file name. There are no 'crippled' features or options.  The  only
difference  between  the  shareware  and registered versions is the lack of

'plea' screens on the registered version  and  the  clarity  of  the  Users
conscience.  Amount in {} is price for registration.

                           The *Master Series

CDMaster - To help Users catalog their CDs and assist in printing catalogs,
listings  and  labels  for the case and front of the CD.  There are entries
for CD Number, Title, Artist, and up to 24 Tunes as well as Category and  3
User  defined  fields.   The program will hold up to 9999 CDs (depending on
disk  space)  and  can  be  used  to find even a single song.  It will also
produce a list of every Tune User have in addition to the regular  catalogs
and case inserts.  Find! option locates CDs by any of the data fields or by
a User defined mix of data fields. {$25}

AlbumMaster  -  To help Users catalog their Albums and assist with printing
catalogs, listings and labels for the front of the Album. There are entries
for Album Number, Title, Artist, and up to 12 Tunes on each side as well as
Category and 3 User defined fields.  The User can define fields for use  as
producer,  writer,  opinions  etc.  The program will hold up to 9999 Albums
(depending on disk space) and can be used to find even a single  song.   It
will also produce a list of every Tune User have in addition to the regular
catalogs. Multiple data field Finds!  and User designed listing make this a
must have for audiophiles. {$20}

CassetteMaster - To help  User  catalog  their  cassette  tapes  and  print
catalogs,  listings  and  inserts for the case and front of the tape. There
are entries for Tape Number, Title, Artist, and up to 14 Tunes on each side
as well as Category. The User can also define  three  entries  for  use  as
producer,  writer,  opinions  etc.   The  program  will  hold  up  to  9999
individual Tapes, with two Titles per Tape (depending on  disk  space)  and
can  be  used  to  find even a single song.  It will also produce a list of
every Tune User have in addition to the regular catalogs. The case  inserts
not  only  print all the tunes, artist, and title but the User defined info
as well.  Find!  and Criteria print option make this very  useful  for  the
'home recorder' or the 'store bought' cassette tape User. {$25}

VideoMaster  -  To  help  User catalog their video tapes and assist User in
printing catalogs, standard and User customized listings and labels for the
spine and front of the tape.  There are entries  for  Tape  Number,  Title,
Rating,  Start Point, Star, Co Star, three User defined entries and a seven
line Synopsis as well as Category.  User can find any tape  by  any  field.
The  program  can  handle  up to 5 titles per tape, with the data file only
being limited by disk space. Great for the home video buff. {$25}

PostCardMaster - The program will help User compose post cards and maintain
addresses  on  disk.   Then  User  may  retrieve  either  listings  of  the
addresses  and  cards, address labels, 3X5 cards, 4X6 post cards or Roladex
cards.  The primary purpose of the program is  to  print  post  cards,  and
address them for the User. Post cards cost 1/3 the price of a letter and in
some  cases  are equally as good ie meeting notices, invitations, change of
address.  This program is a update for an earlier Unicorn Software  release
called FORWARD2. {$20}

DayMaster   -   The   program   provides   User   with  trivia,  birthdays,
anniversaries for a particular date, but also allows User to include  their
own  information  for  any  date.  It  also  gives a quote for the day, and
informs User of any reminders (Weekly/Daily/Monthly/Single/Annual/Range  Of
Dates)  the  User might have.  All of this can take place at boot up or any
other time User activate the program. The  data  file  contains  over  2000
historical events and quotes. {$20}


                            The OMNI* Series

OMNIDiZk - A disk  cataloger  and  labeling  utility.   Features:  Reads  a
floppy  into  memory  and lets User save the data (The saving is optional);
Print out 4 X 1 7/16 or 3 X 15/16 labels as well as catalogs; Perform Find!
searches on any files that User has saved; Print lists of every  file  name
in  the  data  file;  Allow  complete Updates of disks or of just the title
info; Lets User enter a 23 character title, 3 character code and two  lines
of  remarks  up  to  52  characters  each;  Lets User set the data and read
drives. {$20}

OMNIDay - Handles up to 10 Users  with  PassCode  protection  for  privacy,
optional  encryption  of data with 10,000 possibilities per User, automatic
entry of text date line, and a full function text editor with online  Help.
The  data  file is dynamic (only as large as entries) and can be located on
any drive.  Daily entries can be from 1 to 5000 lines with the  ability  to
change  history (Alter Entry) and the ability to make history vanish (Erase
Entry).  The Reminisce feature allows  User  to  'thumb'  through  entries.
Prints  out  the  entire  opus  or selected dates.  User names the opus and
enters their name into program for use on screen and in print outs. {$25}

                            The Comp* Series

CompUser - A rated cyclopedia with the names, addresses and  phone  numbers
of  shareware  distributors,  hardware  companies, authors, computer clubs,
BBSs and more.  Almost 2000 entries are in the complete database and it  is
updated  almost  daily with revisions being mailed out every 120 days.  The
program creates, edits & prints post cards, address labels  and  more.   It
will  also  import  new  data  and allow the User to change the data in the
file.  Great for clubs (looking for authors  and  distributors),  shareware
authors  (looking  for markets), shareware libraries (looking for authors),
BBS Users (looking for new BBSs) and the average Comp{ter}User (looking for
all of the above).  All entries  are  rated  A,B,C,D,  or  F  for  size  of
operation  and  the  way  that  they  conduct business. This alone makes it
worthwhile because Users  can  avoid  poorly  rated  businesses  that  have
historical problems and lack good customer service. {$30/Year}

                             The *4D Series

DiZk4D  -  The  first dizk cataloging system specifically written for 4DOS.
DiZk4D will: Read a floppy into memory and lets User  save  the  data  (The
saving is optional). Lets the User enter a 21 character title, 4 digit DiZk
number, 3 character code and two lines of remarks up to 65 characters each.
Change  or  add  file descriptions. Users have the option of using the same
description for all files, or describing them  individually  using  a  full
screen  editor. Prints out 4 X 1 7/16 or 3 X 15/16 labels of the file names
or of file names and descriptions.  Prints out or writes to a file complete
or select listings and catalogs.  Prints out a complete list  of  all  file
information, or writes that information to a file.  Perform Find!  searches
on  any  filename,  description,  date,  title, DiZk number (alphanumeric),
code, or remarks.  Allows complete Updates of DiZks or of  just  the  title
info.  Lets User use Auto numbering of DiZks. {$25}

BBS Update Program:
-------------------

Most BBSs have standard procedures for acquiring new files.  They get  them
from  other  boards, new programs are uploaded by users, etc.  This is good
because most authors cannot  afford  to  mail  disks  or  upload  files  to
thousands  of  BBSs.  However, some BBSs prefer to obtain programs directly
from the authors.  If you would like to obtain programs directly  from  us,
automatically, then please help us to cover the cost.

If  your  BBS  would  like  to  receive  automatic  upgrades  to any of our
products, directly from us, then please refer to the information below. Due
to the time and expense we are generally unable to  upload  directly  to  a
large  number  of  Bulletin  Board  Systems.   However, we are able to mail
updates on disk (in a sealed envelope) to many BBS's.

If your BBS would like  to  receive  automatic  updates  then  please  take
advantage  of  our  BBS Update Program.  Under this program you can receive
updates for an entire year for only $10 for  all 11  programs  (this  helps
to offset our costs).

To  receive  updates,  simply send us a letter with the name and address of
your BBS, your mailing address, the name  of  the  person  we  may  contact
(preferably the SYSOP or CO-SYSOP), and a check or money order for $10 (for
countries  outside of North America please add an additional $10).  Payment
in U.S. funds drawn on a U.S.  bank only, please.

The  BBS  Update  Program  covers  all  eleven  programs in release.  For a
complete list see the bottom of READ1ST.DOC (as of March, 1991)

NOTE: All BBS's participating in our BBS Update Program will  automatically
receive  any  NEW  programs  which  we  may  release while their BBS Update
Program is in effect.

The BBS Update Program is only intended to help us cover  our  expenses  in
those cases where a BBS desires to obtain the program directly from us.  If
you  have  other  standard ways to obtain programs, then you may prefer not
to use our BBS Update Program.

Computer Clubs who wish to distribute Unicorn Software's programs.

Individual and Company Users: Please refer to READ1ST.DOC for information.

Program Name & Category:
------------------------

OMNIDay - Suggested categories are: Desk Calander, Desk Top Productivity,
Educational, Word Processor, Home or Misc.


Description:
------------

I  wanted to use my computer to keep a diary of goings on in my life and to
document my own personal history.  I started using  a  word  processor  for
awhile to write my opus but there are drawbacks: You have to name each file
daily  or  search  for  the  end of the file if you use a single file for a
month, the disk space taken up by some word processors was bigger  than  it
needed  to  be,  I had to enter the date everyday manually, getting a print
out was a pain of printing a bunch of individual files, and it was easy for
someone else to get ahold of my data disk and  read  it.   So  OMNIDay  was
born:

Program Features:


        * Handles up to 10 Users.
        * Optional encryption of data
        * 10,000 encryption possibilities (User defined)
        * PassCode entry to protect privacy
        * Automatic entry of text date line
        * Modifiable PassCodes  & encryption  options
        * Dynamic data file (only as large as entries)
        * Entries can be from 1 to 5000 lines
        * The ability to change  history  (Alter  Entry)
        * You define printer codes
        * You name data file, screen colours, and data drive
        * Word Wrap & Scroll toggle on/off
        * Common word processor commands used
        * On line Help available  (F1)
        * The  ability to make history vanish (Erase Entry)
        * Reminisce feature allows  you  to  'thumb'  through entries
        * Data files automatically install
        * Full  featured  full  screen  editing  of  entries
        * Works  with  TSR  spell check/thesaurus  programs
        * Prints out entire opus or selected dates
        * You name the opus and enter your name into program
        * Much more!

The User can set the colours,  printer  codes,  default  data
drive  and  data file name.  There are no 'crippled' features
or options.  The only difference between  the  shareware  and
registered  versions  is  the  lack  of 'plea' screens on the
registered version and the clarity of the Users conscience.

Hardware Requirements: 256K RAM, IBM graphics/laser printers,
mono or colour monitor, can operate on one/two or  hard  disk
drives.


Other Requirements:  MS-DOS 2.11 or higher.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Outside the U.S.A. call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer in

OMNIDay Ver 2.27:

There  are  a lot of drawbacks in using a word processor to keep a personal
journal.  You have to name each file daily or search for  the  end  of  the
file  if you use a single file for a month, the disk space taken up by some
word processors is larger than  the  text,  you  have  to  enter  the  date
everyday  manually,  getting a print out is a goat rope of printing a bunch
of individual files, and it is easy for someone else to get the  data  disk
and  read  it.  OMNIDay alleviates all these ills and has toggles that word
processors do not have.

*Handles up to 10 Users with optional encryption of data.

entry to protect privacy.

10000 lines.

commands. Word Wrap & Scroll toggle on/off.

*On line Help available (F1).

print out the entire opus or selected dates.

*Works with TSR spell check/thesaurus programs.

*User names the opus and enters their own name into program as the Author.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
