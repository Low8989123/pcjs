                        How to Register SCROLLit


     SCROLLit is registered by purchasing a registration key which
     converts your shareware copy of SCROLLit into a registered copy
     without the shareware screen. Your registration key will work for
     this and all future versions of SCROLLit. You do not need a new
     diskette copy of SCROLLit, but as we have received such requests,
     that option is provided for in the attached order form.
                                  
     Each registration key for SCROLLit is US$17 for U.S. and other
     international orders and CAD$20 for Canadian addresses. We can
     accept payment in other currencies such as UK Pounds, Australian
     Dollars or Dutch Guilders with a US$5 surcharge to cover increased
     banking fees. Overseas users should start with the US$ price, add
     US$5, and then convert to their local currency at current exchange
     rates.

     SCROLLit can be registered by mailing the registration fee to our
     Ottawa address, or, for a small surcharge, convenient registration
     using Compuserve's shareware registration service ('GO SWREG') is
     available. When you register with this service, the US$17
     registration fee (plus a $3 surcharge to cover Compuserve's service
     fee) is added to your monthly Compuserve bill. Your SCROLLit
     registration key will be sent to you by Compuserve mail (unless you
     request postal mail).
     
     Companies and other organizations interested in multiple copies of
     SCROLLit should obtain a site license. Please refer to the enclosed
     file SITE_LIC.DOC.

SCROLLit 1.6         Advanced Scrollback Buffer           March 24, 1993


Introduction - What is SCROLLit? =======================================

SCROLLit is a memory resident (TSR) program that captures, in full
color, the lines of text that scroll off the top of the video screen and
stores them in an XMS, EMS or conventional memory 'scrollback' buffer of
a size specified by the user. A fast compression technique is used to
store more than twice the number of lines in the available buffer space.
SCROLLit can be activated or 'popped up' over any non-graphical program
by pressing the Scroll Lock key. Once activated, SCROLLit will let you
scroll back through this saved information, line by line or page by
page. SCROLLit has a fast search capability as well as a block-write
feature that allows you to mark a block of lines for writing to a disk
file or sending to your printer.

For details on how to use SCROLLit, please refer to the SCROLLIT.DOC
documentation file.

Requirements ===========================================================

SCROLLit requires DOS 3.1 or above and supports all monitor/video
combinations (monochrome or color; MDA/CGA/EGA/MCGA/VGA or Hercules).

Quick Start ============================================================

SCROLLit can be installed with a 100k buffer by typing:

    SCROLLit 100

SCROLLit can then by activated by pressing the Scroll Lock key. Once
activated, press the F1 key for a quick command summary. When SCROLLit
is installed, the Scroll Lock key no longer toggles your Scroll Lock
light on and off. Instead press Alt-Scroll Lock.

SCROLLit can be removed from memory by typing:

    SCROLLit /U

Refer to Appendix 3 in SCROLLIT.DOC for a command line summary, or type:

    SCROLLit /?

Special Cases ==========================================================

Qmodem/Telix users: You will need to configure your communications
software to use the BIOS to perform screen scrolling. This will allow
SCROLLit to intercept and save the lines that scroll off the top of the
screen. If SCROLLit isn't capturing your scrolling lines, chances are
you need to switch to BIOS screen scrolling. See Appendix 1 in
SCROLLIT.DOC. Procomm Plus and Commo always uses the BIOS for screen
scrolling so no reconfiguring is necessary.

Desqview users: SCROLLit is Desqview aware. You will need to load
SCROLLit in the Desqview window(s) where you want to capture scrolling.
See Appendix 2 in SCROLLIT.DOC.

The Last Byte Memory Manager users: Some versions of TLB's HIGHTSR
program appear to have difficulty with TSR parameters beginning with a
slash (/). SCROLLit accepts either slashes or dashes (-). For example,
to install SCROLLit in high memory with a 100k EMS buffer, type:

     HIGHTSR SCROLLIT 100 -E

Registered users of older versions of SCROLLit:  Please refer to
WHATSNEW.DOC to see what has changed since your version of SCROLLit.
Your registration key will work with this and all future versions of
SCROLLit. Thank you for supporting the shareware concept.

                   SCROLLit Site License Information


     Companies and other organizations wanting multiple copies of
     SCROLLit should obtain a site license by filling out the attached
     site license order form. The site license grants the organization a
     perpetual, nontransferable, nonexclusive right to use the specified
     number of copies of SCROLLit for the organization's internal use.

     The site license is valid for the current version and all future
     versions of SCROLLit. Note that the site license includes one
     diskette copy of the latest version of the software and
     documention. The site license grants you the right to make
     additional copies of the SCROLLit software and documentation up to
     the number of copies licensed. Distribution, repackaging, or
     reselling of SCROLLit to third parties is not allowed.
     
     The fee for a site license depends on the estimated number of
     copies of SCROLLit that you will use. The fee applies to one site.
     For local area networks, one copy must be licensed for each
     computer that will be using the program on the network. To use the
     discount schedule below, estimate the number of copies that you may
     eventually use. Site licenses for Canadian addresses are payable in
     Canadian dollars, while U.S. and other international site license
     fees are payable in U.S. currency. We can accept payment in other
     currencies such as UK Pounds, Australian dollars or Dutch Guilders
     with a US$5 surcharge to cover increased banking fees. Overseas
     users should start with the US$ site license fee, add US$5, and
     then convert to their local currency at current exchange rates.

     form and we will mail you a printed invoice.

## TODO.TXT

{% raw %}
```
Things to do:

1.  Add slide show capability, single image viewing from command line

2.  Add JPEG, Sun Raster, Portable PixMap, RIX image support.

3.  Add configuration file capability, color selection capability,
    and configuration editing window (colors, standard toggles, sort modes,
    etc)

4.  Add mouse support of some kind

5.  Add support of BGR and RGB truecolor display types

The next two items are REAL low on the priority list, and may not be
implemented.

5.  Add full GIF89a support (at this point, should be little more than
	expanding the viewer and image descriptors, and adding support in
	the ShowPic function).

6.  Add image save capability.

SVGA Change Log
---------------

1.11	Added SVGATEMP variable.
	Added a check for missing EMS page frame.
	Corrected Trident 8800 memory detection.
	Redesigned EMS/XMS identity determination code.
	Corrected minor video bug in exit cleanup code.
	Corrected mode listing for Video7 1024i adapters.
	Added full support for Oak 037C/067/077, including Oak HiColor.

1.10	Added Truevision TARGA support, types 1, 2, 9, and 10.
	Added 24 bit PCX, BMP support.
	Added S3 GUI Accelerator, HiColor support.
	Added Trident TVGA 8900C, 9000, LCD9100, LX9200 detection.
	Added VESA TrueColor extensions support.
	Added automatic resolution selection.
	Added accurate detection of ATI 1MB, gate version through rev 6.
	Added Tseng 4000 HiColor support.
	Added ATI 640x480x32k, 800x600x32k HiColor support.
	Added 386 detection/support.
	Added ability to display incomplete images.
	Added command line switch to force use of VESA interface.
	Added accurate video memory detection for Tseng3000 and VESA.
	Now selects native chipset in preference to VESA.
	Maximum number of files increased to ~925.
	Virtual memory errors are both clearer and less likely.
	Fixed Paradise 800x600 unsupported mode problem.
	Fixed Oak detection.

	Note:	I have completly rewritten the video adapter detection code.
		PLEASE report if you have ANY problems with adapter detection,
		such as incorrect video memory, incorrect adapter, or
		incorrect image display.

	Note:	No image quantization or dithering is currently performed.
		It is possible that it will be implemented in the future to
		improve display quality.  I chose speed over quality for this
		first truecolor version.

	Note:	HiColor modes on my ET4000 have problems with random pixels
		written to the video buffer.  This shows up while scrolling
		as image corruption, snow, etc.  This is not a software bug.
		Your mileage may vary.

1.02	No longer locks up when insufficient XMS memory is present when
	using HIMEM.SYS.

1.01	Images are now correctly displayed under low memory conditions.
	Situations where allocated disk space did not match reported disk
	space are now handled properly.

1.00	First release

        - Presence of a real time clock
        - Presence of a Micro Channel bus
        - System BIOS including source, date and size
        - A listing of all known BIOS extensions in the system, and the
          size of those BIOS
        - Type of keyboard attached (84 key or 101 key) and keyboard status
        - Type of mouse installed, number of buttons, and interrupt used
        - Number of parallel ports in system and the base addresses
        - Number of serial ports in system and the base addresses and
          parameters of the port
        - Type of Serial port UART chip including 16550
        - Various information on a Network connection
        - Hard disk size including tracks, heads, sectors and CMOS type
        - Hard disk controller manufacturer
        - Hard disk partition information
        - Floppy disk size and parameters

        - Amount of environment space used and available
        - Amount of conventional memory total and available
        - Amount of extended memory total and available
        - Amount of expanded memory total and available, version and
          location of page frame
        - Amount of XMS memory
        - Listing of all resident programs and the size of those programs
        - Listing of all non standard device drivers installed
        - Throughput speed of system, taking into account CPU speed and
          wait states
        - Self checking for virus detection
        - Operates under Windows in all modes (SYSCHK.ICO is included
          for your use with Windows).

   A hardcopy printout or file of your system's information is also available
   as an option.  Standard Output redirection is also available for use in
   batch files by simply adding "/F" as a SysChk parameter.
   For example "SYSCHK /f > MyInfo.txt" will create a file called MYINFO.TXT
   or "SYSCHK /f" will display a text file to the console screen.

   SCSI host adapter determination can sometimes cause the SCSI bus to hang.
   If you wish to disable the host adapter determination then enter /S as a
   SYSCHK parameter (SYSCHK /s).

   Support questions may be submitted through CompuServe ID [70323,136].

.TOPIC:
SetUp
To SetUp this program you need to place the program  in the same 
directory with your PKZIP and Virus scan files.  Place the help
text file (HELPARC3.TXT) is your root directory (C:\).

Add the directory to your PATH in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.  Remember
that all items on your PATH statement MUST be on the same line.
This line may be upto 256 spaces long.  To do this you may use
an ASCII word editor that dose not wordrap.  The ASCII editor
that comes with SCREEN MINDER II is a very good file editor for
this type of entry.

Example:     PATH C:\DOS;C:\ZIPS

NOTE: be sure to place a  ;  between PATH entries.

To RUN  ZIP Shell program type ZIPSHEL.EXE at the DOS prompt.

.TOPIC:
ZIPing Files
ZIPing Files is the act of arciving or combinding files into one file. 
This generally includes compressing the files down so that they take
less space on the disk or can be sent over the phone lines, via
modem, at a faster rate.

Select "ZIP Files" on the ACTION list

Enter "Source Mask".  This should be the drive, directory, and
      the filespects that you wish to have ZIPed.  You may select
      a Drive & Directory by using the Drive Select Box in the
      lower left corner or select a drive by use of the Drive
      Select Menu above Source Mask.  You may also use the Direct
      Entry method.
      Example: C:\HOLD\*.*   C:\HOLD\WORK*.*

      If you use the Target DIR Menu to select  a Target Drive,
      then the target file will be HOLD.ZIP by default.  By 
      placing the curser in the Dialog Box, you may edit the
      Default Target Name.

Enter "Target Name".  This should be the drive, directory, and
      the filename that you wish to have the ZIPed files in.
      Example:  C:\HOLD\WORKFIL.ZIP    B:\WORKFIL.ZIP

Select <RUN>.  This will ZIP your files.

NOTE:  It is not required that you UnZIP only files with the .ZIP 
extension, however if you try to UnZIP files that were not ZIPed 
you will get an error.  For this reason, you should always specify 
the .ZIP extension.

See Direct Entry   List Select Entry   Search Entry
    Source Dir     Target Dir
.TOPIC:
Self Extracting Files
Self Extracting means that an archived file will extract the archived 
files that it contains with out the use of an extractor program like 
PKUNZIP.  These files will have an .EXE extension and are treated 
like a standard program.  They are larger than a standard archived file, 
but are more convent to us when dearchiving.

Select "Self Extract" on the ACTION list

Enter "Source Mask".  This should be the drive, directory, and
      the filename that you wish to have made into a Self Extracting
      file.  This file Must have been ZIPed and have a .ZIP extension.
      This must be exact and will not except wild cards.
      Example:  C:\HOLD\WORKFILE.ZIP

      You may use the File Listing to select the file to be worked on.    

      The filename of the file being worked on will be used as the 
      filename of the new .EXE file.

Select <RUN>.  This will create your file.

See Direct Entry   List Select Entry   Search Entry
    Source Dir     Target Dir
.TOPIC:
UnZIPing Files
Select "UnZIP File" on the ACTION list

Enter "Source Mask".  This should be the drive, directory, and
      the filename that you wish to have UnZIPed.
      Example: C:\HOLD\*.ZIP   C:\HOLD\WORK*.ZIP  B:\WORKFILE.ZIP

      (Cation would be used in using wild cards as it is not
      uncommon for ZIPed files to contain ZIPed files.  It is also
      easier to evaluate programs if only one per subdirectory is
      unziped.)

Enter "Target Name".  This should be the drive, directory, and
      the filename that you wish to have the UnZIPed files in.
      Example:  C:\HOLD\    B:\

Select <RUN>.  This will UnZIP your files.

NOTE:  It is not required that you UnZIP only files with the .ZIP 
extension, however if you try to UnZIP files that were not ZIPed 
you will get an error.  For this reason, you should always specify 
the .ZIP extension.

.TOPIC:
ZIP Fixer
ZIP Fixer should be ran on a .ZIPed file when it will not dearchive.  
This will fix the problem most of the time.  However, you should be 
weary of the files that require ZIP Fixer as they may have been 
tampered with or contain a Virus.

Select "ZIP Fix" on the ACTION list

Enter the drive, directory, and filename to be acted upon.
      Example:  C:\HOLD\WORKFILE.ZIP

Select <RUN> to fix your file.

NOTE: You can not use wild cards.

ENTER the drive, drive & directory, or drive & directory & filename to 
         be scanned into the Target Name Dialog Box.
