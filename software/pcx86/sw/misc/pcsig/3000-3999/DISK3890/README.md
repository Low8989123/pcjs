PROGRAM TITLE
HyperGeo
SHORT DESCRIPTION
HyperGeo is a tool for investigating geometrical properties of
four-dimensional objects constructed in hyperspace. It will display
three-dimensional images, it creates from a 4-D object, by projecting
onto or intersecting with a 3-D hyper-plane. You, as the user, have
full control over the objects orientation and position. The 3-D images
can be presented in a number of different display modes including,
linear projection, stereoscopic projection (for use with colored "3D"
glasses), hidden-line, surface relief, and solid surface rendering.
Included are data files listing a number of 4-D objects definitions
including, the hypercube and other regular and irregular hyperobjects.
The data files are simple text files which the user can create and
edit as desired to construct many new objects for investigating with
HyperGeo.

This program is aimed at two distinct markets. First, it is ideally
suited for use in a classroom at the high-school or college level as a
visual tool used in the study of analytical geometry or solid
descriptive geometry. And second, the program should be fascinating to
anyone who possesses even a laymen's interest in mathematics.

HyperGeo is naturally perfect in the mathematics or scientific
software categories, but it will also be enjoyed as entertainment or
graphics software since it includes a variety of options and object
forming capabilities. WareCraft is now making an offer to anyone who
purchases the shareware version of HyperGeo and sends them a self
addressed stamped envelope they will receive a free pair of "3D"
glasses that are required to view the stereoscopic projection display
mode.
