What's green with red spots, has suction cup hands, and an overbite like
Bart Simpson? Of course, the answer is Cosmo! A young alien on his way  
to visit Disney World with his parents. That is, until their ship is    
struck by a blazing comet, forcing them to land on an uncharted planet. 
                                                                        
While his Dad repairs the ship, Cosmo heads off to explore the strange  
planet. Upon returning, both his Mom and Dad are gone and big, scary    
alien footprints are all around his ship! Oh no... have Cosmo's parents 
been taken away? Possibly to be eaten? Well, Cosmo is off to the rescue.
Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure is an epic journey across a forbidden planet   
full of dangers and surprises. Can he save his parents in time? Cosmo is
a lovable extraterrestrial (alien) with a special ability: he has hands 
that work like suction cups! He can cling to walls, ledges, and all     
sorts of other things.
