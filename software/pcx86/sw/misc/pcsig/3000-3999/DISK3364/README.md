PC-SIG UPDATES PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM

For Immediate Release


PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM UPDATED TO INCLUDE A NEW USER INTERFACE AND MORE
THAN 800 MB OF PROGRAMS June 21, 1992, SUNNYVALE, CALIF. - PC-SIG, Inc.
today announced availability of The Eleventh Edition of the PC-SIG Library
on CD-ROM.  The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM contains over 800 megabytes of
shareware and includes more than 300 new programs, 550 updated programs,
and the addition of 75 megabytes of Windows 3.x shareware.  The
user-interface has been completely re-engineered to take advantage of the
HyperWriter! hypermedia and multimedia authoring system from NTERGAID, Inc.

The implementation of HyperWriter! provides significant performance and
ease of use enhancements.  Programs can access and download much faster
than with previous editions.  Programs have been reorganized and indexed
for better referencing.  Users just c lick with a mouse, or point with the
cursor, on a program name to see a complete description of the program.
Downloading or copying a program is handled automatically by HyperWriter!
Addition of a preview option is especially important for anyone who uses
images, icons, or fonts.  "You can preview the whole library of images to
find the right one," according to Bruce Kent, product development manager.
"This CD finally makes it possi ble to conserve your disk space and paper,
yet still have all the information you need to make an informed decision,"
said Kent.

All new and updated programs have been reviewed and tested by PC-SIG. Every
program goes through extensive virus checking using the most recent version
of VIRUSCAN from McAfee Associates, and other anti-virus software.
According to Kent, "In the ten ye ars we've distributed shareware, we have
never had a confirmed report of a virus on any of our distributed programs
or CD-ROMs."

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, Eleventh Edition has a list price of $179.

Upgrades from previous editions are available for $99.

Users of PC-SIG's Essential Home & Business Collection CD-ROM can upgrade
for $120.

PC-SIG CD-ROMs are distributed worldwide through a network of distributors
and resellers. Based in Sunnyvale, Calif., PC-SIG, Inc. markets and
supports one of the world's largest collections of shareware for IBM PCs
and compatible systems.  PC-SIG also publishes Shareware Magazine, which is
devoted solely to shareware.  The magazine is availa ble by subscription
and on newsstands nationwide.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K memory, DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions, and a hard drive. Microsoft compatible

## KBDOCK.TXT

{% raw %}
```
KBDock is an "application bar" replacement for the Windows Program Manager
including: Nested menus; Fast operation; Drag-Drop; Auto-Conversion from
Program Manager groups.

Requires Win 3.1 and VBRUN100.DLL.

This is Version 1.2. Version 1.1 had a serious startup bug that kept 
KBDock from displaying at all on many systems. As an apology for all those
wasted downloads, V1.2 is *FREE* for 6 months. NO NAG SCREENS UNTIL 6/1/93.


```
{% endraw %}

## SYSOP.TXT

{% raw %}
```
This is KBDock Version 1.2. It should be zipped as KBDOCK12.ZIP, or KBDK12.ZIP.
Please delete older versions known as "KBDOCK.ZIP" and "KBDK11.ZIP".
Version 1.1 had a serious bug, and I don't want people wasting their time and
money downloading it.

Thanks!

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

INSTALLATION NOTES

Once you have unarchived (or copied) all of Plug-In's files to a
directory on your hard disk (e.g., C:\PLUGIN), run PLUGIN.EXE from 
Windows.  Plug-In has a built-in install program which will copy
a few small files to the Windows directory and create the 
initialization file. 

Keep in mind that Plug-In is fully integrated with Program Manager. 
To access Plug-In, you use Program Manager's menus!

Once installed, you should refer to:

        - The Quick Tour section in Plug-In's on-line Help.
        - Configure Plug-In (Options menu in Program Manager).

That's all there is to it!  We hope you enjoy the program.  The trial
license for Plug-In allows you to use it for a period of 21 days,
after which time you must register it if you continue using it. 
When you receive your registration number, simply enter it in the 
"Enter Registration Number" dialog.


USER'S GUIDE IN ON-LINE HELP

Plug-In contains a complete User's Guide in its on-line help system.
You can select the "Help" button (or press F1) in all dialogs to go
directly to specific help for that dialog.


UPDATING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION OF PLUG-IN

NOTE:  The following will retain your current configuration for Plug-In.

1) Shutdown Plug-In by pushing the "Remove Plug-In (Shutdown)"
   button in the "Configure Plug-In" dialog (Options menu in ProgMan).

2) UnArchive the most recent version of Plug-In into the SAME
   directory currently used for Plug-In (e.g., C:\PLUGIN).
   It is OK to overwrite the existing files in this directory.

3) COPY GROUP.EXE to your Windows directory (Please don't forget
   to do this!).

4) If you are running Windows 3.1, you can delete COMMDLG.DLL
   and TOOLHELP.DLL from your Plug-In directory.
       
5) You are now updated!  Simply run PLUGIN.EXE to continue.  


INTERNATIONAL ISSUES

Plug-In will operate under international versions of Windows.  
However, there is one thing you must do for proper operation 
if you are using Windows 3.1:  Edit (using NotePad) ProgMan.INI and
define your StartUp group under the [Settings] section 
(e.g., "StartUp=Autostart").

We are planning fully internationalized versions of Plug-In
for a future release.  Contact us for more details.


SOME DETAILS ABOUT THE INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

If you get a message saying that, "Plug-In is being installed from a 
location that may not be available during later Windows sessions," 
this means that Plug-In is being installed from either a removable
drive (i.e., a floppy drive) or a remote drive (i.e., a network drive).
Plug-In sets up its initialization file to point to the location
from which it was installed.  Because of this, you should not install
Plug-In from a floppy drive.  However, it is fine to install from
a network drive as long as it is always available from within Windows.

The "Save Settings On Exit" option in Program Manager is turned
off during the installation (you can still save on exit if you wish).
We recommend that you use "Save Settings Now" instead.  Please refer
to the on-line help for further details.

Plug-In sets itself up to load each time Windows is started.  This 
is the best way to get optimal use out of the program.  If you decide
that you don't want to continue using Plug-In, simply disable the 
"Run Plug-In when Windows starts" option in the configuration dialog.

Plug-In's distribution files include two DLL's from Windows 3.1
(COMMDLG.DLL and TOOLHELP.DLL).  If you are running Windows 3.1,
these files are automatically deleted from the Plug-In directory.
If you are running Windows 3.0, they are left in your Plug-In 
directory.  However, it is recommended that you move them to your 
Windows\System directory.

Plug-In places 5 files in your Windows directory.  These are:

        GROUP.EXE
        PLUGINQN.PIF
        PLUGINQN.BAT
        PLUGINQM.PIF
        PLUGINQM.BAT

These files only take up about 7K bytes.  They are placed in the
Windows directory because they need to be in a directory listed 
in the PATH environment variable.  If you do not wish to have
these files in your Windows directory, it is acceptable to place
them elsewhere, as long as they are on your path (e.g., you could
leave them in the directory with the rest of the Plug-In files if
you added this directory to your PATH environment variable.)

(Note that two other very small files, PLUGIN.INI and PLUGIN.HST,
are created and maintained in the Windows directory).


OBTAINING THE MOST UP-TO-DATE VERSION OF PLUG-IN

If, for whatever reason, you want to be SURE that you have the 
absolute latest version of Plug-In, you may contact Plannet Crafters
directly.  We will ship you the latest version for a nominal charge
of:
        $5 (including shipping / handling in the U.S. and Canada)
        $8 (including shipping / handling for International orders)


KEEPING BACKUPS OF PLUG-IN'S DATA FILES

It is always a good idea to backup your data files!  Most of Plug-In's
configuration data is kept in one file, PLUGIN.INI, which resides in
the Windows directory.  Another file, PLUGIN.HST (also in the Windows
directory) maintains the history list for the run command.  Both of
these files are small, and a simple backup procedure is to copy them
to a floppy disk on occasion.

While on the topic of backups, you might also wish to keep backups of
your group files.  Simply copy *.GRP (the group files) and *.G_P (the
deactivated group files) from your Windows directory to a floppy disk.


USING MICROSOFT'S MS-MOUSE UTILITY (8.10 or 8.20)

If you wish to use this utility and also want to make use of 
Plug-In's custom cursors, you must not use the "growth" feature
in the MS-MOUSE utility.  For more details, refer to the on-line Help.


NOTE TO WINDOWS 3.0 USERS

There are a few commands (some of the group functions and tile 
horizontal) that are only available under Windows 3.1.  The
unavailable commands will be grayed out (disabled) in the menus.


HOW TO DE-INSTALL PLUG-IN

If you wish to de-install Plug-In from a system, do the following:

        1) Disable "Run Plug-In when Windows starts" in the Config
           dialog.  (If you fail to do this, you must manually
           remove the Plug-In entry from either the StartUp group
           or the "Load=" line in the WIN.INI file.
        2) Shutdown Plug-In by selecting "Remove Plug-In" in the 
           Config dialog.
        3) Delete all files in Plug-In's home directory (assuming
           this directory contains ONLY Plug-In files!)
        4) In the Windows directory, Delete the following files:
           PLUGINQ?.*, PLUGIN.INI, PLUGIN.HST, GROUP.EXE


CHANGE HISTORY

1.00    - Initial Release

1.01    - Keep the registration screen on top until it is dealt with.
        - Minor documentation changes
        - Display message if "Group Copy" to an existing group
        - Added "SWITCH" option to GROUP.EXE utility
        - Fixed a minor problem with parentheses in group/item names
        - The external Group utility wasn't updating customized group
          icons when a group was activated.

1.10    - Change to 1.10 so that we can rename PLUGIN10.ZIP to PLUGIN11.ZIP
          This was necessary because many BBS's, etc. won't update a file
          with the same name.
        - Fixed a problem where Plug-In would claim it was being installed
          from a floppy drive when in fact it was not.
        - Increased the max number of QuickRun entries to 25 and the
          max number of SpeedList entries to 20.
        - Minor documentation changes.

1.11    - Fixed a bug that caused a GP Fault when an application sent
          a broadcast notification of multiple changes to WIN.INI.  
          The only known example of this is selecting a different printer 
          from within the Page Setup dialog in Excel 4.0.
        - Miscellaneous changes to the README.DOC file.

* Plannet Crafters, Inc. also hereby grants permission to distribute the
* Plug-In package to Individuals, User Groups, Computer Clubs and BBS's 
* as long as distribution is in accordance with the following restrictions. 
*---------------------------------------------------------------------------*

The Plug-In package is defined as containing all the material listed in 
the PACKING.LST text file.  If any files listed in the PACKING.LST text 
file, or the PACKING.LST file itself, are missing, then the package is 
not complete and distribution is forbidden.  Please contact us to obtain 
a complete package suitable for distribution.

The Plug-In package - including all related program files and documentation
files - CANNOT be modified in any way and must be distributed as a complete
package, with the only exception explained in the next paragraph.  The
PACKING.LST text file contains a list of all files that are part of
the Plug-In package.

There is one exception to the above paragraph.  Many BBS's customarily 
add a small text file (advertisement) to each archived file.  This text 
file describes the BBS and tells people that the file was downloaded from 
that particular BBS.  Other BBSs add a  small one-line message with 
their BBS name and phone number into the compressed file, which will 
display when the file is uncompressed.  Either of these methods of
mentioning your BBS are acceptable and may be used, provided the program
and documentation is otherwise unmodified and complete.

No price or other compensation may be charged for the Plug-In package.
A distribution fee may be charged for the cost of the diskette, shipping
and handling, as long as the total (per disk) does not exceed
US$8.00 (U.S / Canada) or 12.00 (International).


Disk Sets & CD-ROMs:
--------------------

The Plug-In package CANNOT be sold as part of some other inclusive package.  
Nor can it be included in any commercial software packaging offer, without
a written agreement from Plannet Crafters, Inc.

ASP Approved Vendors who wish to distribute the Plug-In package as part
of a collection (such as PsL's MegaDisk set, or a CD-ROM package) may do 
so provided that all the other restrictions are met.

Vendors (non-ASP Vendor Members) who wish to distribute the Plug-In
package as part of a collection (such as PsL's MegaDisk set, or a CD-ROM 
package) must obtain permission from Plannet Crafters, Inc. prior 
to beginning such a distribution.

If you wish to add any of our programs to a CD-ROM or other collection,
please check the release date of the version you have.  If the version
is over six (6) months old then please contact us to ensure that you
have the most current version.  This version was released in October 1992.


Disk-of-the-Month (or Subscription) Distribution:

permission to distribute the Plug-In package under the Disk-of-the-Month
style of distribution.

Others (non-ASP Members) must contact us in advance to ensure that you

You cannot use a Disk-of-the-Month distribution to use up your inventory
of old (out of date) disks.  Only current versions may be shipped as
Disk-of-the-Month disks.

The Plug-In package cannot be "rented" or "leased" to others.

You may not list any of our products in advertisements, catalogs, or
other literature which describes our products as "FREE SOFTWARE".
Shareware is "Try-Before-You-Buy" software, it is not free.

Plannet Crafters, Inc. prohibits the distribution of outdated
versions of the Plug-In package, without written permission from 
Plannet Crafters, Inc.  If the version you have is over six (6) months old,
please contact us to ensure that you have the most current version. 
This version was released in October 1992.

Licensee shall not use, copy, rent, lease, sell, modify, decompile,
disassemble, otherwise reverse engineer, or transfer the licensed

shall result in immediate and automatic termination of this license.

U.S. Government of the computer software and documentation in this
package shall be subject to the restricted rights applicable to

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
