This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
900 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'INSTALL' at
the DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy
access to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.  All the programs are logically divided into thirteen
major categories with subcategories, making it easier to find just the
right software.

All of the programs have been scanned for viruses.  There are also three
online virus utilities that can be run from the CD-ROM which will scan,
screen and clean viruses.  Not only does this save hard disk space, but
also gives every user added security from viruses.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

Winner of the Optical Publishing Assn's Best Consumer Product Award.

Shareware for every imaginable need: Accounting Chemistry Educational
Engineering Games Hypertext Networks Programming Spreadsheets Utilities
Word Processing

Additional BBS file descriptions are available from PC-SIG so that the
CD-ROM can be set up quickly on a bulletin board.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 530K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
a graphics monitor (Hercules/EGA/VGA/SVGA).  A mouse is optional.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.


                      The PC-SIG Games CD-ROM
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now you can play a game a day fo over a year.  This CD-ROM is jammed
with over 380 shareware games of all types, designed to appeal to the
new generation of CD-ROM users out for fun.  The CD incorporates a
hypermedia interface and allows 250 of the games to be played directly
from the CD-ROM.

The hottest games in shareware are on this disk, including the
action/arcade games "Jill of the Jungle" and "Wolfenstein 3D," which
rival or surpass commercial PC and Nintendo for use of animation,
SoundBlaster audio, and VGA graphics.  There are also games designed to
teach children mathematics, spelling and even ecology.  All these games
for less than a dime each!

Over 250 of the games can be played directly from the CD without copying
them to a floppy or a hard drive.  Being able to run from the CD means
that users can explore games without using up valuable hard disk space
or spending time downloading and deleting files.  The hypermedia
interface makes it easy to browse the titles, read a one line
description or full review, and copy or start a game by clicking the
mouse or using the keyboard.

   THE strategy game for ALL power seekers!
   
        World Empire v 2.0 features improved computer

             "World Empire has to be the best version
             of a Risk-style game I've seen.  Thank you

             quality Risk-like games, and yours is by far

   Welcome to World Empire II Deluxe:
  
        There you stand: alone, confident.
        The building whose baroque balcony rails you are gripping is a
   massive structure - actually the capital building of your country. 
   You gaze up at the clear, azure sky, then downwards to the skyline of
   your beautiful capital city.  A humbling aura of history clouds your
   thoughts - but not your vision - as you further lower your gaze to the
   city streets below.
        There is a noise rising there.
        Rather, there is a thunder rising!
        Incredibly, as far as your eyes can see, the streets, boulevards,
   byways, and even alleyways of your city are packed with the people
   responsible for your rise to power as their supreme leader.  Masses of
   loyal, idealistic faces return your gaze as they voice their approval
   of your mission with long, loud, appreciative cheers!
  
        Your mission?  Nothing less than to conquer the entire planet and
   institute a worldwide government under the auspices of your beloved
   ideology.
        World Empire is a strategy game based on a time in the not too
   distant future when nationalism is on the decline... the people of the
   world are tired of the weakened nationalist governments that are
   constantly bickering with one another over trade restrictions and
   border disagreements.
        The beliefs of the world population have polarized into two to
   four ideologies (depending on the number of players in the game!).
        Each ideology has a strong, determined leader who considers
   himself to be militarily capable of uniting the world under one
   government.
        Here is a brief summary of the four major ideologies and their
   leaders:
  
  
  
   The Populist Movement
  
        It has been 10 years since the Populist movement swept like
   wildfire around the world. Growing out of the democratic movement that
   sprang up in Europe during the late 1980's, it was carried by
   enthusiastic students, artists, and intellectuals who organized
   rallies, protests, and marches.
        Their enthusiasm led to the overthrow of a number of governments.
   Local populations joined them and the populist flag became synonymous
   with youth.  They have a dynamic leader who has promised that one day
   they will cover the whole world.  He has raised a number of armies of
   his own and rumor has it that he plans to take over leadership of
   other populist countries as well as defeat the three other world
   parties.
  
  
   The Militarist Ideology
  
        Disgruntled army leaders executed rapid coups in a number of
   African countries during the last years of the 20th century. The
   subsequent success of the economies of those countries led to growing
   support for military leadership in other nations.
        A fiery young army officer in Morocco rose rapidly to the rank of
   general and his charismatic personality has generated a great deal of
   followers who regard him as a potential world leader. The Militarist
   ideology bears close watching in future years.
  
  
   The Socialist Ideology


  
        Socialists owe their beginnings to a group of Central American
   countries who amalgamated in 2004 and formed a  coalition promoting
   world unity as a means for better distribution of national resources.
   Opposition in their home territory has, at times, tipped the balance
   of power and ousted them.
        However, their ideology has aroused a lot of support among some
   countries.  At present the most powerful exponent of it, both
   militarily and philosophically is a highly educated young general
   noted for his military campaigns and his best selling book "Share The
   Wealth or Lose It".  Some critics feel that his world unity plans call
   for one leader, himself!
  
  
   The Realists
  
        Many people don't remember the obscure beginnings of the Realist
   ideology.  Apparently, it started in a small village in eastern
   Canada, known as Pugwash Junction, by a frustrated smoker who felt
   that cigarette taxes were too high.  He organized thousands of
   disgruntled smokers who overthrew the government and dropped cigarette
   prices from $6.46 a pack to 25 cents. Gradually, the push for
   realistic prices spread to other things.
        The present head of the Realist Party can't remember what
   happened next; but it must have been quite a bit since the Realists
   are determined to take over the world with their leader, a grandchild
   of the original Pugwash Junction revolutionary (and a non-smoker!).
  
  
  
   T H E   C H A L L E N G E ! ======================
  
  
        Can you do it?  Can you defeat the other ideological leaders and
   create your own empire?
        Or, if you haven't anyone else to conquer, can you defeat the
   evil General - 'Chip' Silicon - in Computer Play Mode?
        What are REVOLUTIONS?
  
        World Empire II Deluxe will provide the answers to these
   questions and give you hours of enjoyable hegemony!
  
        Enjoy!  "May you always occupy fully".
  
  
  
   I N S T R U C T I O N S ====================
  
  
        World Empire II Deluxe is a game that blends strategy and luck to
   achieve world conquest.
        The object of the game is simple: defeat the other players (human
   or computer) and conquer the world!
  
        You begin the game with 56 Armies (actually divisions) in normal
   mode or 30 Armies in expert mode, all placed in a randomly selected
   country.  Your strategy will likely be heavily influenced by this
   initial positioning.
  
        You can only attack countries that border a country that you
   already own.  Also, attacking one continent from another can only be
   done from certain countries.  For example, an attack launched at Asia
   from Europe can only be accomplished through the Ukraine - an attack
   launched at Africa can only be accomplished through Spain.


  
        Also at the beginning of the game, each player is assigned an
   IDEOLOGY, or set of beliefs, for which he will fight for the duration
   of the game.
        A randomly selected number of countries around the world are also
   assigned that player's ideology.
        These ideologically "friendly" countries are easier to conquer
   than those who are friendly to another player.  They also require only
   ONE army of occupation.
  
        The winner of individual attacks is determined randomly by
   electronically throwing dice (though you don't see this).  If you get
   the highest result, you win.
        If these "dice" come up doubles and the country you are attacking
   shares your ideology, then you win the battle.  If, however, that
   country shares someone else's ideology you lose the tie.
  
        Unfriendly countries require two to four armies to occupy them,
   while the maximum amount of armies any country can accomodate is 99.
   If you occupy these unfriendly countries with less than the specified
   amount, or if an opposing player whittles your armies down to less
   than that amount, you are in danger of losing that country to a
   REVOLUTION.
        A revolution takes place when the amount of occupation armies is
   too low.
        After a revolution, ownership of the country reverts to the
   player who shares that country's ORIGINAL ideology and the populace
   will raise five armies for that player to use.
  
        Conquering countries is important, for at the beginning of each
   turn you are awarded new recruits based on the number of countries you
   currently own (the ones that you've successfully attacked).
   You will receive ONE new army for every TWO countries you own.
        In addition, when you have conquered an entire continent, you
   receive bonus armies based on the size of that continent.
  
  
  
  
  
   R E A L   W O R L D   S I M U L A T I O N   M O D E ==============
   (Registered Version Only)
  
        When you select "Real World Simulation" from the New Game Dialog
   Box (described below under 'NEW Button') things are a bit different,
   however.
        The differences are:
  
             1.  New Armies are assigned according to population.
                 For example, if you own the United States, you will
                 receive 22 armies for it alone at the beginning of each
                 turn.  If you own Haiti, you'll get one army and if
                 you own China, you'll get 100 (the most of any country).
  
             2.  Occupation armies (the number of armies needed in a
                 country to prevent a revolution) are also calculated by
                 population.  Countrys friendly to your beloved ideology
                 still require only 1 army of occupation, and the minimum
                 number of armies required in an unfriendly country is 2.
                 The maximum is 25, if you own China and it is unfriendly.
  
             3.  Armies are given STRENGTH depending on the total
                 industrial capability, agricultural output, *and* the
                 gasoline production capacity of *all* of a players


                 conquered countries combined.  The more industrialized
                 countries you own, the stronger your armies are because
                 infantry is now augmented by mechanized forces and
                 tactical air forces.
  
             4.  Players start out in a medium industrialised nation
                 (unless they select their own home country in
                 the New Game Dialog Box), with each player placed
                 as equally as possible.  Your strategy will depend      
                 initially on attacking only those countries
                 whose economic potential will not dilute the
                 strength of your armies.  Your goal will be
                 to stay stronger than your opponent.
  
                 For example, if you start your crusade for
                 empire in the United States, you would not
                 want attack Cuba immediately.  Attacking
                 Cuba would effectively cut the STRENGTH of
                 your forces in HALF!  So go north and take
                 Canada, which will actually raise your overall
                 strength.
  
             5.  Winners of individual battles are determined
                 far less randomly, although there is still a
                 large random element involved, as in the real
                 world.  The STRENGTH of a player's armies is the
                 major determining factor, however.  If you have
                 fifty armies and they are facing fifty hostile
                 armies but your strength is twice that of your
                 opponent, you will win - regardless of whose
                 ideology the country originally 'believed' in.
  
             6.  You'll find that armies in the Real World Simulation
                 mode are abundant,  but you'll need to watch their
                 quality!
  
  
  
  
  
   Hints for Real World Simulation Mode:
  
        The computer players are okay in this this mode, but, ideally,
   another human makes the best opponent.  Suggestions are encouraged.
        If you do not select Base Countries for each player, the computer
   will place each player in a randomly selected country of medium
   industrial/gas production capacity.
        If you do select Base Countries try to keep each players strengh
   balanced.  Unless you just wanna smash those guys!
        Choose your attacks carefully, so that your strength is not
   drained supporting countries with poor resources.  This will be
   difficult at times but engrossing.
        Some scenarios may not be winnable in Real World Simulation, so
   don't get frustrated.  On the other hand, some games will be too easy!
        There are two way to go: Attack only industrialised nations to
   keep your strength at maximum, or concentrate on countries with large
   populations and use numbers to overpower your opponents.
        Remember the real world isn't fair, neither is this mode!
  
        I hope you enjoy this addition to World Empire II For Windows.
  
  
  
   I N S T R U C T I O N S ==================== ...Continued


       
        There are two Screens in World Empire II Deluxe - the World Map
   Screen and the Continent Map Screen.
        Computer play takes place entirely on the World Map Screen
   whereas human players first must select a continent to view, then do
   their conquering from the Continent Map Screen.
  
  
  
   THE WORLD MAP SCREEN ====================
  
        The Controls on this Screen are (Starting from the bottom left   
        corner going clockwise):
  
   The ABOUT Button:
        Displays program credits and this manual.
  
   The NEW Button:
        Displays the New Game window.  Follow the prompts to enter
        the information for the type of game you want to play.
        There are five components to the World Empire II Deluxe
        New Game Window.  They are:
  
             -Player Configuration:
                  Here you choose which players will be computer
                  players and which will be human.  Once a player
                  is turned on, his BASE Button becomes active.
                  Click on this to position that player in a
                  custom location.  When you click on the BASE
                  Button, a scrolling window appears from which
                  you'll select first the continent, then the
                  country from which you want this player to start
                  the game.
  
             -Initial Victim Status:
                  Use this box to select whether you want your
                  game to begin with all countries randomly
                  distributed among the players, or whether you
                  want all countries to be unconquered when play
                  begins. 
                  NOTE:  This box has no effect when
                  playing in Real World Simulation mode.  All
                  countries will be neutral.
  
             -Game Mode (Registered Version Only):
                  Use this box to select the Real World Simulation
                  feature of World Empire II Deluxe.
  
             -Options (Registered Version Only):
                  Due to popular demand, you can now turn off
                  Revolutions entirely - or just have the number of
                  armies it takes to occupy a country displayed
                  with that country's information.  Not as much fun,
                  though <grin>.
  
             -Difficulty (Registered Version Only):
                  If you are NOT playing in Real World Simulation Mode,
                  you can play using the new "EXPERT" level.  This
                  level starts everyone out with 30 armies rather than
                  56, and causes occupation forces to be raised to
                  between 2 to 7 in unfriendly countries.  It's neat.
  
  
  


       
   The LOAD Button:
        Displays the Load Window listing games that you have saved.
        Click on the game you wish to load, then click on "Okay".
  
   The SAVE Button:
        Displays the Save Window.  To save a game, Click the SAVE
        Button, enter a name for the current game, and click the
        "Okay" Button.
  
   The GIVE UP Button:
        When there is no hope and all is lost, click on this button
        to surrender.  After confirming your decision, the program
        will display a list of players to whom you may surrender.
        Click on your choice, then click on "Okay".
        The player you surrender to will take over any countries you
        may still have remaining.
        Also, your ideology will be erased from all countries who
        share it, and will be replaced that player's ideology.
  
   The PICTURE WINDOW:
        When a game is in progress this window displays a "picture"
        of the current player.
  
   The FLAG WINDOW:
        When a game is in progress this window displays Ideological
        Flag of the current player.
  
   The PASS Button:
        This button ENDS YOUR TURN, allowing the next player to do
        his thing.
  
   The COMPUTER DIALOG WINDOW:
        When a computer player is conquering, his progress and
        strategic decisions are displayed here.
  
   The BLITZ Button:
        This button allows computer player to player without
        constantly displaying their progress.  It speeds things up
        considerably.
  
   The EXIT Button:
        Use this button to Exit the game.
  
  
   The CONTINENT Buttons:
        There are six of these, one for each continent used in the
        game.  To attack or view the status of a country, click on
        the Continent Button below the name of the continent where
        that country is.
        This will display the Continent Map Screen for that
        continent.
  
  
   THE CONTINENT MAP SCREEN ====================
  
        Here's where you'll fight your individual battles.
  
        At the bottom of the Continent Map Screen is the BACK TO WORLD
   MAP Button.  Click on this to return control to the World Map Screen.
  
        Above the BACK TO WORLD MAP Button is the map of the continent
   you selected from the World Map Screen.
  


        Each country on the map is identified by a small line running
   from the country itself to the country's name.  Beside the country's
   name is the Country Button.
  
   When you click on a Country Button:
  
   1. Information on that country will be displayed in the ATTACKER'S
   BOX, in the upper right hand corner of the screen.
  
   2. A list of countries that BORDER the selected country drops down
   below the Attacker's Box.  This is the BORDER BOX.  Each item in the
   Border Box consists of three parts:
  
        - The border country's name.
        - A small box indicating the country's owner by color.
        - A small box indicating the country's ideology by color.
  
   (If a country has not been conquered by any of the players yet its
   owner box will be grey.)
  
   3. Real World Simulation Only:  A graph will appear below the
   ATTACKER'S BOX and above the BORDER BOX.  This graph shows the current
   STRENGTH of the armies residing in the selected country.  The graph
   consists of a bar with three colors which represent:
       
        Yellow - The relative amount of MECHANISED STRENGTH that the
                  armies possess.  Yellow is power!
        Green -  The relative amount of INFANTRY STRENGTH that the
                  armies possess.
        Blue -   The relative amount of TACTICAL AIR SUPPORT available
                  to those armies.  Air support strengthens both
                  mechanized and infantry armys.
  
        When you conquer a country, that country's STRENGTH GRAPH will
   immediately reflect the change in strength caused by adding that
   country to your growing empire.
  
  
  
  
   To ATTACK a country:
  
  
        When the bordering countries are displayed, select a country from
   the BORDERS BOX that doesn't yet belong to you, and click anywhere on
   its name IN THE LIST BOX.
        Information on the country you are attacking will then be
   displayed directly below the Attacker's Box in the ATTACKEE'S BOX.
   If you have more than one army in the country you are attacking from,
   the ATTACK BUTTON will appear.
        Press the Attack Button to attack the country displayed in the
   Attackee's Box.
        When the Attack Button is pressed it changes to a RETREAT BUTTON.
   Retreat (press the Retreat Button) when an attack is going bad and you
   need to preserve armies.
  
  
   To TRANSFER armies from one country to another:
  
        Click on the Country Button of the country you want to transfer
   armies FROM, and a list of countries bordering that country will drop
   down under the Attacker's Box.
        Click a friendly country that you want to transfer armies to. 
   That country will be displayed in the Attackee's Box and the TRANSFER


   BUTTON will appear.
        Click the Transfer Button and use the scroll bar that appears to
   move the armies from one country to another.
  
  
   To ASSIGN newly recruited armies:
  
        If there are new armies to distribute, the ASSIGN BUTTON will
   appear after clicking on the Country Button of a friendly country.
        Click the Assign Button, then use the scroll bar to assign new
   armies to that country.
  
  
  
   That's how easy it is!
  
  
  
   THE EMPERORS HALL OF FAME =====================
  
        The player who conquers the world suffering the least army
   casualties will be entered into the Emperors Hall of Fame for
   posterity.
  
  
  
   P R O G R A M   N O T E S  ======================
  
   Geography:
  
        We included as many countries as we perceived were practical. 
   Some were left out because of their small size (smaller than a pixel),
   while some were left out because they would have overloaded a
   particular continent with countries.  For instance, including ALL of
   the Pacific island states would have made Asia a bit top heavy
   army-wise.  Sorry Taiwan!
  
        There are other oddities - for example, Iceland, which is
   technically part of Europe, for display convenience and balance is
   placed on the North American Continent Map.
  
        The maps are hand-drawn so should not be used for serious
   navigational purposes (hee hee).
  
   Ain't pixelated hegemony great?

   The UnderWare Early Warning System
   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  
       If you are a beginning shareware author, you are entering into an
   exciting an unique method of software creation, compensation, and
   distribution.  It is a truly enjoyable way to share your hard work
   with people around the world.  It can even offer a monetary return!
       You should be aware, however, that releasing your programs without
   stipulation as to *who* can freely distribute them leaves your program
   vulnerable to certain near-unethical business methods practiced by a
   only few shareware vendors.
       A simple remedy to this is to include a VENDOR.DOC file with every
   program you release, specifying the requirements *you* have to protect
   your rights in having a say in how your program is distributed, even
   if all you require is your permission.
       A FILE_ID.DIZ file containing your own description of your program
   is also helpful.
       Feel free to utilize the UnderWare constitution in your
   documentation.  Alter it to suit your needs as necessary (you may even
   remove the UnderWare Logo, if you wish!)
            
       Please also include this note to new shareware authors in your
   program documentation.
       Good luck with your new SHAREWARE program!

NOTE 1:
   
   This program is written in Visual Basic.  Thus it needs the 
   VBRUN100.DLL (which is included) to run.  If you got your copy
   from an online service or bulletin board take note:
        Some BBS Sysops remove the VBRUN100.DLL file from Windows
        programs that use it in order to save disk drive space.
        If you are missing the VBRUN100.DLL file, log back on to
        the service or BBS it came from, and, if you can't easily
        find the VBRUN file, leave a comment to your Sysop asking
        how he/she allows people to acquire it.  
   
NOTE 2:

        There is a Windows setup program included.  To run the setup
        program from DOS, be sure you are in the directory in which
        the World Empire II files reside.  Then type "EMPIREII" and hit
        enter.  A batch file will run WIndows and execute the setup
        program for you, creating a Program Group and an Empire
        icon.

        To run the setup from Windows, use the File Manager to locate
        the directory where your World Empire II files are, then find the
        file SETUP.EXE and double-click on it or select 'Run" from the
        File Manager's "File Menu" after highlighting the file.

NOTE 3:
   
   It has come to my attention that certain SVGA video hardware
   is non-compatible with the MicroSoft Visual Basic Environment and
   causes problems every so often in 800 x 600 mode and more often in
   1024 x 768 resolution.  Buttons will be misplaced in relation to 
   maps, etc.  At the moment there is one solution:
        Open the Windows Setup icon and select CHANGE SYSTEM SETTINGS
        from the OPTIONS menu.  Follow the prompts to change your
        video mode to a 640 x 480 resolution driver.  The game will
        now run fine.  When you're finished, return to Setup and
        re-install your original driver.
        This is a patch, of course, but rest assured the problem
        will be addressed in the next version of World Empire II,
        version 2.1.  We're sorry for the inconvenience.
   
   
   Happy conquering!

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Outside the U.S.A. call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer in

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.


To Order, in the U.S.A.: Call 800-245-6717 and ask Customer Service.

Outside the U.S.A. call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer in
