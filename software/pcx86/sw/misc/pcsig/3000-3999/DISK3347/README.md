Komputer Kitchen

Komputer Kitchen is an easy-to-use Windows based cookbook and recipe manager.
With it you can enter your own recipes, use the existing recipes, 
put together a menu and, from that, create  a shopping list. 
When working with the recipes you can choose to simply view them, 
edit them and/or print them. Editing the shopping list is also a convenient 
feature as you can add other items not located on your chosen recipes 
to simplify your shopping needs. Komputer Kitchen can also tailor the recipes 
to the number of people you are serving. This program requires Windows 3.0 or 
higher and a hard disk.
