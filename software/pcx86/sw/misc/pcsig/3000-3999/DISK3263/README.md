     Dash through verdant woodlands, jump over gushing streams, climb rail
fences and race through farm fields as you search for the opposing team's
flag in a desperate race to capture their flag before they capture yours. 
Analyze your defensive team's skills, develop their tactics, then deploy
them in natural cover to intercept and capture the opposition raiders.
      Choose between running, walking, crawling, or just a standing search
as lookout.  Enjoy the suspense and sounds (supports Adlib and Sound
Blaster) of battle.  All of this action takes place on a huge, beautifully
detailed playing field in gorgeous HIGH resolution VGA (640 by 480 in 16
colors), with synchronized sound and great animation. 
     Took 2,600+ hours to create this commercial quality, landmark game. 
Extensive play testing has resulted in comprehensive help popups that make
this new kind of strategy game remarkably quick to learn.  Can play
against the computer (strong artificial intelligence) or a friend.  
     REQUIREMENTS: 530,000 free bytes, a 286 or above, and VGA.
