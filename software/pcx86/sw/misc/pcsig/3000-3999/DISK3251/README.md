1111  INSTALLING MYTHMASTER: A VAGABOND'S ADVENTURE ON YOUR HARD DISK  1111

You need the following to run this game:
     IBM PC and IBM PC compatibles       
     8 mhz. or faster       
     EGA or VGA (16-color)       
     2.5 megabytes of hard disk space
     384k RAM
     keyboard or joystick (optional)
If you have three double density diskettes they should contain a total of
four files:
MM1READ.TXT--This text file on disk 1
MM1DISK1.EXE--The first self-extracting file for the game on disk 1
MM1DISK2.EXE--The second self-extracting file for the game on disk 2
MM1DISK3.EXE--The third self-extracting file for the game on disk 3
If you have one high density diskette then it should contain all four of the
above files.
Make sure you have at least 2.5 megabytes of free hard disk space.
Create a directory for the game by typing MD MYTHMAST and then pressing
ENTER.  
Now get into the directory by typing CD MYTHMAST and then press ENTER.

a) If you have three diskettes:  Place DISK 1 into the floppy diskette drive. 
Type the letter of the floppy drive followed by a colon and then type
MM1DISK1 then press ENTER. As an example, if you put the diskette into floppy
drive A, then at the hard drive prompt type A:MM1DISK1 then press ENTER.  A
screen will ask you if you want to continue to unpack the compressed files. 
Repeat this procedure with Disk 2 for MM1DISK2 and with Disk 3 for MM1DISK3.
     
b) If you have one high density diskette, then put it into the floppy drive
and repeat the above steps without having to change the diskette in the
floppy drive, i.e. type A:MM1DISK1 then press ENTER and unpack the files. 
Type A:MM1DISK2 then press ENTER and unpack the files.  Type A:MM1DISK3 then
type ENTER and unpack the files.

c) If, after starting the game, you find that you can't communicate on the
game command line or you experience other major problems then you probably
have device drivers and/or TSR's (terminate-and-stay-resident programs)
interfering with the game program.  To solve both these problems, rename your
config.sys file and your autoexec.bat file then reboot your machine.  The
game should run okay now.  Be sure to restore the correct names to these two
files and reboot your machine again when you want to run your other software
applications. (always keep backup copies of these two files.)

Type DIR then press ENTER and you should get a listing containing all of the
following files distributed with this game:
     MM1.EXE--The MythMaster: A Vagabond's Adventure program
     MM1READ.TXT--How to install the game on your hard disk
     MM1GUIDE.TXT--How to play the game and other information
     MM1NOUNS.DAT--Data file
     MM1PIC.DAT--Data file
     MM1RSPTS.DAT--Data file
     MM1SD.DAT--Data file
     MM1STATS.DAT--Data file
     MM1VERBS.DAT--Data file

          check for any kind of file corruption

Read the text file MM1GUIDE.TXT for instructions on playing the game.  If you
have a printer you may type COPY MM1GUIDE.TXT LPT1 then press Enter and you
will get a copy of the guide for future reference.
