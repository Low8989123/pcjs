_______________________________________________________________

   McAFEE ASSOCIATES BUSINESS/INSTITUTION/GOVERNMENT LICENSE

        NOTICE TO USERS ("COMPANY"):  CAREFULLY READ THE FOLLOWING
LEGAL AGREEMENT. COMPANY'S USE OF THIS SOFTWARE IS CONDITIONED
UPON COMPLIANCE BY COMPANY WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE
SOFTWARE MAY BE EVALUATED FOR FIVE DAYS ON A ROYALTY FREE BASIS. 
CONTINUED USE AFTER EVALUATION IS CONDITIONED UPON PAYMENT BY
COMPANY OF THE NEGOTIATED LICENSE FEE SPECIFIED IN A CONFIRMATION
LETTER FROM MCAFEE ASSOCIATES ("MCAFEE").

        The Software may not be distributed by Company to any
outside corporation, organization or government agency.  This
license authorizes Company to use the number of copies described
in the confirmation letter from McAfee and for which Company has
paid McAfee the negotiated license fee.  If the confirmation
letter from McAfee indicates that Company's license is
"Corporate-Wide", this license will be deemed to cover copies
duplicated and distributed by Company for use on any additional
incremental machines purchased or leased by Company during the
Term, at no additional charge.  This license will remain in
effect for two years from the date of the confirmation letter
from McAfee authorizing such continued use or such other period
as is stated in the confirmation letter (the "Term").  If Company
does not obtain a confirmation letter and pay the applicable
license fee, this license expires at the end of the five day
evaluation period.  All updates must be accessed and downloaded
from McAfee's bulletin board, the McAfee Virus Forum on
CompuServe or McAfee's Internet node.  Access instructions for
the Company's licensed user bulletin board are included in the
confirmation letter.  In the case where Company is licensing more
than 50 copies of the Software, all updates will also be provided
in diskette form at no charge as they occur or quarterly,
whichever is less frequent, during the term of this license.

I.      SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT.  Support for Software bug reports
and other product issues will be handled through a single point
of contact within the Company.  Company shall identify the
contact individual when placing its order with McAfee or McAfee's
Authorized Agent.  There will be no charge for support of the
Software when channelled through such individual.  Support
requests from other organizational areas will be billed at normal
hourly support rates. 

II.     INFECTION SUPPORT.  Telephone, BBS, CompuServe and Internet
support for virus infections is available at no additional
charge.  On-site support may be obtained from a McAfee Authorized
Agent, as available, at a negotiated hourly rate plus travel time
and expenses.
 
III.    EMPLOYEE HOME USE OPTION.  In the case where Company is
licensing more than 50 copies of the Software, McAfee will
license the Software for home use by employees if requested by
Company, in writing, within the first year of the license.  The
cost for this option is 20% of the standard site license fee for
that number of employee home use machines.

IV.     GENERAL TERMS.

        COPYRIGHT.  The Software is protected by United States
copyright laws and international treaty provisions.  Company
acknowledges that no title to the intellectual property in the
Software is transferred to Company.  Company further acknowledges
that full ownership rights to the Software will remain the
exclusive property of McAfee or its suppliers, and Company will
not acquire any rights to the Software except as expressly set
forth in this license.  Company agrees that any copies of the
Software made by Company will contain the same proprietary
notices which appear on and in the Software.

                             VALIDATE Version 0.4
                 Copyright (C) 1989-1992 by McAfee Associates.
                              TEL (408) 988-3832

NOTE: VALIDATE version 0.4 is being released so that VALIDATE will
      remain compatible with the /SAVE option of SCAN. The new /SAVE
      option changes the SCAN.EXE file, and the new VALIDATE will be
      able to compensate for the changes, so that the validation results
      before and after the /SAVE switch will be identical.  This in no
      way impairs the validating process.

     VALIDATE is a file-authentication program that may be used to check
other programs for signs of tampering.  VALIDATE uses two discrete methods
to generate Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC's), which are then displayed for
the user to compare against the known value for the program(s) validated.
The known validation data can be published by the author of the program or
be obtained from a trusted information database.  The dual CRC checking
provides a high degree of security.

     To confirm that a program is in its original, untampered state, run
the VALIDATE program on it, record the validation data produced, and
compare it against the record in the online database. If they match, than
it is highly improbable that the program has been modified.

To run VALIDATE, type:

     VALIDATE d:\path\filename.ext

The VALIDATE program will then display the following information:

                   Size:  (#/bytes)
                   Date:  (file creation date)
    File Authentication
         Check Method 1:  (a four digit CRC)
         Check Method 2:  (a four digit CRC)

     The VALIDATE program may be copied and distributed at no charge as
long as it is distributed whole and intact and unmodified in any way,
along with this file.  Please report virus infections and reports of
program tampering to:
