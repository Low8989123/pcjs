 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         README.TXT: LETTERHEAD.PRO FOR WORDPERFECT 5.0 or 5.1 (DOS)
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Thank you for your interest in Letterhead Pro. This program requires only that
 you have WordPerfect 5.0 or 5.1 (DOS) installed. Letterhead Pro will set up 16
 graphic sample letterheads, 6 logos, and 1 watermark into WordPerfect. Each 
 letterhead will also have a macro that installs the letterhead into any 
 WordPerfect document.  After the installation is completed, WordPerfect will
 automatically be called up with a document entitled README.DOC on screen. 
 (It does not contain the same information as this file.) README.DOC contains
 instructions on how to use the installed macros, as well as instructions for
 designing and ordering your own customized letterhead, logo, and watermark.

 README.DOC is a WordPerfect document and must be printed from inside
 WordPerfect. You may use README.DOC to guide you through the display and 
 printing of the letterheads. The document was set up using COURIER 10cpi so
 that it would print the order form and other items correctly on almost any 
 printer. You will be shown how you may obtain your own customized graphic 
 letterheads. All instructions, worksheets, and order forms are included.

 You may design your own letterhead, convert your present printed letterhead,
 or have CPI Software design a letterhead for you. CPI Software will place
 this design into a graphic PCX format, add a macro, and return it to you.

 If the printer you are currently using will print WordPerfect graphics, it
 will print graphical PCX letterheads. This includes lasers, ink jets, and
 dot-matrix printers. You do NOT need special printer drivers or any other 
 add-ons to place a customized professionally created letterhead on your
 WordPerfect documents. WordPerfect and Letterhead Pro are all you need.
 
 Before starting the installation, refresh yourself on whether you used the
 Basic or Custom installation when installing WordPerfect. If you do not 
 remember, then locate the path to the macro files, graphic files, and 
 WordPerfect document files. Use the Custom installation for Letterhead Pro
 and type in the path data when prompted.


                                 INSTALLATION

 Letterhead Pro may be installed in one of three ways. It may also be removed
 from your hard disk (uninstalled) using the CLEANUP command below.

 1. Basic Installation:

 This installation corresponds to the WordPerfect Basic installation, where
 all the documents, macros, and graphics were into the \WP51 directory. If you
 did not make any changes in the directory locations since installing 
 WordPerfect with the Basic installation, then this is the method of choice.

 2. Custom Installation:

 This installation will let you place the document files, the macros, and the
 graphics into any directory you wish. You must know the path to each of these
 directories. For example, if you placed all documents into a directory named
 "DOC" off the main "WP51" directory on drive "C", then this would be the full
 path:

                               C:\WP51\DOC                           

 You will be asked: a. the drive letter, b. the path for document files, c. the
 path for macro files (files ending with .WPM), and c. the path for graphic
 files (files ending with .WPG). If you are not sure how you had installed
 WordPerfect, then use this method. Locate these files before the installation,
 and write down their proper path. Even if you used the Basic WordPerfect
 installation, this method would work, if you know where the files are located.

 3. Manual Installation:

 This method does not use the Letterhead Pro INSTALL program, but it must be
 done exactly as follows: 

 a. Locate where the WordPerfect document files, macro files, and  graphic
    files are on your hard disk. 
    
 b. From the INSTALL disk, copy these files into the proper directory:

           1. PRO.EXE and ZAP.EXE into the documents directory.
           2. MACROS.EXE and ZAP.EXE into the macros directory. 
           3. GRAPHICS.EXE and ZAP.EXE into the graphics directory.
 
 c. PRO.EXE, MACROS.EXE, GRAPHICS.EXE, and ZAP.EXE are self-extracting 
    files. You need only to type their names and strike the ENTER key, and
    the Letterhead Pro file(s) will be extracted from them.

 d. ZAP.EXE should be in every directory where any Letterhead Pro files are
    located. This contains the file CLEANUP.EXE that is used to remove all
    Letterhead Pro files from the directory (see below) at a later time.

 e. After extracting all files, call up WordPerfect. When WordPerfect is on
    screen, retrieve or open the README.DOC file. Print the README.DOC file
    just as you would print any WordPerfect document. Use the README.DOC
    instructions to guide you through the printing of the letterheads. Then 
    use the Worksheet and Order Form to obtain your customized letterheads, 
    logos, and watermark.


                         UNINSTALLING LETTERHEAD PRO

 The installation places the file CLEANUP.EXE into every directory where 
 Letterhead Pro files have been placed. When you wish to remove all installed
 Letterhead Pro files, simply go into the directories where you have installed
 files and type:

                       CLEANUP   and strike the ENTER key

 You will be asked if you want to uninstall all Letterhead Pro files in that
 directory. Press the ENTER key and all installed files will be removed,
 including CLEANUP.EXE. 


 CPI Software also distributes Letterhead Pro for WordPerfect for Windows, 
 Letterhead Pro for Word for Windows, and Letterhead Pro for Ami Pro. In 
 addition, Laser Letterhead plus and The Laser Letterhead Kit are available
 specifically for laser printers. We have been designing letterheads for
 business and personal use since 1987. 
 
 Thank you again, and enjoy your experience with Laser Letterhead Pro.
