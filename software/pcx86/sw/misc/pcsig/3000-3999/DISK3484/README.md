This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
900 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'INSTALL' at
the DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy
access to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.  All the programs are logically divided into thirteen
major categories with subcategories, making it easier to find just the
right software.

All of the programs have been scanned for viruses.  There are also three
online virus utilities that can be run from the CD-ROM which will scan,
screen and clean viruses.  Not only does this save hard disk space, but
also gives every user added security from viruses.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

Winner of the Optical Publishing Assn's Best Consumer Product Award.

Shareware for every imaginable need: Accounting Chemistry Educational
Engineering Games Hypertext Networks Programming Spreadsheets Utilities
Word Processing

Additional BBS file descriptions are available from PC-SIG so that the
CD-ROM can be set up quickly on a bulletin board.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 530K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
a graphics monitor (Hercules/EGA/VGA/SVGA).  A mouse is optional.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.


                      The PC-SIG Games CD-ROM
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now you can play a game a day fo over a year.  This CD-ROM is jammed
with over 380 shareware games of all types, designed to appeal to the
new generation of CD-ROM users out for fun.  The CD incorporates a
hypermedia interface and allows 250 of the games to be played directly
from the CD-ROM.

The hottest games in shareware are on this disk, including the
action/arcade games "Jill of the Jungle" and "Wolfenstein 3D," which
rival or surpass commercial PC and Nintendo for use of animation,
SoundBlaster audio, and VGA graphics.  There are also games designed to

for less than a dime each!

Over 250 of the games can be played directly from the CD without copying
them to a floppy or a hard drive.  Being able to run from the CD means
that users can explore games without using up valuable hard disk space
or spending time downloading and deleting files.  The hypermedia
interface makes it easy to browse the titles, read a one line
description or full review, and copy or start a game by clicking the
mouse or using the keyboard.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

VGACAP v7.7 Copyright 1987-91 Lawrence & Marvin Gozum, MD.

VGACAP captures MCGA/VGA 320x200x256 or SVGA 640x480x256, 800x600x256
and 1024x768x256 screens.  VGACAP74.ZIP includes VGAFIL to convert 256-color
320x200, 640x480, 800x600 or 1024x768 grabs to GIF, PCX, BMP (Windows 3.0)
and TGA (Targa 16), as well as hardcode VGACAP for FAST, SVGA SCREEN GRABS.

VGACAP now supports fast VGA/SVGA captures for 640x480x16, 800x600x16
and 1024x768x16 !!!

You can also view VGACAP and VGAFIL as a generic conversion utility since
almost any MCGA/VGA/SVGA image from (320x200 to 1024x768) that can be
viewed, can be converted to GIF, PCX, BMP or TGA format !

VGACAP  .COM    TSR Capture Utility
VGACAP  .DOC    User Manual
VGAFIL  .DOC    GIF/PCX/BMP/TGA encoder
BRUN41  .EXE    Runtime Module
Update v7.7     * BUGFIX: Total overhaul of 1024x768x256 grab routines.

		* BUGFIX: Trident bank switching code modified to force
		  64KB paging with single page mapping.

		* VGAFIL v2.7 now encodes BMP files via a special color
		  reduction and remapping routine to virtually eliminate
		  "hotspots" when BMP images are remapped by Windows 3.x;
		  resulting in FASTER LOADS too !

		* VGAFIL v2.7 cosmetic overhaul (similar to MVGAVU).

		* VGAFIL v2.7 now incorporates faster PCX encoding.

		* VGAFIL v2.7 BUGFIX: missing right column of pixels with odd
		  image PCX sizes; corrected.

		* VGAFIL (v2.7) BUGFIX: "0" lenght PCX, BMP and TGA files
		  did not trigger the right error code (ie., unsupported
		  image dimensions); corrected.


Update v7.6     * BUGFIX: C&T 1024x768x16 and 1024x768x256 bank switching
		  code code got exchanged, thereby messing up each other;
		  corrected.

		* BUGFIX: Video7 1024x768x16 and 1024x768x256 bank switching
		  code code got exchanged, thereby messing up each other;
		  corrected.

Update v7.5     * BUGFIX: Trident SVGA bank routines were still flawed
		  (we tried to accomodate the rare BR version of the
		  TVGA chip), resulting in erroneous bank switching;
		  corrected by restoring the standard 64KB TVGA 8800/8900
		  banking code. <damn those BRs!>

		* Added a new 'Trident' SVGA bank switching mode labelled
		  'Zymos'; this is essentially similar to Trident 8800/8900
		  chipset BUT with similar WRITE/READ bank switching
		  routines.

		* VGAFIL (v2.5) customization menu updated to accomodate
		  'Zymos' setting.

		* BUGFIX: Video7 1024x768x16 grabs required a different
		  bank switching routine; added 16-color bank switching code.

		* BUGFIX: C&T 452/453 1024x768x16 grabs required a different
		  bank switching routine; added 16-color bank switching code.


Update v7.4     * Added FAST SVGA 1024x768x256 capture funtionality.

		* Added FAST SVGA 1024x768x16 capture funtionality.

		* Added FAST SVGA 800x600x16 capture funtionality.

		* BUGFIX: SVGA C&T 452 and 453 bank routines were flawed;
		  corrected.

		* VGAFIL (v2.4) now avoids sign-on screen if REGISTER.OVL
		  is detected and verified; saves you a keystroke.

Update v7.3     * BUGFIX: When VGACAP is loaded and one or more files are
		  saved, subsequent reloading of VGACAP would be accepted
		  (ie., two or more VGACAP resident files would be
		  permitted); corrected.

		* Added Ahead-B chipset support (VGA Wizard).

		* VGAFIL (v2.3) MAJOR BUGFIX: Some combinations of DOS and
		  environment variables resulted in "0" lenght PCX, BMP and
		  TGA files (something to do with too many or conflicting
		  DOS file handles); corrected!

		* VGAFIL (v2.3) FASTER PCX encoding.

Update v7.2     * FAST VGA 640x480x16 grabs

		  - Automatically detects VGA 640x480x16 mode and
		    jumps to appropriate routine.

		  - Works in BIOS or ANY SVGA hardcoded setting.

		* VGAFIL (v2.2) - adds "-H" option for "hex" (ie., 16-color
		  GIF encoding.  No need to rename files to NYBLSCRN.*
		  anymore; now you encode as many as you want in one
		  sitting without getting out of VGAFIL.

		* BUGFIX: Trident 8800/8900 and Zymos routines for fast
		  SVGA grabs were flawed; corrected.


Update v7.1     * BUGFIX: GVGA code was "misplaced"; corrected.

                * BUGFIX: Tseng 4000 was in write bank only; this has been
                  modified for READ and WRITE bank operations.

                * VGAFIL (v2.1) - adds "-C" to configuration option to
                  maintain common interface with MVGAVU and other utils
                  we will release.

Update v7.0     * VGAFIL (v2.0) now supports Targa 16 (uncompressed TGA)
                  format for those who want to edit/modify SVGA screen grabs
                  with XGA, Hercules Graphics Station, Targa and other cards
                  that support 32KB, 64KB, or 1.6MB colors !

                * BUGFIX: When VGAFIL was used in COMMAND LINE mode and the
                  RAW files were not located in the default directory or
                  drive, "0 x 0" images were encoded and subsequent system
                  "hang" resulted.  This has been corrected <whew!>.

                * SVGA 640x480x256 and 800x600x256 hard-coded for DIRECT
                  memory/bank access; captures in about 2-3 seconds (based
                  on SX with 28 ms. hard disk).  The following SVGA chipsets
                  are supported and can be configured with VGAFIL.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

		  did not trigger the right error code (ie., unsupported
		  image dimensions); corrected.


Update v7.6     * BUGFIX: C&T 1024x768x16 and 1024x768x256 bank switching
		  code code got exchanged, thereby messing up each other;
		  corrected.

		* BUGFIX: Video7 1024x768x16 and 1024x768x256 bank switching
		  code code got exchanged, thereby messing up each other;
		  corrected.

Update v7.5     * BUGFIX: Trident SVGA bank routines were still flawed
		  (we tried to accomodate the rare BR version of the
		  TVGA chip), resulting in erroneous bank switching;
		  corrected by restoring the standard 64KB TVGA 8800/8900
		  banking code. <damn those BRs!>

		* Added a new 'Trident' SVGA bank switching mode labelled
		  'Zymos'; this is essentially similar to Trident 8800/8900
		  chipset BUT with similar WRITE/READ bank switching
		  routines.

		* VGAFIL (v2.5) customization menu updated to accomodate
		  'Zymos' setting.

		* BUGFIX: Video7 1024x768x16 grabs required a different
		  bank switching routine; added 16-color bank switching code.

		* BUGFIX: C&T 452/453 1024x768x16 grabs required a different
		  bank switching routine; added 16-color bank switching code.


Update v7.4     * Added FAST SVGA 1024x768x256 capture funtionality.

		* Added FAST SVGA 1024x768x16 capture funtionality.

		* Added FAST SVGA 800x600x16 capture funtionality.

		* BUGFIX: SVGA C&T 452 and 453 bank routines were flawed;
		  corrected.

		* VGAFIL (v2.4) now avoids sign-on screen if REGISTER.OVL
		  is detected and verified; saves you a keystroke.

Update v7.3     * BUGFIX: When VGACAP is loaded and one or more files are
		  saved, subsequent reloading of VGACAP would be accepted
		  (ie., two or more VGACAP resident files would be
		  permitted); corrected.

		* Added Ahead-B chipset support (VGA Wizard).

		* VGAFIL (v2.3) MAJOR BUGFIX: Some combinations of DOS and
		  environment variables resulted in "0" lenght PCX, BMP and
		  TGA files (something to do with too many or conflicting
		  DOS file handles); corrected!

		* VGAFIL (v2.3) FASTER PCX encoding.

Update v7.2     * FAST VGA 640x480x16 grabs

		  - Automatically detects VGA 640x480x16 mode and
		    jumps to appropriate routine.

		  - Works in BIOS or ANY SVGA hardcoded setting.

		* VGAFIL (v2.2) - adds "-H" option for "hex" (ie., 16-color
		  GIF encoding.  No need to rename files to NYBLSCRN.*
		  anymore; now you encode as many as you want in one
		  sitting without getting out of VGAFIL.

		* BUGFIX: Trident 8800/8900 and Zymos routines for fast
		  SVGA grabs were flawed; corrected.


Update v7.1     * BUGFIX: GVGA code was "misplaced"; corrected.

                * BUGFIX: Tseng 4000 was in write bank only; this has been
                  modified for READ and WRITE bank operations.

                * VGAFIL (v2.1) - adds "-C" to configuration option to
                  maintain common interface with MVGAVU and other utils
                  we will release.

Update v7.0     * VGAFIL (v2.0) now supports Targa 16 (uncompressed TGA)
                  format for those who want to edit/modify SVGA screen grabs
                  with XGA, Hercules Graphics Station, Targa and other cards
                  that support 32KB, 64KB, or 1.6MB colors !

                * BUGFIX: When VGAFIL was used in COMMAND LINE mode and the
                  RAW files were not located in the default directory or
                  drive, "0 x 0" images were encoded and subsequent system
                  "hang" resulted.  This has been corrected <whew!>.

                * SVGA 640x480x256 and 800x600x256 hard-coded for DIRECT
                  memory/bank access; captures in about 2-3 seconds (based
                  on SX with 28 ms. hard disk).  The following SVGA chipsets
                  are supported and can be configured with VGAFIL.

                  WD90C10 and WD90C11 chipsets; forces single bank select
                  just in case you capture while viewing with a program that
                  uses the dual bank switching mode or new 800x600x256 mode
                  supported by WD90C11 chip.

                * Genoa GVGA 6100, 6200, 6300, 6400, 6600 chipset support.

                  bank switching mode and adjusts for the weird bank
                  numbering scheme.  Customized for read bank operations.

                * Optional Zymos/Trident TVGA 8900 chipset support using a
                  linear/normalized 64KB bank switching scheme (just in case
                  some chipsets fix/normalize the weird bank numbering
                  scheme).  Customized for read bank operations.

                * New Chips & Technologies support for 452/453 versions.
