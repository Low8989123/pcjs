PC-SIG UPDATES PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM

For Immediate Release


PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM UPDATED TO INCLUDE A NEW USER INTERFACE AND MORE
THAN 800 MB OF PROGRAMS June 21, 1992, SUNNYVALE, CALIF. - PC-SIG, Inc.
today announced availability of The Eleventh Edition of the PC-SIG Library
on CD-ROM.  The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM contains over 800 megabytes of
shareware and includes more than 300 new programs, 550 updated programs,
and the addition of 75 megabytes of Windows 3.x shareware.  The
user-interface has been completely re-engineered to take advantage of the
HyperWriter! hypermedia and multimedia authoring system from NTERGAID, Inc.

The implementation of HyperWriter! provides significant performance and
ease of use enhancements.  Programs can access and download much faster
than with previous editions.  Programs have been reorganized and indexed
for better referencing.  Users just c lick with a mouse, or point with the
cursor, on a program name to see a complete description of the program.
Downloading or copying a program is handled automatically by HyperWriter!
Addition of a preview option is especially important for anyone who uses
images, icons, or fonts.  "You can preview the whole library of images to
find the right one," according to Bruce Kent, product development manager.
"This CD finally makes it possi ble to conserve your disk space and paper,
yet still have all the information you need to make an informed decision,"
said Kent.

All new and updated programs have been reviewed and tested by PC-SIG. Every
program goes through extensive virus checking using the most recent version
of VIRUSCAN from McAfee Associates, and other anti-virus software.
According to Kent, "In the ten ye ars we've distributed shareware, we have
never had a confirmed report of a virus on any of our distributed programs
or CD-ROMs."

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, Eleventh Edition has a list price of $179.

Upgrades from previous editions are available for $99.

Users of PC-SIG's Essential Home & Business Collection CD-ROM can upgrade
for $120.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.


To Order, in the U.S.A.: Call 800-245-6717 and ask Customer Service.

## SILMAR.DOC

{% raw %}
```
Included in this package are three different programs: Silmar (S.EXE),
Dunjax (D.EXE), and Navjet (N.EXE). You must have a VGA graphics card in
order to run them. Complete on-line help is included for each program.
Simply type "S", "D", or "N" to begin.

Silmar is a game in which you guide adventurous heroes through an imposing
series of labryinths. You must seek both treasure and improvement of your
character to reach your goal, the bottom level of the dungeons of Silmar.
Trying to stop you will be the creations of the dungeons-- hideous creatures
of all sorts. These have various powers, all designed to render your character
deceased.

Silmar consists of 3 volumes:

1.  THE DUNGEONS OF SILMAR: (included in this package)
    This is the only volume that is shareware.

2.  AN EVERPRESENT MAGIC:  (not included here)
    Journey to the age of conjuration to rid the land of Thralya of that
    which now holds dominion over it!  This volume has an all-new set of
    spellcasting characters to use. In fact, everything is new: new items,
    monsters, and special encounters!  The action now unfolds in multiple
    settings, as well!

3.  THE FORWARD TERMINUS: (not included here)
    Travel onward to final age of the trilogy! Seek your arch-enemy through
    30 more levels with all-new settings, enemies, items, and encounters to
    discover!  The challenge is heightened as you guide the most powerful
    characters yet against incredibly tough creatures of all races!

Register all three volumes of Silmar for only $12 total by mailing cash

we have completed, for your review.


In Dunjax, you are an astral explorer whose ship has crashed on an
uncharted planet! After awakening from unconsciousness, you have found
your ship pillaged by strange lifeforms. Chiefly missing is a propulsion
device that powers the engines of your ship. Donning your gravity boots
and ion rifle, you have tracked the beings to a cave set into a nearby
mountain range. You must retrieve your stolen part from these fiends to
get off the planet and report your discovery to others!

In Navjet, the dictator of an enemy country has gained possession of nuclear
weapons and is planning to use them against your homeland! You must pilot a
series of attack aircraft against the defenses of his country to find the
warhead-armed missles and destroy them! This is a side-view action game.

Dunjax and Navjet (both included in this package) are part of a series
of 5 VGA games that also includes the following volumes:

DUNJAX II   (not included here)
On a different alien world you must now seek out and destroy cavern-dwelling
creatures who are terrorizing the surface populace with their raids!
Also a side-view action game.

RANADIN  (not included here)
Journey across the four islands of Argentan, exploring their caves and
crumbling castles! You must put an end to their conqueror, the dark
mage, before he leads his forces to victory once again! This is an
overhead-view adventure game.

REQUIEM  (not included here)
Continuing the adventures found in Ranadin, you are now on a new quest to
