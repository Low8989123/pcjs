Add WORDCRUNCHER to the list of high-quality commercial software        
programs now offered as shareware.  WORDCRUNCHER is a full- featured,   
text retrieval program suitable for even the biggest jobs. If you       
have a large body of text, and you want to be able to browse, search,   
and even organize for computer access, consider WordCruncher for the    
job.                                                                    
                                                                        
WORDCRUNCHER comes in two parts: Index and View.  The WORDCRUNCHER      
Index portion takes a standard ASCII text file and indexes it on every  
word.  Indexing on every word means it records where every single       
word in the text occurs.  Once a text file is indexed, the View portion 
lets you specify a single word or combination of words to search for    
in the original text file, and jump directly to every place in the      
text file that the word appears.  View also lets you browse through     
the text or locate other words with new searches.                       
                                                                        
WORDCRUNCHER was originally developed for academic study, but is suited 
to books or manuals whose use can benefit from random searching.  Its   
most obvious use is for electronic versions of technical manuals.  With 
a WORDCRUNCHER version of a manual, users could quickly search and      
locate any word and topic.  Clear text presentation, highlighted search 
hits, and informational headers make text retrieval very manageable,    
without programming.                                                    
                                                                        
WORDCRUNCHER can handle the biggest jobs, and is routinely used         
on CD-ROM-based products.  This is an industrial-strength program.

                          =========================

WCShare is the Shareware version of a robust, mature text retrieval and 
analysis program for the PC: WordCruncher. This program is fully documented 
(See WCMANUAL).  This program is designed for many text retrieval uses, 
especially Electronic Publishing. WordCruncher includes two programs: 

	1)	WCISHARE "indexes" data 
	2)	WCVSHARE retrieves text from DOS text files. 


                         ===========================
                         =  ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING  =
                         ===========================

WCVSHARE allows you to create an electronic book, then bundle a "run-time" 
copy of WCVShare with your text. This is an economical method for distributing
electronic texts which benefit from access by a text retrieval program. A quick 
look at how WordCruncher works and what it does:


                               ==============
                               =  INDEXING  =
                               ==============

	With WCISHARE, each word in a text is catalogued and alphabetically 
sorted into a WordCruncher Index. The location of every occurrence of every 
word becomes a part of the index. The result is a detailed electronic 
"roadmap" of a text that makes possible sophisticated search combinations 
of large documents with amazing speed.

	Existing electronic texts require very little preparation before 
processing with WCISHARE. A simple set of markup codes allow electronic texts 
to be structured in a manner similar to their paper counterparts, e.g. Title, 
Section, Paragraph; Book, Chapter, Verse; Chapter, Page, Paragraph.

	WordCruncher allows indexing of documents in many foreign languages. 
Users are able to define the proper sorting sequence of characters, such as 
umlauts in German, accents in French, the "ch" in Spanish, etc.

                                =============
                                =  VIEWING  =
                                =============

	With WordCruncher's WCView, data can be retrieved according to a set of 
user-defined parameters from large documents. With WCView, you can launch 
searches according to flexible parameters that you define, using:

	+	single words
	+	combinations or lists of words
	+	substrings, such as a suffix or stem
	+	combinations of word lists
	+	boolean operators (and, or, but not) 
	+	proximity (within "n" characters)

	+	Help displays are available throughout.
	+	WordCruncher is fast! Even in very large documents, 
		it generally takes only a second or two to located every 
		reference you're looking for - no matter how obscure - and 
		display it on your computer screen in context.
	+	References can be displayed in windows with as much or as 
		little surrounding text as required. Fill the whole screen 
		with text if necessary, and page forward or backward through 
		the document.


                                  ================
                                  = MANIPULATING =
                                  ================

        The WCVShare version of WordCruncher does not include the cut and paste 
functions available in WCView software. Registered users receive a copy of 
WCView with which they can manipulate the text in any number of ways. Print 
data immediately, save it in a DOS text file, or place it in a temporary file 
such as the WordPerfect Office Clipboard provides. Print or save:

	+	Specific blocks of text.
	+	A list of just the locations of your "hits"
	+	A report containing a certain number of lines of text 
		around your hit, or the complete paragraph or verse.
	+	Book style indexes.
	+	Keyword (KWIC) concordances of words or phrases.


                            ===========================
                            =  HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS  =
                            ===========================

	+	IBM compatible personal computer.
	+	640K of internal RAM 
	+	One 5.25" and/or one 3.5" disk drive.
	+	MS-DOS or PC-DOS Version 2.1 or later.
	+	A hard disk drive with enough space to accomodate your texts.


                   ===========================================
                   = WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY ABOUT WORDCRUNCHER =
                   ===========================================

        "WordCruncher has been developed into one of the most powerful 
analytical tools in a scholar's kitbag ... In fact, businessmen and 
professionals of all kinds are likely to find it an invaluable tool."		

                                           Chicago Sun-Times

        "WordCruncher indexes text files ranging in size from the miniscule 
to the humongous and retrieves data in the twinkling of a cursor."	

                                           PC Magazine

        "WordCruncher performs functions that formerly were possible only 
with mainframe computer programs .. If you need text retrieval software, this 
program is outstanding."				

                                           Byte Magazine


                        =================================
                        = WHO USES WORDCRUNCHER AND HOW =
                        =================================


	A multi-national corporation has accounting offices throughout 
the world. Detailed policies and procedures governing the financial 
adminstration of the company are updated on a regular basis. The corporation 
replaces their old paper manuals with CD-ROMs which include both the indexed 
manuals and WordCruncher.

	A high school teacher in Long Island introduces his students to a new 
way of studying Shakespeare. They "own" words, seeing how the Bard used a 
particular word or image in a specific play, or throughout all his works. The 
end result  -- better papers, excited students, more learning.

	A political science major is comparing the various campaign platforms 
of several democratic contenders for the 1988 Presidential nomination. He 
indexes all their speeches and position papers, then uses WordCruncher to 
compare them on specific issues.

	A scientific society publishes their ten year index using the 
WordCruncher Publishers ToolKit.

	While it may be true that we are living in the Information Age, it is 
equally true that we are more adept at generating information that we are at 
keeping track of it. Business, education, industry and government are now 
distributing information in electronic form that once was delivered on paper. 

	Large texts are like haystacks, and the bits of information you're 
looking for are the proverbial needles hiding somewhere inside. Traditionally, 
finding these needles of information demanded tedious searches through 
incomplete indexes, or frustrating "thumb-searches" though page after page 
of printed matter. 

	Electronic Publishing is a new and rapidly growing industry. 
Johnston & Company has participated in hundreds of electronic publishing 
projects, ranging from the Federal Acquisition Regulations to the 
Riverside Shakespeare.

	Many text retrieval software companies have emerged, and Johnston & 
Company reviews, analyzes, and understands the different programs, 
technologies and approaches. There is no single program which satisfies all 
the needs of the vast array of electronic publishing projects.  

	If you or your company feels that Electronic Publishing may be an 
important part of your future, let us help you initiate your investigation 
into the world of electronic publishing and text retrieval.
