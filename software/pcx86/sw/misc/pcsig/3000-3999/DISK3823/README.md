Periodic Table v2.01 - ReadMe.TXT

This is a maintenance release of Periodic Table.  It has fixed
any known bugs and added a Maximize on Startup menu command.
See the PTOE.WRI files for details.  Please note that this
release is FREE for registered users of Periodic Table 2.0

This version of Periodic Table requires Windows 3.1.  If it is
installed on a Windows 3.0 system, it will not run.

If you received Periodic Table as a ZIP file, and you are using 
360kb disks, please unzip PTDISK1.ZIP and PTDISK2.ZIP to separate
diskettes and label them with the names:

  PERIODIC TABLE INSTALLATION DISK
  PERIODIC TABLE DOCUMENT DISK

respectivly.  If you are unziping the files to a disk format 
greater than 360kb, then you can unzip both files to the same 
diskette.

If you received Periodic Table on diskette, and your disk format 
is greater than 360kb, then you will receive only one diskette 
with all files on it.  The installation will proceed normally 
without asking you to change diskettes.

Insert your Installation Disk in drive A:  Then from the File/Run 
command of either Program Manager or File Manager type:

A:\INSTALL

Then just follow the screen prompts.

Thanks for choosing Periodic Table by SMI Corporation.
