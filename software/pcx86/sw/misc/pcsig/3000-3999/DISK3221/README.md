OsoSoft's Fonter 5.0
=====================

INTRODUCTION
============

Windows 3.x lets you use fonts quickly and easily, both on
the screen and in your printed documents. Using Windows
3.1's TrueType fonts, or fonts automatically scaled by
programs like Adobe Type Manger, Bitstream FaceLift, and
others, you can have access to thousands of typefaces, all
of which will work in any Windows program.

But there's a problem. It's often difficult to choose just
the right font for the job. That's where Fonter comes in. It
lets you view any Windows font on the screen, in several
ways. Even better, Fonter lets you create printed lists of
all your fonts, with a text sample of each font. You can
also print sample sheets showing your font in all of its
variations, and a character set chart which will help you
discover just what characters are in every font.

Windows uses the ANSI character set, which not only includes
normal keyboard characters, but foreign language and
symbolic characters as well. Still, all fonts don't contain
exactly the same characters. You need a way to find out if
the characters you need are in the font you want to use.
Fonter lets you do that quickly.

Finally, dingbat and symbol fonts contain special characters
for enhancing your documents. But they aren't regular
keyboard characters, so it's hard to know what character
you'll get when you press a key. Again, Fonter comes to the
rescue, letting you print sheets showing every special
character, along with the key to press to display that
character.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

Fonter requires a 386SX or better PC, with a minimum of 2 MB
of memory. You'll also need a printer with a Windows driver
that takes full advantage of that printer's capabilities.

LICENSE INFORMATION
===================

This is the shareware version of FONTER. You may use it only 
for a 30-day trial period, to evaluate its usefulness. After 
that time you must register your copy. Registration costs 
just $15, so there's no real reason not to register.

There are three ways to Register:

1. Send a check, or money order, drawn on a US bank, for $15 
to:
OsoSoft
1472 Sixth Street
Los Osos, CA  93402

2. To order with a credit card, call the Public (software) 
Library at (800) 242-4775. Tell them you want to register 
FONTER. A $4 shipping and handling fee will be added if you 
order through this number. NOTE: THIS NUMBER IS FOR ORDERS ONLY!!!

3. After August 1, 1992, you can register on CompuServe. Give 
the command, GO SWREG. The Program name is FONTER. 
Registration fees will be charged to your CIS account.

Registered users will receive the latest Registered Version 
on disk, and will be entitled to full voice and Email support.


SYSTEM LIMITATIONS
==================

Font Scaling Software
Fonter works with TrueType, Adobe Type Manager, Bitstream
Facelift, and SuperPrint 2.0 scalable fonts. Other font-
scaling software is untested.

Drop to DOS
Do not drop to DOS or run a DOS program while Fonter is
minimized! An incompatibility in Microsoft Visual Basic can
cause Windows to become unstable if you do this.

Defective Fonts
Some TrueType and Adobe PostScript fonts have defects. This
can cause Fonter or other Windows software to crash. To spot
these fonts, and if you have problems with Fonter or other
Windows software, view each font in Fonter's window. If you
have a problem, delete that font. For more information, see
the Troubleshooting section at the end of this manual.

INSTALLATION
============

To install Fonter, follow these steps:

1. Create a directory on your hard disk for the Fonter
files, using the DOS CD command or the Windows File Manager.
Example: C:\FONTER

2. Copy all the files from the Fonter distribution disk or
the FONTER.ZIP file into that directory.

NOTE: If you're upgrading an existing version of Fonter,
simply copy all files into your current Fonter directory.
You can skip the remaining steps.

3. Copy the VBRUN100.DLL file from your distribution disk
into your main Windows directory. If you do not have a copy
of this file, which is not shipped with the ZIP version, you
may download VBRUN100.ZIP from the OsoSoft BBS. (805) 528-
3753. This file is the Microsoft Visual Basic runtime
library. You need only one copy of the file for all your
Visual Basic programs, which is why the file is not included
with the .ZIP version of this program.

4. In the Windows Program Manager, click inside the program
group window where you want the Fonter icon. Then click the
File//New command and click OK in the next dialog box.

5. Type in the information for FONTER in the next dialog
box. Include the complete path for the program in the
Command Line field. If you're using Windows 3.1, also type
the path to the Fonter directory in the Working Directory
field. Then, click OK. The Fonter icon will appear in your
selected program group. If you do not see it, scroll the
group window to find the icon, then move it to a new
location.

That completes installation of Fonter.

RUNNING FONTER
==============

To start Fonter, double-click its icon in the Program
Manager. The first time you run the program, it will create
a list of your fonts and save the list in a file. This
process can take a minute or two. You'll see a window
telling you what's going on. On subsequent loading, Fonter
will use its own font list, letting you know if there are
changes in your fonts and offering to create a new list at
your option.

USING FONTER
============

The Fonter Window

Once Fonter starts, you'll see its main window. Along with
the normal Windows menu, at the top left of the screen,
you'll see the Font Sample window, which displays a sample
of the currently-selected font.

To the right, you see the list of all your fonts. Below that
are three buttons, with a list of selected fonts below the
buttons.

To the left of the Selected Fonts window are a number of
option check boxes and other Fonter options.

Viewing a Font Sample

To see a brief alphanumeric sample of any font, just click
on the name of the font in the Main Font List window. Use
the scroll bars on that window to view more font names.

HINT: Click on a font, then type the first letter of your
desired font for faster scrolling.

Selecting a Font

Many Fonter operations use a list of selected fonts, shown
in the Selected Fonts window at the bottom left of the
Fonter window.

To add a font to the Selected Fonts list, double-click on
the desired font name in the Main Font List. Or you can
click the [Add] button to add the currently-highlighted
font.

To delete a selected font from the list, click on the font
name in the Selected fonts window, then click the [Remove]
button.

To clear the selected font list, click the [Clear All]
button.

Updating Your Font List

If you add or delete fonts from Windows, or change printers,
you'll need to update your font list. When you start Fonter,
it checks its own list against the list of actual Windows
fonts. If it finds any discrepancies, it will ask you if you
want to update the list. You should do so. If you want, you
can also update the list with the "Re-list Fonts" command in
the "File" menu.

Setting Font Options

You can alter many aspects of Fonter's display by selecting
a number of options. All options are at the bottom left of
the Fonter Window.

Font Size
To change the size of a font sample, click the arrow on the
Font Size drop-down list, then click the size you want. You
can scroll down the list to see more sizes. The font size
you select will display in the Font Sample Window and will
be the size you see in printed font lists.

You can also type a font size larger than 36 points directly
in the Font Size window. Just click in the window, type the
font size, then press <Enter>.

NOTE: Font lists will print in a maximum size
of 36 points, regardless of the size you enter.

Bold and Italic
To display Bold, Italic, or Bold Italic samples, click the
appropriate check box. These options also function when
printing a font list.

Custom Text
To View specific text in the Font Sample window, type it in
the sample text box at the bottom left of the main screen.
Just click inside the box, then type your text. You can use
the normal <Home> and <End> keys to scroll the text if you
type more than is visible in the box.

Once you type the text, click the Show Custom Sample box.
Your custom text will display in the Font Sample window. If
this box is checked, that text will also appear in the Font
List printouts.

Text Samples
You can also type directly in the Font Sample window. To do
this, click in the window and type away. You can use normal
Windows text selection tools while in this window to delete
existing text. The Cut and Paste tools in the "Edit" menu
also work here, as do all Windows cut and paste shortcut
keys.

Displaying ANSI Codes
You can display ANSI codes for all characters in the Font
Sample window. To do this, give the "Display ANSI Codes"
command in the "Options" Menu. It takes a few moments to
load all the codes, and the Font Sample window will
disappear while the codes are loaded. To view more codes,
use the scroll bar on the window.

NOTE: Each time you change fonts, Fonter has to load all the
characters. For faster access to ANSI Codes see the "Full
Screen" section below.

Selecting a Text Font
Fonter uses Courier as the descriptive text font in
printouts. This is because some fonts don't have the
alphabetical characters needed to print descriptions. To
change this font to one of your choice, first click on the
font name in the Main Font List window, then give the "Make
Current Font the Text Font" command in the "Options" menu.
Your choice will show in the Text Font: line on the screen.


FULL SCREEN DISPLAY
===================

Fonter offers a full screen display of characters for any
font. To view this, click the [Full Screen] button. You'll
see a list of the keyboard characters, with ANSI codes.

Extended ANSI Characters
To view codes for foreign language and symbolic characters,
click the [Extended Characters] button on the full-screen
display.

To return to the normal, keyboard character display, click
the [Normal Character] button.

Zoom
To view an enlarged character set, click the [Zoom] button
on the full-screen display. Character size will double.

To view an even larger sample, highlight a character by
dragging the mouse cursor over it while holding down the
left mouse button. Then click the [Zoom] button. You'll see
a 200 point sample of your character.

To return to the normal full-screen view, click the [Normal
Size] button.

To return to the main Fonter Window, click the [Return]
button in the full-screen display.

As with the sample window, you can use the Full-Screen
display's Edit menu to cut and paste selected characters.
This feature uses the normal Windows Clipboard, so you can
copy a character into the clipboard, then switch to another
application and paste that character into that application.


PRINTING WITH FONTER
====================

While Fonter's on-screen display is useful, the program's
real function is to print out lists and samples of your
fonts. There are a number of ways to print your fonts. All
printing commands are in Fonter's "File" menu.

All Fonter printouts have a 1.25" left margin. If you print
on 3-hole binder paper, it's easy to put your font lists and
samples into a binder for quick reference.

Printer Information

Fonter always prints to the default Windows printer. Once
Fonter is running, you cannot change printers. However, you
can change printers anytime Fonter is not running. Use the
Windows Control Panel and the Printers icon to switch to
another printer. Be sure to make your printer choice the
Default printer by double-clicking on it in Windows 3.1 or
selecting it as the default in Windows 3.0.

NOTE: If you change printers, you'll need to update your
font list inside Fonter. Just click [Yes] when Fonter
proposes a font list update.

Printing Font Lists

List All Fonts
To print a list of all fonts installed in Windows for your
current printer, give the "Print List (All)" command. The
list will contain the name of each font, along with a text
sample for that font. If you have entered custom text and
checked the "Show Custom Sample" box, that text will print
following the font name in the list.

Font lists print in the font size selected in the Font Size
drop-down list. If you've selected a font size larger than
36 points, Fonter will revert to 36 points for the list.
Font lists also use the Bold or Italic attributes you select
with the check boxes at the bottom left of the main Fonter
window.

NOTE: Some internal printer fonts have a fixed size. These
fonts will print in their default size, although they will
display on the screen in other sizes.

NOTE: Printing a complete font list can take several
minutes. Please be patient while printing takes place.

List Some Fonts
To print a list of just the fonts in your Selected Fonts
window, give the "Print List (Selected)" command. This will
print a list of only those fonts in your selected font list.
All comments above apply to this list as well.

Printing Font Samples
Fonter can create two separate font sample sheets. One is a
sheet displaying your selected font in several sizes from 3
to 60 points. This sample also displays Bold, Italic, Bold
Italic and Underlined sample text, plus a complete list of
the font's characters, divided into logical groups. It's a
great way to view any font in a variety of styles.

The second sheet contains an grid-like chart of every
character available in the font. This chart lets you see the
ANSI code for any character at a glance. You'll also see the
normal Windows keyboard character or extended ANSI
character. On symbolic or dingbat fonts, this character is a
reference for which key to push to access any character.

You can print either sheet, or both. Simply check the
appropriate box in the lower left corner of the Fonter Main
window. The "Print Grid" box controls the ANSI grid, while
the "Print Sample" box controls the sample sheet. Be sure to
select the appropriate boxes before printing. The default is
to print both sample sheets.

Single Font Sample
To print samples of the currently-selected font in the Main
Font List window, give the "Print Sample (Current)" command
in the "File" menu.

Multiple Font Samples
To print samples of more than one font, first add the fonts
to the Selected Fonts window, then give the "Print Samples
(Selected) command.

NOTE: You can abort a multiple font sample printing job.
Just click Fonter's [Exit] button with the hourglass cursor.
Fonter will cease printing after finishing with the current
font.


Printing Font Books

Fonter offers a way to automate printing to create font
books, which contain both font lists and font sample sheets.
Fonter first prints a list, as in the Font List commands,
then prints samples for each font.

Sample sheets print in the same way as described above. You
can elect to print one or both of the sample sheets. When
you print a font book, though, the font list size is always
12 points.

NOTE: Printing a font book for all fonts can take as long as
8 hours! Plan to print your font book at night, or when you
don't need your computer or printer.

Aborting Font Book Printing
You can always abort font book printing. Just click Fonter's
[Exit] button with the hourglass pointer. Printing will
cease following the current font.

WARNING: Check your printer's paper capacity. You'll be
printing up to two pages for each font. If your printer
doesn't hold enough paper, the process will abort until you
add paper. If you have too many fonts to print a complete
font book, do this instead:

Print a complete font list, then add fonts to the Selected
Fonts list box as described above. Use the "Print Samples
(Selected)" command to print these in groups small enough
for your printer's paper tray.

DOT MATRIX USERS:  Printing font samples is a very slow
process, so plan accordingly.


Complete Font Book
To print a font book for all fonts installed, give the
"Print Book (All Fonts)" command in the "File Menu".

Partial Font Book
To print a font book of just some fonts, first add the fonts
you want to print to the Selected Fonts list, then give the
"Print Book (Selected)" command. This is a great way to
print custom samples for customers if you're a graphic
designer or print shop.

GETTING HELP
============

Help with Fonter
Fonter offers a help system to answer your questions. To use
this system, give the "Fonter Help" command in the "Help"
menu, or press <F1> at any time.

You'll see a new window on the screen. On the left is a
Topic Index. On the right is the Help information. To view
help on a topic, simply click on that topic in the Topic
Index. To view more topics, use the Topic Index scroll bar.

You can also scroll through the Help information window with
its scroll bar.

Returning to Fonter
Click the [Exit] button or the "Return to Program" command.

About Fonter
To view information about Fonter and to find the OsoSoft
support access numbers, click the "About Fonter" command in
the "Help" menu.

OsoSoft Program Information

OsoSoft offers a number of other programs which may be of
interest to you. To view information on other OsoSoft
products, or to order, give the "OsoSoft Program Info"
command in the "Help" menu.

You'll see an order form for OsoSoft products. To learn more
about any product listed, click the [Info] button next to
that product's listing.

To order, simple type the number of copies for each product
in the box next to that product's name. The rest is

but you can always call and check.

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

Defective Fonts

Some fonts, particularly public domain and shareware fonts
which have been converted from another format, can cause
problems in Windows programs. Fortunately, there's a way to
spot these defective fonts in Fonter. Just follow these
steps:

1. Start Fonter, then give the "Display ANSI Codes" command
in the "Options" menu.

2. Click on each font you have installed, in turn. When you
reach a defective font, Windows will generate an error,
probably a General Protection Fault (GPF). When that
happens, exit Fonter as gracefully as possible, under the
circumstances, then delete that font, using the Windows
Control Panel or your font scaling software's tools.

3. Repeat the process until you see no more problems.

You can also spot defective fonts in a Fonter font list
printout. A bad font will not print, and will corrupt the
printouts for later fonts. Again, the answer is to delete
the offending font. BUT, delete only the first font that
doesn't print properly, then print a new list.

OTHER PROBLEMS
==============

PROBLEM: Fonter just won't run at all.
SOLUTION: Check your installation. Make sure VBRUN100.DLL is
available in the Windows directory.

PROBLEM: Fonter crashes constantly
SOLUTION 1: Check your Windows setup. Disable any programs
running in the background then try again. If it runs
correctly, add the background programs one at a time until
you have a problem.
SOLUTION 2: If you're using a memory manager like QEMM, you
may need to EXCLUDE certain portions of memory. Make a note
of any memory block information you see if you get a General
Protection Fault Error, and use that as a guide to areas to
EXCLUDE.
SOLUTION 3: Make sure your Video and Printer drivers are
current and the correct ones for your version of Windows.
Windows 3.0 drivers will not work reliably in Windows 3.1.
SOLUTION 4: As a last resort, try running Windows with no
addons at all. This may require a fresh installation. If
you're having problems with Windows generally and with other
Windows programs, this is probably your best solution.

PROBLEM: Some fonts do not print in the size I expected.
SOLUTION: Fixed-size internal printer fonts can only print
in their default size, even if they display on the screen in
other sizes.

PROBLEM: In the ZOOM view, some characters are cut off.
SOLUTION: For some very wide characters, Windows cannot
display the entire character correctly. Printing will be
correct.

PROBLEM: In font lists, some text goes right off the edge of
the page.
SOLUTION: Ignore this. Fonter prints as much of its sample
text as it can. You can also create a shorter, custom text
sample for the printout (See above), or choose a smaller
font size.

PROBLEM: I pasted a dingbat symbol into my word processor,
but I didn't see what I expected to.
SOLUTION: The Windows Clipboard only copies the character
code into your other application. You must change fonts
manually in that application to get the correct character.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

                               ===========

                                   by
                             George Campbell

INTRODUCTION
============

When working with Windows 3.x software, it's often easiest to 
standardize on .BMP files for your clip art needs.  Every Windows 
program can handle these images, and most paint programs, including 
Windows PaintBrush, included with Windows 3.0, can produce and edit 
these files.

Unfortunately, it's been impossible to view these files quickly or 
to print a catalog of your clip art images.  Until WinClip, that 
is.

WinClip allows you to view your .BMP files on screen, and then 
print a catalog of all your files, or just the ones you select.  
You can even delete a file you no longer want. WinClip is so easy 
to use that you may not need any documentation at all.  It uses 
the standard Windows 3.0 conventions, relying on buttons 
primarily, rather than menu commands.

As an additional feature, WinClip allows you to edit your images, 
using Windows PaintBrush or any other paint program you choose.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS 
===================

WinClip requires Windows 3.0, running in Standard or Enhanced mode, 
a hard disk and a mouse. 2 MB of RAM is needed. To edit images, 
you'll also need Windows PaintBrush or another program which can 
edit .BMP files.

WinClip supports all HP LaserJet compatible printers, with a 
minimum of 1.5 MB of ram. It does NOT support PostScript devices.  
Dot matrix support will depend on the individual printer, and has 
not been tested.

LICENSE INFORMATION
===================

WinClip is a shareware program. If you use it past a reasonable 
(30 day) trial period, you must register your copy. Registration 
costs just $15, and entitles you to the latest version of the 
program, which will be mailed to you once your registration 
arrives. You'll also be entitled to telephone, mail and E-mail 
support for the program as well. I'll also let you know about 
other valuable Windows programs which are available from me at 
low cost.

There are three ways to register this program:

1. Send a check or money order for the registration fee, written 
on a U.S. bank and made payable to:

OsoSoft
1472 Sixth Street
Los Osos, CA  93402

2. If you use CompuServe, you can register online. Log on to CIS 
and give the command "GO SWREG." Use the CompuServe menus to 
locate and register the program by name. CompuServe will bill 
your account for the amount of the registration fee, and I'll 
ship the program to you immediately.

3. If you prefer to order by MasterCard, Visa, American Express, 
or Discover card, contact Public (software) Library. You may call 
(800) 242-4775 or (713) 524-6394 for voice registration. Or FAX 
your order to (713) 524-6398. Or send an Email message on 
CompuServe at 71355,470. For FAX or Email orders, remember to 
include the name of the program, your credit card number, and 
expiration date. NOTE: THIS SERVICE IS FOR ORDERS ONLY. DO NOT 
CALL PsL FOR INFORMATION OR SUPPORT. Credit card orders include a 
$4 charge for shipping and handling.

All orders will be shipped within one week.

You may contact me at that address or at my CompuServe address: 
71571,222

Please do not call me by telephone. Support is only available for 
registered users.


INSTALLING WINCLIP
==================

WinClip was written in Microsoft Visual Basic 1.0. All Visual Basic 
programs require a run-time library, VBRUN100.DLL, which must be 
located in your Windows main directory. If you use other Visual 
Basic programs, VBRUN100.DLL will already be installed.  If not, 
you'll have to download a copy. It's available on CompuServe in the 
WINNEW forum, and in the MSBASIC forum. Look for the file 
VBRUN.ZIP. You'll also find this file on most major BBS service, or 
you can download it from my BBS, as VBRUN100.ZIP. Call (805) 
528-3753. You may download on the first call.

To install WinClip, first create a directory for the program (e.g. 
C:\WINCLIP\) using the DOS MakeDir (MD) command. You can also 
install the program in any other directory you wish.  Next, copy 
all WinClip files into that directory.

Now, start the Windows Program Manager and click on the program 
group where you want to place the WinClip icon.  Next, click on the 
File menu in Program Manager, then click on New. Click OK in the 
next dialog box, then type WinClip in the first line of the next 
dialog box.  Press <Tab> and type the whole path and filename for 
Winclip in the next line.  (e.g.: C:\WINCLIP\WINCLIP.EXE).  Click 
OK.

The WinClip icon will appear in the program group which was current 
when you added the new icon.  You may have to scroll the program 
group window to find the icon, but then you can drag it wherever 
you like.

That's it.
 
RUNNING WINCLIP
===============

To start WinClip, just double-click on the WinClip icon.  After a 
brief delay, you'll see the program's screen.

Menu Commands
=============

On the top line are three menu entries: File, Set Paint Program, 
and About.

The File menu contains just one option: Exit.  Click this command 
will exit WinClip, after asking for confirmation.

The Delete Current File will delete the current file selected in 
the main file list. You'll have an opportunity to abort the 
process. Note that unless you are in the main file list, this 
option will be grayed-out.

The Set Paint Program item opens a dialog box where you can input 
the file specifications for your favorite paint program. The 
default editor is Windows PaintBrush, which works very well for 
this purpose.  If you choose, however, you may enter the file 
specification for another program, such as Publisher's Paintbrush 
from Zsoft.  Your entry should include the complete path to the 
program.  (e.g.: D:\PP\PPAINT.EXE). Substitute your own 
information.  HINT: Use the Program Manager's File/Properties 
command to view the path information for your favorite paint 
program.

The About menu offers registration information for WinClip.


The WinClip Screen
==================

Once you start WinClip, you'll see the program's main screen.  On 
the left side are a group of boxes and buttons. You'll find a Drive 
box, a Directory box, a Filename box and a List box for selected 
files.

To change drives, click the arrow next to the Drive box, then click 
on the drive where your .BMP files are stored. Select a directory 
or subdirectory by double-clicking on the appropriate directory in 
the Directory box. Your .BMP files will appear in the Filename Box, 
just to the right of the Directory box. You'll also see a count of 
the total number of files in that directory.

Click once on any filename to view your image, which will appear to 
the right of the filename box.  Just above the image, you'll see 
the image size, in pixels. Use the scroll bar to view files which 
are not immediately visible.

NOTE: Images too large to display on the screen will be cropped at 
the edge of the WinClip window.

At this point, you can print the current image by clicking on the 
[Print Image] button. Your image will print, along with the 
filename, in it's actual size for your printer.  If you want to 
edit the image, click the [Edit Image] button. This will start 
either Windows PaintBrush or your choice of other paint programs.  
Your image will load automatically. 

HINT: Once you finish editing your image, save the changes and exit 
the paint program. Click on the filename again to view your changes 
on the WinClip screen.

Printing Multiple Files
=======================

Click the [Print All Files]] button to print all images in the 
Filename box. You'll see a confirmation box, then your files will 
print, with their filenames, on your laser printer. A 1.5" margin 
on the left of the page allows for three-hole punching for easy 
storage.  The right margin may be as little as .25"

PRINTING SPEED: If you print many images, printing may take as many 
as 5 minutes to complete. It takes time to compose the pages, and 
Windows just isn't a printing speed demon.  Please be patient.

As printing proceeds, you'll see each image appear, in order on the 
WinClip screen, along with the image's size. WinClip handles 
pagination, creating as many pages as needed to print all the 
files.

Printing Selected Files
=======================

If you want to print just some of your files, you can add them to 
the Selected files box.  To add a file, click on its name in the 
Filename box, then click the [Add] button.  Or you simply 
double-click on a filename in the Filename box. If you want to 
add all the files in the Filename box, click the [Add All] button.

To remove a file from the Selected files box, click on the filename 
in the Selected files box, then click the [Remove] button.  The 
[Remove All] button will remove all files displayed in the Selected 
files box.

REMEMBER: Once you add files to the Selected files box, you can 
change directories to other directories containing .BMP files, then 
add those files as well to the Selected files box. This feature 
allows you to print files in more than one directory as part of 
your catalog. Directory names appear in the printout above the 
first file in a new directory.

As with the Filename box, you can click on any filename to view the 
image on the screen.

To print your complete list of selected images, just click the 
[Print Images Below] button. You'll be asked to confirm, then 
printing will begin. As before, you can cancel printing by pressing 
the [Cancel Print] button.

To cancel printing, click the [Cancel Print] button which appears 
whenever you print multiple files.  Printing will cease after the 
next image goes to the printer, but your printed pages will still 
emerge from the printer.

OTHER WINDOWS PROGRAMS
======================

Fonter 4.1

This program allows you to view and print all your Windows 3.0 
fonts. You can print font lists, with samples, or character set 
charts showing all the available characters for any font, with text 
samples. On-screen, you can view individual font samples or a full 
screen display of characters, with two zoom levels. You can even 
cut and paste from Fonter to other Windows software, making the job 
of choosing special characters a breeze.

Fonter has the same requirements as WinClip, but works with 
PostScript printers too. Full ATM, FaceLift, and Publisher's 
Powerpak Support.

REGISTRATION FEE: $15
AVAILABLE ON: Compuserve in WINADV as FNTER4.ZIP or on my BBS as

to disk, or print either a 200%-sized copy for your print shop or 
sheets of cards, ready-to-cut into instant business cards. If you 
ever need business cards, you need a copy of Rockford! Requirements 
are the same as WinClip.  No PostScript support, but Rockford! 
works with ATM, FaceLift, or Publisher's PowerPak.
