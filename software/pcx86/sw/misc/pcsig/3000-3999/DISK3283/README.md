Disk No: 567A&B          TITLE: SOFTWARE JUKEBOX
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      The Software Jukebox is the latest innovation in Software
      marketing.  It turns the PC into a Software vending machine that
      holds up to 200 of the most popular software disks.  The PC
      becomes a very colorful, attention getting, advertising tool
      while just sitting on the dealer's counter.  Despensing of the
      is easy and convenient.  The total involement by the dealer is
      collecting the copying charges after the customer is finished
      copying all the disks that they require.  The copying total is
      automatically tabulated on a totalizer built into the machine.
