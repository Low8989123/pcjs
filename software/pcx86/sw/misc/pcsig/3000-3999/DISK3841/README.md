implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

            Overview








            Introduction
                                Long ago, in the era of dot-matrix
                                printers, it was easy to print the
                                directory list of a floppy disk on an
                                adhesive label.  Now the text may not
                                always have been legible (especially if
                                you had a 9-pin printer, but it worked,
                                and it was easier than popping the disk
                                into the drive and using DOS to get a
                                directory of the files. But if you have
                                a laser printer, well, that changes
                                everything.  All of a sudden, that great
                                old labeling program no longer works
                                because it was designed to print labels
                                one at a time -- or to be more accurate,
                                one line at a time; and as we all know,
                                laser printers print one page at a time.
                                So began the quest (and as any Monty
                                Python fan clearly knows, the Quest is
                                the Quest) for laser printer disk labels
                                and a program that would make use of
                                them.  The first part was easy -- a trip
                                to the local business/office supply
                                store turned up a vast supply of Avery
                                5196 label stock; and though a box of
                                these labels carried a hefty price tag
                                (approximately $35), the final cost of
                                5.5-cents per label didn't seem like
                                such a big expense in the long run.
                                The second half of the Quest was a bit
                                more difficult.  After looking high and
                                low, under rocks and in trees, on
                                bulletin board systems from one end of
                                the country to the next, and even on a
                                couple of commercial on-line services,
                                things were looking pretty grim.
                                I couldn't find a program to do what I
                                needed, so in the true spirit of a
                                determined wonk (and entrepreneur), I
                                set about to create the very tool that
                                seemed so elusive, and Laser LabelMate
                                was born.

                                however, Laser LabelMate is coded to
                                look for the Help file in the \WINDOWS
                                directory.
                                The THREED.VBX file should be placed in
                                the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory, though
                                you can keep it with the executable if
                                you prefer.  Placing this (and any other
                                .VBX controls you may have) in your
                                \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory makes them
                                available to any Visual Basic program,
                                and reduces the chance of you having
                                more than one copy of these custom
                                controls on your disk drive.

                                System requirements

                                Laser LabelMate requires a SVGA card
                                capable of 800-by-600 resolution, and
                                displaying a minimum of 16 colors
                                (though a 256-color display will make
                                the splash screen look a whole lot
                                nicer).
                                Laser LabelMate can be run from a floppy
                                or hard drive; it's footprint is only as
                                much as the executable, Help file,
                                custom control,custom controlcustom
                                control: THREED.VBX and .DLL require --
                                about one megabyte.
                                While Laser LabelMate is designed to use
                                a laser printer, it should work on any
                                dot matrix printer that has the ability
                                to feed single sheets.  Laser LabelMate
                                has been tested on the HP LaserJet IV
                                and Panasonic KX-P4410 printers, but
                                should work on any laser printer with a
                                Windows driver.
                                Laser LabelMate was designed to use
                                Avery 5196 label sheets. These sheets
                                contain nine 2.75"-square disk labels,
                                and 12 divider tab labels; all of which
                                can be used by the program.






                                Your first sheet




                                Going from soft to hard-copy


                                Hopefully, by, now, I've lost you;
                                rather, hopefully, you'll not need to
                                read these pages. Laser LabelMate was
                                designed to be fairly intuitive.  But
                                just in case you're a masochist, or the
                                type who likes to read manuals, here
                                goes.

                                The main form



                                The Laser LabelMate form resembles the
                                Avery 5196 sheet.  You'll see nine
                                square boxes with rounded corners (one
                                for each disk label), and below them, 12
                                smaller rectangles (also with rounded
                                corners) for the divider tab labels.
                                Along the bottom of the form are four
                                command buttons which will be explained
                                shortly.
                                To prepare a label for printing, double-
                                click on the desired disk or divider tab
                                label box on the main form.  You needn't
                                worry about starting with the first
                                label in the upper left-hand corner;
                                Laser LabelMate is designed to print on
                                the labels you want it to use, so no
                                labels get wasted.  If you want to start
                                dead in the middle, then go ahead; and
                                if you're really a free spirit and get
                                into random or geometric patterns,
                                double-click in the order you like and
                                get wild; Laser LabelMate doesn't care.
                                In fact, if you mess up, and prepare a
                                label for a disk you don't really want
                                to label or misspell that tab, then just
                                double-click on that label again, and
                                you can correct your mistake.






                                Selecting a drive



                                After double clicking on the drive label
                                square or selecting the label from the
                                Disk Label menu, the drive selection
                                windowdrive selection window will pop up
                                over the main form.  There are two
                                buttons on the top of this window for
                                choosing a drive to take a directory
                                from; click on one of these buttons and
                                the file list box will appear with the
                                contents of the disk's files.  (Note:
                                Subdirectories will not appear in the
                                file list box, nor will they appear on
                                any label printed out by Laser
                                LabelMate.  Sorry for the
                                inconvenience...)
                                If you have chosen the wrong drive or
                                disk, just click on the drive button
                                again and Laser LabelMate will poll the
                                new disk or drive. Once you're
                                satisfied with the directory list,
                                click on the "OK" button and Laser
                                LabelMate will pop up a dialog box
                                prompting you for the Volume
                                Label.volume label  You may enter a
                                string of up to 50 characters to
                                describe the disk.  This string will be
                                printed on the label, and positioned so
                                that it will rest on the top narrow
                                edge of the disk.
                                After entering a Volume Label, press
                                [ENTER] and you'll be back at the main
                                form ready to prepare the next disk
                                label.  The label square you just
                                prepared will now contain a drawing of a
                                floppy disk, with your Volume Label
                                printed on it's disk label (Note:  Your
                                finished label will not resemble the one
                                pictured on the form.).  When all nine
                                disks appear, you're ready to print your
                                label sheet -- though you can print the
                                sheet even if you haven't prepared any
                                of the labels, but what good would that
                                be?






                                Divider Tabs

                                The 12 small labels at the bottom of the
                                Avery sheet are used for labeling
                                dividers in a disk box.  Laser LabelMate
                                will allow you to print a string of up
                                to 12 characters on these small labels.
                                To prepare a divider tab label,divider
                                tab label double-click on it, or use the
                                Tabs menu to select the appropriate
                                label (Note: the Tabs menu uses
                                hexadecimal numbering to specify tab
                                numbers; therefore tab 10 is represented
                                in the menu as Tab A, tab 11 is Tab B,
                                and tab 12 is Tab C.).  A small dialogue
                                box (similar to the one used for
                                assigning Volume labels) will pop up
                                over the main form.  Enter the desired
                                text string and press [ENTER].  The text
                                string you just entered will appear on
                                it's label in the main form.

                                Printing your labels

                                Now that you have prepared all the
                                labels you want, printing is the next
                                step; and it's just as easy as preparing
                                your label sheet.  To print out your
                                disk labels, load the Avery sheet into
                                your printer'sprinterprinter: laser

                                (or put it in the manual feed) and click
                                on the [PRINT LABELS] button at the
                                bottom of the main form, select the
                                Print option from the File menu, or
                                press the [CTRL-P] key combination.
                                Laser LabelMate will send the text of
                                your label sheet out to your printer,
                                and using the default printer font, will
                                print disk labeldisk label text in all
                                caps using 6-point type; divider tab

                                out more copies of the same sheet (just
                                click on the Print button again to print
                                another sheet).  To clear the current

                                [CTRL-C] key combination; the main form
                                will clear and you will be ready to
                                begin another label sheet.

                                Finished?  So soon?  Well, if you insist
                                on going, you have three ways out.  The
                                first is to click on the Exit button at
                                the bottom of the main form; the second
                                is to use the [CRTL-X] key combination;
                                and the third, as with any other Windows
                                application, is to press the [ALT-F4]
                                key combination.

                                from memory, giving you a fresh set of
                                labels and divider tabs to work with.
                                While you can change the contents of any
                                one label by doubleclicking on it and
                                going through the process of providing
                                the necessary information again, using
                                this option allows you to clear the

                                also be accessed by pressing the New
                                Sheet button at the bottom of the main

                                If your label sheet is at a point where
                                you are ready to turn it into hard copy,
                                choosing the Print option will send the
                                contents of the sheet to the printer.
                                Since the sheet is not cleared after
                                printing, you can use this option again
                                to print multiple copies of your label
                                sheet.  This option can also be accessed
                                by pressing the Print Labels button at
                                the bottom of the main form.

                                select the wrong disk label, or
                                accidentally poll the same disk twice,
                                you can choose the menu option or

                                through six on the second row, and

                                represents a fair price for a utility of

                                Technical Support

                                Laser LabelMate was designed to be easy-
                                to-use and fairly self-explanatory.  It
                                has been tested on an HP LaserJet IV and
                                on a Panasonic KX-P4410 laser printer.
                                No guarantees of operation can be made
                                on any other model printer, though the
                                software should operate without any
                                problem on most printers (laser and non-
                                laser types) as it does not use any
                                specialized fonts or printing
                                techniques.
                                However, if you find you need technical
                                support, the author (me) can be reached
                                via the following:

                                software, as well as copies of your

                                what actions prompted the error, and
                                indicate whether or not you were able to
                                reproduce the error.

                                the post office can deliver...
                                One of the benefits of shareware is the

            Overview








            Introduction
                                Long ago, in the era of dot-matrix
                                printers, it was easy to print the
                                directory list of a floppy disk on an
                                adhesive label.  Now the text may not
                                always have been legible (especially if
                                you had a 9-pin printer, but it worked,
                                and it was easier than popping the disk
                                into the drive and using DOS to get a
                                directory of the files. But if you have
                                a laser printer, well, that changes
                                everything.  All of a sudden, that great
                                old labeling program no longer works
                                because it was designed to print labels
                                one at a time -- or to be more accurate,
                                one line at a time; and as we all know,
                                laser printers print one page at a time.
                                So began the quest (and as any Monty
                                Python fan clearly knows, the Quest is
                                the Quest) for laser printer disk labels
                                and a program that would make use of
                                them.  The first part was easy -- a trip
                                to the local business/office supply
                                store turned up a vast supply of Avery
                                5196 label stock; and though a box of
                                these labels carried a hefty price tag
                                (approximately $35), the final cost of
                                5.5-cents per label didn't seem like
                                such a big expense in the long run.
                                The second half of the Quest was a bit
                                more difficult.  After looking high and
                                low, under rocks and in trees, on
                                bulletin board systems from one end of
                                the country to the next, and even on a
                                couple of commercial on-line services,
                                things were looking pretty grim.
                                I couldn't find a program to do what I
                                needed, so in the true spirit of a
                                determined wonk (and entrepreneur), I
                                set about to create the very tool that
                                seemed so elusive, and Laser LabelMate
                                was born.

                                the program, you will need to unZIP the

                                For the most part, you can put the

                                I recommend the \WINDOWS directory);

                                look for the Help file in the \WINDOWS
                                directory.
                                The THREED.VBX file should be placed in
                                the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory, though
                                you can keep it with the executable if
                                you prefer.  Placing this (and any other
                                .VBX controls you may have) in your
                                \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory makes them
                                available to any Visual Basic program,
                                and reduces the chance of you having
                                more than one copy of these custom
                                controls on your disk drive.

                                System requirements

                                Laser LabelMate requires a SVGA card
                                capable of 800-by-600 resolution, and
                                displaying a minimum of 16 colors
                                (though a 256-color display will make
                                the splash screen look a whole lot
                                nicer).
                                Laser LabelMate can be run from a floppy
                                or hard drive; it's footprint is only as
                                much as the executable, Help file,
                                custom control,custom controlcustom
                                control: THREED.VBX and .DLL require --
                                about one megabyte.
                                While Laser LabelMate is designed to use
                                a laser printer, it should work on any
                                dot matrix printer that has the ability
                                to feed single sheets.  Laser LabelMate
                                has been tested on the HP LaserJet IV
                                and Panasonic KX-P4410 printers, but
                                should work on any laser printer with a
                                Windows driver.
                                Laser LabelMate was designed to use
                                Avery 5196 label sheets. These sheets
                                contain nine 2.75"-square disk labels,
                                and 12 divider tab labels; all of which
                                can be used by the program.






                                Your first sheet




                                Going from soft to hard-copy


                                Hopefully, by, now, I've lost you;
                                rather, hopefully, you'll not need to
                                read these pages. Laser LabelMate was
                                designed to be fairly intuitive.  But
                                just in case you're a masochist, or the
                                type who likes to read manuals, here
                                goes.

                                The main form



                                The Laser LabelMate form resembles the
                                Avery 5196 sheet.  You'll see nine
                                square boxes with rounded corners (one
                                for each disk label), and below them, 12
                                smaller rectangles (also with rounded
                                corners) for the divider tab labels.
                                Along the bottom of the form are four
                                command buttons which will be explained
                                shortly.
                                To prepare a label for printing, double-
                                click on the desired disk or divider tab
                                label box on the main form.  You needn't
                                worry about starting with the first
                                label in the upper left-hand corner;
                                Laser LabelMate is designed to print on
                                the labels you want it to use, so no
                                labels get wasted.  If you want to start
                                dead in the middle, then go ahead; and
                                if you're really a free spirit and get
                                into random or geometric patterns,
                                double-click in the order you like and
                                get wild; Laser LabelMate doesn't care.
                                In fact, if you mess up, and prepare a
                                label for a disk you don't really want
                                to label or misspell that tab, then just
                                double-click on that label again, and
                                you can correct your mistake.






                                Selecting a drive



                                After double clicking on the drive label
                                square or selecting the label from the
                                Disk Label menu, the drive selection
                                windowdrive selection window will pop up
                                over the main form.  There are two
                                buttons on the top of this window for
                                choosing a drive to take a directory
                                from; click on one of these buttons and
                                the file list box will appear with the
                                contents of the disk's files.  (Note:
                                Subdirectories will not appear in the
                                file list box, nor will they appear on
                                any label printed out by Laser
                                LabelMate.  Sorry for the
                                inconvenience...)
                                If you have chosen the wrong drive or
                                disk, just click on the drive button
                                again and Laser LabelMate will poll the
                                new disk or drive. Once you're
                                satisfied with the directory list,
                                click on the "OK" button and Laser
                                LabelMate will pop up a dialog box
                                prompting you for the Volume
                                Label.volume label  You may enter a
                                string of up to 50 characters to
                                describe the disk.  This string will be
                                printed on the label, and positioned so
                                that it will rest on the top narrow
                                edge of the disk.
                                After entering a Volume Label, press
                                [ENTER] and you'll be back at the main
                                form ready to prepare the next disk
                                label.  The label square you just
                                prepared will now contain a drawing of a
                                floppy disk, with your Volume Label
                                printed on it's disk label (Note:  Your
                                finished label will not resemble the one
                                pictured on the form.).  When all nine
                                disks appear, you're ready to print your
                                label sheet -- though you can print the
                                sheet even if you haven't prepared any
                                of the labels, but what good would that
                                be?






                                Divider Tabs

                                The 12 small labels at the bottom of the
                                Avery sheet are used for labeling
                                dividers in a disk box.  Laser LabelMate
                                will allow you to print a string of up
                                to 12 characters on these small labels.
                                To prepare a divider tab label,divider
                                tab label double-click on it, or use the
                                Tabs menu to select the appropriate
                                label (Note: the Tabs menu uses
                                hexadecimal numbering to specify tab
                                numbers; therefore tab 10 is represented
                                in the menu as Tab A, tab 11 is Tab B,
                                and tab 12 is Tab C.).  A small dialogue
                                box (similar to the one used for
                                assigning Volume labels) will pop up
                                over the main form.  Enter the desired
                                text string and press [ENTER].  The text
                                string you just entered will appear on
                                it's label in the main form.

                                Printing your labels

                                Now that you have prepared all the
                                labels you want, printing is the next
                                step; and it's just as easy as preparing
                                your label sheet.  To print out your
                                disk labels, load the Avery sheet into
                                your printer'sprinterprinter: laser

                                on the [PRINT LABELS] button at the
                                bottom of the main form, select the
                                Print option from the File menu, or
                                press the [CTRL-P] key combination.
                                Laser LabelMate will send the text of
                                your label sheet out to your printer,
                                and using the default printer font, will

                                out more copies of the same sheet (just
                                click on the Print button again to print
                                another sheet).  To clear the current

                                [CTRL-C] key combination; the main form
                                will clear and you will be ready to
                                begin another label sheet.

                                Finished?  So soon?  Well, if you insist
                                on going, you have three ways out.  The
                                first is to click on the Exit button at
                                the bottom of the main form; the second
                                is to use the [CRTL-X] key combination;
                                and the third, as with any other Windows
                                application, is to press the [ALT-F4]
                                key combination.

                                from memory, giving you a fresh set of
                                labels and divider tabs to work with.
                                While you can change the contents of any
                                one label by doubleclicking on it and
                                going through the process of providing
                                the necessary information again, using

                                If your label sheet is at a point where
                                you are ready to turn it into hard copy,
                                choosing the Print option will send the
                                contents of the sheet to the printer.
                                Since the sheet is not cleared after
                                printing, you can use this option again
                                to print multiple copies of your label
                                sheet.  This option can also be accessed
                                by pressing the Print Labels button at
                                the bottom of the main form.

                                select the wrong disk label, or
                                accidentally poll the same disk twice,
                                you can choose the menu option or
                                double-click on the label square and

                                through six on the second row, and

                                represents a fair price for a utility of

                                Technical Support

                                Laser LabelMate was designed to be easy-
                                to-use and fairly self-explanatory.  It
                                has been tested on an HP LaserJet IV and
                                on a Panasonic KX-P4410 laser printer.
                                No guarantees of operation can be made
                                on any other model printer, though the
                                software should operate without any
                                problem on most printers (laser and non-
                                laser types) as it does not use any
                                specialized fonts or printing
                                techniques.
                                However, if you find you need technical
                                support, the author (me) can be reached
                                via the following:

                                software, as well as copies of your

                                One of the benefits of shareware is the

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Outside the U.S.A.: Call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer near
you.

Thank you for trying Laser LabelMate, the 3╜" disk labeling program for Windows
and laser printers.  If you like Laser LabelMate, and find it useful, you are
asked to register the program.  Resigstration is $20.  For further details on
registering Laser LabelMate, choose REGISTRATION from the program's HELP menu.


What's in this package?
-----------------------

The LABLMATE.ZIP archive contains the following files:

	* LABLMATE.DOC	Documentation file (Word for Windows 2.0 format)
	* LABLMATE.EXE	Laser LabelMate executable
	* LABLMATE.HLP	Help file for use with Windows Help viewer
	* LABLMATE.TXT	Documentation file (in ASCII text format)
	* THREED.VBX	Custom control file
	* README.1ST	This file
	* FILE_ID.DIZ	Archive description file (for BBS use)

   Not included in the LABLMATE.ZIP archive, is VBRUN200.DLL.  This is the
dynamic link library used by any program written in Visual Basic 2.0 for Windows;
but don't worry, you've either already got it in your \WINDOWS\SYSTEM
directory, or can find it on the system where you downloaded this program.
Where does the furniture go?
   For the most part, you can put the executable anywhere you want to (though I
recommend the \WINDOWS directory); however, Laser LabelMate is coded to
look for the Help file in the \WINDOWS directory.
   The THREED.VBX file should be placed in the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory,
though you can keep it with the executable if you prefer.  Placing this (and any
other .VBX controls you may have) in your \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory
makes them available to any Visual Basic program, and reduces the chance of you
having more than one copy of these custom controls on your disk drive.

System requirements
-------------------

   Laser LabelMate requires a SVGA card capable of 800-by-600 resolution, and
displaying a minimum of 16 colors (though a 256-color display will make the
splash screen look a whole lot nicer).  It can be run from a floppy or hard drive.
   While Laser LabelMate is designed to use a laser printer, it should work on any dot
matrix printer that has the ability to feed single sheets.  Laser LabelMate has been
tested on the HP LaserJet IV and Panasonic KX-P4410 printers, but should work on
any laser printer with a Windows driver.
   Laser LabelMate was designed to use Avery 5196 label sheets.  These sheets
contain nine 2.75"-square disk labels, and 12 divider tab labels; all of which can be
used by the program.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
