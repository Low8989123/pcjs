PC-SIG UPDATES PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM

For Immediate Release


PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM UPDATED TO INCLUDE A NEW USER INTERFACE AND MORE
THAN 800 MB OF PROGRAMS June 21, 1992, SUNNYVALE, CALIF. - PC-SIG, Inc.
today announced availability of The Eleventh Edition of the PC-SIG Library
on CD-ROM.  The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM contains over 800 megabytes of
shareware and includes more than 300 new programs, 550 updated programs,
and the addition of 75 megabytes of Windows 3.x shareware.  The
user-interface has been completely re-engineered to take advantage of the
HyperWriter! hypermedia and multimedia authoring system from NTERGAID, Inc.

The implementation of HyperWriter! provides significant performance and
ease of use enhancements.  Programs can access and download much faster
than with previous editions.  Programs have been reorganized and indexed
for better referencing.  Users just c lick with a mouse, or point with the
cursor, on a program name to see a complete description of the program.
Downloading or copying a program is handled automatically by HyperWriter!
Addition of a preview option is especially important for anyone who uses
images, icons, or fonts.  "You can preview the whole library of images to
find the right one," according to Bruce Kent, product development manager.
"This CD finally makes it possi ble to conserve your disk space and paper,
yet still have all the information you need to make an informed decision,"
said Kent.

All new and updated programs have been reviewed and tested by PC-SIG. Every
program goes through extensive virus checking using the most recent version
of VIRUSCAN from McAfee Associates, and other anti-virus software.
According to Kent, "In the ten ye ars we've distributed shareware, we have
never had a confirmed report of a virus on any of our distributed programs
or CD-ROMs."

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, Eleventh Edition has a list price of $179.

Upgrades from previous editions are available for $99.

Users of PC-SIG's Essential Home & Business Collection CD-ROM can upgrade
for $120.

PC-SIG CD-ROMs are distributed worldwide through a network of distributors
and resellers. Based in Sunnyvale, Calif., PC-SIG, Inc. markets and
supports one of the world's largest collections of shareware for IBM PCs
and compatible systems.  PC-SIG also publishes Shareware Magazine, which is
devoted solely to shareware.  The magazine is availa ble by subscription
and on newsstands nationwide.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K memory, DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions, and a hard drive. Microsoft compatible

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Outside the U.S.A. call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer in

                          Last updated:  June 1992

This file provides information for Shareware Distributors, Disk Vendors,
Computer Clubs, Users Groups and BBS Sysops who wish to distribute the
subject software package.

Individual and Company Users:  Please refer to RECAINFO.DOC for
information.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
====================
RECAP:  Author, Rosemary West (ASP); Registration $15.00

REQUIREMENTS:  DOS 2.1; 512K RAM; compatible data files

VERSION:  2.4

BBS FILENAME:  RECA24.???

LONG DESCRIPTION: RECAP corrects capitalization in data files. It can be
very frustrating to find that some of your database records have been
entered in all caps when you didn't want them that way, or that some have
not been entered in all caps when you did want them that way! RECAP will go
through any dBase III-compatible database file and make the desired
adjustment.

ONE-LINE DESCRIPTION: Corrects capitalization in dBase compatible data
files.

DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS:
==========================
Individuals who wish to distribute the software package to friends or
associates may do so in accordance with the restrictions outlined in the
"License" section of RECAINFO.DOC.

Vendors, Distributors, Computer Clubs, User Groups and BBS Sysops, wishing
to add the software package to their disk library may do so in accordance
with the "Limited Distribution License" below.

Limited Distribution License:
-----------------------------
As the exclusive copyright holder for this software, Rosemary K. West dba
R.K. West Consulting authorizes distribution only in accordance with the
following restrictions.

Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP) Approved Vendors and BBSs in
good standing are hereby given permission to distribute the software
package, as are BBSs which do not charge a fee for downloading files.
Non-ASP vendors or BBSs which charge a download fee MUST REQUEST AND
RECEIVE PERMISSION prior to distributing this package.

The software package is defined as containing all the material listed in
the PACKING.LST text file. The software package, including all related
program files and documentation files, CANNOT be modified in any way and
must be distributed as a complete package, without exception. If any files
listed in the PACKING.LST text file, or the PACKING.LST file itself, are
missing, then the package is not complete and distribution is forbidden.
Please contact us to obtain a complete package suitable for distribution.

Small additions to the package, such as the introductory or installation
batch files used by many shareware disk vendors, are acceptable, PROVIDED
THEY DO NOT INTERFERE WITH ANY INSTALLATION ROUTINE WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN
INCLUDED BY THE AUTHOR.

Many BBSs customarily add a small text file (advertisement) to each
archived file. This text file describes the BBS and tells people that the
file was downloaded from that particular BBS. Other BBSs add a small
one-line message with their BBS name and phone number into the compressed
file, which will display when the file is uncompressed. Either of these
methods of mentioning your BBS are acceptable and may be used, provided the
program and documentation is otherwise unmodified and complete.

No price or other compensation may be charged for the software package. A
distribution fee may be charged for the cost of the diskette, shipping and
handling, as long as the total (per disk) does not exceed US$8.00 in the
U.S. and Canada, or US$12.00 internationally.

Disk Sets & CD-ROMs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The software package CANNOT be sold as part of some other inclusive
package. Nor can it be included in any commercial software packaging offer,
without a written agreement from R.K. West Consulting.

ASP Approved Vendors who wish to distribute the software package as part of
a collection (such as PsL's MegaDisk set, or a CD-ROM package) may do so
provided that all the other restrictions are met. Non-ASP Vendors who wish
to distribute the software package as part of a collection MUST OBTAIN
PERMISSION FROM R.K. WEST CONSULTING PRIOR TO BEGINNING SUCH A
DISTRIBUTION.

If you wish to add any of our programs to a CD-ROM or other
collection, please check the release date of the version you have. If the
version is over six (6) months old then please contact us to confirm that
you have the most current version. This version was released in May 1992.

Disk-of-the-Month (or Subscription) Distribution:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you would like to distribute the software package as a "disk-of-the-

permission to distribute the software package under the subscription style
of distribution.

You cannot use a subscription distribution to use up your inventory
of outdated disks. Only current versions may be shipped as "disk-of-the-
month" or subscription disks.

Additional Terms:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The PRINTED User's Guide may not be reproduced in whole or in part, using
any means, without explicit written permission from R.K. West Consulting.
No part of the disk-based documentation may be distributed in PRINTED
(hardcopy) form.

The software package CANNOT be "rented" or "leased" to others.

literature which describes our products as "FREE SOFTWARE". Shareware is
"Try-Before-You-Buy" software, it is not free. You may not list any of our
products in advertisements, catalogs, or other literature which describes

immediate and automatic termination of this license.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.


To Order, in the U.S.A.: Call 800-245-6717 and ask Customer Service.

Outside the U.S.A. call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer in
