                            BOLO BALL GAME

                           by William Soleau
                          Version 1.0  Jan.92
                           Requires: EGA/VGA


   *************************   Directions   ****************************

        The objective of Bolo Ball is quite simple.  You try to push
    your 29 balls down a maze so that they reach the bottom row.  The
    farther down you can get them, the higher the score.  You can play
    against the computer or against a friend.


         The game board is a 29x18 grid.  The top row is from where all
    balls will be pushed.  In the grid there are several different
    obstacles which are:

       Blue Arrow Tiles:  These are ramps that will make the ball travel
                          in the direction of the arrow.  Once a ball has
                          hit a ramp and moves off it,  it will flip itself
                          to the opposite direction.
                          (for the next players turn)

     Yellow Bonus Tiles:  These will add ten points to your total score.  It
                          will not affect the path or direction of the ball
                          pushed.

             Gray Tiles:  These tiles will stop the ball if it obstructs the
                          ball's path.  When all balls have been pushed by
                          both players, these gray tiles will be removed and
                          the balls that are above them will continue to
                          gather points as they descend toward the bottom
                          row.
                          (The game is won or lost in most cases not by all
                          the balls being pushed, but by the points gained
                          once these gray tiles are removed!)

           Purple Tiles:  These purple tiles (ramps on level three of the
                          long game version), rotate randomly.  The ball
                          will move in the direction of the arrow at time of
                          contact.

            Black Holes:  There are five tiles which are called Back Holes.
                          If a ball hits one of these black and white tiles,
                          it will disappear and resume its journey from
                          another one of the four remaining Black Holes.


                      ***  Human / Computer  ***

         You have the option of either playing against another human
     player, or against the computer.  If you are playing against the
     computer, you will be the Blue player and the computer will play Red.


                     ***  Long and Short Games ***

         There are two types of games you can play in Bolo Ball.  One is
     the short version that ends after only one level, and the long
     version which is three levels.  (The computer is hard to beat playing
     the long version... but its a lot more fun!)


                           *** Scoring ***

         Point totals are located on the bottom row of the screen.  A ball
    that reaches the bottom row will be awarded 60 points.  Each ball that
    remains on the grid board, will show its value. (2 points per row).
    This will automatically be added to your total score.


                      *** Key Definitions ***


      Arrow keys move your man right of left along the top of the game grid.
      The down arrow key will push a ball onto the game board.


      <S>ound Toggle              :  Turns sound on or off

                                     balls are when its your turn.  (Helps
                                     for strategy...blocking...etc...)
