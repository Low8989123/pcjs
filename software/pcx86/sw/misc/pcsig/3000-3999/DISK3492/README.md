                              FILE DESCRIPTION
===========================================================================

Welcome to WOPR, the Word for Windows (TM) Office POWER Pack (TM).

In order to use WOPR, you MUST have Word for Windows.  (No, sorry, WOPR 
doesn't work with Ami Pro or WurdPerfect.  No way, Jose.)  This is the 
only ASCII text file you'll see; you need WinWord to get into anything 
else. 

Unfolding WOPR is easy.  You should have two files, WOPRA.EXE and 
WOPRB.EXE -- if you don't have both, you don't have the whole WOPR.

First, check and make sure you have an extra 1.5 MB on your hard disk.
(Yeah, it's big.  That's why we call it "WOPR"!)  Create a new subdirectory.
Many people put WOPR under WinWord, e.g., in C:\WINWORD\WOPR.  Copy both
WOPRA.EXE and WOPRB.EXE to the new subdirectory.  Then run each file -- just
as you would run any program.  WOPR will automagically unfold before your
very eyes.  You can use the Windows File Manager to create the new sub- 
directory, copy the files, and run the decompression programs, if you like.
Or you can do it all under DOS.  Whatever you prefer.

The best way to explore WOPR is to poke around with File Open and look 
for .DOC files.  They're just plain old everyday WinWord documents.  Take 
your time and enjoy what you see!

This is an unregistered, evaluation copy of WOPR.  Please feel free to 
pass around WOPRA and WOPRB; show 'em off to friends and co-workers.  
The more the merrier!  But if you distribute the files, distribute BOTH 
WOPRA and WOPRB.   

Please encourage your friends and associates to register WOPR if they use 
it.  (Your company, too, for that mattter!)  Registrations are very 
important: that's how we make a living, feed the kids, put gas in the car.  
Registration forms are embedded in all the WOPR documents.  

Thanks for trying out WOPR.  We'd appreciate your comments.....

            THE WORD FOR WINDOWS (TM) OFFICE POWER PACK (TM) 
======================================================================

NOTE:

The files WOPRA.EXE and WOPRB.EXE are self-expanding LHA files which expand 
to Word for Windows (TM) documents.

They cannot be read by normal ASCII editors.  You must use Word for Windows
to access, review, install, and use WOPR.

=======================================================================

Association of Shareware Professionals approved vendors may distribute 
WOPR with but one restriction -- please drop a line to:

you could just add us to your mailing list.  This will simplify our

WinWord macros are just around the corner!

to the above address and request permission to distribute WOPR.

Non-profit organizations may copy and distribute WOPR at will.  Yep, that
includes user groups.
