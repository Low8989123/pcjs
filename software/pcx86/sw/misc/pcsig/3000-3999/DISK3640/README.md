                WELCOME TO GRIN GRAPHICS VOLUME #2
          150 more fantastic and funny clip art images   

                           WHAT'S NEW 

1. You can now register using your Visa or Mastercard. 
   Voice (903)586-6150  Data: (903)589-0042 or by sending in the  
   registration form. We still accept checks. 
2. From now on only U.S. Funds can be accepted. I got some stuff I 
   couldn't even read, and my bank charged $5.00 to exchange it.
3. We no longer distribute any format except PCX. Very few        
   registrations come in requesting other than this. We do get a  
   few requesting WPG for WordPerfect but WordPerfect imports PCX 
   without any problems.
4. Registered Users, will now receive a complete pictorial index of 
   Volume #2 images, allowing easy identification and selection of 
   the many images available.
5. Registered users now have free access to the "Grin and Share It"
   Bulletin Board. This board was set up to support Grin Graphics 
   and to give Grin Graphics users a friendly environment to      
   exchange information and communicate with other users. You do  
   not have to be a registered user to access the BBS but only    
   registered users are allowed full VIP access. It will also allow 
   vendors to D/L the newest versions available and get direct    
   information from the authors. (BBS) 24 hours a day 7 days a week 
   Grin and Share It > 903-589-0042. We can also be contacted     
   through the WILDNET International Mail Network in the SHAREWARE, 
   GRAPHICS, DESKTOP PUBLISHING, or GENERAL MAIL conferences.
6. We no longer even attempt to do custom work except on a local  
   level. Deadlines and different artistic visions don't work well 
   over long distance.

                   USING GRIN GRAPHICS IMAGES

   All Grin Graphics clip art is compressed into self extracting
zip-files.
The easiest way to get going is to copy the "*.EXE" file from this
diskette to the directory on your hard drive where you wish to keep
your art. 
 
Example:  COPY A:\GRINV2A.EXE C:\CLIPART

Go to the clipart directory on your hard disk and type the first
letters of the "*.EXE" file:

Example for GRINV2A.EXE;    TYPE    "GRINV2A"  then press ENTER 

NOTE: ANY FILE WITH "PCX?.EXE IS A SELF EXTRACTING ZIP FILE!
      IT DOES NOTHING EXCEPT DECOMPRESS THE HIGHLY PACKED PCX    
      IMAGES.

The file will automatically decompress into separate clip art
images numbered in the following manner; 024.PCX, 057.PCX etc..
Make sure you have plenty of room on your hard drive, some of these
are really monsters.

After the files are decompressed erase the Grin Graphics "EXE" file
from your hard drive and put away your floppy in a safe place. You
never know when you might need to do this again.

            ALL I GOT IS NUMBERED FILES....NOW WHAT?

     Now that you have the images decompressed you need something
to see them with. If you are planning on using these images in your
paint program, word processor, or Desk-Top publishing program we
suggest you enter that program now and follow it's instructions for
loading, importing, placing, or pasting graphic images. 
     If you have a graphics file viewing utility such as VPIC or
Graphics Workshop, (both of which you can d/l from the Grin and
Share It Bulletin Board), and are available where all better
shareware is sold; use these for the quickest way to see what
you've got.

*                                                                *

*   Press ENTER and your printer will print it out.              *
*================================================================*

     Once decompressed you may load the individual images into your
word processor, paint, or desktop publishing program. Grin graphics
PCX images are compatible with almost all programs that are capable
of using the PCX format. 

                          OTHER FORMATS

     Grin Graphics is no longer distributed in the nine or ten
different formats that we once tried to maintain. PCX seems to be
the current format of choice and is compatible with almost all
programs using graphic images. If you must have a special format
get a graphic image conversion utility that will change the PCX
image into what you are needing. One of the best we have seen is a
shareware program called "Graphics Workshop". If you cannot find it
in your area you can download it from the Grin and Share It
bulletin board described later in this document. There are also
several commercial utilities for doing this; HiJaak for example. 

                  The "Why's" of Grin Graphics

Why so big?

     Grin Graphics images are large, most of them anyway. When we
got our first computer system, all we had was a nine pin dot matrix
printer. It was almost impossible to find graphics images that fit
where we wanted them to fit without having to scale the image which
caused horrible distortion and usually unprintable graphics. We
discovered that if you created a graphic larger than you needed,
then reduced it's size, it would retain most of it's definition,
and sometimes even improve in its print quality. By making the
images large they printed well on 9 pin or even 300 dpi laser
printers. 

Why create such stuff?

     Another sad fact we discovered was that there was very little,
almost none in fact, clip art that was targeted for non-business
publications. There were lots of office scenes, telephones, stop
signs, etc., but where could you find a frog sitting at a bar
drinking a bottle of 100 proof fly juice? Where could you find a
kitten in a toilet bowl, a puppy in a box or a fat man blowing a
trumpet? We have filled that void. We hope you enjoy our Graphics
as much as we enjoy making them available to you.

Why register? 

     If and when you register you will receive another diskette
chock full of more Grin Graphics images. You'll receive a printed
pictorial index of all volume #2 images for easy location and
identification of the image you need. You'll have free access to
the Grin and Share It Bulletin board which has been set up for your
support and contact with the Grin Graphics Company, with direct
access to Charles Miles, the artist of Grin Graphics images. Not
only do you get all of this but you also get that good feeling
inside knowing that you are supporting the shareware concept.

About the BBS.....

        We have set up a bulletin board for our users called "Grin 
and Share It. Our plan is not to make this some gigantic BBS with
thousands of files you'll never need. It is here for you to contact 
Grin Graphics, get some of the utilities you might need, be in contact
with other Grin Graphics users, and to get the newest updates and
or reports about Grin Graphics clip art or other programs.
        It is also here for the shareware vendor who wishes to distribute
Grin Graphics products. If you are a vendor you should leave a comment
to the SYSOP stating that you are a vendor and how you plan to distribute 
Grin Graphics. Also, if you are another BBS please let us know your BBS
name and it's number.
        Grin and Share It BBS is currently a node on the International
Wildnet Mail Network. If you have a local BBS carrying this echo mail
network it might be less costly for you to contact us through it rather
than call long distance just to leave a message. 
        While we do allow any and all access to the board, we only allow
full VIP access to registered Grin Graphics users. If you are already
a registered user just call the BBS and once your registration has been 
verified you will receive full VIP access also. 

A note to Vendors.....

        Grin Graphics Clip art is distributed in two different packages;
a catalog distribution pack and a BBS distribution pack. 

Catalog Version: Consists of two diskettes containing images 234-383.
                 These should not be sold as separate items. 

BBS Version: Consists of one diskette with assorted images. This packet 
             was made smaller in order to encourage BBS users to download 
             the file. This does not restrict you from also carrying the
             full catalog version on your board; you may carry both.

Grin Graphics may not be broken, separated, or combined with other clip 
images unless approved by Grin Graphics. This however does not include
shareware packages as long as Grin Graphics is maintained as a separate
and individual program within that package.

Catalog distributors are allowed to use Grin Graphics images in their 
catalog illustrations only if the illustration is in direct contact with
the Grin Graphics description or a special note is listed somewhere in the 
catalog documentation letting users know where the clip art came from and
how they can obtain it.

To All.........

        We make no warranties whatsoever as to how this shareware will 
        function with your particular application or on your equipment.

                          

     This collection of clipart is distributed as shareware; not freeware.
     If you evaluate this package and see that you can and will use it, you
     need to register it. If you can't use it please pass it on to someone
     who can. Upload it to your favorite bulletin board and tell others about
     it. 
        We hope that these clipart images brighten your day and give you a 
     big grin. Then, when you register, you'll be sending a grin back to
     us. Before you know it we'll all be grinning.
