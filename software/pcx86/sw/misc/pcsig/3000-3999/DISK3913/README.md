The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We
recommend a 386 with a VGA monitor.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

I. INTRODUCTION

 Silicon Universe is a computer program with two major sections.  Section
one plots the location of deep sky objects with respect to the plane of our
galaxy, the Milky Way;  section two consists of an interactive astronomy
tutorial defining and illustrating these objects.  The term "deep sky
object" refers to everything in the visible universe beyond the Solar
System.  By this definition deep sky objects can be stars, star clusters,
nebulae and galaxies, all of which are prime targets for both amateur and
professional astronomical telescopes.  This program differs from
planetarium software (such as ALGOL SOFTWARE WORKS companion program
SILICON SKY) in that the universe is displayed, not as it is seen from the
earth, but from the point of view of an observer stationed far outside our
galaxy.  In other words, simply by pressing a few keys on a computer
keyboard, you will have before you a "God's Eye View" of the cosmos. 
Objects which may be displayed are:

 1. Globular Clusters
 2. Open Clusters
 3. Diffuse Nebulae
 4. Planetary Nebulae
 5. Stars
 6. External Galaxies

 In addition to the data files which are supplied with the program, the
user may make custom files using an included file making utility.

  The following paragraphs describe the operation of the program, although
every effort has been made to make the program self contained and easy to
use without reference to this manual.

II. RUNNING THE PROGRAM

 Begin the SILICON UNIVERSE by typing "SUNV" and then pressing return;  the
subsequent title display will show a button bearing the legend "PRESS ENTER
TO CONTINUE".  If you want to terminate the program at this point press
ESC, otherwise press ENTER as requested.
    
Upon pressing ENTER the screen will display the Milky Way with the location
of the sun indicated by an arrow.  Across the top of the display will be a
row of five buttons: ACTIVATE, OBJECTS,INFO, HELP and ESCAPE.  Note that
each button has a letter (or letters) highlighted in RED and one of the
buttons shaded cyan.  A button may be selected either by pressing the
appropriate yellow letter or by moving the cyan highlight to the desired
button using the arrow keys and pressing ENTER.  If a (previously initialized) MOUSE is available, then the buttons may be
selected by moving the cursor to the desired function and pressing the LEFT
mouse button.


From right to left the action of each button is as follows:

     ESCAPE: Terminates the program and returns to DOS.

     INFO: Provides a basic astronomy tutorial, with interactive
     illustrations defining the structure and dimensions of the universe
     and the nature of the various types of deep sky objects.

     OBJECT: Selects the type of object to be located on the active
     display.

     ACTIVATE: Plots the selected object and provides a number of tools to
     manipulate the resulting image.

     These keys will now be examined in detail in the following sections.

III. INFO - BASIC ASTRONOMY TUTORIAL

     When INFO is pressed a menu will appear with the following buttons:
     Introduction, Stars, Globular Clusters, Open Clusters, Diffuse
     Nebulae, Planetary Nebulae, and Galaxies.  Each selection gives a
     brief write up of the subject in one or more panels which can be
     accessed by pressing the "Page Down" key.  Previously viewed panels
     can be reexamined by pressing "Page Up".  After the written material
     is completed, illustrative screens can be displayed by again pressing
     "Page Down".  These illustrations will vary with the subject matter. 
     For example, the Introduction section illustrates cosmic distances by
     showing the time required for a beam of light from a flashlight to
     travel across progressively larger distances, beginning with the
     Earth-Moon system and finishing with the whole of the observable
     universe.  The cosmic distance examples are selectable from a menu. 

     Many of the illustrations involve some interaction with the user.  For
     example, globular clusters, diffuse nebulae and elliptical galaxies
     are constructed using mathematical models which place stars (or
     circles for diffuse nebulae) on the screen according to a series of
     calculations.  When globular clusters or nebulae are first displayed
     only 1,000 stars (circles) are placed.  The user can specify more
     stars or circles (up to 30,000) if a richer looking cluster or nebula
     is desired.  Elliptical galaxies are calculated with a similar
     algorithm using an initial value of 30,000 stars.  If the galaxy
     display process appears to be taking too long for your machine, you
     can always curtail the process by pressing "ESC".

     NOTE: ANY ACTION CAN BE TERMINATED BY PRESSING THE "ESC" KEY
           OR SELECTING THE ESC BUTTON WITH A MOUSE.  IF THERE IS NO
           EXPLICIT "ESC" BUTTON, THE ACTION MAY ALSO BE TERMINATED BY
           PRESSING THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON.
                               IV. OBJECT - SELECTING THE ACTIVE DISPLAY

Pressing the "OBJECT" button gives a menu from which a specific type of
object for display can be selected.  The menu is as follows: 
     
     Globular Clusters
     Open Clusters
     Diffuse Nebulae
     Planetary Nebulae
     Brightest Stars
     Nearest Stars
     Local Group
     Messier Galaxies
     No Objects
     Custom

Pressing any button but the last two will access a predefined data file.
The "No Objects" option will simply display the "bare" galaxy without any
objects, while the selection of "Custom" requires the user to input the
name of a user prepared file (more on this below).  After choosing the
object, it may be displayed by pressing the "ACTIVATE" button.

 With the exception of extra-galactic displays, the initial display will
always be of the Milky Way inclined to the field of view by 30 degrees, and
the Sun will be represented by a yellow dot.  A menu showing the tools to
manipulate the display is given at the bottom of the screen.

                          TOOL MENU - BOTTOM ROW

F1-F8: MAGNIFY

The first thing to note in the tool menu is that the display can be
magnified (i.e., the area represented by the screen can be reduced) using
the function keys F1 through F8.  Different types of objects will require
different magnifications for optimum display.  For example, globular
clusters are relatively distant from the Solar System, forming a "halo"
about the Milky Way.  Thus, they are most conveniently viewed along with
the whole galaxy (i.e., on the initial screen display).  The other objects
are much closer to the Solar System, and the scale of the display must be
changed to view them properly.  Pressing function keys F1 through F8 will
display the galaxy at unit scales ranging from 10,000 to .8 light years. 
Try each set of data at different scales until the proper perspective is
obtained.

PgUp:EDGE ON, PgDn:FACE ON, HOME:30 DEGREE, UP/DOWN ARROWS:TILT

Continuing with the tool menu, an edge on view of the galaxy can be
displayed by hitting the "PAGE UP" key, and a face on view may be obtained
by hitting the "PAGE DOWN" key.  Pressing the "HOME" key will re-display
the 30 degree view.  For magnifications F1 through F6 the "UP" and "DOWN"
arrows will,respectively, tilt the display up or down in 5 degree
increments.  At the two highest magnifications, F7 and F8, the increment
will be one degree.

At magnifications F4 and above, the "LEFT" and "RIGHT" arrows will rotate
the display.  From F4 through F6 the rotational increment is 20 degrees,
while the increment is one degree for F7 and F8.

                            TOOL MENU - TOP ROW

REMOVE/RESTORE MENU

Pressing "R" will remove the tool menu from the bottom of the screen. 
Pressing "R" a second time will restore it.

SPHERE

Pressing this key draws a sun centered sphere whose equator is defined by
the galactic plane.  It can be understood as representing two different
things.  First, it demonstrates the GALACTIC COORDINATE SYSTEM, i.e., the
system of coordinates in which an astronomical object's location on the
celestial sphere is specified by its galactic longitude and latitude. 
Second, the radius of this sphere is equal to that of the unit scale of the
display.  Thus, if the scale is 10,000 light years, a glance at the sphere
will show how many objects are located within this distance from the sun.  

LABEL

This key has no effect unless either the "SPHERE" or the "GRID" button has
been activated.  If the celestial sphere has been selected, then pressing
"LABEL" will display primary galactic longitudes and latitudes, as well as
the constellations in which the specified galactic longitudes and latitudes
are located. Naturally, constellations have no meaning from the standpoint
of the omniscient observer in intergalactic space; such things are strictly
for Earth bound mortals.  If the grid alone is present, then only galactic
longitudes are labeled.

IDENTIFY

Repeatedly pressing this key will label the objects displayed in sequence. 
Since it is sometimes hard to get a sense of perspective from these
diagrams, both the in plane and perpendicular projections of the distance
are given.  A dashed perpendicular line means BELOW the galactic plane,
while a solid perpendicular line means ABOVE the plane.

GRID

The grid is circular, with radii marked off in units of the current scale. 
For the face on and edge on displays the grid is in the galactic plane,
while it is normal to the plane when the edge on view is displayed.

SCALE

Pressing this button will display the unit scale at the top of the screen.

MOUSE

Pressing the "MOUSE" button will display an arrow cursor which may be moved
with a mouse to an object whose identity is desired.  Pressing the LEFT
button will label the object.  THE MOUSE WILL WORK ONLY IF IT HAS BEEN
PREVIOUSLY ACTIVATED BY MOUSE DRIVER SOFTWARE.  


>>>>>>>> TO EXIT MOUSE <<<<<<<<<<

To exit the mouse environment WITH MOUSE PRESENT press the RIGHT button
or "ESC".


ZOOM FEATURE

The views given in the standard displays, regardless of the scale, are
views which would be seen by an observer an infinite (or very large)
distance away from the Milky Way.  Thus the perspective is "flat" in the
same sense that the moon appears to be a flat disk from the point view of
Earth bound observers.  A more three dimensional effect can be obtained by
bringing the observer closer to the galaxy.  This is accomplished by
pressing the "Z" key when the display magnification is F4 or higher.  The
effect is somewhat like using a wide angle lens in a camera, and thus there
will always be some resulting distortion.  Three successively closer zoom
distances can be obtained by repeatedly pressing the "Z" key.  Return to
the original perspective by pressing "X".

CUSTOM FILES

One of the most useful features of SILICON UNIVERSE is the ability to read
user defined files.  To prepare a file you must have the following
information about the objects you wish to plot on the SILICON UNIVERSE
display:

          1. Type of object (star, globular cluster, open cluster, diffuse
          nebula, planetary nebula or galaxy).
          2. Type of coordinates (equatorial or galactic).
          3. The coordinates of each object
          4. The distance to each object in light years.

The file can be prepared using the program "MAKEFILE.EXE".  To use this
utility simply type "MAKEFILE" and press ENTER.  The program will then step
you through the file making process.  To use your newly created file,
select "CUSTOM" from the OBJECT menu and input the name you have given the
file.                       REGISTRATION

If you have enjoyed using SILICON UNIVERSE, you might also be interested
in another ALGOL SOFTWARE WORKS publication, SILICON SKY. SILICON SKY is a
planetarium program which displays stars brighter than magnitude 4.5 which
can be seen from a given locality at a specified time, date and viewing
horizon.  Constellations are identified, and the motions of the sun, moon
and planets are also given.  In addition, the program shows "telescopic"
views of the moon and bright planets, along with a selection of deep sky
objects and double stars.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: [REQUIRES EGA OR VGA GRAPHICS]

Silicon Universe is a both a cosmic simulator and an astronomy tutorial. 
Using this program the location of celestial bodies known as "deep sky"
objects can be displayed with respect to the plane of our galaxy, the Milky
Way.  To give the user an understanding of these objects, an astronomy
tutorial is provided with interactive graphics and illustrative examples.

The term "deep sky object" refers to everything in the visible universe
beyond the Solar System.  By this definition deep sky objects can be
stars, star clusters, nebulae and galaxies, all of which are prime targets
for both amateur and professional astronomical telescopes.  This program
differs from planetarium software (such as ALGOL SOFTWARE WORKS companion
program SILICON SKY) in that the universe is displayed, not as it is seen
from the earth, but from the point of view of an observer stationed far
outside our galaxy; simply by pressing a few keys on a computer keyboard,
you will have before you a "God's Eye View" of the cosmos. Objects which
may be displayed are:

 1. Globular Clusters
 2. Open Clusters
 3. Diffuse Nebulae
 4. Planetary Nebulae
 5. Stars
 6. External Galaxies
 In addition to the data files which are supplied with the program, the
user may make custom files using an included file making utility.
