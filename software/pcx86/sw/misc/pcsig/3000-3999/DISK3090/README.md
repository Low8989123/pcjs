PC-SIG UPDATES PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM

For Immediate Release


PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM UPDATED TO INCLUDE A NEW USER INTERFACE AND MORE
THAN 800 MB OF PROGRAMS June 21, 1992, SUNNYVALE, CALIF. - PC-SIG, Inc.
today announced availability of The Eleventh Edition of the PC-SIG Library
on CD-ROM.  The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM contains over 800 megabytes of
shareware and includes more than 300 new programs, 550 updated programs,
and the addition of 75 megabytes of Windows 3.x shareware.  The
user-interface has been completely re-engineered to take advantage of the
HyperWriter! hypermedia and multimedia authoring system from NTERGAID, Inc.

The implementation of HyperWriter! provides significant performance and
ease of use enhancements.  Programs can access and download much faster
than with previous editions.  Programs have been reorganized and indexed
for better referencing.  Users just c lick with a mouse, or point with the
cursor, on a program name to see a complete description of the program.
Downloading or copying a program is handled automatically by HyperWriter!
Addition of a preview option is especially important for anyone who uses
images, icons, or fonts.  "You can preview the whole library of images to
find the right one," according to Bruce Kent, product development manager.
"This CD finally makes it possi ble to conserve your disk space and paper,
yet still have all the information you need to make an informed decision,"
said Kent.

All new and updated programs have been reviewed and tested by PC-SIG. Every
program goes through extensive virus checking using the most recent version
of VIRUSCAN from McAfee Associates, and other anti-virus software.
According to Kent, "In the ten ye ars we've distributed shareware, we have
never had a confirmed report of a virus on any of our distributed programs
or CD-ROMs."

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, Eleventh Edition has a list price of $179.

Upgrades from previous editions are available for $99.

Users of PC-SIG's Essential Home & Business Collection CD-ROM can upgrade
for $120.

and resellers. Based in Sunnyvale, Calif., PC-SIG, Inc. markets and
supports one of the world's largest collections of shareware for IBM PCs
and compatible systems.  PC-SIG also publishes Shareware Magazine, which is
devoted solely to shareware.  The magazine is availa ble by subscription
and on newsstands nationwide.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

  LICENSING AGREEMENT
  -------------------
  PCXVIEW is copyrighted software and all rights are reserved. PCXVIEW
  may not be changed or modified in any way except by the author.


  OVERVIEW OF PCXVIEW
  -------------------

  * It can be used on any color EGA, VGA or SVGA display card.

  * It can show 2, 16 , 256 and 16.7 million (24 bit) color PCX files
    in both 16 and 256 color modes. However viewing real 256-color and
    24 bit pictures in 16 color will only give you a hint of the picture.
    Viewing 24 bit pictures in 256 color is acceptable.

  * On Tseng HiColor cards, you can view 24 bit colors PCX files in
    32768 colors (640x480x32k or 800x600x32k). In 32768 colors modes,
    you can ONLY view 24-bit pictures.

  * It detects these SuperVGA card and uses their HiRes modes in 16 or
    256 colors:
    ATI-VGA, Trident, Genoa, Paradise, Tseng3, Tseng4, Tseng HiColor
    (also 32768 color), Oak-37, Oak-67, Video7, Ahead A/B,
    Chips & Tech 451/452/453

  * It has a neat file browser, so you can walk though your whole harddisk
    without leaving PCXVIEW. There is a limit of 2000 PCX-files per
    directory (you are not likely to hit this limit!). You simply use the
    cursor arrows or PgUp or PgDn to select the file you want to see. Press
    Enter to view file.

  * The PCX-files must be no larger that 6000 pixels wide, which should be
    more than enough.

  * You can easily set up a slideshow by tagging a number of files and then
    hitting F2 (to start the slideshow). You must tag at least 2 files to
    have a slideshow.

  * PCXVIEW will detect which videomodes your videocard can use, and you
    can easily switch between these modes by pressing F1 (or F5 & F6).

  * PCXVIEW is designed to show the PCX-files that PCXDUMP produces with no
    color distortion. This means that all PCX-files from PCXDUMP can be seen
    correctly.
    Viewing a real 256-color PCX-file will properly not be very nice in a
    16 color screen mode, but if you are able to capture a 256-color screen
    mode, you are also able to view the file in a 256 color screen mode!

  * It is FAST! PCXVIEW is written in a high level language and assembler
    for all the screen and unpacking operations.
    Compared with the great shareware fileviewer VPIC (which can show a large
    number of formats, not only PCX), PCXVIEW is 30%-700% faster with an
    average about 2-3 times faster as VPIC!

   corresponding game is started from the same batch file such as:

  WHAT'S NEW IN PCXDUMP VERSION 7.1
  ---------------------------------


  For those who are curious, Version 7.1 of PCXDUMP
  contains the following additions and improvements over
  previous versions

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 7.10      - The /WIDE option is improved. The syntax for this
                    option is now /WIDE=number.
                    Since PCXDUMP automatically determines the logical
                    screen width (which is bigger than the physical display
                    width), but have no way of calculating the logical screen
                    height, you here specify how many times higher than the
                    physical display height the logical screen height is. Lets
                    say you want to capture the full logical screen of
                    COMMANDER KEEN 4. This game runs in 320x200 in 16 colors.
                    You do not have to worry about the logical screen width,
                    since PCXDUMP will take care of that. The logical screen
                    height is approx. 600 pixels. Therefore, to dump the
                    logical screen, you should install PCXDUMP with:

                    PCXDUMP /TIME=15 /WIDE=3    (since 200*3 = 600)

                    If you have access to this game you should try it!
                    To have any effect, the WIDE values must be in the
                    range 1-5.
                  - New option /OFFSET. Normally PCXDUMP will save the images
                    to files starting with the file "DUMP0000.PCX". But by
                    specifying a file-offset, you can tell PCXDUMP to save the
                    images to files starting with another file.
                  - Small improvements here and there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 7.00      - All the follow tweaked 256 color VGA-modes will be
                    recognized! PCXDUMP has been tested and works in
                    320x200, 320x240, 360x200, 360x240, 320x400, 400x250,
                    320x480 and 360x480! In all these modes, you can
                    use the mouse or keyboard to select what area of the
                    screen to dump. The routine is a general detection
                    routine so PCXDUMP should work with other 256 color
                    tweaked modes as well.
                  - Some BGI-drivers for Turbo Pascal and Turbo C makes
                    it possible to use tweaked modes in 16 colors, e.g.
                    704x528 or 720x540. These modes are recognized now
                    and PCXDUMP will treat them like any other 16 color
                    mode.
                  - Some advanced games uses splitscreen techniques to
                    implement a status panel on the bottom half of the
                    screen (like 3D Wolfenstein or SupaPlex). PCXDUMP
                    now knows how to handle splitscreens in both 16 and
                    256 colors.
                  - New hotkey 'A'. Registered users will be able to dump
                    a text screen to an ANSI-file with the extension .ANS.
                    These files contain all the necessary escape
                    sequences and can be typed with the DOS command TYPE.
                    This option is great for SysOp's, who wants to capture
                    text screen which can be send through a modem with
                    color information.
                  - I have included a fantastic new program in the PCXDUMP
                    system: PCXVIEW. It is an easy-to-use PCX-file viewer
                    and it is very fast! Showing PCX-files is about 2-3
                    times faster than with VPIC.
                    It is able to show 2, 16, 256 or 16.7 million color
                    PCX-files on any EGA, VGA or SVGA card. Check
                    PCXVIEW.DOC
                  - The /NOPEL option is removed. When dumping graphics
                    from a program that uses horizontal scroll, use the
                    middle mouse button or Keypad "5" to adjust frame position
                    within a "videobyte".
                  - New option /LIGHT=number. When you install PCXDUMP
                    you can now adjust the palette intensity. When dumping
                    a screen to gray scaled PCX-file it is often very
                    convenient to make the image lighter before printing
                    it on your favorite laserprinter.
                  - The colors used to print the framesize and frame on
                    the screen are now much easier to see.
                  - You can now do a (normal or inverted) gray scale dump
                    in 32768 colors modes.
                  - Minor bug fixes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.00      - PCXDUMP is now menu-controlled. All options, such
                    as hotkeys and videoadapter can be seen and set on
                    screen. This means that it is very easy to compose a
                    complicated installation. It is still possible to
                    install PCXDUMP via "command line switches".
                  - Two new hotkeys 'G' and 'H'. 'G' will convert
                    the image to a gray scale image (provided the
                    screen mode is color with at least 4 colors and
                    at most 256 colors). 'H' will produce an inverted
                    gray scale image.
                  - New option /WIDE. If a program uses smooth scroll
                    (that is, defines a virtual screen bigger than
                    physical display), e.g. the COMMANDER KEEN series,
                    you can set /WIDE, and PCXDUMP will try to dump the
                    virtual screen instead of the physical screen.
                    This option will not have any
                    effect on an EGA-card since registers on this card
                    are write-only.
                  - New option /AUTODUMP.This option will only have an
                    effect, if it's used in conjunction with either the
                    /DISK or /TIME option.
                    If you install PCXDUMP with "/TIME=10 /AUTODUMP"
                    this is what happens: after 10 seconds PCXDUMP will
                    install it's own keyboard routine and will immedia-
                    tely start dumping the screen.
                  - A small sound improvement. No matter how fast your
                    computer is, the beeps should now be of same the
                    duration.
                  - New option /INT=number. It is possible to use
                    PCXDUMP from another program. You specify here
                    which interrupt PCXDUMP must use, when called from
                    another program.
                  - New hotkey 'T'. This hotkey enables registered users
                    to dump a text screen to a text-file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.00      - If you install PCXDUMP with a delay with
                    the /TIME or /DISK option, PCXDUMP will now
                    beep when it takes over the INT 09h or/and
                    INT 08h.
                  - It is now possible to capture graphics in
                    virtually any program or game. I have had some
                    problems with a number of Apogee game, such as
                    Commander Keen and many commercial games, such
                    as A10 Tank Killer V 1.5. or Lemmings. However,
                    these programs represent different problems.
                    Games such as Keen and Lemmings define a "virtual"
                    screen, which is much bigger than the actual
                    resolution. This is how they make the impressive
                    smooth scrool in all directions. Games like A10
                    Tank Killer and many others (new ones) use a trick
                    to gain four video pages on a standard VGA display
                    card to obtain smooth animation with page flip-
                    ping. Needless to say, PCXDUMP will now work in
                    these modes, but since detecting and manipulation
                    of these special videomodes depend heavily on
                    register readings/writings, PCXDUMP will not
                    recognize these modes, unless your videocard is at
                    least a VGA-card. Reason: on an EGA-card, all
                    registers are write-only.
                  - Actually some programs use a special mode (X) on
                    a VGA-card: 320 x 240 x 256. This mode provides
                    square pixels and 2 display pages on a standard
                    VGA card. PCXDUMP is able to handle this mode
                    as well. The most tricky game is BANANOID (a free-
                    ware game), that uses mode X, but defines a
                    virtual screen about 500 pixels wide and
                    with smooth horizontal scroll. PCXDUMP will now
                    also capture screens from such nasty programs
                    as well.
                  - A new option: /NOPEL. This option will prevent
                    PCXDUMP to read a certain register on the graphics
                    card. Reading of this register sometimes blanks
                    the screen while PCXDUMP is dumping graphics
                    (normally the screen reappears when PCXDUMP has
                    finished). This register determines exactly where
                    the screen starts if there is smooth scrool
                    involved (in a 16 color mode). If you explicit
                    tell PCXDUMP not to read this register, PCXDUMP
                    will dump a picture which is 8 pixels wider than
                    the physical display. Later you can cut out
                    precisely the part of the picture you are interested
                    in.
                  - PCXDUMP will now recognize and use VESA-cards.
                  - All these new options will only use additional 400
                    bytes !
                  - The registered version of PCXDUMP will now capture
                    most of all these SuperVGA hires text modes, such
                    as 132x25, 80x60, 132x44 or 100x40 etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.02      - It is no longer possible to use the mouse, while
                    PCXDUMP is dumping information to disk.
                  - In 16 colors VGA text PCXDUMP used a fixed palette;
                    now it uses the correct colors, even if it is a custom
                    color palette.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 4.0       - The registered version of PCXDUMP 4.0 will now
                    capture screen in text modes. Both in color and in
                    black and white.
                  - Internal buffersize is now increased to
                    3600 bytes for better performance. PCXDUMP
                    therefore uses more memory now than previous
                    versions. This turned out to be necessary
                    to make PCXDUMP handle 32768 colors.
                  - Ahead A/B chipset is now recognized.
                  - The routine to recognize Chips & Technology
                    chipsets is improved.
                  - On TSENG HiColor cards, PCXDUMP can be used
                    in the 1280x1024x16 mode incl. all modes
                    with 32768 colors.
                  - On ATI-WONDER cards, PCXDUMP can be used in the
                    640x480x32768 colors mode.
                  - On Paradise cards, PCXDUMP can handle the
                    640x480x32768 and 800x600x32768 modes incl. the
                    1024x768x256 mode.
                  - PCXDUMP can now be used in CGA mode:
                    04h = 320x200x4
                    05h = 320x200x4
                    06h = 640x200x2
                    PCXDUMP, however, still requires minimum an EGA-card
                    to be installed.
                  - It is now possible to adjust framesize without
                    a mouse, using SPACE and the arrowkeys instead.
                  - PCXDUMP now releases the environment copy.
                  - Improved check for pop-up in busy situa-
                    tions. E.g. PCXDUMP will not pop up as long
                    as INT 13h is active.
                  - The normal hotkey sequence is now ALT+SHIFT (left
                    shift). Previous versions used ALT+CTRL as the hot-
                    key sequence.
                  - There was a minor problem with the EGA-
                    palette in mode 0Dh (320x200x16) and mode
                    0Eh (640x200x16). In these two modes the
                    palette is a fixed 16 colors palette (and not
                    as in mode 10h 16 colors out of 64). This has bow
                    been fixed.
                  - PCXDUMP will now beep a low and long tone if
                    the hotkeys are pressed in an unsupported videomode.
                  - PCXDUMP now reads command-line parameters.
                    /ON is necessary to install PCXDUMP (only
                       if none of the other options are used).
                    /OFF will remove PCXDUMP from the memory.
                    /NOSOUND tells PCXDUMP not to use any sounds.
                    /TIME=number tells PCXDUMP to delay instal-
                       lation of INT 09h number seconds.
                    /DISK=number tells PCXDUMP to delay instal-
                       lation of INT 08h by number calls to
                       INT 13h. INT 09H will be installed 3 sec.
                       after INT 08H.
                    /SHIFT=number. It is now possible to choose
                       between ALT, SHIFT and CTRL in the hotkey
                       sequence.
                    /HOTKEY=number. You can tell PCXDUMP to use
                       you custom hotkey. All other hotkeys will
                       be disabled. PCXDUMP will automatically
                       determine to dump either a color or a mono-
                       chrome image.
                    /CHIPSET=number. Force PCXDUMP to use a cer-
                       tain chipset. See PCXDUMP.DOC for details.
                    /DIR=directory. Will tell PCXDUMP to put the
                       PCX-files in this directory instead of in
                       the current directory.
