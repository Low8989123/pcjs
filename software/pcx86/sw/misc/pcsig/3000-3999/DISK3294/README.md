Why WIN-DIARY ?
---------------

A lot of people have the idea to write down all the important 
experiences or sensations in any way. They decide to have a diary. 
They buy a handle or a little book and start to write.

But the joy often insn't for a long time, because there are a lot 
of ink-blots or cancel in the book. The diary don't look like so 
good than when it was new. It becomes a torture to write every day 
into the diary. There is no more fun. 

Further, there must be a safety place to hide the diary. A diary 
always should be a little secret. Nobody else should have the 
possibility to read in it. If there is a very hard-working diary 
writer there is the problem to hide a lot of books, and a large 
hiding-place is necessary. In summary there are a lot of proplems 
to have an usual diary. 

The logical consequence comes. A lot of usual diarys have to live
just a view days or weeks. When there is much effort and no more joy 
the relust is always the same. The diary is no more important.

WIN-DIARY is an electronic supported way to have a diary. All the 
problems we have seen are solved in WIN-DIARY.

Because of the password check and the encoding it is absolutely 
impossible for unauthorized person to have an acces to your diary. 
You can wirte into the diary in an easy way . When it is necessary 
you can change or delete the entries. Of course there is a 
possibility to put all the diary or a part of it to your printer.

If you don't have much time to write into the diary you can use 
the function "scale". Here you can find the ten most important 
areas in the live of an adult person. You put in notes for it and 
can do it in a few seconds.

Last but not least there is a horoscope function for you. For 
every day you get a personal horoscope within all important 
information which is necessary to have a pleasant day.

WIN-DIARY is very easy to handle. But there are much more advantages 
in an electronic supported diary. Because of the access security 
you must not have a secret place for your diary. It is very easy 
to change or delete entries in WIN-DIARY and you can be sure that your 
diary never will have inck-blots or dog's ears.

WIN-DIARY is the best way to have a personal and secret document.
