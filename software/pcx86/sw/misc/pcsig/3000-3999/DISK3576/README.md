This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
900 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'INSTALL' at
the DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy
access to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.  All the programs are logically divided into thirteen
major categories with subcategories, making it easier to find just the
right software.

All of the programs have been scanned for viruses.  There are also three
online virus utilities that can be run from the CD-ROM which will scan,
screen and clean viruses.  Not only does this save hard disk space, but
also gives every user added security from viruses.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

Winner of the Optical Publishing Assn's Best Consumer Product Award.

Shareware for every imaginable need: Accounting Chemistry Educational
Engineering Games Hypertext Networks Programming Spreadsheets Utilities
Word Processing

Additional BBS file descriptions are available from PC-SIG so that the
CD-ROM can be set up quickly on a bulletin board.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 530K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
a graphics monitor (Hercules/EGA/VGA/SVGA).  A mouse is optional.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.


                      The PC-SIG Games CD-ROM
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now you can play a game a day fo over a year.  This CD-ROM is jammed
with over 380 shareware games of all types, designed to appeal to the
new generation of CD-ROM users out for fun.  The CD incorporates a
hypermedia interface and allows 250 of the games to be played directly
from the CD-ROM.

The hottest games in shareware are on this disk, including the
action/arcade games "Jill of the Jungle" and "Wolfenstein 3D," which
rival or surpass commercial PC and Nintendo for use of animation,
SoundBlaster audio, and VGA graphics.  There are also games designed to
teach children mathematics, spelling and even ecology.  All these games
for less than a dime each!

Over 250 of the games can be played directly from the CD without copying
them to a floppy or a hard drive.  Being able to run from the CD means
that users can explore games without using up valuable hard disk space
or spending time downloading and deleting files.  The hypermedia
interface makes it easy to browse the titles, read a one line
description or full review, and copy or start a game by clicking the
mouse or using the keyboard.

The jetpack model L1069-E is specially designed for human flight
with great power, but unfortunately it consumes a large quantity of
fuel.  You must find fuel for your jetpack before you can fly
around the dungeons.  Press down while flying to maintain constant
altitude.  Some levels contain no fuel, so you must rely on ladders
and be careful not to encounter any monsters on the ground.

There is also a Phase Shifter built in to your jetpack which
tunnels through bricks.  Some bricks are denser than others and
require more time to break through.  Grey stone is solid and cannot
be phased.  There are also other items that can be affected by the
Phase Shifter.  You'll have to experiment to discover what they
are.

                          ************

There are teleporters that transport you around the level, and
barriers that block your progress.  These barriers are deactivated
by pressing buttons of the same color.  Activate buttons and
teleporters by pressing down while touching them.  Monsters can
turn the barriers on and off by moving over colored floor switches. 
There are moving platforms and ladders that can help or hinder you. 
Icy bricks make it hard to walk, and some bricks are covered with
sludge, slowing your progress.  Monster Stunners, Shields, and fuel
appear randomly for a quick player to retrieve.  The Stunners make
the monsters harmless and paralyze them momentarily.  Shields
protect you from monsters, spikes, and all other hazards.

The level editor is one of the most exciting features in Jetpack. 
With it you can create thousands of your own levels to play and
share with friends.  Press [ENTER] for a layout of all 120 tiles
available for level construction.  Use the arrow keys to choose a
tile and then place it in the desired location with [SPACE].  The
joystick can also be used.  A quick way to pick a tile is to move
the cursor on to one that is already on the level screen and press
[INSERT] to pick it up.  A shortcut key for putting down background
tiles (erasing) is [DELETE].  This key is also used to erase
monsters and other objects.

If you're having trouble getting started on a level, press [R] to
randomly scatter your selected tile.  This will give you a
foundation around which to create a level.  The Block function also
helps in level construction.  Block works like the Block option in
most word processors.  Press [B] to mark the starting point of the
block, then move and press [B] again to mark the endpoint.  The
rectagonal area you have just selected is now saved in memory.  You
can press [P] to paste it down with the top-left at your current
cursor location.  Press [F] to fill the entire blocked area with
your selected tile.  Press [C] to clear the entire level.

There are eight types of monsters that you can use to make your
levels more challenging.  You can place up to 20 monsters in each
level, by pressing [1] to [8] for the monster type.  The monsters

levels, see 'Registration Information.'

==============================================================================

      SYSOPS - Read VENDOR.DOC for complete descriptions for your BBS.

    If you are interested in getting quality Shareware for your BBS system,
then become part of the Shareware Distribution Network at Software Creations.
Thousands of Sysops have joined Software Creations and more are joining every
day in setting up file sections on their BBS systems for our Shareware.  We
make all these files FREE downloads, with unlimited time to download on the
Software Creations BBS.

    Once you have a Software Creations file section set up on your BBS, and
have our Shareware in it, just call the HOME BOARD and fill out the script in
door 4 with all the information about your BBS.  Just type OPEN 4 at the main
menu.  If you are already a Shareware release point for one of our other HOME
BOARD companies then just leave me a message to get you added to our list.

    We will carry your name and numbers in our bulletin, letting people know
where they can get our products in your area.  We also hope that getting high
quality software directly from the source brings more callers to your BBS, and
more paying members.

    If downloading is too much of a problem, whole shareware file sections can
be ordered on Software Creations for only the cost of duplication and mailing.

    I wish you luck with your BBS, and hope our shareware brings you lots of 
quality BBS members.

                            * TROUBLESHOOTING *
                            *******************
PROBLEM:
     Not Enough Memory
SOLUTION:
     Try removing TSR's (such as mouse drivers) from your config.sys and
     autoexec.bat files.
     If you have DOS version 5 or above, include the line:

          dos=high

     in your config.sys file after "himem.sys" or another memory manager has
     been loaded.
     As a last resort, try disabling Sound Blaster support so the digitized
     samples will not be loaded (see command-line sound overrides).


PROBLEM:
     Movement is erratic, or there is no movement
SOLUTION:
     Press [J] to adjust your joystick(s).
     Most systems should work with joysticks set to 'AUTO' in the main menu. 
     If movement is still erratic, try either setting joysticks to 'FORCE ON'
     which will scan only port 1, or disabling joysticks.


PROBLEM:
     Sound isn't working correctly, or the game locks up
SOLUTION:
     Use the command-line sound card override.
     Load Jetpack with one of the command-line options:

          Jetpack /S0    -    No Sound
          Jetpack /S1    -    PC Speaker
          Jetpack /S2    -    Adlib (or compatible)
          Jetpack /S3    -    Sound Blaster (or compatible)


SOUND BLASTER HELP
------------------
If your Sound Blaster or compatible card is not working in Jetpack, try
setting the environmental variable BLASTER by typing:

     SET BLASTER=Axxx Ix Dx

     Axxx represents the address of the SoundBlaster/SB Pro.  For the SB,
it's either A210,A220,A230,A240,A250 or A260.  For the SB Pro, it's either
A220 or A240.  The default is A220.
     Ix represents the IRQ number used by the SB/SB Pro.  For the SB, it's
either I2, I5, or I7.  The default is I7.
     Dx represents the DMA channel used by the SB/SB Pro.  Acceptable values
are D0, D1, or D3.  The default is D1.

If the game continually locks up and you have a Sound Blaster, as a last
resort try disabling the digitized Sound Blaster samples by using the Adlib
command-line override (Jetpack /S2).

Jetpack should have come without the configuration file "JETPACK.CFG"  If you
can't solve the problems you are having, try erasing this file.  Jetpack will
create a new config file based on your system.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Outside the U.S.A. call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer in
your country.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.


To Order, in the U.S.A.: Call 800-245-6717 and ask Customer Service.

Outside the U.S.A. call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer in
your country.
