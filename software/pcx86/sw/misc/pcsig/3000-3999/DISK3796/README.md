The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We
recommend a 386 with a VGA monitor.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

NETWORK.TXT - WORLDTIME FOR WINDOWS
VERSION 2.10a
NETWORK/MULTI-USER MODE TECHNICAL SUPPLEMENT
_______________________________________________________________

Please take the time to review this file before installing and
running WorldTime 2.1 in a network environment.


WORLDTIME OPERATING MODES
-------------------------
When WorldTime is run without any command line parameters, the
program defaults to "Normal Mode."

Normal Mode is the recommended operating mode for most users,
and offers the most reliable performance whether the program
is being run on an individual PC or in a network environment.

In Normal Mode, the WorldTime 2.1 initialization file
(WTIME21.INI) is automatically stored in the host PC's default
Microsoft Windows directory (e.g., C:\WINDOWS).

Normal Mode is specifically recommended when WorldTime is used
on local area networks, since operation in this mode makes
locating and accessing the WTIME21.INI file very easy.

Normal Mode limits ALL instances of WorldTime on the user's
system to a single initialization file.  As a result, users
will NOT be able to install and run multiple copies of
WorldTime and run each with different configuration settings.

A second operating mode, "Private Mode," is available
for the benefit of users who prefer to access the WTIME21.INI
file from WorldTime's own directory (e.g., wherever the
WTIME21.EXE file is located), not the default Windows
directory.

To run WorldTime in Private Mode, the /P command line switch
should be included in the WorldTime command line, as in the
following example:

C:\WTIME\WTIME21.EXE /P

When run in Private Mode, multiple copies of WorldTime
(located in separate directories) can be run concurrently,
each one accessing its own set of configuration settings
stored in a separate WTIME21.INI file.

Copies of WorldTime installed and used in a local area
network (LAN) environment generally should NOT be run in
Private Mode, since this can complicate management of the
individual WTIME21.INI files (See Network Considerations
below).

The user can always check the operating mode of a currently
running instance of WorldTime by opening the "About WorldTime"
dialog box.


WORLDTIME SUPPORT FILE PROTOCOL
-------------------------------
WorldTime 2.1 includes a number of modifications to improve its
handling of initialization (.INI) and help (.HLP) files.

WorldTime automatically compiles a complete
drive\directory\filename path for each WorldTime support file.
Each path is stored in memory while WorldTime is running, and
used by the program whenever access to a support file is
required.

The paths of the WTIME21.INI and WTIME21.HLP files are assigned
according to the following protocol:

a) In Standard/Single-Instance Mode, the WTIME21.INI file is
created and maintained in the default Windows directory
(e.g., C:\WINDOWS) of the local user's PC.  WorldTime 2.1
obtains the drive\directory path of the Windows directory
directly from Windows itself, and assigns the INI pathname
accordingly.

b) The WTIME21.INI file is not included on the master program
disk.  This file is automatically created by WorldTime 2.1
when the program is first run.

c) The WTIME21.INI file is ONLY stored and accessed from the
default Windows directory when the program is run in
Standard/Single-Instance Mode.  If WorldTime is run with the
Multiple-Instance Mode command line switch (/M), the program
will store and access the WTIME21.INI file from the
WorldTime default directory (i.e., the directory containing
the WTIME21.EXE file).

d) The WTIME21.HLP pathname is based on the drive\directory
location of the WorldTime executable file, WTIME21.EXE.  As a
result, WTIME21.HLP MUST be located in the same directory as
the WTIME21.EXE file.

WorldTime's default support file routines will automatically
override any paths passed to the program via any "Working
Directory" entries.


Please consult the WorldTime help system (WTIME21.HLP) for
full documentation of all program features.

README.TXT - WORLDTIME FOR WINDOWS
VERSION 2.10a
_______________________________________________________________

Please take the time to review this file before installing and
running WorldTime 2.1.


INTRODUCTION
------------
WorldTime 2.1 is an easy to use international clock utility
for the Microsoft Windows operating environment.  WorldTime
can display six different international locations and their
current local times -- selected from a database of over 170
metropolitan and geographic locations worldwide.


NOTES FOR USERS OF PREVIOUS VERSIONS
------------------------------------
If you are familiar with previous releases of WorldTime,
please take note of the following new features implemented in
version 2.1:

WTIME21.INI Location
--------------------
Unlike previous releases, WorldTime 2.1 now creates and
maintains its initialization file (WTIME21.INI) in the
default Windows directory.  This change was implemented to
make the program easier to use on local area network (LAN)
systems.  Previous releases kept the .INI file in the
WorldTime directory.

For the benefit of user's who prefer keeping the WorldTime
.INI file in the WorldTime default directory, the program
can be run with the Private Mode command line switch (/P).
This forces the program to create and access its
initialization file in the WorldTime default directory
(i.e., wherever the WTIME21.EXE file is located), and also
allows multiple copies of WorldTime (stored in separate
directories) to be run with their own configuration
settings.

Configuration Dialog
--------------------
All configuration settings are now managed from within a
Configuration dialog, accessible via the menu bar
"Options/Configuration..." command.

Point-and-Shoot Mouse Support
-----------------------------
The international location selection dialogs can now be
opened by placing the mouse pointer over the selected location
display and double-clicking the left mouse button.  This
feature duplicates the functions of the six buttonbar
controls (which can now be disabled and removed from the
program window -- see "Show/Hide ButtonBar").

Reduced Memory Overhead
-----------------------
Under normal operation, WorldTime 2.1 requires less installed
memory than version 2.0.

Larger International Location Database
--------------------------------------
The number of standard locations accessible from WorldTime's
International Location Selection dialog boxes has been
increased, and includes generic time zone selections
representing all standard time zones (labeled according to
hours plus or minus Greenwich Mean Time).  This facility,
coupled with the Custom Location Name feature, enables
virtually any location to be entered and displayed in the
WorldTime program window.

Custom Location Names / Half-Hour Time Support
----------------------------------------------
WorldTime 2.1 now allows the configuration and selection of
custom locations based on WorldTime's default or standard time
(STD) location listings.  Any custom location can also be
configured as a "half-hour" time zone.

Show/Hide ButtonBar
-------------------
The buttonbar controls can now be disabled and removed from
the program window, useful if your international location
fields are set and you wish to decrease the size of
WorldTime's program window.  This toggle option is accessible
via the menu bar "Options/Show/Hide ButtonBar" command.

Iconic Time Display
-------------------
WorldTime can now display the current local time even when the
program window is reduced to an icon.  This option is
accessible from the Configuration dialog box.

Window/Icon Topmost Display
---------------------------
WorldTime can now keep its program window or icon "topmost"
among any other active applications on the Windows desktop.
This option is accessible from the Configuration dialog box.

12-Hour/24-Hour Time Displays
-----------------------------
WorldTime can now be display all times in 12-hour or 24-hour
format.  The user's selection of either option is then
reflected not only in the main program window, but in the
iconized time display and in the Set System Time dialog box.

Adjustable Text Display Color
-----------------------------
The on-screen color of each of the six international location,
day of week, and time fields can be selected from the
International Location Selection dialog box (within the "Text
Display Color" control group).


PROGRAM FILES
-------------
The WorldTime 2.1 package consists of 5 files:

	README.TXT
	NETWORK.TXT
	WTIME21.EXE
	WTIME21.HLP
	WTIME21.TXT

A sixth file, WTIME21.INI, is automatically created when the
program is first run, and is located in the default Windows
directory (e.g., C:\WINDOWS or C:\WIN).  This file contains
all WorldTime configuration information.


READ ALL ABOUT IT
-----------------
Full product documentation is contained in the WTIME21.TXT
file.  This is an ASCII text file which can be easily loaded
and viewed with Windows Notepad, Windows Write, or any word
processor or text editor that supports the ASCII text format.
This file includes a program description, instructions, and
technical notes.

Specific information regarding the use of WorldTime 2.1 in a
network environment is contained in the ASCII text file,
NETWORK.TXT.  It is STRONGLY recommended that this file is
read before installing WorldTime 2.1 on a local area network.

Hypertext program documentation is supplied in the WTIME21.HLP
file.  This is a Windows Help System format file, which can be
loaded and viewed with Windows Help -- and is directly
accessed from within WorldTime via the menu bar
"Help/Contents..." command.

Both of these files contain all the information you need to
install and run this program.  The Windows Help System
includes the provision for easily printing any topic or topics
from the WTIME21.HLP file.  This handy feature can be used to
turn your "manual on disk" into hard copy for future
reference.


QUICK & DIRTY START-UP
----------------------
We recommend that you make a backup copy of the master program
disk(s) before installing or running WorldTime.  We also
recommend that this program be installed to, and run from, a
hard disk.

To get WorldTime loaded and running with a minimum of fuss,
simply create a new directory or subdirectory on your hard
disk (e.g., C:\WTIME21) and copy the entire contents of your
master disk to that new directory.

WorldTime 2.1 does not access or require any files from
previous versions.  As a result, you may safely delete all
installed files from any previous version of WorldTime prior
to installing WorldTime 2.1

From Microsoft Windows, you can run this program from File
Manager by "double-clicking" the WTIME21.EXE file entry or by
selecting the WTIME21.EXE file entry and issuing the menu bar
"File/Run" command.

Of course, WorldTime's icon can be easily installed into a new
or existing Program Manager group for quick, one-step running.

Once running, all configuration controls are accessed from the
WorldTime menu bar and/or buttonbar controls.  A complete
summary of all commands is provided in the WTIME21.TXT file
and within the WorldTime help system.

WTIME21.TXT - WORLDTIME FOR WINDOWS
PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION - VERSION 2.10a
_______________________________________________________________

INTRODUCTION
------------
WorldTime 2.1 is a powerful international clock utility for
the Microsoft Windows operating environment.

WorldTime can display six different international locations
and their current local times -- selected from a database of
over 170 metropolitan and geographic locations worldwide.

WorldTime is flexible, too!  With just a few keystrokes,
custom location names can be substituted for any of the
standard locations.  This feature allows you to
custom-configure the WorldTime location/time displays any way
you see fit.


PROGRAM FILES
-------------
The WorldTime 2.1 package consists of five files:

README.TXT
An introductory ASCII text file, containing program notes and
"quick and dirty" installation guidelines.

NETWORK.TXT
A technical supplement dealing with the use of WorldTime 2.1
in a network environment.

WTIME21.EXE
The executable program file.

WTIME21.HLP
The Windows Help file, used for providing comprehensive
run-time help via the Windows Help system.  The help system is
accessed via the menu bar "Help/Contents" selection.  Any help
topic may be easily printed through the Windows Help menu bar
"File/Print Topic" selection.  A printable registration form
is included.

WTIME21.TXT
This file, containing program information, notes, general
instructions, and a registration form (see end of file).

A sixth file, WTIME21.INI, is created the first time
WorldTime 2.1 is run.  This initialization file is normally
located in the user's default Windows directory, and is used
for storing all configuration information.  Every time
WorldTime is run, the program checks the Windows directory
for this file and will create a new, blank WTIME21.INI file
if the original is not found.

Note:  For the benefit of user's who prefer keeping the
WorldTime .INI file in the WorldTime default directory, the
program can be run with the "Private Mode" command
line switch (/P).  This forces the program to create and
access its initialization file in the WorldTime default
directory (i.e., wherever the WTIME21.EXE file is located),
and also allows multiple copies of WorldTime (stored in
separate directories) to be run with their own configuration
settings.


PROGRAM NOTES
-------------
WorldTime 2.1 runs within the Microsoft Windows environment,
and requires the following:

* Microsoft Windows (version 3.1 or later).

* VGA or higher graphics capability (640x480 minimum
resolution).

A Windows-compatible mouse or other pointing device is
recommended, but is not required for running WorldTime.


SYSTEM CLOCK SETTINGS
---------------------
WorldTime is dependent upon the accuracy of your computer's
system clock, and your operating system's associated DATE and
TIME settings.  Both must be correct for WorldTime to
function properly.

WorldTime 2.1 includes the facility to adjust your system
TIME setting from within the program.

This is done by selecting the menu bar "Options/Set System
Time..." command.  This will open a dialog box containing
"repeating" pushbutton controls for adjusting the Hour and
Minute TIME settings.

To accept any changes, "click" the "OK" button or press the
"ENTER" key.  To discard any changes, select the "CANCEL"
button.

There are a number of other methods available for adjusting
your system DATE and TIME settings, both from Windows itself
or from the host operating system.

Consult your Windows User's Manual or your operating system
user's manual for full explanations of the DATE and TIME
functions.


INSTALLATION GUIDELINES
-----------------------
1. MAKE A BACKUP COPY
We strongly recommend making a backup copy of your program
disk.  Keep the master copy in a safe place and use the backup
disk for program installation.

2. COPY THE PROGRAM FILES
Although WorldTime can be run from a floppy disk, we strongly
recommend its installation to a hard disk.

To do this, copy the primary program files (WTIME21.EXE and
WTIME21.HLP) from your master disk to an appropriate
subdirectory on your hard disk (e.g., C:\WTIME21).

The ASCII text files, WTIME21.TXT and README.TXT, are an
important source of program information, but are not REQUIRED
in order to run WorldTime.  The WorldTime initialization file,
WTIME21.INI, is created when WorldTime is first run and
usually stored in the default Windows directory (usually
C:\WINDOWS or C:\WIN31).  The two program files (WTIME21.EXE
and WTIME21.HLP), however, ARE required, and must reside
together in the same drive and directory in order for the
program to work properly.

3. ASSIGN AN ICON
You may use the "Windows Setup" utility to assign WorldTime's
program item (icon) to a program group.  Setup will recognize
the WTIME21.EXE file and assign its icon to a program group
for you.

or...

You may assign a program item icon to WorldTime 2.1 manually,
through the Program Manager menu bar "File/New" command.

Always make sure that the complete path and correct filename
(e.g., "C:\TIME\WTIME21.EXE") is assigned to the WTIME21
program item.  The "Browse" control in the Program Item dialog
box will make it easy to locate and assign the correct path
and filename.

4. RUN THE PROGRAM
If installed correctly, the program should load from the
Program Manager screen when the WorldTime icon is
double-clicked (or from File Manager when the WorldTime
listing is selected with "File/Run" or double-clicked).

Naturally, you do not have to assign WorldTime executable file
to a Program Manager group.  The program can easily be run
directly from File Manager or any "substitute" Windows shell
or desktop application.

5. WORLDTIME OPERATING MODES
When WorldTime is run without any command line parameters, the
program defaults to "Normal Mode."

Normal Mode is the recommended operating mode for most users,
and offers the most reliable performance whether the program
is being run on an individual PC or in a network environment.

In Normal Mode, the WorldTime 2.1 initialization file
(WTIME21.INI) is automatically stored in the host PC's default
Microsoft Windows directory (e.g., C:\WINDOWS).

Normal Mode is specifically recommended when WorldTime is used
on local area networks, since operation in this mode makes
locating and accessing the WTIME21.INI file very easy.

Normal Mode limits ALL instances of WorldTime on the user's
system to a single initialization file.  As a result, users
will NOT be able to install and run multiple copies of
WorldTime and run each with different configuration settings.

A second operating mode, "Private Mode," is available
for the benefit of users who prefer to access the WTIME21.INI
file from WorldTime's own directory (e.g., wherever the
WTIME21.EXE file is located), not the default Windows
directory.

To run WorldTime in Private Mode, the /P command line switch
should be included in the WorldTime command line, as in the
following example:

C:\WTIME\WTIME21.EXE /P

When run in Private Mode, multiple copies of WorldTime
(located in separate directories) can be run concurrently,
each one accessing its own set of configuration settings
stored in a separate WTIME21.INI file.

Copies of WorldTime installed and used in a local area
network (LAN) environment generally should NOT be run in
Private Mode, since this can complicate management of the
individual WTIME21.INI files (See Network Considerations
below).

The user can always check the operating mode of a currently
running instance of WorldTime by opening the "About WorldTime"
dialog box.


NETWORK CONSIDERATIONS
----------------------
WorldTime 2.1 was designed from the outset to extremely
compact, requiring the absolute minimum in terms of disk space
and memory resources.  As a result, there is relatively
little to be gained from installing WorldTime on a network,
as opposed to simply distributing registered copies of the
program to individual users.

Still, WorldTime 2.1 may be installed onto a network and
easily "shared" between network users.

The local area network (LAN) manager should be aware that
WorldTime, when run in Normal Mode, automatically creates an
instance of its configuration file in the default Windows
directory (e.g., C:\WINDOWS) of the individual user's host
system.

On start-up, WorldTime obtains the drive/directory path of
the user's default Windows directory and appends to it the
"WTIME21.INI" filename.  This full pathname is then stored
in memory and used by WorldTime whenever read/write access
to the program's initialization file is required.

A similar routine obtains the drive/directory location of the
WorldTime executable file (WTIME21.EXE) and uses this as a
basis for the pathname assigned for access to the WorldTime
help file (WTIME21.HLP).

If WorldTime attempts to access any of these files, and they
cannot be found at the expected location, the program will
post an error message and attempt to continue operation.

Under this arrangement, WTIME21.EXE and WTIME21.HLP must be
located together, presumably on a network server PC's hard
drive.  Individual copies of WTIME21.INI will be created and
maintained in the default Windows directory used by each
individual network user (either on their local PCs or in a
subdirectory on the server's hard drive).

Note:  When run on a network, WorldTime should ONLY be
run in its Normal Mode.  Users are reminded that use of the
Private Mode command line switch (/P) forces WorldTime
into Private Mode, in which the WTIME21.INI file is
created and accessed from the WorldTime default directory
(i.e., wherever the WTIME21.EXE file is located).

Any distribution of files should be made with this protocol
in mind.

WORLDTIME CONFIGURATION
-----------------------
For WorldTime to function correctly, the program must first be
configured to your local time zone.  This is done via the menu
bar "Options/Configuration..." selection.

This menu bar selection opens the Configuration dialog box,
which contains controls for selecting your local time zone and
toggling local daylight savings time mode on or off.  These
settings must be correct if WorldTime is to provide accurate
international time updates.

The drop down list box control accesses a list of all standard
time zones around the world.  Use the keyboard cursor control
(arrow) keys or the list box scrolling control to browse the
list.  When you find your local time zone, select it by
clicking it with the mouse pointer.

DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME NOTE:  If a daylight savings time policy
is in effect in your area, the "Local Daylight Savings Time"
checkbox control should be highlighted (checked); if not, make
sure that the control is cleared.

LOCAL HALF-HOUR TIME ZONE NOTE:  If you live in a "half-hour"
time zone area (e.g., Australia's Northern Territory or South
Australia areas, India, Newfoundland, etc.), the "Local
Half-Hour Time Zone (+ :30)" checkbox control should be
highlighted.  As long as your Local Time Zone list box
selection is correct, activating this control will make the
necessary adjustments to all international times displayed.

When your setting changes are complete, close the dialog box
by clicking the "OK" button with the mouse pointer.
WorldTime's active defaults are immediately updated.

This configuration process need only be made once (assuming
your computer is not moved to a different time zone).


WINDOW/ICON DISPLAY OPTIONS
---------------------------
The "Keep Window/Icon Topmost" checkbox control enables and
disables a feature that keeps the WorldTime program window and
icon "topmost" above any other active applications on the
Windows desktop.

The "Iconic Time Display (Caption Text)" checkbox control
enables and disables a feature that displays the current local
time even when the WorldTime program window has been reduced
to an icon.

NOTE:  The "Iconic Time Display" feature requires that
WorldTime periodically update the icon caption text, an action
which will defeat most Windows-based screen savers.  If you
require the use of a Windows-based screen saver utility, we
recommend against enabling the "Iconic Time Display" option.


TIME DISPLAY OPTIONS
--------------------
The "12-Hour Clock" and "24-Hour Clock" radiobutton controls
allow easy toggling between these two methods of time display.
This setting applies not only to the program window itself,
but to the iconic time display and the time display in the
"Set System Time" dialog box.


BUTTONBAR DISPLAY OPTIONS
-------------------------
One of the distinctive features of the WorldTime program
window is the buttonbar, a row of six pushbutton controls used
for setting each of the six international location/time fields
(see INTERNATIONAL LOCATION SELECTIONS).

Once you have WorldTime configured the way you like it, the
buttonbar controls can be optionally removed from the program
window via the menu bar "Hide/Show ButtonBar" command.  The
buttonbar can be restored via the same command.

Whenever the buttonbar is removed or restored, the program
window is resized to accommodate the change.  As a result,
this option can be of some use in freeing up some space on
the Windows desktop (and to prevent accidentally opening one
of the International Location dialog boxes).


INTERNATIONAL LOCATION SELECTIONS
---------------------------------
WorldTime was designed to provide a quick and easy means of
obtaining the correct time for dozens of locations around the
world.

ButtonBar Access...
-------------------
Each of the six location/time fields may be set via the
buttonbar controls located at the top of the WorldTime screen.
The first control accesses a dialog box for selecting the
location and time displayed in the first fields, the second
control selects the location and time in the second field, and
so on.

Mouse "Point-and-Shoot" Access...
---------------------------------
If you use a mouse or other pointing device, the international
location selection dialog boxes can also be activated by
placing the mouse pointer/cursor over a selected location
display (anywhere within the text display rectangle) and
double-clicking the left mouse button.

The International Location Selection dialog boxes provide a
drop-down listbox control from which you may access any of the
over 170 standard metropolitan and geographic locations in the
WorldTime location database.

Simply scroll through the location listings and select the one
you wish displayed.  When you close the dialog box, the new
selection will appear in the appropriate location field and
the current time at that location will be displayed in the
field to the right.

NOTE:  A "blank" item is provided at the beginning of each
locations listbox, which may be selected to clear the display.

You may also select the color of the location, day, and time
text to be displayed on-screen.


CUSTOM LOCATION NAMES
---------------------
Although WorldTime's database of over 170 international
locations is more than enough for most purposes, the six
location displays can be "custom" configured to display
virtually any name or label you desire.  You can substitute a
city or town name, the name of a geographic site or landmark,
even a business or personal name!

This is made possible with a Custom Location feature, which
allows the user to select any of WorldTime's standard
locations, then attach an "alias" name to that selection.  The
custom name is then displayed in the appropriate window field
in place of the standard location.

This feature is available for each of the six display fields.

Here's how it works...

Let's say you wish to display the name and correct time of a
French city not included in the WorldTime database.  This is
accomplished in three steps:

1. Open one of the "Set Location" dialog boxes and select any
city in metropolitan France (Paris, Lyon, Marseilles, etc.).
As long as the standard WorldTime selection is in the same
time zone (and subject to the same DST policies) as your
desired location, the time displays will remain accurate.

2. Enter the alternative display name in the edit control
window.  This can be a city name, a business name, even the
name of a friend or relative.  Up to 24 alphanumeric
characters (including spaces and punctuation) are allowed.

3. Enable the alternative location display by highlighting
the "Enable Custom Name" checkbox control.

4. When the "Enable Custom Name" control is highlighted, an
optional "Half-Hour Time Zone" checkbox control is enabled.
You should highlight the "Half-Hour Time Zone" control ONLY if
the desired custom location is within an international
"half-hour" time zone.  Selecting this option will add 30
minutes to the displayed time.

NOTE:  The International Location Settings "Half-Hour Time
Zone" option is available ONLY for custom locations.  This
option is automatically disabled if the custom location name
selection is toggled off.

When all settings for the desired custom location have been
made, close the dialog box by "clicking" the "OK" button (or
pressing the keyboard "ENTER" key).  Your custom location name
will appear in WorldTime's interface screen in place of the
standard location.

Using the check box control, you can easily toggle back and
forth between the standard WorldTime location name shown in
the list box control and your customized display name in the
edit control.


TROUBLESHOOTING AND RUN-TIME HELP
---------------------------------
Comprehensive run-time help is available at any time through
the WorldTime menu bar "Help/Contents" command.

This launches the Windows Help system and loads the WorldTime
Help file, WTIME21.HLP.  This file contains detailed
instructions on configuring and running WorldTime.

You can directly access any Help topic through the Contents,
or browse from topic to topic.  Help topics may even be
printed through the Windows Help menu bar "File/Print Topic"
command -- a convenient way of turning this "manual on a disk"
into a hard copy reference.


DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME
---------------------
Assuming your PC system DATE and TIME settings are correct,
WorldTime for Windows will automatically detect any
international daylight savings time policies in effect during
its use, and compensate for them in its time display
calculations.

WorldTime 2.1 currently recognizes 10 different daylight
savings periods that come into effect all around the world,
and will make automatic adjustments to any default locations
selected in the International Location Selection dialog boxes.

If, for any reason, you wish to override this feature, 24
"Standard Time Zone" selections are available in the
International Location Selection drop-down listbox control.
These "plain vanilla" listings reflect simple one-hour
increments above or below Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), and are
not affected by international daylight savings time policies
or influenced by internal WorldTime calculations of such
policies.

Using the Custom Location Name option, you can associate any
of the "Standard Time Zone" locations with a location name of
your choice.


DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME IRREGULARITIES
------------------------------------
Daylight Savings Time is officially observed in the United
States from the first Sunday in April to the last Sunday in
October.  Even so, there are certain areas within the U.S. and
its territories that DO NOT observe Daylight Savings Time.
These include the states of Arizona, Hawaii, parts of Indiana,
the commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.

Many countries in the world observe some form of Daylight
Savings Time.  Unfortunately, the dates of observance differ
widely from nation to nation and from hemisphere to hemisphere.

Although WorldTime is designed to recognize and compensate for
Daylight Savings Time periods observed in each of the
locations listed, this requires that both the TIME and DATE
settings of your computer's system clock be correct.

NOTE:  In many parts of the world, the "official" policies
regarding Daylight Savings Time are extremely flexible, and
subject to periodic change.  Future releases of WorldTime will
attempt to keep pace with any such changes as they come into
effect.  Registered users of WorldTime will receive update
information whenever a new release is under development or
placed into distribution.  Product upgrades of this kind are
usually heavily discounted to registered users.
