The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We
recommend a 386 with a VGA monitor.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

* System wide hotkeys for each program
* Window position and size save and restore
* Icon position save and restore
* Drag and drop for programs and parameters
* Installs programs directly from the Program Manager (mark and pick)

  - US and alternate keyboard layout switch
  - Right and left mouse switch
  - CD player control (multimedia)

You can run WinDrop like any other program from the Program or File Manager.

After execution, you will see the signon dialog. After that, the main window 
of WinDrop will appear in form of an icon bar on the right hand side of your 
screen.

Help is available by pressing F1.

F10 pops up the main menu.

This icon bar can hold up to 49 program icons that you can install and run 
from this bar. When you run WinDrop for the first time it installs the most 
important applications included with Windows for you. You can install your own 
applications just by dragging them from the Windows File Manager and dropping 
them on a free slot on the WinDrop bar. Drag and drop doesn't work with the 
Program Manager, but WinDrop employs a different scheme here, called mark and 
pick. Just press the left mouse button over an empty slot and hold it down 
while you drag the mouse over a window or icon in the Program Manager and then 
release the button. The application will be installed with all Program Manager 
attributes. You can run a program by double clicking its icon on the WinDrop 
bar. To run a program with another file as parameter just drop this file from 
the File Manager on the icon on the bar. For details on how to install, 
configure or scroll these programs see the Windows help file. 

Pressing and holding down the left mouse button over the WinDrop icon on the 
top of the bar or pressing F10 pops up the main menu.

In the options dialog you can select the language that you prefer. Select 
Options... from the menu.

You should have received these files:

readme.txt	This file

windrop.exe	The executable to start it (english)
shotkey.dll	A generic DLL for hotkey management
windrop.sn	Contains the serial number
windrop.hlp	The Windows help file

windropg.dll	German language
windrops.dll	Spanish language

WinDrop is shareware and may be copied and distributed freely but not sold. 
Professional shareware distributors are allowed to charge a reasonable 
processing fee but should contact the author first before doing so. If you 
like WinDrop and use it beyond a reasonable trial period, you should register 
your copy. For details and how to earn money thru registering, see the Windows 
help file.

INTRODUCTION
------------

WINhide is a utility that allows many Windows programs, and all DOS programs
run under Windows from a PIF file, to be run invisibly, without even an icon
on the desktop.

There are some utility programs that are used to globally change the way the
Windows desktop is configured, no matter what other programs are running; it
seems to me that there's really no need to clutter the desktop with these 
unnecessary icons. Do you have icons on your desktop that you never max-
imize, never close? Then WINhide is for you. There may also be times when 
you want to run programs in the background without even an iconic reminder 
on the desktop. That's where WINhide comes in.

By the way, the reason WINhide works with some Windows programs and not others
is that some Windows programs (and not others) maintain a tight control over how
they look, and simply don't allow any changes such as being run hidden. This does
not mean they are "ill-behaved" in any way; it just means that the only way to
find out which programs WINhide works with is to try it.



INSTALLATION
------------

It's easy to install WINhide. Just copy the file WINHIDE.EXE to your hard drive
using the File Manager (or from DOS, and then call up Windows); you may first
have to extract it from the file WHIDE.ZIP or WHIDE10.ZIP, using an extraction
utility such as PKWare's PKZ110.EXE or the newer PKZ204g.EXE.

Then in Program Manager, choose

       FILE | NEW | OK | DESCRIPTION:

and type in a description such as "Windows Hide" or "Hide Program" (without the quote
marks).

Then choose

       COMMAND LINE:

and type in

       [drive][path]WINHIDE.EXE

Then be sure to check "Prompt for Parameters". This will allow you to decide at run-
time what program you want to run hidden. As an alternative, you can set up an icon
for each program you'll be running hidden; in that case, your description will be
different and you'll type in [drive][path]WINHIDE.EXE [drive][path]PROGNAME.EXE
where PROGNAME.EXE is the name of the program you want to run hidden.

By the way, WINhide will hide any DOS program, run under Windows, as long as that
DOS program is called up by a PIF file with the "Windowed" option checked. In that
case you'd type in [drive][path]WINHIDE.EXE [drive][path]PROGNAME.PIF.

At this point rather than clicking OK, I'd suggest choosing

       CHANGE ICON... | VIEW NEXT

in Windows v3.0, or in v3.1 simply

       CHANGE ICON...

to view the available icons. I've included two of them in WINHIDE.EXE although
you can of course substitute another one. Then click

       OK | OK

and that's it!


CAUTION
-------

You should be careful about which programs to run hidden. While you can certainly
(for example) run a communications program and its automated script file hidden,
you may find that if something goes wrong you have no way to stop it. Remember
that hidden programs cannot be accessed in any normal way from the desktop. In
other words, you won't be able to intervene to shut it down.

The only program I know of at this writing that will normalize a hidden program is the
METZ Task Manager. This is a feature I plan to add to WINhide version 2.0.


SUPPORT
-------

I provide support for WINhide through several means. The most direct is via
voice telephone; call me at (708) 771-8931. Please, though, don't call before
8:00 A.M. or after 10:00 P.M. Central time.

You can always reach me electronically, as well. Leave me an E-Mail message on
CompuServe, addressed to

   Erik Skamser 70521,260

or call the Robbie's Retreat BBS at (708) 526-8545 N,8,1. I regularly check in
on both CompuServe and the Robbie's Retreat BBS. These are the first places I
upload my programs and upgrades, so if you want the latest from me, download
from either of these two sources.


REGISTRATION
------------

WINhide is shareware. It is not free software. Please register your copy of
WINhide if you find it useful. A good rule of thumb is that if you find yourself
using it even occasionally after 30 days, register. If, however, you've deleted
WINHIDE.EXE from your hard drive and its icon from Program Manager... well, then
don't register.

Registration is $2.00 and it does matter. It may be a small amount of money
(this is, after all, a small utility) but every registration check I receive
helps to motivate me to continue my work on a major Windows application I've
begun. It also gives you the satisfaction of using software legally and
supporting the shareware concept.

To register your copy of WINhide, use the enclosed order form (REGISTER.TXT) or
just write down your name and address on a blank piece of paper and send it
along with $2.00 (U.S. funds only, drawn on a U.S. bank, please) to me at the
address at the top of this file. If you would like to receive the current
version by return mail, send me a disk and a self-addressed, stamped return
mailer, or just add $3.00 to defray the costs of postage and materials. Be sure
to specify your preferred disk size.

Upgrades to WINhide are always free. Registered users may download a newer
version WHIDE.ZIP from CompuServe, or WHIDEnn.ZIP or WHIDEnnn.ZIP (where nn
or nnn is the version number) from a BBS or obtain it from any source, and just
use it. Or, get the newest version directly from me; simply send a self-
addressed postage-paid return mailer and a blank floppy disk to me at the
address at the top of this file. Or, send a check or money order for US $3.00
to cover postage and handling (Canada, US $4.00, other foreign, US $6.00). If
you are a registered user, or are registering, you will receive a registered
copy; otherwise your disk and return mailer or $3.00 will get you an
unregistered evaluation copy.

Please! Feel free to pass along WHIDE.ZIP to a friend or upload it to your
favorite BBS! Just make sure it includes all of these original files:

 WINHIDE.EXE        -- the program
 WINHIDE.TXT        -- this file, in ASCII text form (read with NOTEPAD)
 REGISTER.TXT       -- Registration form
 FILE_ID.DIZ        -- Identifying information for BBS use
 DESC.SDI           -- Information for BBS use
