This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
900 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'INSTALL' at
the DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy
access to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.  All the programs are logically divided into thirteen
major categories with subcategories, making it easier to find just the
right software.

All of the programs have been scanned for viruses.  There are also three
online virus utilities that can be run from the CD-ROM which will scan,
screen and clean viruses.  Not only does this save hard disk space, but
also gives every user added security from viruses.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

Winner of the Optical Publishing Assn's Best Consumer Product Award.

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

Section 1:  Getting Started & Hardware Requirements

    Hardware:
    You must have a minimum of EGA monitor & driver for display
    and a mouse to use this program.

    One Drive System:  
    Start your computer as you normally would (with the DOS diskette)
    then insert the Melissa's Music Flashcards Diskette into drive "A",
    at the DOS prompt type in "A:\FGSMMF". The program will run slowly
    from diskette but is acceptable.

    Hard Disk System:
    Start your computer as you normally would. Make a directory
    for FGSMMF (consult your DOS manual for instructions on how to
    make a directory and copy files). Copy all the files from your
    Melissa's Music Flashcards diskette into this directory. At the
    DOS prompt type in "FGSMMF" to run the program.


PRECAUTIONS:
    To insure proper operation of the program it is best to place it
    in it's own directory. This is only a precaution, progams that
    are in their own directories do not bother or are not bothered by
    any other program. This is not a must, just a good practice.




SECTION 2:  Melissa's Music Flashcards in Windows

    To use Melissa's Music Flashcards in Windows 3.X and install the 
    Icon, use the normal procedure to start Windows. Select the window
    in which you want to install the program (refer to your windows
    manual for installation of DOS programs). Once you have installed
    the program in Windows, single click on the program just to
    highlight it. Pull down the "FILE" menu and select properties.
    Click on change icon. In the "File Name Box", type in the
    Drive:\path\icon.name, (ie: C:\MMF\FGSMMF.ICO). Click OK & OK.
    You should now have the FGSMMF icon on the screen above FGSMMF.
    If you have a problem with this procedure consult your windows
    manual.

Section 3:  General Description of Melissa's Music Flashcards

     One of the most time-honored traditions in the teaching of music and
     specifically the piano is the music flashcard.  Teachers, parents and the
     students themselves remember the often tedious chore of guessing the
     names of the notes or key signatures shown on flashcards.  It was felt
     that the learning process could be made more enjoyable and even
     entertaining by combining the value of the flashcard as a teaching aide
     with the interactive environment that the computer provides.  Melissa's
     Music Flashcards was written with this symbiosis in mind.

     The experience base required for the use of this program is limited to
     the most basic of music theory (ie. what a note is, what sharps and flats
     do, the difference between clefs, etc.)  These are levels of
     understanding encountered early in the process of learning to play a
     musical instrument and therefore serve as no obstacle to use of this
     program.  There are a number of books on musical theory in public
     libraries which could be consulted by those who wish to further explore
     the theory of music notation.

     Fundamentally, Melissa's Music Flashcards allows one to setup a flashcard
     session for a student with a specific range of notes, keys and clefs to be
     practiced.  These notes, keys and clefs are then generated randomly within
     the setup constraints and displayed graphically for the student.  The
     student then guesses the note by selecting its name from a note table.
     Correct/incorrect guesses are rewarded by an animated happy/sad face.
     HINT features can be used to help the student.  A PLAY feature allows
     notes to be sounded through the PC speaker for exploration of the effects
     of key signatures on the sounds of the notes.  With adult guidance,
     Melissa's Music Flashcards can be more than a mere flashcard program.  


Section 4:  Initialization Screen

     The opening screen consists of a column of key boxes, a column
     of clef boxes and a row of option boxes at the bottom of the
     screen. The KEY and CLEF boxes may be scrolled through with the
     cursor keys or selected with the mouse (except the SELECT NOTE RANGE
     box which can be selected only by the mouse)

     The four KEY boxes are:
              KEY OF C - To practice notes in the Key of C
            SHARP KEYS - To practice notes in the sharp keys only
             FLAT KEYS - To practice notes in the flat keys only
     FLAT & SHARP KEYS - To practice all possible key signatures

     NOTE: Except in the case of the Key of C option, pressing a number 
     key between 0 & 7 will set the upper limit on the number of sharps
     and/or flats that will be displayed (the left & right cursor keys
     will also increase & decrease this value). This feature is handy
     when introducing the concept of keys to a student.

                            Fischer Grafix & Software

Section 4:  Initialization Screen (Continued)

     The Four CLEF boxes:

           TREBLE CLEF - To practice notes in the treble (or G) clef
             BASS CLEF - To practice notes in the bass (or F) clef
            BOTH CLEFS - To select both treble & bass clefs
     SELECT NOTE RANGE - To select a custom range of notes - see below

     The Bottom option boxes:

                 BEGIN - Starts flashcard generation
                  HELP - Displays a one page quick help
                  EXIT - Exit this program to DOS


Section 5:  Flashcard Screen

     The features of the Flashcard screen allow for supervised teaching of
     note name, key signature, clef and note time value.  Unsupervised
     practice for note name allows the student to work at his own pace. 

     The Flashcard Screen displays a musical staff with clef sign, a note,
     and a number of sharps or flats if selected in the initialization menu.
     There is also a row of boxes across the top of the screen showing note
     letters with sharp and flat symbols. Across the bottom of the screen are
     some option boxes. To be shown the name of the displayed note and key,
     simply press the enter key or the right mouse button with the cursor
     positioned to the right of the note. Pressing the enter key again or
     clicking the left mouse button will cause a new note to be displayed.
     To guess the name of the note, move the mouse cursor to the upper row of
     boxes and click the right mouse button when you are positioned over the
     note name. A correct answer will result in an animated happy face
     whereas an incorrect answer results in an animated sad face. If the note
     name is sharped or flatted due to the key signature, the sharp or flat
     symbol associated with the note name should be selected.  In the regis-
     tered version a happy face and sad face also appear at the bottom of the
     after each guess to show the number of correct or incorrect guesses made
     during the current flashcard session.  To reset these to zero, merely
     EXIT the flashcard screen and immediately select BEGIN from the opening
     screen

     EXIT option box: Selecting the EXIT box at the bottom of the screen or
     hitting the ESCape key returns you to the initialization screen where
     parameters may be changed or the program exited.

     HINT option box: A display of the note on the keyboard can be seen by
     clicking on the hint box at the bottom of the screen or by pressing the
     "H" key. To really cheat, clicking the left mouse button in the center
     of the note on the staff will highlight the correct note box at the top
     of the screen.

                            Fischer Grafix & Software

Section 5:  Flashcard Screen (Continued)

     PLAY option box: To hear a rather crude rendition of the notes of the
     staff played over the cheap little PC speaker in your computer, select
     the PLAY option box by clicking on it with the left mouse button. The
     cursor will become note-shaped and if you position it on the staff and
     click the left mouse button, that note will be sounded. This may be of
     use in helping a student associate sounds with notes.  It should be of
     much use in teaching major and relative minor scales of the displayed
     key signature.  Selecting the PLAY option box a second time toggles the
     cursor to the default arrow and deselects the play feature.

Section 6: Select Note Range Screen

     The range of notes which are randomly generated during the flashcard
     session can now be limited in this section of the program to a smaller
     range than provided by the check box settings in the initialization
     screen.  This allows Melissa's Music Flashcards to be set up for use by
     beginning students of music who need to be introduced to music notation
     a few notes at a time.

     The range change screen displays the current range of notes in two
     ways.  In the upper right of the screen is a double staff showing two
     notes which represent the highest and lowest notes which will be
     generated during the flashcard session.  A keyboard is also shown with
     a pair of bracketing arrow sets for the same range.

     To change the range of generated notes, just position the arrow cursor
     over one of the arrow sets on the keyboard and click the left mouse
     button.  The cursor becomes a specialized cursor which is trapped within
     the keyboard image. This cursor moves with mouse motion and the notes on
     the staff change position simultaneously.  Move the cursor until its
     vertical line is on the key representing the range extreme you desire
     and click the left mouse button again.  The cursor returns to its arrow
     shape allowing the above process to be repeated to define the other end
     of the range. If the range thus defined falls entirely within the Bass
     Clef bracket under the keyboard, all the notes generated in the flashcard
     session will be in the Bass Clef.  Likewise for the Treble Clef.  A
     range larger than these will require both clefs being used. A range
     strictly within the overlap region will be displayed in Treble Clef only.
     A flashcard session can be created for note meters alone by setting the
     range to zero length.

     Note: When you RETURN to the startup screen, selecting one of the top
     three boxes on the right side (TREBLE, BASS or BOTH) will reset the range
     you have just redifined to their original defaults.  You may, however,
     modify the left column of boxes without affecting the changes you have
     just made to note range.  When you select BEGIN from the startup screen,
     the flashcard session begins, and the notes displayed will be within the
     range you selected in the Note Range Selection screen.

Section 7:  Screen Saver

     You may have noticed if you have already played with MMF, that a 
     screen saver becomes active if the program is left unattended for more
     than approximately 30 seconds.  This will occur in any of the screens
     except the help screens.  The delay time before activation cannot be
     currently changed from within Melissa's Music Flashcards.  It can,
     however, be modified from the DOS command line when starting the
     program by appending "Tnnn" to FGSMMF at the DOS prompt.  The "nnn" value
     is the number of seconds of delay before the screensaver starts. A value
     of "T0" disables the screen saver.  Valid values for T are 0 < T < 32766.
     (Example:  FGSMMF T13 <ENTER> will start Melissa's Music Flashcards
     with the screensaver delay set at ~13 seconds.)  Return to the program
     by moving the mouse or hitting the ESCape key.  A rather crude timer
     can be synthesized by setting the T value to the amount of time you 
     want the student to make his guess within.  Some "tweaking" of the
     T value may be required depending on the particular speed and type of
     computer you are using.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Outside the U.S.A. call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer in

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.


To Order, in the U.S.A.: Call 800-245-6717 and ask Customer Service.

Outside the U.S.A. call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer in
your country.
