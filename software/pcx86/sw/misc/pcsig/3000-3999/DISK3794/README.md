Long Description:
-----------------
ThingsToDo, Version 1.3, is a Personal Information Manager for Windows
programmed in Visual Basic 2.0. ThingsToDo allows you quickly to collect
and organize notes about meetings, to-dos, calls, etc.  It takes only
moments to install and master, yet gives you great power in searching,
organizing and displaying your notes.  It draws on the familiar Windows
interface.  Unlike many new Windows applications, however, it makes 
minimal demands on your system's memory and storage capacity.  It is 
ideal for notebook computers with limited storage capacity.  ThingsToDo
is distributed as shareware with a registration fee of $35.00.

The following are some of the key features of ThingsToDo:
1.  Items of all types, including information about meetings, projects,
    people, and tasks, are kept in a single database.  This allows you to
    mix types of information on reports, to access any type quickly, and 
    to scan across all types for those which have a particular word or
    phrase, or those which are scheduled for a particular week or day.

2.  You are able to enter and retrieve items which contain a minimum of 
    information.  All you really have to enter is a brief summary.  You 
    are not required to enter dates, times, priorities, etc., for various
    tasks but may use these fields if desired.

3.  For each item, you can enter an associated note which can be as much 
    as 15 pages in length.  You may elect, on an item-by-item basis to 
    print associated notes when an item appears on a particular report.

4.  Key word searches are applied not only to a summary that has been 
    entered for an item, but also to any text which has been entered in
    associated notes.

5.  Notes for a particular item are stored in a separate file in an ASCII
    format. You can easily pull the note into the word processor or text 
    editor of your choice, massage it, and print it.

6.  A set of memorable Hot Keys have been defined to allow you quick access
    to the majority of the features of ThingsToDo.

7.  ThingsToDo helps you as much as it possibly can on the entry of dates 
    and times, minimizing the need to worry about punctuation.

8.  You are able quickly to mark an item as completed and to purge 
    completed items.

9.  Tasks assigned to a particular day but have not been completed are
    automatically displayed. You will not lose track of them merely because
    the date has passed.

If you have things to do,  you may need ThingsToDo.  It is pro-
grammed for Windows 3.0 and 3.1 in Visual Basic 2.0 ("Windows" 
and "Visual Basic" are trademarks of Microsoft Corporation) and
is designed to allow you to keep track of a wide range of items
or information and organize them into schedules and lists of 
tasks.   I developed ThingsToDo when I became frustrated with
various other "personal information managers" that I  tried. The
intention was to keep it simple so that I could quickly enter 
notes, ideas and commitments.  But I wanted the powerful search
and view features that would make this data entry worthwhile and
keep me from reverting to using my pocket calendar and post-its.
I hope you will find that ThingsToDo gives you a proper blend of
simplicity and power.   Here are some of its key features:

1.      Items of all types, including information about meetings,
projects, people, and tasks, are kept in a single database.  This
allows you to mix types of information on reports, to access any
type quickly, and to scan across all types for those which have a
particular word or phrase, or those which are scheduled for a
particular week or day.

2.      You are able to enter and to retrieve items which contain
a minimum of information.  All you really have to enter is some
brief summary.  You are not required to enter dates, times,
priorities, etc., for various tasks but may use these fields if
desired.  

3.      For each item, you can enter an associated note which can
be as much as 15 pages in length.  You may elect, on an item-by-
item basis to print associated notes when an item appears on a
particular report.

4.      Key word searches are applied not only to a summary that
has been entered for an item, but also to any text which has been
entered in associated notes.

5.      The notes for a particular item are stored in a separate
file in an ASCII format, allowing you easily to pull the note into
the word processor or text editor of your choice, massage it, and
print it.

6.      A set of memorable Hot Keys have been defined to allow you
quick access to the majority of the features of ThingsToDo.

                                                             Page 1 of 3




7.      ThingsToDo helps you as much as it possibly can on the
entry of dates and times, minimizing the need to worry about
punctuation.

8.      You are able quickly to mark an item as completed and to
purge completed items from your database.

9.      Tasks which have been assigned to a particular day but
have not been completed are automatically displayed, so you will
not lose track of them merely because the date has passed.


It is very easy to get ThingsToDo up and running.   Just follow
these steps:

1.      Create a subdirectory named C:\Windows\Things
	(assuming that Windows is in C:\Windows.)

2.      Copy "Thingz.Exe" from the diskette to C:\Windows\Things.

3.      Type "Thingz" and press the Enter key.  This
self-extracting file will create all of the needed ThingsToDo
files.

4.      You may then start ThingsToDo in any of the customary
ways: 
	 double-click the "Things.Exe" filename on the File Manager,
	 place the command "C:\Windows\Things\Things.exe" on the
		      "Load" or "Run" lines of your WIN.INI file,
      use the "FILE/RUN" option of Program Manager,  or 
	 set up a new icon on your desktop and double-click it.

5.      For further instructions, print out and review the 
	  "Things.Wri" file using Write.  



If (heaven forbid!) you try ThingsToDo and decide that it does not
suit you, you can easily uninstall it.  Just delete the files in the
C:\Windows\Things subdirectory and then delete the subdirectory itself.
ThingsToDo in no way modifies the WIN.INI or SYSTEM.INI files used
by Windows.



REGISTRATION

ThingsToDo is a "shareware program" and is provided to you for 
evaluation at no charge.  Feel free to share it with your friends,
but please do not give it away altered or as part of another system.
The essence of "user-supported" software is to provide personal 
computer users with quality software without high prices, and yet 

                                                          Page 2 of 3


to provide incentive for programmers to continue to develop new 
products.  If you find this program useful and find that you are 
using ThingsToDo and continue to use ThingsToDo after a reasonable
trial period, you must make a registration payment of  $35.00 to 
The Manager, Inc.  You are encouraged to pass a copy of  ThingsToDo 
along to your friends for evaluation.

The full terms under which ThingsToDo is offered and a description 
of our support policies are contained in the manual.

When you register, I will send you a copy of ThingsToDo which does
not display the annoying registration notice at startup.  I will 
also answer your questions, keep you informed about updates, and 
take your comments into account as we plan new updates. I welcome 
your comments, questions and suggestions.
