Disk Title: Psychic Piano
PC-SIG Version: S1

Program Title: Psychic Piano
Author Version: S.02B
Author Registration: $15.00
Special Requirements: No special requirements.

PSYCHIC PIANO is a computerized version of Name That Tune and includes
over 650 songs. Play against the computer or with eight other players.
Guess the music's title from a multiple-choice list as the computer
plays the song on its speaker. Or, listen to the songs without playing
the game. To do this, look up a song by its title or category (show
tunes, Christmas, etc.), or just browse through the entire list. The
songs have a computerized beep-beep quality to them, but are nicely done
and very easy to identify - that is, if you know them.

One interesting feature is Psychic Piano's ability to let you add songs.
Just type in the notes by their letter equivalent. Psychic Piano covers
all the bases from "Bicycle Built for Two" to "Silent Night" to "Theme
From Father Knows Best" to "Hotel California." A fun program for any
music fan.

  Thank you for trying out PSYCHIC PIANO.  Here are some helpful
  hints to get you started...

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    MAIN FEATURES OF PSYCHIC PIANO
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  ■ COMPLETE INVENTORY OF OVER 650 SONGS FROM A DOZEN CATEGORIES, INCLUDING:
    - AMERICANA/FOLK (e.g., "Bicycle Built For Two", "Home Sweet Home")
    - GEOGRAPHIC NAMES (e.g., "Moon Over Miami", "Hotel California")
    - MOVIES/BROADWAY/TELEVISION (e.g., "Theme from Father Knows Best"
    - NAMES (e.g., "ALFIE", "AUBREY", "BEN")
    - CHRISTMAS (e.g., "Silent Night", "Deck the Halls")
    - YOUTH (e.g., "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star", "It's a Small World")

  ■ TITLE-THAT-TUNE GAME CAN ACCOMODATE UP TO 9 PLAYERS
    - Play Solo or with up to 9 players
    - Optional Song Categories displayed as clues
    - Definable Window Size (5-20 Songs Multiple-Choice)
    - Countdown Timer
    - Choice of Scoring Options and Handicapping
    - An optional Category of Songs may be selected

  ■ UNIQUE "SEARCH BY NOTES" FEATURE WITH AUTO-TRANSPOSITION
    - If you can play some notes on the "piano", you can search and play
      back songs from the library without knowing their titles!
    - You may add your own songs or change the timing of Library Songs.
    - If a unique song is found, it will automatically play back in the
      same key that you entered for the search notes.

  ■ SEARCH SONGS BY CATEGORY
    - Songs having a common characteristic (e.g., Foreign Songs) may be
      grouped together for display or playback.
    - The last category scanned can be used in the "Title-That-Tune" game.

  ■ SEARCH SONGS BY TITLE
    - If you know one or two words of a song, the Title Search will find
      every song that includes the search string.

  ■ BROWSE ENTIRE LIBRARY
    - Browse forward or backward, a song at a time or a screen at a time;
      you may flip to the beginning or end of the library, or go to the
      start of the desired letter of the alphabet.
    - The timing of any song can be added or changed.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    SOME GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS AND HINTS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 1. From any list of items displayed in a window, the mouse or cursor keys
    may be used to highlight and select the desired entry.  The [Enter] key
    or [M1] (left Mouse button) is typically used for selecting; [Esc] or
    [M2] (right Mouse button) is used to quit or cancel a function.

 2. When using the Mouse to select, it is usually necessary to double-click
    (press [M1] twice quickly).

 3. Prompts will usually appear either at the top line, the bottom 2 lines,
    or both.  If in doubt, PLEASE READ INSTRUCTIONS ON THE SCREEN!!!

 4. If you expect to find a unique song using Note Search, you can usually
    press a key after a beep indicates that a song has been found; if left
    until completion, all songs that match the search notes in all other
    keys will be displayed.

 5. To use one of the song categories as input to the game, simply do a
    category search to display the songs from the desired category, exit,
    and start the game.  You will be asked if you wish to use the last song
    category when starting the game.

 6. When playing the game with other players, remember that MORE THAN ONE
    player may try to answer; the first player number pressed will be given
    first crack at the answer; if it's wrong, the next player will have a
    chance.  Observe the bottom status line carefully to see what's going on.

 7. The default window size for the game is 20 songs.  You may specify a
    window size from 5 to 20 songs BEFORE starting the game:
    e.g.,  SONGS 12    specifies a window for 12 songs in the game.

 8. The notes and timing may be a little off for some songs, but hey, I had
    to enter EVERY SINGLE SONG and I get tired!  Hopefully, you can at least
    be able to recognize them.  If it REALLY bothers you, then change it!

 9. If you can allocate a portion of memory for a virtual (electronic) disk,
    the speed of the Note Search feature will improve dramatically!

                       press [Esc] when FINISHED 
