Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you

The brand new PC-SIG World Of Windows is a must-have for Windows users.
In order to produce the best possible Windows collection PC-SIG has made
an alliance with the acclaimed Windows OnLine BBS. So not only do you have
access to the collecting and weeding out efforts for which PC-SIG is
famous, but also the huge volume of fonts and sound files and the in-depth
software reviews of the world's best Windows BBS.

This CD contains every one of the best Windows shareware programs
available, 350+ in all, over 900 TrueType fonts which can be used
without royalties, 429 ATM fonts, over 2,000 sound files in .WAV,
.VOC, .SND, .SOU, .MID format and 2,794 icons! A major computer
catalog is offering a collection of 250 fonts for $49.95. They have
great prices on hardware and software, but this time they can't
touch us.

As if the files aren't enough, we thought you would want to preview
and use these sounds, fonts, icons and programs directly from the CD,
without taking the time and space to unarchive them. So we have
included a font previewer and installed, a sound player and an icon
manager. Over 200 of the programs can be run simply by clicking on
them in the File Manager. Nobody else offers you anything close to
this type of access.

We're not done yet. In add to all the Windows riches described above,
this CD also contains the text and programs from the July-August
issue of Shareware Magazine. This is the second in a six-volume PC-SIG
Encyclopedia of Shareware CD-ROM series (Games was the first). Each
volume includes the programs from a section of the PC-SIG Library plus
all the text and every program from the current issue of Shareware
Magazine. Software reviews for this issue cover over 100 programs
including games, communications, printing, text editors and more. 124
of the programs mentioned in the magazine are included, plus 225
programs updated since the May-June issue.

                                OBJECTIVE


     The objective of Crusher Castle is to find your way out of a Haunted
     Castle made up of 25 different rooms filled with Ghosts.


                                Game Play

     When the game begins, you will find yourself in the center of the
     Castle in room 13.  There is a Room Map on the left side of the
     screen which will show you your location in the Castle at all times.

     Your man will appear by one of the four exits in room 13.  Using
     your <Arrow Keys> you can move your man around the room.


                          Objects / Objectives

     There are various objects you will see in each room.  There are
     Brown Closets, Gold Bags, Candles, Bombs, Boxes, and of course
     Ghosts.  These Ghosts will always be after you as make your
     escape out of the Castle.


                         10,000 Point Objective

     Before you can even begin in your quest to find the way out of
     the Castle, you first must acquire 10,000 points.  When you begin
     your journey you have 3 Men, 5 Candles, and 4 Bombs in your
     inventory. Your inventory is shown on the left side of the screen at
     all times. A Room Map is also displayed showing your location within
     the Castle.


                             Boxes and Bombs

     There are Boxes which are scattered about the room.  These can be
     pushed around the room to help you avoid the Ghosts.  They can
     also be blown up with a bomb which will remove them from the room.
     If you have bombs collected, you can blast a Box by pressing the
     <Spacebar> to activate the bomb.  Then press the <Arrow Keys> for
     the direction you want the bomb to explode.  Pressing the
     <Spacebar> key again or moving in another direction where there
     is no Box will de-activate the Bomb and it will not be used up.


                     Gold / Candles / Closets / Ghosts

     In most of the rooms you will see Bags of Gold, Candles, Closets
     and those nasty Ghosts.  Points are awarded for capturing these
     items.  Crushing Ghosts (trapping them) is done by pushing the 
     Boxes so that the Ghost has nowhere to move.  After he is trapped,
     in a few seconds he will vanish and a candle will appear somewhere
     in the room.

     Candles are the most important objects you will need.  Without
     candles the game will be over no matter how many men you have left.
     Therefore make sure you always have enough candles.  ( Hint: this
     is really important as you near your escape.)  If your candles get
     down to 3, then a warning will flash.  This means you had better
     find some more candles or you will fail in your quest to find your
     escape.  Approximately every 24 moves by your man, a candle will be
     used up.  Every time you change rooms, half a candle will be used.

     Closets are located in every room.  Inside the closets might be
     Candles, Bombs, or other items which can help (or hurt you), but
     you can never lose a life by opening a closet.  

     Hint: These closets are the key to finding your escape route out 
     of the Castle.


                                 Ghosts

     There are always Ghosts which will try to catch you.  The white
     ghosts are the slowest, the pink ghosts are faster, and the light
     green ghosts are the fastest.  If you can trap a ghost with the
     boxes so that he cannot move, you will be awarded points and
     he will vanish from the room.  As a bonus, a candle will then
     appear somewhere in the room.  If you trap two ghosts together,
     they will not be considered trapped.  They must be trapped 
     separately.


                          Points / Scoring
                       -------------------------
                         Candles   =  50 Points
                         Bombs     = 100 Points
                         Gold Bags = 150 Points

               Trapped White Ghost = 200 Points
               Trapped Pink Ghost  = 300 Points
               Trapped Green Ghost = 400 Points

                         Extra Man = Every 10,000 Points



     An Extra man is given to you for every 10,000 points.  Your first
     objective when beginning the game is to reach this 10,000 point
     mark. After that, you will be given clues to the later stages of 
     the game.  You will come into contact with things like Magic Cats,
     Old Maps, Keys, Secret Passageways....  Each will give you extra
     points once found.



                      Exiting and Entering Rooms

     By looking at the Room Map on the left side of the screen, you can
     see where you are in the Haunted Castle.  Since you are starting
     in the center room number 13, there are 4 exits from the room.

     To exit a room, simply look for an exit on one of the sides and
     move your man through it.  The man will then disappear from the
     room and enter the next room to continue his journey.  Once you
     leave a room, the Ghosts you have crushed and the Closets you
     have opened will re-appear the next time you enter that room but
     in different locations.  Remember that every time you exit a room
     and go into another, it will use up half a candle !


                             END OF GAME

     If you run out of Candles or lose all your Men, then the game
     will be over.  The game checks to see whether your score is
     in the Top Ten High Scores.  If it qualifies, then you will
     be asked to enter your initials onto the scoreboard.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

                              OBJECTIVE

    The objective of Wall Pipe is to try to keep the water flowing
    as long as possible by placing down pipe links to direct its flow.



                            GAME PLAY / CLOCK

    On the left side of the screen, you will see 4 different shaped
    pipes.  The mouse cursor will be on top of the bottom pipe.
    Clicking the mouse button will make the pipe disappear and the
    mouse cursor will then appear on the game board itself.  Clicking
    the mouse button again, will place that pipe onto the game board.

    When the game begins, there is a clock located on the left side
    of the screen.  At the first level, you will have 40 seconds to
    place pipes before the water starts to begin flowing from the
    Water Well which is light blue.  Once the water has begun to flow,
    you can still keep placing pipes down on the game board in order
    to keep ahead of the onrushing water.



                             PLACING PIPES

    You may place a pipe anywhere on the game board where there is an
    empty space.  You can also place a pipe on top of a previously
    placed empty pipe, however there will be a time delay of 3 to 4
    seconds.  This can be really fatal when trying to keep just ahead
    of the water flow.  If water has already entered a pipe, then you
    will be unable to place another pipe at that location.


                             LEVELS / WALLS

    As you move to higher levels, the initial clock timer will have
    less and less time before the water starts to flow from the well.
    On some levels there are blank brick walls which will prevent you
    from placing pipes there.  They can either be stationary or will
    shift around with each pipe placed.


                             PIPES & OBJECTS

    There are many different types of pipes and objects you can use to
    help you keep the water flowing.


     WATER WELL:     It is from here the water will begin to flow
     light blue      once the clock timer runs out time.

           HOLE:     There are sometimes two holes placed on
           pink      the game board.  If you can get the water
                     to flow into it, then the water will emerge
                     flowing in the same direction from the other
                     hole located somewhere else on the board.

    DIRECTIONAL:     The water must flow in the direction of the
    PIPES            arrows or else it will be considered a dead end.

    BONUS PIPES:     Bonus Pipes and Tubs give you extra points if
                     you can get the water to flow through them.

    CROSS PIPES:     These cross pipes allow you to loop the water
                     through itself for extra bonus points. These loops
                     are essential for getting to higher levels.

           SINK:     If you see a Sink on the game board, you * MUST *
                     end the water flow there, or the game will be over
                     regardless of the points scored.  The game will
                     remind you of that on levels which have a Sink on
                     them.



                             SCORING

    At the start of each level, the points needed to progress to the
    next level is shown below the game board.  The longer the water
    flows through the pipes, the more points are scored.

    When the water reaches a dead end (no pipe), then the level will
    be over.  Pipes that were not used, will be eliminated from the
    game board.  Each unused pipe will cost you 20 points off your
    total score.  If your total score is equal to or higher then the
    points needed to continue, then you will be allowed to proceed
    to the next level.

    The higher the level, the more points will be needed to keep
    advancing to higher levels.   (LEVEL * 10) + 200


    Every 8000 points will give you a Bonus Round.  You cannot lose
    any points during the Bonus Round.  Unused pipes are not deducted
    from your score.

                         WATER LOOPS

              50  Points :  Looping Water through itself
             400  Points :  4 to 7 Loops made
             800  Points :  8 to 11 Loops made
             1500 Points :  12 to 15 Loops made
             3000 Points :  16 or more Loops made

             75   Points :  Using the Hole
             50   Points :  Using the Directional Pipes

                          BONUS ROUND

       A Bonus Round is given for every 8000 points scored.



                            GAME OVER

    The game is over when you do not reach the score needed to advance
    to the next level.  The program will then see if you qualify for the
    Top Ten High Scores.  If you do, then you will be asked to enter your
    initials onto the scoreboard and your score will be recorded.
