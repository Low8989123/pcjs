The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We
recommend a 386 with a VGA monitor.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

## ICONMGR.TXT

May 12, 1993

This is the README.TXT file distributed with Icon
Manager version 3.2.

OVERVIEW
--------
Icon Manager is a powerful tool for working with
icons in the Windows operating environment.  The
same drag-and-drop interface used by Program Manager
allows icons to easily be moved, copied, and organ-
ized into files within Icon Manager.  Unlike other
applications which offer awkward procedures for
installing icons into Program Manager, Icon Manager
will install icons into Program Manager or Norton
Desktop DIRECTLY using the wizardry of Windows'
Dynamic Data Exchange.  For those who would like
to create or edit their own icons, Icon Manager
taps the power of OLE to whisk you into a edit
session with Paintbrush by just double-clicking on
an icon.  All of these features and more make
Icon Manager the most complete icon tool available
for the Windows operating environment.  (A 32-bit
version of Icon Manager has already won first place
in its class in the Microsoft Windows NT Shareware
Contest during Fall Comdex '92).

REGISTRATION
------------
Icon Manager is not free software.  It is released
as shareware, which provides the opportunity for
the program to be evaluated before it is purchased.
Complete information on how to register Icon Manager
is included in the REGISTER.TXT file.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
Icon Manager includes on-line help that covers all
aspects of program operation.  Some customers have
asked why Icon Manager does not come with an oper-
ations manual.  The main reason for this is that
since the first release of Icon Manager in 1990,
Impact Software has never asked registered users
for an upgrade fee.  New versions that users
acquire from their shareware channel continue to
honor earlier registrations.  By including on-line
help with each release, we are able to provide up-
to-date information for new and old customers
alike.

This is not intended to suggest that upgrade
version will always be free, but rather that
this method of providing documentation makes
it easier for us to provide no-charge updates
when possible.


INSTALLING ICON MANAGER
-----------------------
The Icon Manager package includes a graphical Windows
installation program using the standard name of SETUP.EXE.
You should place all of the files included in the package
on a floppy disk or in a temporary directory of your hard
drive.

SETUP requires about 210K bytes of hard disk space to
complete the installation of Icon Manager.

Run SETUP by selecting the 'Run...' command from the
File menu of Program Manager or File Manager. Enter
"d:\SETUP" as the Command Line, where "d" is the
drive/directory that you are installing Icon Manager FROM
(i.e. A:\SETUP).

SETUP will prompt for the target directory you would like
to install Icon Manager to on your hard disk.  Accept the
default or enter a directory of your choice.  Select OK
to install Icon Manager.


NEW FEATURES IN THE 3.2 RELEASE OF ICON MANAGER
-----------------------------------------------

The following additions and changes have been added in
the 3.2 release of Icon Manager:

  - Icons can now be replaced within Windows program
    files.  Just drag the new icon you would like to
    use over the one you want to replace and drop it!

  - The Arrange option on the Window menu now
    cascades to reveal two selections.  Select Align
    Only to perform a normal row and column
    arrangement.  Select Alphabetize to perform an
    alphabetical sort during the arrange.


NEW FEATURES IN THE 3.1 RELEASE OF ICON MANAGER
-----------------------------------------------

The following additions and changes have been added in
the 3.1 release of Icon Manager:

  - Icon Archive files now store a description for an
    icon.  If you open earlier versions of archive files
    the descriptions will be "(Untitled)".  Icon Manager
    will read old format icon archives.  Their "changed"
    flag will be automatically set when they are opened.
    When you select to save them they will be written in
    the new format.

    (Version 3.1a allows icon descriptions to be used in
    icon library files as well.)

  - Icon windows act more like Program Manager's.  There
    is a "current selection" for each window.  The icon
    description will be highlighted in archive windows.
    All other windows display a dotted frame around the
    current selection.  Use the mouse or keyboard arrow
    keys to move the icon selection.

  - The right mouse button can be clicked on any icon to
    display a popup menu of actions that can be performed
    on the icon.

  - Icons can now be edited via an OLE session with
    Windows Paintbrush by double-clicking on them.

  - Icons can be installed *directly* into Program Manager
    using the Install Icon function.  A supporting *.ICO
    file is created to be used by Program Manager when (if)
    your video display format changes.  The Reconcile
    Configuration function can be used at any time to cause
    Icon Manager to look for ICO files it created which are
    no longer in use by Program Manager.

  - Icon Manager takes advantage of the sound capabilities
    of Windows 3.1.  Select the File.Sound menu option to
    configure your audio preferences.  If you have the
    hardware to play digital *.WAV sounds, you can request
    sound effects associated with the drag and drop as
    well as deletion operations on icons.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

1. OVERVIEW         

WinLock protects your Microsoft Windows and LAN 
environment from unauthorized users. The easy to 
use security features locks Windows at start up, 
on demand, and automatically when your away from 
your desk. When locked all mouse and keyboard 
activity is restricted. Intruders are met with 
a flashing red screen, an audible alarm, and 
deterrent messages. The security audit trail 
provides you with a record of unauthorized 
password attempts. Your Windows environment 
remains secure even when your PC is rebooted 
from floppy. Since, WinLock is compatible with 
most commercially available screen savers you 
can enable your favorite screen saver without 
locking your system. WinLock provides an 
additional level of security to any Novell, 
LAN Manager, or Banyan network.
