  WindowMagic is a utility that will let you easily assign an Icon to
  the Program Mangers Group or Application Icons. It also has a very
  useful Quick Launch feature that allows you to launch a program 
  from a minimized group.  WindowMagic uses a drag & drop icon 
  management interface to make icon customization quick, easy and fun.

  WindowMagic 1.1 now contains a ToolBar Facility.  This facility allows
  you to create a free floating tool bar from a program manager group.


  Installation
 
  NOTE: If you are using WindowMagic 1.0 please disable the program
        before installing the new version.

  1) Select the startup group from the program manager.

  2) Select the [File] menu selection from the program manager, then 
     choose the [New] and [Program Item] options from the displayed menu
     and dialogs.

  3) Type in the full path name where WindowMagic was installed  
     I.E. C:\WMAGIC\WMAGIC.EXE

  4) Save your new item by clicking on the OK button.

  5) Quit and restart Windows to activate the program, or double
     click on the new icon in the startup group.
 

  /*************************************************************************
  * How to use
  **************************************************************************
  WindowMagic uses a simple drag and drop interface.  To use the utility
  select the [WindowMaigc] item from the Program Managers menu.  

  1. Select [WindowMagic]
        You will be presented with a popup menu of all available choices
        for WindowMagic.  Select "View Icon Palette" and then choose
        an .EXE,.DLL or .WMP file.  Hint: try a .WMP first. The WMP file
        is located in the directory that you unzipped the program in.

  2. The icons stored in the file you have choosen will be presented in 
     a paletteized form.  Simply click and hold the left mouse button when 
     the cursor is over an icon you wish to use. Now drag the icon over a 
     Program Manager group or Application icon and release.  
     (The cursor will change from a circle/slash to a B&W icon 
     when it is over a valid drop area.)

  3. Once you get the hang of dragging and dropping icons, try Creating your 
     own Icon Palette.  With WindowMagic you can Import Icons from just about 
     anywhere. Place several palettes on the screen and you're ready for 
     hours of fun selecting, collecting, and mixing your own icon libraries!

                   list box with icons, or a vertical/horizontal button
                   bar.  The bars are minimizable and will retain the
                   Icon associated with the group or program.  Drag and
                   Drop function on the bars. Quick Access is also available

Introduction & Welcome

Thank you for previewing WindowMagic Shareware, The productivity enhancement 
tool for Windows. You are joining a world wide group of satisfied customers who
use WindowMagic every day to enhance their Windows environment.

The first Windows program you and your colleagues ever used was the Program 
Manager. You are probably very comfortable and knowledgeable about the Program 
Manager, however as you may have noticed there are certain inconsistencies, and
missing features in the Program Managers design.

There used to be one solution to this problem, purchase an expensive new type of 
"Program Manager" from a third party vendor.  Unfortunately besides being costly
it requires you to learn an entirely new way of doing things. WindowMagic 
finally provides you with a low cost, easy to use solution to this dilemma.     

WindowMagic extends and enhances the capabilities of the Program Manager instead
of trying to replace it.  WindowMagic seemlessly integrates itself with the 
Program Manager, fixes a major inconsistency, enhances a number of features, and
teaches an old dog a few new tricks. Although the Program Manager is greatly
enhanced by the addition of WindowMagic, you are not required to relearn any of
the skills you previously acquired. Everything still works like it used to, you
just have a few more features at your disposal. 
  
Please take a few moments to read the users guide so that you are familiar with
WindowMagic and all that it has to offer.
 
We at WinWear are committed to enhancing the environment of our users while 
offering quality products, at affordable prices. We will continue to add new
features to the product, and to enhance the existing features in order to make
the Windows environment more intuitive and productive than ever.

We would also like to hear from you, should you have any comments regarding
WindowMagic, or any suggestions on how we could improve the product, or new
features you would like to see implemented.  

If  you have any suggestions or comments please write to:

alphabetical order (sorting by usage is also supported)  Highlighting an 
application and then releasing the mouse key launches the application.  
QuickAccess supports Program Managers file association and minimize on 
use features.  

Another feature of the QuickAccess system is FastLaunch.  FastLaunch lets 
you select your favorite or most commonly used application from each group 
that is always available by simply double clicking on the minimized group. 
( notice the lighting bolt for the first menu entry, this designates your 
FastLaunch choice for the selected group)  This eliminates the need to open 
the group, or to use the QuickAccess menu for your most commonly used 
applications.

After using QuickAccess and FastLaunch most people never go back to the 
"Microsoft Shuffle" way of doing things.













Group Icon Customizer

The "Group Icon Customizer" menu selection toggles on and off the ability 
to display a custom icon for a Program Manager group. 

This selection must be enabled in order for you to see the customizations 
you have made to the Program Managers group icons.  If you would like to 
disable this function at any time, simply access the WindowMagic menu and 
select the Options menu and then the "Group Icon Customizer" 
menu entry. 

This option only affects whether or not the customized groups are displayed, 
so don't worry about losing any changes you may have made. WindowMagic will 
remember what Icons were attached to your Program Manager groups, Simply 
re-enable the Customization option and the Icons that were previously 
selected for your Groups will reappear! To select this function with a 
hot key keys use the "Alt+G" key sequence.


Windows Exit Enhancement

to use the "Windows Exit Enhancement" feature.  If you would like to 
disable this function and use the standard Windows exit dialog, simply 
access the WindowMagic menu and select the Options menu then select the 
"Windows Exit Enhancement" menu entry.  

To re-enable the "Windows Exit Enhancement" feature simply access the 
WindowMagic menu and select the Options Menu then select the 
"Windows Exit Enhancement" menu entry and the ability to utilize the 
function will be re-enabled.  To toggle this feature with the hot key 
use the "Alt+E" key sequence.






Using Enhanced Exit

Being a Windows user you know that occasionally you want to exit and 
then immediately restart Windows, or possibly re-boot your machine. 
You might want to do this when you receive a program error, or maybe 
you just want to start fresh. WindowMagic makes this simple and easy 
by providing an enhanced exit dialog that replaces the 
Program Managers.  

Additionally all exit features are accessible without bringing up the 
dialog by using the ALT-X, ALT-R, or ALT-B hot key sequences 
respectively.  This allows for a very fast means of exiting Windows 
without using the Program Managers exit dialog.   

Help

The "Help" menu entry displays the help topic available for the 
WindowMagic program If you would like to use help for WindowMagic, 
simply access the WindowMagic menu and select the "WindowMagic Help" 
Menu item and the help dialog will appear.

About WindowMagic

The "About WindowMagic" menu entry displays the:  Registered user, 
Version Number, Serial Number. and WinWear's telephone number so you 
can tell all your friends what a great product WindowMagic is, or 
report a problem.  If you would like to view the "About WindowMagic" 
screen, simply access the WindowMagic menu and select the 
"About WindowMagic" menu item and the "About WindowMagic " 
dialog will appear.

Disable WindowMagic

The "Disable WindowMagic" menu entry disables WindowMagic until 
you restart Windows or restart WindowMagic.  If you would like to 
disable WindowMagic, then simply access the WindowMagic menu 
and select the "Disable WindowMagic" menu entry, or use the "Alt+D" hot 
key sequence.
