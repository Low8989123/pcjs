Beyond basic client scheduling, Architect's Helper [TM] contains powerful 
financial extensions, such as the creation of summary or detail statements, 
for any historical or current period.  In addition to aggregating all 
billable items for an architect, this program will also calculate any add-
on charges.  If selected, this feature will calculate add-on interest and 
will then place those charges into newly created activity records, then 
upgrade the summarized value during the posting process to reflect these 
additional charges.    The period selected by the architect for this 
automatic calculation could be either yearly, monthly, weekly, or daily.  
To see these financial features, please note selection 4 on the Main 
Program Menu:  Revenue/Expense.  Once you select '4', you will then see the 
Revenue/Expense Summary Menu and its Help screen.


                  ===== Speed, Power, Ease of Use  =====

Speed, Power, Ease of Use is more than just a phrase that appears within 
the program in the exploding graphics Install procedure.  It is my 
commitment to you to deliver the best, most stable, high performance 
business software available today.

One concrete example of this theme of Speed, Power, Ease of Use is the new 
implementation of Alternate Phone Numbers.  To see it, go into the Main 
Program Menu, Option 1) Client File.  Once you have selected option 1, 
observe the 'G' selection for G)et Client.  Upon your entering the 'G' key, 
you will see  the first client record in the test data for Architect's 
Helper [TM].  On the bottom right of the screen is this definition of the 
function keys for each Client record: 


                  F1 = Background    F7 = Flash Report
                  F2 = Tag/Untag     F8 = Dial Phone
                 F3 = Quick Label    F9 = Hang up Phone
                 F4 = Memo           F10 = Detail File
                  F6 = Act Now   ALT F1 = More Phones


Once you select ALT F1, the program presents the "Alternate Phone Number 
Options"  Menu.  This feature gives you an additional 20 alternate phone 
numbers PER Client.  For each of the 20 phone numbers, you can enter an 
area code and a descriptive phrase.   Each description can be up to 40 
characters.  In addition to the Client Get screen, this option is also 
available in the Activity Add, Activity Get, and Activity Callback screens.  
As robust as this new feature is, it requires only 10 characters per client 
record, using a Paul Sax-designed variable field PHONE_2 in the main file.

Dear Paul:

Your software program, Architect's Helper [TM], has been most helpful to 
our office. It is very well thought out, creatively designed and an 
efficient program that we have used for some time now.

Of specific interest to us were the several workshop seminars we conducted 
on the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Each seminar included invitations 
to approximately three hundred prospective clients.  By using Architect's 
Helper [TM], we were able to quickly generate mailing labels and then use 
your program to follow up with attendees and then to generate letters to 
those who expressed interest in our providing further professional services 
for their facilities.  

In addition, we have switched over our new business development prospects 
to Architect's Helper [TM].  Although we are just in the process of 
organizing that information, there is little doubt in my mind that it will 
be extremely effective and reduce the amount of time we have to spend with 
this important aspect of our overall office.

One of the unique benefits of working with ACS has been the excellent phone 
support service that you personally have provided whenever a situation came 
up where we needed some help.  To me this is as important as a well done 
software package.  Both excellent support and program are combined in 
Architect's Helper [TM].  

Thanks again for your responsiveness and we hope that you have continued 
success in your program development.


Yours very truly,






Brewster Ward, AIA, IFRAA
