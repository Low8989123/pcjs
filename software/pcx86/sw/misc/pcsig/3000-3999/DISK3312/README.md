The files which make up the FREE & EASY package are all contained in the 
self extracting file FE.EXE.  In this shareware version there are 44 files
contained in FE.EXE.

To extract the files place the disk containing FE.EXE in your floppy drive
and make the current drive and directory the location where you want the FREE 
& EASY files to go.  There must be at least 890 K of available space. At the 
DOS prompt type A:FE (if the disk containing FE.EXE is in floppy drive A).

In this version of FREE & EASY in order to allow the file FE.EXE to be less 
than 360 K three files from the Instruction Book (the appendix) and 4 lessons
from the tutorials have been left out.  If you wish to see these files they 
can be downloaded from CompuServe (the file FE.ZIP in IBMAPP, LIB #6).  Of
course if you decide to register FREE & EASY you will receive all the files
included in the FREE & EASY package.
