WP BOOKLET SYSTEM 2.3 for WordPerfect 5.1 (DOS)

Distribution of WP Booklet for profit is possible so long as the 
following steps are taken or conditions met:

1) A letter requesting authorization to distribute WP Booklet must
   be sent to the author at the following address: Alex D. Ogden, 3029
   Chandler Court, Murfreesboro, TN  37129.  The letter must state
   the version number listed above.  Permission to distribute will
   be automatically granted to all reputable vendors.  I must still
   receive the letter of request, however, so I can know you have
   the latest version currently in release.
2) I must be placed on the mailing list to receive the catalog in
   which WP Booklet is listed.
3) All files must be included on the distribution media.  The files
   which must be included are:
      INSTALL.BAT
      READ.ME
      WHATS.NEW
      VENDOR.DOC
      FILE_ID.DIZ
      WPBKLT23.EXE
   These files must be included unaltered, including time and date
   stamps.  They may be distributed on a floppy disk with other
   programs so long as the other programs on the disk are also
   intended to be used with WordPerfect (DOS).
4) The fee charged to distribute WP Booklet must not be excessive.
   Most vendors offer a shareware disk at $5 or less.

Sysops of BBS's: Distribution of WP Booklet on computer bulletin
boards is permitted without any special permission from me.  I do
ask, however, that you use the archive name of WPBKLT23.* for the
WP Booklet System 2.3.  The file FILE_ID.DIZ has been included in
the package to provide an appropriate description.

Suggested description for catalogs:

Anyone who has tried to create a folded booklet (pamphlet, brochure, 
tract, bulletin, handbook, etc...) of any length at all will
appreciate the WP Booklet System.  This macro system is designed to
make the production of such booklets with WordPerfect 5.1 (DOS) much
easier.  WP Booklet is fully menu driven.  It keeps track of up to
16 different booklet paper definitions on each of 10 different
printers at the same time.  A total of 8 paper sizes are now
supported.  It supports the use of page numbers including having
page one someplace other than at the start of the document.  WP
Booklet comes with an extensive documentation file fully explaining
how to prepare your original document and rebuild it into a booklet.
(Requires WordPerfect 5.1 (DOS) dated 6/29/90 or later)
