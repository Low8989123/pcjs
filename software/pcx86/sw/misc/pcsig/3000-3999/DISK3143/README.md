```
               Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP)

The ASP is an organization of software authors, shareware disk vendors, and 
bulletin board system (BBS) operators, devoted to the success of shareware.
One way ASP helps you, the user of shareware, is its Ombudsman service. 

We at Quicksoft hope you never have a problem with our software or service. 
If you do have a problem, please call us at 206-282-0452. But if you prefer 
to contact someone else, do try the ASP Ombudsman. 

Here is the Ombudsman's statement:

"Quicksoft is a member of the Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP). 
ASP wants to make sure that the shareware principle works for you. If you are 
unable to resolve a shareware-related problem with an ASP member by contacting 
the member directly, ASP may be able to help. The ASP Ombudsman can help you 
resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member, but doesn't provide technical 
support for members' products. Please write to the ASP Ombudsman at 545 Grover 
Road, Muskegon, MI 49442-9427, or send a CompuServe Mail message to the ASP 
Ombudsman at 70007,3536, or send a FAX to (616) 788-2765. Please include a 
telephone or FAX number if possible when you contact the Ombudsman."
