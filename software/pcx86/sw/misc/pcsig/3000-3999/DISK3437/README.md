SUGGESTED PRODUCT NAMES AND DESCRIPTIONS

   The following are suggested product names and descriptions
and a testimonial that can be used in vendor catalogs, brochures,
ads, mailings, etc..

Testimonial:
 "We used Brochure in a marketing campaign for our documentation
services.  Of 100 diskettes mailed to non-customers, we have
already landed 1 large account and have 5 more solid prospective
customers.  I really noticed the advantage of Softline's talking
Brochure over the standard "junk mail" written brochure when I
did follow up calls.  They immediately recognized Alta Copy as
the "talking Brochure" printing company.  Brochure really helped
us stand out from the competition."
             Ramey Bell, Account Executive of Alta Copy & Print,
                                   Bellevue, Washington
