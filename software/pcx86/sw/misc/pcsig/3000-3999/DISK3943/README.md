                               SIMSTAT LICENSING
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       INDIVIDUALS
       ~~~~~~~~~~~
       SIMSTAT  and its  related  programs  are  NOT  public  domain  or
       freeware! The SIMSTAT  package is a copyrighted  software product
       developed and owned by Normand Peladeau.

       SIMSTAT  is distributed as  shareware.  As  such, individuals may
       evaluate the SIMSTAT package for a maximum period of 30 days.  At
       the end  of the evaluation  period, if you  find SIMSTAT to  be a
       useful tool and wish to continue using it, you must register your
       copy with the author, Normand Peladeau.

       Registration is  $55 in U.S.  dollars plus shipping  and handling
       ($5  for  U.S./Canadian   residents,  $7  for   non-U.S./Canadian
       residents).

       Registration entitles  you to  a copy of  the current  version of
       SIMSTAT and a copy of the next version when it becomes available.
       This  copy will  be mailed  to  you as  soon as  it  is released.
       Registered users also receive a printed  and bounded manual and a
       minimum of 90 days of support (by mail and via Compuserve).

       Registered  users  who  have already  received  their  upgrade of
       SIMSTAT may order the next version by paying a minimal fee.

       To  register  your copy  of  SIMSTAT,  fill  out the  order  form
       included  in the distribution archive (the file called ORDER.FRM)
       and mail it with payment to the address specified on the form.


       CORPORATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       A license is also required for use of SIMSTAT within corporations
       and  institutions.  This license allows  internal use and copying
       of  the program  and  manual  by as  many  users/machines as  are
       licensed.   The license fee is  based upon the number of machines
       on which the SIMSTAT package will be running.  An unlimited  Site
       License is also available which  allows unlimited copying of  the
       software for  internal use by  your company (see the  file called
       ORDER.FRM for pricing information).

       Regardless of the  quantity, one diskette containing  the program
       and documentation  will be sent  to you.   Upon receipt, you  may
       make as many copies of the package as are licensed.   The license
       covers use of all versions of  the software.  A copy of  the next
       version  will  be   sent  to  you  when   it  becomes  available.
       Additional disquettes  and manuals  can be  provide upon  special
       agreement.

       Licenses  for   corporations  and  institutions   to  distribute,
       repackage or resell the program to third parties are available by
       contacting the author.  Clubs, user groups and  computer bulletin
       boards may distribute the software without a distribution license
       provided  the  entire  SIMSTAT  package,  including  all  support
       programs, documentation files  and orderform, is included  in the
       distribution and a fee not to exceed $10 is charged for such
       distribution.
