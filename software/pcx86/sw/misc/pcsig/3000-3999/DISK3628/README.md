The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We
recommend a 386 with a VGA monitor.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

                                  WELCOME
                                  -------

Welcome to Treasure Hunt Math!  Suitable for home and school uses, this
program covers elementary math education for grades 1 through 6 (ages 6-
12).  Older children as well as adults who need to brush up on their math
skills will also benefit from this program.  The program contains over 1000
math facts in all the math operations introduced in elementary school
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, decimals and
percents).  This big array of problems is organized by subject and level
and include review lessons.  An easy to use problem editor lets you
customize and add to the problems.  Parents and teachers will appreciate
the record keeping capabilities, and the ability to generate printed math
tests and certificates of achievement.  The objective of the game is to
find a treasure that was long sunk with a pirates' ship.  There are four
phases that take you in and around the treasure island and under the sea!
As you progress through each of the phases, you are presented with math
problems to solve.  Depending on the option you selected, the challenge may
be solving the equation or finding a missing factor.  A study mode is
available where you can preview the equation before attempting to solve it.
The registered version includs MathTris, a falling-blocks style math drill
game.  The exciting graphics, animation and sound effects throughout the
program promise hours of fun and make learning math facts an enjoyable 
experience!

                        Playing Treasure Hunt Math
                        --------------------------

Treasure Hunt Math theme revolves around a quest for a treasure long-sunken
with a pirates' ship.  Armed with a treasure map, you progress through four
different stages in and around the treasure island.  Between each phase the
treasure island map is displayed with your current position highlighted
with a flashing (X) mark.  In the first phase, you collect secret messages
in bottles that are floating around the island.  In the second phase, you
land on the beach where you pick seashells that may contain precious
pearls.  In the third stage, you make sure you have enough food for your
journey by collecting coconuts in your basket.  In the last phase, you head
for the deep sea in your diving suit.  Surrounded by fascinating sea
creatures, you continue your treasure quest, gathering various items from
the lost treasure.  As you progress through each phase, you will be
presented with math problems to solve.  Since these are math facts that
should be memorized, you can enter the solution from left to right only
(you cannot enter the solution from right to left as if you are computing
them).  Solve all problems in a phase and you are rewarded with a bonus
round.  In the timed bonus round, there are no math problems to solve, only
a good chance to accumulate even more points.  Solve all the problems in
the game and the treasure is yours in a delightful animation sequence.  You
can print a certificate of achievement if your score is 90% or higher.  A
top score will guarantee you a place in the high score list.  If your
performance was less than perfect, you get the chance to retake the
problems you missed.
All throughout the game, you can use the Esc key to interrupt the
ongoing activity.

Phase One
---------
In this phase you are on a boat with a mission to collect secret messages
from bottles floating in the waters surrounding the treasure island.  Move
the boat around using the four ARROW keys (be sure NUM LOCK is turned off).
In the bonus round watch out for the fins of deadly, hungry sharks.  Look
for the red bottles for an extra bonus.

Phase Two
---------
Once on the beach, you collect seashells.  Use the ARROW keys to move
around on the screen.  In the bonus round, watch out for the crab, he is
known for his tendencies to bite!  Collect the shells with pearls for an
extra bonus.

Phase Three
-----------
Try to get as many coconuts as you can in your basket.  Use the left and
right ARROW key to move from one end of the screen to the other.  In the
bonus round, don't step on the stinging snake!

Phase Four
----------
In this phase, you put on your diving suit and dive into the fascinating
waters surrounding the treasure island.  Use the left and right ARROW keys
to move.  Collect the treasure items as they fall around you.  In the bonus
round, try to avoid the annoying jelly fish but make sure you capture the
pirate's sword for extra points.

The High Score List
-------------------
If your score is among the seven highest, it will appear alongside your
name on the high score list.  The high score list is automatically saved
after each game.  To delete the high score list, simply delete the file
THMATH.SCR.  To accomplish that, make sure the file is in your current
directory, and type the following at the DOS command line:

        DEL THMATH.SCR

After deleting this file, the next time you run the program you will have a
blank high score list.

The Scoreboard Menu
-------------------
After a round of the game, the scoreboard will display information about
your performance.  This information includes your name, the date, subject
and level, total number of problems, number of problems solved correctly,
and the score as a percentage.
From the scoreboard menu you can choose to go to the main menu, or to print
out the scoreboard.  If you have a score of 90% or more, and were not in 
study mode, you can print a certificate of achievement, or go on to the 
next level for the current subject. If you missed a few items, and your 
score is less than 90%, you can choose to retake that level.

Retaking a Level
----------------
When retaking a level, you get a second chance at solving the problems
you got wrong the first time.  There are no bonus rounds.  When finished
retaking, you are returned to the Retake Scoreboard menu where you can only
go to the Main menu or print the scoreboard.  You cannot print a certificate
nor can you retake a second time.  No performance record is saved even if
Record Keeping is turned on.  Also, you will not be presented with the
high score list.

Auto Saving of Menus
--------------------
The state of the Treasure Hunt Math menus is saved automatically when you
quit the program.  The next time you start the program, the menus will be
restored to that saved state.

                              Using the Menus
                              ----------------

Treasure Hunt Math menus contain a variety of options.  To change an option
you have to select (highlight) it first.  The selected option is the one
with a red box around it.  To select an option, use the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW
keys (be sure NUM LOCK is turned off).  You can also use the TAB or
SHIFT+TAB (hold down the SHIFT key and press TAB) keys to select an option.
You "Choose" an option to carry out an action.  This is done by pressing
the ENTER key once the option is selected.  You can use the Esc key at
any time to quit the current menu.
There are four different kinds of menu options: text boxes, filename boxes,
selection boxes and action buttons.

Text Box
--------
A text box is used to enter textual information.  It is typically preceded
by a label explaining its purpose.  The modifiable text itself is
surrounded by a box.  To change the text, press ENTER when the text box is
selected.  A flashing cursor in the shape of a vertical bar indicates where
the next typed character will appear.  Start adding text by typing it in,
new text is inserted at the cursor position.  Use the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW
keys to move the cursor around the text.  The HOME key will position the
cursor at the beginning of the text, while the END key will position it at
the end.  The DEL key will delete the character to the right of the
cursor, and the BACKSPACE key will delete the character to the left of
the cursor.  To accept the edited text, press ENTER.  The ESC key will
discard any changes and restores the text to its original form.  An example
of a text box option is the Name option which lets you enter your name.

Note: Some text boxes accept more text than what can be displayed at a
    time in the text box.  In this case, the entered text will scroll to
    the left or right of the text box.  The text box will be, in effect, a
    "window" through which you can see parts of the text.  Use the LEFT
    and RIGHT ARROW keys, the HOME and END keys to gain access to
    various parts of the text.

  Treasure Hunt Math                                             Page 7

Filename Box
------------
The filename box option is used to enter or to select a filename.  It looks
like the text box option except for a disk icon at the right end of the
box.  Press ENTER when the filename box option is selected to choose it.
You will be presented with a file selection menu that allows you to pick up
or enter a filename from any disk and directory.  See "The File Selection
Menu" later in this chapter for detailed information about using the file
selection menu.

Selection Box
-------------
A selection box option is distinguished by an up and down arrow depiction
to the right of the box.  The option contains a value that can assume one
of many predetermined ones.  You change the selected value by pressing the UP
and DOWN ARROW keys to scroll through the different options (be sure NUM
LOCK is turned off).  An example of a selection box option is the Subject
option.

Action Button
-------------
An action button is a gray rectangular area with some text that briefly
describes the action.  The action button causes an action, such as starting
a game, printing or quitting the current menu.  All action buttons have a
shortcut key that is printed on the button inside square brackets "[]".  To
choose an action button, press ENTER while it is selected.  Alternatively,
you can press the button's shortcut key to initiate the action.  An example
of an action button is the Begin button which starts the game.

                       Using the File Selection Menu
                       -----------------------------

The File Selection Menu appears whenever you choose a filename box option.
Its purpose is to let you select or enter a filename from any disk and
directory on your system.  The file Selection Menu contains the following
options:

* Filename Text Box:  Choose this text box if you would rather type a
filename than select it from the scroll box.  It is assumed that the file
is in the currently selected directory;  NO DRIVE OR PATH INFORMATION
SHOULD BE INCLUDED WITH THE FILENAME.  You will have to type in a filename
if you want to create a file that does not exist (for an output operation).
Once you entered the filename and pressed ENTER, the File Selection Menu
will close and will return the filename to the calling filename box.  Press
ESC if you change your mind and decide not to enter a filename; the
previous filename will be restored in the text box.

* Mask Text Box:  Acts like a "filter" that controls what files get displayed
in the scroll box.  Basically the mask is used to match a group of files
the same way it is used in the DOS directory command; dir.  The mask can
contain the DOS wildcard characters the asterisk "*" and the question mark
"?".  The asterisk wildcard substitutes for any or all characters in a name
or extension, while the question mark wildcard substitutes for a single
character.

Ex1:  Enter *.DAT for a mask to list all files with the .DAT extension.
This will match files like:
ADD.DAT
ADD1.DAT
ADD2.DAT
SUB.DAT
SUB1.DAT
MUL.DAT

Ex2:  To list all files with the .DAT extension whose names begins by ADD
followed by at most a single character,  use the following mask ADD?.DAT.
This mask will match files like:
ADD.DAT
ADD1.DAT
ADD2.DAT
But will not match a file like ADD12.DAT.

Note: The mask *.* will match all files in the current directory.

  Treasure Hunt Math                                             Page 9

* Path Label:  This is not an option but a label that displays the currently
selected path.  You change the path selection by picking different
directories and disk drives from the File Scroll box (see below).

* File Scroll Box:  You choose a selection from the list in the scroll box by
using the UP and DOWN ARROW, HOME and END keys to highlight it, then
pressing ENTER.  The action performed on a selection will depend on its
type.

There are three different types of items in the file scroll box:

1. The List Of Filenames: Lists the filenames in the directory specified by
the path label.  Only the files that match the supplied mask will be
listed.  Filenames are listed as a name followed by an extension and
separated by a dot.  For example, ADD1.DAT and SUB1.DAT are filenames.
Choosing a filename (by pressing ENTER) will terminate the file selection
box menu and returns that filename to the calling filename box.  You can
use the HOME key to get to the top of the list of filenames with one
keystroke.

2. The List Of Directories:  The directory names are surrounded by square
brackets "[]" to differentiate them from regular files.  For example,
[DATAFILES] and [MYFILES] represent directories.  Selecting a directory
entry causes your path to be set to that directory, and files from that
directory will be read into the file scroll box.  The double dot directory
"[..]" is a special directory that takes you back up one directory level.

3. The List Of Disk Drives:  These are represented by one letter followed by
a colon ":" and surrounded by square brackets.  For example, [A:], [B:] and
[C:] represent system drives.  Selecting a drive will cause the path to be
set to the root directory of that drive.  Before you select a floppy drive,
you must make sure there is a floppy in the drive, or a disk error will
result.  You can use the END key to get to the bottom of the list of disk
drives with one keystroke.

* OK Button:  The OK button will close down the File Selection menu and
return whatever filename is in the file text box option.

* Cancel Button:  The Cancel button will cancel the File Selection menu.  It
will not change whatever filename that was in the calling filename box.

Note: To learn more about files, directories and wildcards please refer to
your DOS manual.

                    Viewing and Printing Math Problems
                    ----------------------------------

To view or print math problems, perform the following steps:
* Go to the Secondary menu (from the Main menu choose the Secondary Menu
  button).
* Choose the View/Print Problems button.
* The currently selected subject and level (or custom problem file) will 
  be displayed.
* To print the file as is or as a test, select the Print Problems/Test
  button.  In the print menu you can select the printout to be one of
  three choices:
   * File: To print the problems in the order they appear in the file.
   * Test: To print the problems in a test format, and in the order they
   appear in the file.  The text boxes labeled: Class, Date, Instructions
   and Title will appear as options in the Print menu.  In these text
   boxes you can enter the information you want to show on the test sheet.
   * Random Test: Same as Test but the problems are printed in random
   order.

For more information on the Print menu, see the section, "The Print Menu"
later in this manual.

                           Using Record Keeping
                           --------------------

Treasure Hunt Math has the capability of recording reports on the student
progress.  These records are valuable in determining the student's progress
and areas of weaknesses.  The reports have the student name, date, subject
and level, total number of problems, those solved successfully and the
score as a percentage.  The record file can be viewed and printed as
needed.

To turn on record keeping, perform the following steps:
* Go to the Secondary menu (from the Main Menu choose the Secondary Menu
  button).
* Select the Record Keeping option and toggle it to On.
* A filename box labeled File appears below.  Choose it and you will
  activate a File Selection menu where you can select the record keeping
  filename.

Note:  The extension .REC is recommended for record keeping filenames.  If
   no extension is specified when selecting a record keeping filename,
   .REC will be appended to the filename by default.

If the record keeping file does not exist, it will be created, otherwise
new records will be appended to the existing file.  As long as record
keeping is turned on, a record will be added to the file after each
completed game round.

To examine or print a record keeping file, perform the following steps:
* Go to the Secondary menu (from the Main menu choose the Secondary Menu
  button).
* Choose the View/Print Record File action button.
* If you need to change the selected record keeping file, choose the Record
  File filename box.
* When you have a valid record keeping file selected, record information
  from that file will be displayed.
* Use the PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys to step through the records in the
  file.  The number of the record you are looking at and the total number
  of records in the file are printed on screen.  You can also use the HOME
  key to go to the first record in the file or the END key to go to the
  last record.
* To print all or parts of the record keeping file, choose the Print button.
  In the Print menu, you specify the first and last record number to be
  printed.
* To delete the record keeping file, choose the Delete button.  You will be
  asked for confirmation. The delete operation is irreversible!

For more information on the Print menu, see the section, "The Print Menu"
later in this manual.

                             Using the Editor
                             ----------------

The editor allows you to modify existing math problems files or to create
new ones.  The flexibility and customization offered by the editor enhance
the usability of Treasure Hunt Math.

Starting the Editor
-------------------
To start the editor, choose the Editor button from the Secondary menu.
The top section of the screen displays the name of the file that you are
currently editing.  This name can be "Untitled" if you are editing a new
file, or it can be the name of a built-in level or a filename that you
opened for editing.
The main section of the editor screen is where you edit the math problems.
When the editor starts up, it picks up whatever built-in level or custom
problem file you had selected in the program.  A highlight marks the problem
to be edited.  You can move the highlight using the four ARROW keys.  The
bottom section of the screen displays a help message of the available command
options.
You can create math problem files with up to 40 problems.  Each problem can
be a maximum of 15 characters long

Creating and Saving a Custom Problem File
-----------------------------------------
To edit/modify a problem: move the highlight to the problem to be edited.
Press ENTER and type the problem.  You can use the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW,
BACKSPACE and DEL keys to edit the problem.  Use the asterisk "*" to
indicate multiplication and the colon ":" to indicate division.  No
extraneous spaces are necessary when typing a problem.  When done, press
ENTER again.  The problem will be checked for correctness.  If errors are
detected, you will be notified and asked to either keep your answer or to
choose from the computed one(s).  The editor basically checks for two kinds
of errors:
1.  The math problem type has to be supported by Treasure Hunt Math (see
   below for the format of supported problem types).
2.  The arithmetic correctness of the equation.  If the editor "thinks"
   you are in error, you will be prompted to either accept the editor
   recommendation(s) or to keep your own.

Note that the editor can complete a problem for you.  For instance, if you
enter:
        2 * 3
The editor will complete the equation to read:
        2 * 3 = 6

If the equation can have more than one solution, you will be prompted to
choose one.  For example, if you enter:
        2 / 4
The editor will prompt you:
        Which answer do you have in mind? 1) 1/2   2) 50%

  Treasure Hunt Math                                             Page 13

The format of supported problem types:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | Format           | Type                              | Example         |
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | N1 + N2 = N3     | Add two naturals                  | 2 + 3 = 5       |
  | N1 - N2 = N3     | Subtract two naturals             | 4 - 2 = 2       |
  | N1 * N2 = N3     | Multiply two naturals             | 2 * 3 = 6       |
  | N1 : N2 = N3     | Divide two naturals               | 6 : 3 = 2       |
  | F1 = F2          | Reduce to lowest term, or         | 2/4 = 1/2       |
  |                  | Rename as a whole or mixed number | 5/2 = 2 1/2     |
  | F1 + F2 = F3     | Add two fractions                 | 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4 |
  | F1 - F2 = F3     | Subtract two fractions            | 5/8 - 1/2 = 1/8 |
  | F1 * F2 = F3     | Multiply two fractions            | 3/4 * 1/2 = 3/8 |
  | F1 : F2 = F3     | Divide two fractions              | 3/8 : 1/2 = 3/4 |
  | F = D            | Express a fraction as a decimal   | 1/2 = .5        |
  | N * D1 = D2      | Multiply a natural by a decimal   | 10 * .5 = 5     |
  | P * D1 = D2      | Find the percentage               | 10% * 50 = 5    |
  | D = P            | Express a decimal as a percent    | .25 = 25%       |
  | F = P            | Express a fraction as a percent   | 1/2 = 50%       |
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where:
N, N1, N2 and N3 are natural numbers.
F, F1, F2 and F3 are positive fractions.
D, D1, and D2 are positive decimals (can contain a decimal point).
P is a percentage.

* To insert a problem: move the highlight to where you want to insert the
problem and press INSERT.  You can then edit the new problem.

* To delete a problem: highlight the problem and press DEL.  You will be
prompted for confirmation.  This operation is irreversible!

* To write a file: press W to write the file.  A File Selection menu will
appear.  Choose a name to save this file to.  The File Selection menu user
interface is similar to the one in the Treasure Hunt Math program.  For
more information, see the section, "Using the File Selection Menu", earlier
in this manual.

* To read a file: press R, a File Selection menu will appear.  Choose a file
to read the problems from.  The File Selection menu user interface is
similar to the one in the Treasure Hunt Math program.  For more
information, see the section, "Using the File Selection Menu", earlier in
this manual.

Note:  The extension .DAT is recommended for custom problem filenames.  If no
   extension is specified when selecting a custom problem filename for a read
   or write operation, .DAT will be appended to the filename by default.

* To clear a file:  Press C  to clear all the problems.  You will be prompted
for confirmation if you have not saved the problems to a file.  This
operation is irreversible!

* To quit the editor: Press Q and confirm your choice.  If the file was
changed and not saved you will be asked if you want to do so.

* To modify a built-in level: Press L (for Load level).  You will be prompted
for a subject and level.  The selected level will be displayed in the edit
area.  You can add, delete, modify and save the problems as described
above.  Note that the built-in level is never actually changed.  All the
changes are made to the file that you write out to the disk.  The next
section describes how to use a custom problem file in the Treasure Hunt
Math program.

Using a Custom Problem File in Treasure Hunt Math
-------------------------------------------------
To use a custom problem file in Treasure Hunt Math, perform the following
steps:
* Go to the Main menu.
* Choose the Custom File selection in the Subject option.
* In the File filename box, select the filename of the problem file you
  created in the editor.
* The file will be read and used for all activities (the game, printing of
  tests and in MathTris) until you select another file or a built-in level.

Note:  If no extension is specified when selecting a custom problem filename
   to read, .DAT will be appended to the filename by default.

                             Playing MathTris
                             ----------------
                         (registered version only)

MathTris is an exciting, falling-blocks style math drill game.  Choose the
MathTris button from the Main menu to start the game.  A menu box will
appear.
If you had a built-in level selected when you started MathTris, a level
menu will show in the menu box.  You can use this menu to select a level
for the current subject.  The middle gold bar at the bottom of the screen
indicates the currently selected subject and level.  Select the game speed
from the Speed menu, this ranges from Beginner (slowest) to Expert
(fastest).
When you are ready, choose the Begin button.  The game will start with
three partial equations at the bottom of the "wells".  A gold bar
containing the solution to one of the equations will start dropping from
the top of the screen.  The speed at which the gold bar drops will depend
on the selected speed.  Use the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW key to direct the
falling gold bar where it can form a correct equation.  The DOWN ARROW key
makes the gold bar drop quickly, with no direction control.  The amount of
points awarded for forming a correct equation depends on the game speed
selected.
Across the top of the screen, there is a display of how many gold bars
(unsolved equations) remain.
Different sea creatures will move across the screen.  You get bonus points
when you successfully create an equation before the sea creature disappears
from the screen.  The bonus points are awarded according the following
table:

  -------------------------------------
  | Sea Creature        | Bonus Score |
  -------------------------------------
  | Mermaid             | 100         |
  | Dolphin             | 50          |
  | Sea horse           | 25          |
  | Fish                | 12          |
  -------------------------------------

The game is over when all problems in the selected level are completed, or
when wrong answers pile up to the surface of a "well", which is three
equations deep.
To change to another subject or to load a math problem file, quit the game,
select the desired subject or custom problem file from the Main menu
and restart MathTris.

* File.  This filename box appears only if you selected Custom File for the
subject option.  Use the File Selection menu to pick up a custom problem
filename previously generated with the math problem editor.  The data in
the file will be used instead of the built-in levels.

* Format.  Select Horizontal, Vertical or Horizontal/Vertical.  These
selections refer to the way the math problems are presented.  For example,
in Horizontal mode an addition problem will be presented like this:
 5 + 3 =

In Vertical mode, the problem will be presented like this:
     5
 +   3
     ---

In Horizontal/Vertical mode, the problem presentation will alternate
between Horizontal and Vertical.

Note:  The Format option will appear only when the selected level is
   addition, subtraction, multiplication or division.  This option will be
   hidden and defaults to Horizontal if you select Fractions, Decimals or
   Custom File for the Subject option.

* Activity.  Select Solve to find the result of an equation; Find Missing
Factor to find a missing operand; or Study.  In the Study mode, the
equation is first shown to be studied, then the result will be hidden and
you will be asked to solve it.

                            The Secondary Menu
                            ------------------

The Secondary menu is accessed when you choose the Secondary menu button
from the Main menu.  It contains more options, that are typically less used
than the ones in the Main menu.  The options in this menu are:

* Month, Day and Year.  These are read from the system date.  You will need
to change them only if the system date is not correct.  The date
information is used for record keeping purposes and when printing
certificates.

* Record Keeping.  You can turn this option On or Off.  When turned on, the
Record Filename menu appears. When this option is turned on, a performance
summary is saved in the record keeping file after each completed round of
Treasure Hunt Math.

* Record Filename.  Select the filename where the record keeping information
will be saved.  If this file exists, new records will be appended to it, if
it doesn't exist it will be created.  The file will keep growing as long as
Record Keeping is turned on.  You can examine and print the contents of the
file in the View/Print Record File menu, where you can also choose to
delete it.  For more information, see the section, "Using Record Keeping",
earlier in this manual.

* Editor.  Choose this button to start the math problem editor.  For
information on using the editor see the section, "Using the Editor" earlier
in this manual.

* View/Print Record File.  Choose this button to go to the Record Keeping
menu where you can view, print or delete a record file.  For more
information, see the section, "Using Record Keeping", earlier in this
manual.

* View/Print Problems.  Choose this button to view or print the currently
selected problem set.  You can also print the problems in test or file
formats.  For more information, see the section, "Viewing and Printing Math
Problems", earlier in this manual.

* Begin.  Choose the Begin button to start the game (same function as the
Begin button in the Main menu).

* Main Menu.  Choose this button to go back to the Main menu.

                            The Scoreboard Menu
                            -------------------

You get to the Scoreboard menu after a round of Treasure Hunt Math.  The
options are:

* Main Menu.  Choose to go to the Main menu.

* Print Scoreboard.  Choose to go to the Print menu where you can print the
scoreboard information as they appear at the top of the screen.

* Retake.  This button appears only if some problems were missed and
your score is less than 90%.  Choosing this button will restart the game
with only the problems missed the first time.  See the section, 
"Retaking a Level", earlier in this manual.

* Next Level.  This button appears only if your score is at least 90% and you
are not using a custom problem file.  Choose this option to go to the next
built-in level (e.g., from Addition level 1 to Addition level 2).

* Print Text Certificate, Print Graphic Certificate.  These buttons appear
only if your score is at least 90% and you were not in Study mode.  Choose
either of them to print a certificate of achievement.  The graphic
certificate features nice, detailed graphics but is slower to print than
the text certificate.

                          The Record Keeping Menu
                          -----------------------

The Record Keeping menu lets you view, print or delete record keeping
files.  The options in this menu are:

* File.  Use the File Selection menu to select the record keeping filename
that you wish to view, print or delete.  This should be a file created by
the Record Keeping option in the Secondary menu.

* First. Choose to display the first record in the file.

* Last. Choose to display the last record in the file.

* Previous/ Next.  These action buttons let you page through the records in
the selected record keeping file.

* Print.  Choose to go to the Print menu, where you can print a range of
records from the record file.

* Delete.  Choose to delete the currently selected record file.  You will be
prompted for confirmation before the deletion is carried out.

* Cancel.  Choose to cancel the Record Keeping menu and return to the
Secondary menu.

For more information, see the section, "Using Record Keeping", earlier in
this manual.

                              The Print Menu
                              --------------

The Print Menu appears whenever you choose a print action button.  For
example: when printing a math problem file, a test, record file or a
certificate of achievement.  Some options are general print options that
are always present.  Others appear only depending on what it is you're are
trying to print.  The permanent options for the Print menu are:

* Printer Port.  Select where the printer output should go to:

   --------------------------------------------------
   | Select     | If your printer is connect to     |
   |            |  (DOS device name)                |
   --------------------------------------------------
   | Parallel 1 | Parallel port 1 (LPT1).           |
   | Parallel 2 | Parallel port 2 (LPT2).           |
   | Serial 1   | Serial port 1 (COM1). Note(1)     |
   | Serial 2   | Serial port 2 (COM2). Note(1)     |
   | File       | Output goes to disk file. Note(2) |
   --------------------------------------------------

Note(1):  To be able to communicate over the serial port, serial printers
    require setting the serial port communication prameters using the DOS
    Mode command.  The Mode command should be run from the DOS command
    line or from a batch file.  A Mode command to configure COM1 to work
    with a specific printer could look something like:
         mode com1:96,n,8,1,p
    Please refer to your printer and DOS manuals for the specifics of
    using the Mode command and configuring your printer.

Note(2):  Choose File if you want the printer output to go to a DOS file
    that you can later print using the DOS print command.  The output will
    go to the filename you supply in the Output Filename option (see
    below).  This is handy for computers that are not attached to a
    printer.  You can, for example, get the printer output in a file that
    you name OUTPUT.PRN.  Later on, you can take that file to a computer
    attached to a printer and print it using the DOS Print command:
         print output.prn

* Output Filename.  This option appears only if you have selected File for
Printer Port.  Use the File Selection menu to select the filename where you
want the printer output to go (see note(2) above).

* Print.  Choose the Print button to start the print operation.  You will be
notified of the success or failure of the operation.

* Cancel.  Choose the Cancel button to cancel the print operation.  This will
close down the Print menu.

  Treasure Hunt Math                                             Page 22

Other Print Menu options are available only depending on the kind of
printing you are doing.  These options are:

* Printer Type.  This selection option is present only if you are printing a
graphic certificate.  Your options are:
  * LaserJet if you have an HP LaserJet or compatible printer, or
  * Dot-Matrix. If it is an Epson or an IBM Proprinter compatible dot-matrix
    printer.

* Class, Date, Instructions and Title.  Are present only if you are printing
a test (or a random test).  Use these text boxes to enter the information as
you want them to get printed on your test sheet.  For more information, see
the section "Viewing and Printing Math Problems", earlier in this manual.

* Print As.  Is present only if you are printing a problem file or a test.
The options are:
  * Test: To print out a test with the problems in the order they appear in
    the file.
  * Random Test: Will print out a test with the problems listed in a random
    order.
  * File: Will print out a list of the problems.

For more information, see the section "Viewing and Printing Math Problems",
earlier in this manual.

* First Rec and Last Rec.  Are present only if you are printing a record
file.  You use these menus to specify the starting and ending record for
the print operation.  For more information, see the section, "Using Record
Keeping", earlier in this manual.

              Appendix B: Troubleshooting & Customer Support
              -----------------------------------------------

* Problem: The program gives an error message on start up or fails to start.
  * The program will check if you have the necessary hardware before it
  tries to run.  Please check the section, "Hardware Requirements" for
  information about hardware requirement.
  * If the video system does not meet the requirements, the program will
  notify you and give you the option to quit or continue.

* Problem: I can't get my printer to print with the program.
  * Make sure your printer is properly connected, turned on, has paper and
  is ready to print (i.e., on-line).
  * Make sure that you have selected the appropriate port in the Printer
  Port option of the Print menu.  Please refer to the section, "The Print
  Menu" for more information on setting up the Printer Port option.
  * If you have a serial printer, you have to issue a DOS Mode command to
  setup the port communication parameters.  The command should be issued
  before running Treasure Hunt Math.  Please refer to your printer
  documentation.
  * Try printing a simple text screen (can be the DOS command line screen),
  by pressing SHIFT+PRINT SCREEN (hold down SHIFT while pressing PRINT
  SCREEN). If the test is unsuccessful, you need to check your printer
  documentation on proper setup.

* Problem: I can print a text certificate but not a graphic certificate.
  * Make sure that the Printer Type option is set correctly.  If you have a
  LaserJet or compatible this option should be set to LaserJet.  If it is
  a dot-matrix printer, the option should be set to Dot-Matrix.
  * If you have a dot-matrix printer and it is not IBM Proprinter or Epson
  compatible (most printers are), then you won't be able to print graphic
  certificates.

* Problem: I get a "Drive not ready" error when trying to read or write from
my floppy drive.
  * Make sure you have a formatted diskette in the floppy drive you are
  trying to access and that the drive's door (if applicable) is closed.
  * If you have inserted a blank non-formatted diskette, you will need to
  format it first using the DOS Format command.  Please refer to your DOS
  documentation for information on the Format command.

* Problem: I get a "Write-protected disk" error when trying to write to my
floppy disk.
  * The floppy you are trying to write to is write protected.  Remove the
  write-protect tab on 5.25-inch diskette, or slide the tab back over the
  write-protect hole on the 3.5-inch diskette.

* Problem: I cannot find my problem or record files in the File Selection
menu.
  * Check the displayed path label to make sure you are looking at the right
  drive and directory.
  * Make sure you have the right floppy in your floppy drive.

* Problem: I have read this section, and the relevant sections of the manual,
but I still have a problem.

                        ---------------------

Definition Of Shareware
-----------------------
Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software.  The Shareware
system makes fitting your needs easier, because you can try before you buy.
If you try a Shareware program and continue using it, you are expected to
register.  And because the overhead is low, prices are low also.  Shareware
has the ultimate money-back guarantee; if you don't use the product, you
don't pay for it.
Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software, and the
copyright holder retains all rights.

Agreement
---------
Treasure Hunt Math is a "shareware program" and is provided at no charge to
the user for evaluation.  If you find this program useful and continue to
use it after a reasonable trial period, you must register it with Adventure
LearningWare.  Please see the program for registration instructions and
incentives.  Feel free to share it with your friends and with your local
elementary school, but please do not give it away altered or as part of
another system.  Please encourage them to register their copy if they find
that they can use it.
Educational institutions and commercial users of Treasure Hunt Math must
register and pay for their copies of Treasure Hunt Math within 30 days of
first use or their license is withdrawn.  Lab packs and site-licenses
arrangements are available.
Please see the file REGISTER.DOC, or print an order form from the program's
quit screen for complete ordering information.

ASP Ombudsman Statement

"This program is produced by a member of the Association of Shareware
Professionals (ASP). ASP wants to make sure that the shareware principle
works for you. If you are unable to resolve a shareware-related problem
with an ASP member by contacting the member directly, ASP may be able to
help. The ASP Ombudsman can help you resolve a dispute or problem with an
ASP member, but does not provide technical support for members' products.
Please write to the ASP Ombudsman at 545 Grover Road, Muskegon, MI 49442 or
