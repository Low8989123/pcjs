     -----------------------------------------------------------
     VENDOR STANDARDS:
     The following is a summary of ASP vendor standards.  This
     is just a summary, and is not to be taken as a statement of
     the entire set of ASP standards.  Softline, Inc. appreciates
     each vendor following the ASP standards.

     ADVERTISING:
       All vendor advertisements and brochures must state that 
     "Shareware programs require separate payment to authors if 
     found useful."  This statement must immediately follow the
     price or be tied to the price via an asterisk.

     CATALOGUES:
       Vendors will attempt to educate users on the nature of 
     Shareware.  The following points must be covered in any
     catalog of disks:

       -  The fee paid to the vendor is a copying and distribution
          charge and does not cover the cost of the program
          itself.

       -  If the user finds a Shareware program to be of use,
          he/she is expected to send the registration fee to the
          author.

       -  Registration entitles the user to various rights and 
          benefits (depending on the author).  These range from
          the legal right to continue using the software, to
          printed documentation and/or higher levels of service.

     DISTRIBUTION:
       -  Vendors will respect the copyright and all distribution
          restrictions made by individual authors, usually found
          in the file VENDOR.DOC [this file] on the disk.

       -  Vendors will provide a written notice covering the three
          concepts above with all Shareware programs shipped.  If
          disks are pre-packaged, the notice must be on a visible
          part of the package.

       -  Vendors will not change or delete ANY files supplied
          with the program unless authorized by the author. 

       -  Vendors agree to stop distributing a program, including
          earlier versions, if requested by the author.

          The above is a SUMMARY of the ASP vendor standards.  In
     order to distribute Look and Listen products you must agree
     to abide by these standards whether you are an ASP member or
     not.  If you are interested in becoming an ASP-approved
     vendor, please contact:

                  Association of Shareware Professionals
                  Vendor Certification Committee
                  P.O. Box 5786
                  Bellevue, WA 98006

          We strongly recommend you consider becoming an ASP
     approved vendor if you have not already done so.  The ASP
     vendor member program reduces the workload for both authors
     and vendors alike, and helps give customers confidence that
     reasonable standards are met in the distribution of Shareware
     products.

     =============================================================

          To those organizations given permission to distribute
     Look and Listen Animals, Softline, Inc. will forward a
     Vendor Master Distribution disk.  Updates will be offered to
     approved organizations on a case-by-case basis.
