The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We
recommend a 386 with a VGA monitor.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

                              TEL (408) 988-3832

NOTE: VALIDATE version 0.4 is being released so that VALIDATE will
      remain compatible with the /SAVE option of SCAN. The new /SAVE
      option changes the SCAN.EXE file, and the new VALIDATE will be
      able to compensate for the changes, so that the validation results
      before and after the /SAVE switch will be identical.  This in no
      way impairs the validating process.

     VALIDATE is a file-authentication program that may be used to check
other programs for signs of tampering.  VALIDATE uses two discrete methods
to generate Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC's), which are then displayed for
the user to compare against the known value for the program(s) validated.
The known validation data can be published by the author of the program or
be obtained from a trusted information database.  The dual CRC checking
provides a high degree of security.

     To confirm that a program is in its original, untampered state, run
the VALIDATE program on it, record the validation data produced, and
compare it against the record in the online database. If they match, than
it is highly improbable that the program has been modified.

To run VALIDATE, type:

     VALIDATE d:\path\filename.ext

The VALIDATE program will then display the following information:

                   Size:  (#/bytes)
                   Date:  (file creation date)
    File Authentication
         Check Method 1:  (a four digit CRC)
         Check Method 2:  (a four digit CRC)

     The VALIDATE program may be copied and distributed at no charge as
long as it is distributed whole and intact and unmodified in any way,
along with this file.  Please report virus infections and reports of
program tampering to:

Overview

     PROVIEW for Windows is a program used to analyze, view
     and edit the basic components of a system, including the
     system memory, system interrupts, device drivers, CMOS and
     installed disk drive sectors and file contents.  PROVIEW 
     will allow you to view system elements in HEX, ASCII or 
     disassembled code format.  Full searching and editing 
     functions are included.  It also provides a system audit 
     function to determine whether programs have been added to a 
     system, deleted from a system or have been changed since the 
     last audit.

     PROVIEW displays data in real time.  For example, if you are
     viewing a memory location that is being updated by
     the system (the clock interrupt, for example), PROVIEW
     will display the changes as they occur.

     PROVIEW provides an extensive on-line context sensitive
     help function.  At any point in the program you may press
     the <F1> key to display help text for the process you are
     currently engaged in.  NOTE: The WPV.HLP file must be
     in the same directory as the WPV.EXE file.

     PROVIEW is Novell Network aware.  You may view any network
     file and edit any network file that is not locked.

Installation

     Copy the files WPV.EXE, BWCC.DLL and WPV.HLP to any 
     subdirectory of your disk.  Run WINDOWS and then select
     FILE - NEW - PROGRAM ITEM.  Enter the Name PROVIEW and 
     specify the path where WPV.EXE has been placed.

Using The Menus

     After you have entered the PROVIEW menu system  
     you will be able to move about the PROVIEW menus 
     to access all of the system functions. To pull 
     down one of the available menus, press the ALT key 
     and the highlighted letter of the menu you want or 
     use the mouse to select the pulldown list. 

Using the Edit Functions

     The Edit menu contains all the commands you need to
     edit or change the system elements that are accessed with
     the Memory and Disk menus.

     Undo  (Backspace)

          To undo any change that you have made. Note that
          any values that have been changed are highlighted.

     Set Mask/Value  (F3)

          The mask/value may be set to any hex byte value for
          XOR/Negate or Add/Subtract operations. 

     XOR/Negate  (F7/Shift-F7)

          XOR/Negate the selected byte using the mask value.

     Add/Subtract (F8/Shift-F8)

          Add/subtract the Mask/Value to the highlighted field.

     Rotate Left/Right  (F9/Shift-F9)

          Rotate selected byte left or right.


The FILE Menu

     The file menu has three options:

     Save Edited Object

          Permits saving any changes you have made without
          having to exit the current edit in process.

     Read only   (Default = No)

          This options allows you to enable or disable the
          Read Only function. When enabled (ON), you will
          not be able to change or edit any system data with
          the PROVIEW program. To make changes, and be able
          to save them, toggle this option to read NO.

     Exit

          Returns you to WINDOWS. Be sure to save any
          changes that you have made before exiting.

The MEMORY Menu

          System memory may be viewed and edited by PROVIEW.  
          Memory may be viewed in HEX, ASCII or disassembled
          code format.  If viewing in assembler format, you
          may follow the control of the program by selecting
          the numbers in parenthesis to the right of each 
          branch instruction that is displayed on the screen.
          to reverse the flow of control, press (0) to return 
          to the previous branch instruction.

          The following options are available in the Memory Menu:

     DOS System Area

          View/Edit the DOS System Area, starting at 0K and
          continuing as much as space as necessary for all
          the information loaded. Information stored here
          includes the BIOS DATA Area, DOS Communication
          Area, IO and DOS code, System File Tables, FCB
          Tables, Disk Buffers, System STACKS (CODE and
          DATA), as well as devices loaded with the
          CONFIG.SYS file (e.g., HIMEM.SYS, SETVER driver,
          MOUSE driver).

     Program Area

          View/Edit the Program Area of memory, starting 
          at the end of the DOS System Area and including 
          all used and unused space up to 640K. Information 
          stored here includes the COMMAND.COM code, as well 
          as any TSR programs loaded by the system (e.g., MOUSE,
          DOSKEY).

     Upper Memory Area

          View/Edit the Upper Memory Area, starting at 640K
          and including all the used and unused space up
          to 1MB. Information stored here includes the
          Graphic and Text Video RAM, Video ROM BIOS, and
          System ROM BIOS.

     Interrupts

          View/Edit the System Interrupt Vectors.  Proview 
          indicates which ones are currently in use, their
          memory addresses, owners and interrupt chains. 
          You may display/edit the actual interrupt code in 
          hex or ASM format.

          NOTE: Do not use the "Display Interrupt Chain" 
          sub-function of this feature if you are running 
          any background multi-programming operating environment 
          such as DESQview.  Your system may hang under some  
          circumstances if it is attempted.

     Drivers

          View/Edit installed system device Drivers.  PROVIEW
          displays the list of installed drivers and their
          attributes.  Individual drivers may be selected for
          viewing or editing.

     Absolute Memory View

          View/Edit a user selectable memory address range
          within the system absolute memory.


                          WARNING!!

          Changes made to system memory can cause system crashes
          or data loss.  Make sure that you understand any change
          that you wish to make to any memory location.

     CMOS

          The CMOS viewer allows you to view any element of your
          CMOS.  Full descriptions are provided for sub-fields of
          the CMOS.  To view detailed descriptions, select any of
          the CMOS fields and press Enter.

DISK Menu

     File View

          View/Edit files on the default hard disk drive.
          You can view the file in either HEX, ASM or ASCII
          format.  Files may be selected from hard disk, floppy
          diskette or network drives.

     Sector View

          View/Edit logical sectors on any installed disk
          drive, hard or floppy.  This option may not be used
          on network drives.

     Physical Sector View

          View/Edit physical sectors on any disk drive.  This 
          option may not be used on network drives.

     Boot Record

          File allocation table area of the hard disk or floppy disk
          can cause system crashes and/or loss of data.  Make sure
          that you understand any changes made to these areas.



AUDIT Menu

          The AUDIT function allows you to monitor modifications
          to a computer's software.  It may be used to check for 
          the presence of unknown viruses or to monitor each user's  
          additions, deletions or modifications to their system's 
          software.
          
          When the first sub-function "AUDIT" is selected, a software 
          configuration file will be created for the specified drive.  
          Any time thereafter you may choose to view programs that have 
          been added, changed or deleted since the audit.  When a new 
          "AUDIT" procedure is run, it will replace the audit configuration
          file for the selected drive.

          When listing programs, each program will be prefixed by
          an icon which indicates whether the program is a DOS program,
          a WINDOWS program or an OS/2 program.

HELP Function

     Comprehensive context sensitive help is provided with
     PROVIEW.  At any point in the program press <F1> to
     display help instructions for the function you are
     engaged in.

     



AUTHENTICITY

          Before using PROVIEW for the first time, verify that it has
          not been tampered with or infected by a virus by using the
          the enclosed VALIDATE program.  For instructions on using
          VALIDATE, please read the VALIDATE.DOC file.

               The validation results for Version 1.01 should be:

                        FILE NAME: WPV.EXE
                             SIZE: 158,736
                             DATE: 05-28-1993
              FILE AUTHENTICATION
                   Check Method 1: 21B3
                   Check Method 2: 1CE2

          If your copy of PROVIEW differs, it may have been damaged.

          Always obtain your copy of PROVIEW from a known source.  The latest
          version of PROVIEW and validation data for WPV.EXE can be
          obtained from McAfee Associates' bulletin board system at
          (408) 988-4004 or from the McAfee Virus Help Forum on
          CompuServe (GO MCAFEE), or the mcafee.COM anonymous ftp site on
          the Internet.

               PROVIEW series are archived with PKWare's PKZIP Authentic File
          Verification.  If you do not see an "-AV" after every file is
          unzipped and receive the "Authentic Files Verified! # NWN405
          Zip Source: McAFEE ASSOCIATES" message when you unzip the files
          then do not use them.  If your version of PKUNZIP does not have
          verification ability, then this message may not be displayed.
          Please contact us if you believe tampering has occurred to the
          .ZIP file.
