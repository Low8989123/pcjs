          "paste" items to the invoice you are working on.  A mailing list
          which allows you to locate names and place on an invoice and is
          automatically updated when new orders are entered.

          The next invoice number can be changed at any time such as at the
          first of the year.

          The printer codes are used to make your printer print condensed
          or normal type.  Many printers use the EPSON codes which would be
          27  15 for condensed print and 18 for normal or to release
          condensed print.  If these codes do not make your printer print
          on condensed format then refer to your printers owners manual for
          the proper codes and enter then here.

          line and press [ENTER].
