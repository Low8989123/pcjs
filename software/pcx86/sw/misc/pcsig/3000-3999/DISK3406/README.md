      Talking Slideshow - Long Description:
 
       Talking Slideshow, Version 3.3 - $9.95
         A slide show program that talks with your own voice!.
         Simply substitute your picture and sound files for the

         through the PC internal speaker (Windows 3.0 or 3.1 /
         standard or enhanced modes) or installed sound device
         (Windows 3.1).  Talking Slideshow is similar to Picture

         Sound.  Auto-stretch/shrink tends to distort high
         resolution picture files.  Up to 100 picture and sound
         files in one show!.
         Passed: Microsoft Compatibility for Windows testing.

                   microphone to create the sound files.  Windows
                   Paint or some other third party graphics
                   creation software (save as .BMP files) to
                   develop the picture files.
