The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or

The brand new PC-SIG World Of Windows is a must-have for Windows users.
In order to produce the best possible Windows collection PC-SIG has made
an alliance with the acclaimed Windows OnLine BBS. So not only do you have
access to the collecting and weeding out efforts for which PC-SIG is
famous, but also the huge volume of fonts and sound files and the in-depth
software reviews of the world's best Windows BBS.

This CD contains every one of the best Windows shareware programs
available, 350+ in all, over 900 TrueType fonts which can be used
without royalties, 429 ATM fonts, over 2,000 sound files in .WAV,
.VOC, .SND, .SOU, .MID format and 2,794 icons! A major computer
catalog is offering a collection of 250 fonts for $49.95. They have
great prices on hardware and software, but this time they can't
touch us.

As if the files aren't enough, we thought you would want to preview
and use these sounds, fonts, icons and programs directly from the CD,
without taking the time and space to unarchive them. So we have
included a font previewer and installed, a sound player and an icon
manager. Over 200 of the programs can be run simply by clicking on
them in the File Manager. Nobody else offers you anything close to
this type of access.

We're not done yet. In add to all the Windows riches described above,
this CD also contains the text and programs from the July-August
issue of Shareware Magazine. This is the second in a six-volume PC-SIG
Encyclopedia of Shareware CD-ROM series (Games was the first). Each
volume includes the programs from a section of the PC-SIG Library plus
all the text and every program from the current issue of Shareware
Magazine. Software reviews for this issue cover over 100 programs
including games, communications, printing, text editors and more. 124
of the programs mentioned in the magazine are included, plus 225
programs updated since the May-June issue.
