MAGIC SCREEN SAVER is a screen saver for Window-based computers. Screen 
savers lengthen the life of your monitor by taking control of your      
computer when you're not using it and randomly displaying images. This  
prevents any one image from being permanently burned into your screen.  
MAGIC doesn't use flying toasters like a more famous screen saver, but  
it does use nifty, high-tech graphics.                                  
                                                                        
It displays a colored bar flying across your screen continuously        
turning, bouncing, and changing colors. It also displays the bar's      
trail as it ricochets inside your monitor in a three dimensional motion;
kind of a continuous, time-lapsed display that's stunning. MAGIC        
lets you control the size of the bar, the speed, the reflection pattern,
and how fast the color changes. These simple controls result in a       
stunning array of randomly generated graphics. MAGIC SCREEN SAVER       
also includes a password feature that lets you restrict access to       
your computer.
