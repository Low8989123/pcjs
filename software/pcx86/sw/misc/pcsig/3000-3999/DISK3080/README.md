                BD/PATCH Release 1.0   Quick Documentation

OVERVIEW
========
     BD/Patch  is  a versatile new utility from  Breakthrough  Designs  for 
viewing or editing files, and other file-like objects such as disk  drives, 
directories  and  memory.  Patch supports various display formats  to  help 
interpret the data being edited, but removes the usual restrictions on file 
and disk manipulation usually imposed by DOS or applications programs.  For 
this  reason it is both a powerful and useful tool, and a good way to  mess 
up  data if you're not sure what you're doing.  This program is a tool  for 
patching files and data; the intelligence for what you are accomplishing is 
provided  by you.  WHENEVER POSSIBLE, ONLY PATCH A FILE FOR WHICH A  BACKUP 
EXISTS.
     Patch is also a useful file or object viewer, to examine the structure 
of files or other data without making changes, and provides a good tool for 
seeing "what's inside" the data you examine.
     This program was created to fill several utility needs, and while this 
is  the  first commercial version of this program, it is  the  fifth  major 
revision  of a program which has been used profitably and powerfully  by  a 
number  of people for over six years.  Hopefully you will find  BD/Patch  a 
useful utility for your work as well.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
====== ============
BD/Patch  requires  an  IBM-compatible computer running  MS-DOS  or  PC-DOS 
version  2.0  or  higher.  Version 3.0 or  higher  is  recommended.   Patch 
utilizes as much base memory as is available, but requires at least 220K of 
free  memory to operate.  Any standard video display will work with  Patch, 
although Patch has certain optional features which require an EGA or higher 
display.  Also, Patch makes use of the extended keyboards (twelve  function 
keys across the top) if you have one (and your system supports it).

INSTALLATION
============
The  programs  and files of Patch all fit, uncompressed, on a  single  low-
density  floppy  disk, and require less than 300K if installed  on  a  hard 
disk.   Simply copy the files from the Patch disk to a new floppy, or to  a 
hard disk subdirectory.
     While  the  Patch files take up little space on a hard disk,  you  may 
wish to eliminate some files if you are adding Patch to a "utilities" disk.  
Only  the  PATCH.EXE file is required for operation.   The  following  list 
describes the other files on the Patch disk, and what they are for:
     PATCH.HLP - the on-line help text.  If removed, no help is available.
     PATCH.PRF - these are your preferences, if you have set any.  If you
          remove this file, the factory defaults will be used.
     *.FS - any .FS file adds file system drivers.  If these are removed,
          Patch will only have FILE, SUBDIR, LDRIVE and PDRIVE.
     *.CTL - any .CTL file adds display format drivers.  If these are re-
          moved, Patch will only have HEX, TEXT, SUBDIR and LDRIVE.
     *.PRN - any .PRN file adds printer drivers.   If these are  removed,
          Patch will only have SIMPLE as a printer choice.
     QUICKREF.TXT - this document.
     README.TXT - quick description of the program and how to register.
     PATCH.PIF, PATCH.ICO - these are used by Microsoft Windows for infor-
          mation about this program, but are not required.

RUNNING PATCH
======= =====
To  start  the Patch program, if you are in the directory where  the  Patch 
program is located, just type "patch" and press the ENTER key.  Or, if  you 
have  from one to four files you would like to patch directly from the  DOS 
prompt, type the names of these files after "patch," such as:
     C:\PATCH>patch \mainmenu.mdf a:\sample.dat
If you want to patch a command from another file system, the format is  the 
same but the name is preceded by the file system and a colon, like this:
     C:\PATCH>patch mem:286 subdir:a:\temp
The number of files to patch you type specifies the number of windows which 
will  be  opened.   If you start Patch without any named  files,  a  single 
window appears with the "Opening Menu" displayed; choose options from  that 
by pressing the desired letter, or use the pull-down menus instead.
     MS-DOS  version 3.0 or higher is recommended if you run Patch  from  a 
different  directory than you are working in, which is often the case.   In 
MS-DOS  version  2, Patch can locate the supplemental files  if  Patch  was 
located  in  a  directory  specified  by the  path,  and  is  still  called 
"PATCH.EXE."   But  in  MS-DOS version 3 or higher, Patch  can  locate  the 
supplemental files based on how the command was started, regardless of what 
drive  or directory the files are on, or what the Patch command is  called.  
For example, if you had the Patch files on a floppy disk, you could type:
     C:\DOS>a:patch share.exe
Patch would run, and find all its files on the floppy disk, but only if the 
DOS  version is 3.0 or higher.  Under DOS 2.x, you would have to  make  the 
floppy drive the active drive and run from there, like this:
     C:\DOS>a:
     A:\>cd patch
     A:\PATCH>patch c:\dos\share.exe

BASIC OPERATIONS IN PATCH
===== ========== == =====
Patch  was  written  to view and edit a variety  of  files,  and  file-like 
objects,  in a consistent and editor-like way.  There are  two  overlapping 
methods for controlling Patch, one based upon the WordStar editor, and  the 
other  based  on cursor and function keys and pull-down menus,  which  have 
become customary elements in PC software.
     The cursor keys on your keyboard do pretty much what you would expect.  
The function keys are labeled at the bottom of the Patch screen by  default 
(you can remove the labels if you wish).  The pull-down menus are  operated 
by  pressing the ALT key and the first letter of the menu you  want  (these 
are  displayed  across the top line of the screen), and then  selecting  an 
option from the menu with the cursor keys and pressing ENTER on the one you 
want.  Menu options may also be chosen by typing the capitalized letter  on 
the option you want.
     The  WordStar codes are faster to use and harder to learn.   They  all 
require  a control code (press the CTRL key and the letter you want),  many 
commands  also  requiring a second character which need not  be  a  control 
code.   The commands are represented with a carat (^) symbol to indicate  a 
control  code, so "^KX" means press Ctrl-K, and then X (which can be  upper 
or  lower  case,  or even Ctrl-X).  If you are already  familiar  with  the 
WordStar editor many of the commands will be familiar to you.  If not,  but 
you  wish to learn them, the command reference in this document provides  a 
list,  or  you can turn on WordStar menus by setting the help level  to  3; 
this can be done with the command ^JJ3.
     Patch  can edit up to four files at one time; each appears in its  own 
"window"  (a group of screen lines independent from the others).  Only  one 
window  can be edited at one time, but the other windows continue  to  show 
what you are working on.  The F10 key jumps between windows.
     Several  commands for patching a file use "blocks," meaning a  section 
of the file which you define and use as a single item for this command.  In 
WordStar  commands, you mark the block with the ^KB and ^KK  commands,  and 
then  use  a  command to do something with that block.   In  the  pull-down 
menus, on the other hand, you choose the command, and Patch prompts you  to 
mark the length of the block (and, for some commands, where you want to use 
the  block  as well).  For this reason the two sets of block  commands  are 
similar but not the same.
     Patch has a number of built-in display formats, and some standard add-
on  display formats.  Built-in formats include HEX (displaying  hexadecimal 
bytes  and  ASCII equivalences; this is the default), TEXT (a  simple  text 
editor screen, but awkward if your file isn't text), SUBDIR (the format for 
subdirectory  data) and LDRIVE (the format for a logical drive).  The  file 
PATCH.CTL currently adds the DEC and OCT formats, which are similar to  HEX 
but use decimal or octal, respectively.
     Patch has a number of built-in file systems, and some standard  add-on 
file systems.  Built-in systems include FILE (normal DOS files; this is the 
default),  SUBDIR (DOS subdirectories), LDRIVE (a logical drive,  named  by 
its drive letter) and PDRIVE (a physical drive, named by its unit  number).  
The  file  PATCH.FS currently adds the MEM file system, which  patches  the 
"files"  BASE  (1M of system base memory), 286 (16M of memory on a  286  or 
higher  processor),  386 (4G of memory on a 386 or higher  processor),  and 
CMOS  (the  battery-backed  real time clock and config memory  in  most  AT 
compatibles).
     For  printing,  Patch  can support several printer  types,  which  are 
loaded  from  the  file PATCH.PRN.  Without the .PRN  file(s),  Patch  only 
supports  the SIMPLE printer type, which works suitably on any printer  but 
doesn't make the same data distinctions one of the named printer types can.
     Other  file systems, display formats and printer drivers can be  added 
to  your Patch program by simply adding the appropriate .FS, .CTL  or  .PRN 
files to the location of your existing Patch files.
     You  can change many of the default options in Patch to suit your  own 
preferences,  and to configure Patch to your display if your computer  will 
support 132-column text modes.  These settings are all accomplished via the 
"Prefer"  pull-down menu, and can be saved to the file PATCH.PRF to  become 
your new defaults.

license  to  continue  using the software.  This one-time  license  fee  is 
only  $25.00,  and entitles you to both the latest  shareware  version  and 
product  announcements  as we release new versions and/or titles,  both  in 
shareware and commercial form.

There  is  no  way that we can enforce your  obligation  to  register  this 
product.   However,  we hope that you will do so in order  to  support  our 
development  of future products.  The shareware concept depends  upon  this 
sort  of support, and represents an excellent value compared to prices  for 
commercial software.

When you register BD/Patch, please send $25.00, along with the version  and 
serial numbers of the copy you have (from within Patch, press ^O? for  this 
information), to:

               Breakthrough Designs
               525 Alexander Street
               Greensburg, PA 15601

For  comments  or  suggestions  (not orders),  you  can  also  contact  the 
program's primary author, Mark Bereit, directly by electronic mail at:

               marky@draco.ece.cmu.edu  (Internet)
                    or
               74040,1003               (CompuServe)

If  you  distribute copies of BD/Patch, all the original files  (listed  in 
QUICKREF.TXT) must accompany the PATCH.EXE program in unmodified form.   If 
you  are a commercial distributor, please let us know so that we  can  keep 
you informed as we develop new shareware programs or updates.
