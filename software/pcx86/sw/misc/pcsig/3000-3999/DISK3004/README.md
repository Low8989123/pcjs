This is a slick Windows personal scheduling program.  It lets you enter 
date, time, category, and type of appointments.  Multiple entries can be
added to create to-do lists.  Appointments can be reviewed and printed  
out by time or category.  Like your favorite alarm clock, Windows       
Reminder sounds an audible alarm, and even has a snooze function that   
will re-remind you at a later time.  It can also launch a program when  
you are away from your computer.                                        
                                                                        
Text can be easily imported or exported in ASCII files.  It also        
supports DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) as both a client and server,       
letting you easily exchange data with other Windows programs.

            *** LATE-BREAKING NEWS ***

 This is the second version of Windows Reminder.
 We have fixed all known problems and added a lot more
 functionality as noted above.

 We believe the program to be bug free and fully functional.  We 
 and others have been using it for months without problems.

 Since this is the second release, we encourage any feedback as to 
 what you would like to see in future versions, and also any bugs 
 or problems with the program. 

 While the hard copy manual is still being edited and will be 
 sent to registered customers, complete online documentation is 
 available in the installation directory as REMINDER.HLP. You 
 can view the help file by using Windows WinHelp or pressing the 
 F1 key while in Windows Reminder. 




                 REGISTRATION REMINDERS

 Unlicensed copies of Windows Reminder are 100% fully functional.

 Unlicensed copies of Windows Reminder have a pesky registration 
 reminder screen that pops up whenever you start the program.

 We're sure that once you see the incredible quality of our 
 software, you will dig out your credit card, pick up the phone, 
 call the nice people at our 800 number and register Windows 
 Reminder. 

 When you pay for the shareware you like, you are voting with your
 pocketbook, and will encourage us to bring you more of the same kinds
 of products.  Pay for what you like, and voila, more of what you like
 will almost magically be developed.


                        LEGAL MATTERS

 Of course the usual disclaimers still apply.  We are not 
 responsible for anything at all.  Nothing.  Even if we are held 
 responsible, the limit of our liability is the licensing fees 
 you paid.  The full text of our license agreement is found near 
 the bottom of this file.
