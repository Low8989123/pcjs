This  program  was  suggested  to me by a user of one of my other programs,
CDMaster.  Michael Clark is a teacher at a school in West Virginia  and  he
was  right  in  the  throws of doing his own lesson plans for a school year
while using his computer.  He wondered if I could write a program  to  help
with it and keep the Find! and formatted print outs from the other program,
along with keeping it easy for computer newbies.

The result is LessonPlanZ.  It is an easy  to  use  system  that  allows  a
maximum of flexibility for the user.

The  program is MSDOS compatible, runs on 256K RAM, uses IBM graphics/laser
printers, mono or colour monitor, and can operate on one/two or  hard  disk
drives.   The  User  can  set  the colours, printer codes, and default data
drive. There are no 'crippled' features or options.

Program Features:

        *  Has  5 basic areas of text entries:  Methods, Goals, Objectives,
        Materials and Evaluation Methods for each lesson plan.
        *  The program has  supplemental  information  entries  for  Title,
        Class, Lesson Number, Dates Covered, and Number of Days
        *  The user can change the menu prompts for the text areas and  the
        section headings for each of those areas.
        *  User can obtain print outs for all or selected Lesson Plans.
        *  User  can obtain print outs or write to file a listing of all or
        select plans, a listing of specific sections of the  lesson  plans,
        an actual lesson plan or a custom made listing.
        *  The program prints folder labels for paper storage of information
        associated with a particular lesson plan.
        *  The user can set defaults for the Teacher Name and School Name.
        *  Dynamic data file (only as large as entries).
        *  Entries can be from 1 to 5000 lines.
        *  User defines printer codes.
        *  User names the data file, screen colours, and data drive.
        *  Word Wrap & Scroll toggle on/off.
        *  Common word processor commands used.
        *  On line Help editor available  (F1).
        *  Data files automatically install.
        *  Full  featured  full  screen  editing  of  text entries.
        *  Works  with  TSR  spell check/thesaurus  programs.
        *  Prints out entire opus or selected dates.
        *  Date formats for France, Britain, Germany, Italy and America.
        *  Mouseablity.
        *  Much more!





                              -LessonPlanZ 1-

Getting Started:

The following files MUST be on the same disk or sub directory:

                                   LSNPLANZ.EXE
                                   NEWUSER.DBT
                                   NEWUSER.DAT
                                   PRINT.SET
                                   COLOUR.SET
                                   HELP.PLS
                                   HELP.DBT
                                   UNIEMM.COM

QEMM.SYS And Other Extended Memory Managers:

Occasionally a problem will be incurred by a person using QEMM.SYS or other
extended  memory  manager.   This  has to do with the way that the SYS file
manages memory vs the way that the program wants to use the extended memory
(The program will attempt to use extended memory automatically,  if  it  is
available).

On  the distribution disk there is a program called UNIEMM.COM.  If you are
not using a system with EMM you can delete this file as unnecessary. If you
do have EMM just leave the file in place and use it to  load  the  program.
The utility will tell the program you are using an extended memory that has
this  anomoly  and  command  the program to remain in low memory instead of
switching to extended memory.  After  passing  these  instructions  to  the
program,  the  program  will  start  with  no  other commands needing to be
entered.

Mouse Users:

YOU  must  activate the mouse prior to the start of the program. Two Button
Users: The Left Button serves as the return/enter key, The Right Button  is
the  ESC key.  Three Button Users: Same as two button Users, and the middle
button is the F1 key.

Type LSNPLANZ or UNIEMM to start.

First Time Users:

When you first start the program, the computer will bring up the New Set Up
screen  first.   Just  enter  the  info  requested.  When you name the Disk
Drive, the program will automatically create the data files on  that  drive
for  you ! So Have A Disk In The Drive And Ready !  If you decide to create
additional data files you may do so (see below).  If you change data drives
later  be  sure  you  copy  the  *.DBT and *.DAT to the new data drive THEN
change the default data drive.

                              -LessonPlanZ 2-

                F=French   DD/MM/YY
                G=German   DD.MM.YY
                I=Italian  DD-MM-YY

Next,   the  On  Screen/Paper screen will appear, this lets the user change
or redefine any of the on screen prompts and section titles used  in  print
outs.   One  note:  If the first letter of any two menu prompts is the same
(ie Subjects and Supplies) you will loose the ability to make menu  choices
by selecting the first letter of the menu choice, and must use the lite bar
to make the section choices.

                              -LessonPlanZ 3-

The System:

Is designed using KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) so not much  information  is
needed to get started. Here are a few notes to help you use the system:

Universals:

The ESC key will take you back one menu (Mouse Users use Right Button).

The  box  in  the  upper  right  hand  corner  of  the  screen will contain
information on how to move around, and data entry tips.

The last line of the screen will tell you what the highlighted option does.

All  menu  entries  can  be selected with the light bar, or by pressing the
first letter of the option (Mouse Users when highlited the Left Button will
activate the option).

The   F10   key  will  bring  up  Help for a particular item, if no Help is
available for that item, it will allow you to enter the help  index.   From
the  index  you  may  select any of the topics of help available.  The Help
file was not written by the same person who wrote this manual, therefore it
might help better explain something to you than this manual does  and  vice
versa.

The  F1  key will bring up the Editing Help screen. Once the screen appears
you can exit the program by hitting the ESC key, any other key returns  you
to  the  system.  Great for when you are interrupted or as a Boss Key since
the entire screen is covered  (Mouse Users: Hit the Middle Button).

Add Plan:

Allows  you  to  add a new entry.  The program will bring up the add screen
and then you can select either the Header Info, or one of the text areas to
deal with.

Header  Info  contains  the Title of the plan, class,  start and end dates,
the lesson number and the number of days the plan covers.

When selecting one of the five text areas,  the screen  will  change  to  a
text editing screen for you to make your entry.

General Editing Notes:

The  screen  will  display only 20 lines of text at a time but by using the
down arrow key or Page Down key you can continue on.  Up to 5000 lines  can
be used.


                              -LessonPlanZ 4-

Select one of them or PageDown for the next 32.  If  you  know  the  lesson
number  or  title  you  want select the Lesson # or Lesson Title option and
then enter the information you to want the program to search for.

When the screen is displayed for Change, you select the areas you  want  to
change  as  you did with the Add Plan Option.  The first few lines for each
section will be displayed on the screen.

When you have completed changes, you have the option of going  on  the  the
next  plan, going back a plan,  going to the very first plan listed, or the
very last.  ESC will take you back to the menu.

school, and dates covered.

                              -LessonPlanZ 6-

Sectionals:

Lets you pick and choose the text sections to print, then provides a  print
out  with  teacher, school, class, lesson number, start and end dates, days
covered,  title  and  the  selected  sections.   The  ASCII  file  name  is
SECTION.TXT.

PlanZ:

Produces  a  standard  lesson  plan in outline format, using roman numerals
for each section (ie I,II,III...).  The  print  out  has  teacher,  school,
class,  lesson  number,  start  and  end dates, days covered, title and all
sections.  The ASCII file name is PLANZ.TXT.

Kustom List:

YOU  choose  what  is  printed  from  the  header  info.   The file name is
KUSTOM.TXT.

Find&Read:

This  option  helps you Find specific lesson plans using the same  criteria
as the Labels&Listings criteria, but puts it on the screen for you to read.
After  selecting  an  option  you will be given a list of choices that meet
your criteria, from there just highlite the one that you desire and hit the
enter key.

Utilities:

Indexing:

Lets you put the file in

Build For Speed:

Resequences  entire  data  file.

Crunch File:

Reduces the size of the file by smashing out blanks and empty  opus  lines.
DOES NOT HURT OR CHANGE DATA.

Default Set Up:

See above for Colour choices, etc.  If you desire to  create  another  data
file simply enter a capital Z for the default data drive and hit  the  Page
Down  key.  This will produce an error message and then put you back in the
Default SetUp screen.  Next, enter a NEW data file name (entering the  same

                              -LessonPlanZ 7-

name  or  name  already  used will result in that file being over written!)
and the data drive you desire.  Then hit the Page Down key.

Printer Set Up:

This allows you to customize the printer codes used by the program.   These
codes  can be found in your printer manual.  The codes that the program has
when originally distributed are for the Epson FX100.  You will need to know
the  code  for  10 cpi (Pica), 12 CPI (Elite), Enlarged, Condensed (17CPI),
Bold On and Off,  and Double High/Wide.   If  your  printer  cannot  handle
double  high/wide  DON'T  PANIC,  just leave it blank; the program will use
Enlarged for that entry. You do not have to enter the ESC part of the code,
the program will add that automatically. You can enter the letter ESC  code
or  the  number it does not matter: ie ESC code 119 can be entered as "119"
or "w".  (Do not enter any " "s!)

On Screen/Paper

The   On  Screen/Paper option lets the you change or redefine any of the on
screen prompts and section titles used in print outs.   One  note:  If  the
first letter of any two menu prompts is the same (ie Subjects and Supplies)
you  will  loose  the  ability  to make menu choices by selecting the first
letter of the menu choice, and must use the lite bar to  make  the  section
choices.

Shell To DOS:

You can exit temporarily to DOS by using that option on the Utilities Menu.
The program will swap itself to expanded memory or disk if there  is  space
{about 300K}.  If not the file COMMAND.COM must be on the same drive as the
other  program files to do this.  You must return to the subdirectory/drive
of LessonPlanZ prior to entering EXIT to return to  the  program.  It  will
leave 256K RAM free.

TSR Thesaurus & SpellCheckers:

If  you  do  not  have a TSR thesaurus already, I heartily recommend Thesaur
Plus,  by  fellow  ASP  author  Derrick  Burgess.   Even  if you have a TSR
thesauraus I still recommend that you take a look at Thesaur Plus.  What is
Thesaur Plus?  In the words of the author:

    "Thesaur Plus is a pop-up Thesaurus, whenever you need a different word
or  a  different  shade of meaning than the word that comes to mind, pop-up
Thesaur Plus  and  get  just  the  word  you  wanted,  but  couldn't  quite
remember!"

It   works  excellently  with  LessonPlanZ  and has a registration price of
only $20 (even less if you help build  it's  dictionaries).   It  can't  be

                              -LessonPlanZ 8-

beat!

I will try to maintain the latest  version,  as  convenience  to  users  of
LessonPlanZ  and  will  send  it out for $5 (to cover P&H).  I would rather
have you contact Derrick himself, since he  will  ALWAYS  have  the  latest
version: Derrick Burgess 23311 Schoolcraft St. West Hills, CA 91307

He  charges  $6.00 for the latest version of Thesaur  Plus,  $5.00 of which
is applied toward registration.

I am still looking for, but have yet to find,  a  Shareware  spell  checker
that  is  a TSR.  In the meantime the Borland product Turbo Lightening will
have  to fill the gap.  It works well with LessonPlanZ and does a very good
job of checking your spelling errors.

Enjoy!

```
Prior  to  starting this program there are a few things you should check on
your system:

1.  Do you have a CONFIG.SYS file and if so does it have at least 30 files?

To  check,  go to your root directory on your hard drive (CD\, then return)
or  put  your  DOS  Disk  in  your  floppy  drive  and  and then enter TYPE
CONFIG.SYS.  If you get File Not Found, see below.  If you get a display it
might look like this:

                                FILES=20
                                BUFFERS=49
                                DEVICE=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS

Since  the  files  listed  are below 30 you will need to increase the files
value.

The CONFIG.SYS file can be changed with any word processor that will save a
file in ASCII.

If you do not have a CONFIG.SYS file, the following  will  create  one  for
you:

                COPY CON CONFIG.SYS (Return)
                FILES=30 (Return)
                BUFFERS=20 (Return)
                (Then Hit The F6 KEY)

It   is   important   that  you  reboot  your  system  after  altering  the
CONFIG.SYS file, so that your computer will use the new information.

If  you  are  using  LOADHI  for Files, this will not work for this program
FILES=30 must be in low memory.

If you ever get an OPEN ERROR during the operation of this program and  the
file  named  is in the proper place, try increasing your files,  some other
program may be using a portion of the 30 required by this one.

2.   If you are operating an 80286 or 80386 system, and you have over 1 Meg
of  memory,  use  the  utility  LSNPLANZ.COM  to  start  the  program.  See
LSNPLANZ.DOC for details.

3.  If you use a mouse, be sure you have  included  the  appropriate  mouse
driver  in your CONFIG.SYS file.  Without this the program will not be able
to access your mouse.

OMNIMeal 3.03


Before you push this new program to the side, feeling that you have several
Recipe  programs  in your inventory and you don't need another, take a look
at the features of OMNIMeal and I believe that you  will  decide  it  is  a
welcome addition to your library.

        each recipe.

        this lists not only the ingredients of all recipes User have chosen
        but  will combine them for ease of use.  For example if User have a
        recipe that calls for 2 eggs, another that calls for 5 eggs  and  a
        third  that  calls  for  1 egg; the OMNIShop listing would tell the
        User he needs 8 eggs.

        Complete  catalog  printing  option  that  will produce a print out
        perfect for putting in a 3 ring binder.

LessonPlanZ  Ver 2.00

This  program  was  suggested  to me by a user of one of my other programs,
CDMaster.  Michael Clark is a teacher at a school in West Virginia  and  he
was  right  in  the  throws of doing his own lesson plans for a school year
while using his computer.  He wondered if I could write a program  to  help
with it and keep the Find! and formatted print outs from the other program,
along with keeping it easy for computer newbies.

The result is LessonPlanZ.  It is an easy  to  use  system  that  allows  a
maximum of flexibility for the user.

Program Features:

*  Has 5 basic areas of text entries: Methods, Goals, Objectives, Materials
and Evaluation Methods for each lesson plan.

Concept:

To  provide  a  single  source  cyclopedia of the latest data regarding the
computer industry that is rated for the user and will provide the user with
an easy way to contact the companies listed.  The system has two parts: The
data  file  is  a  listing  of  dealers  in  computer  supplies,  software,
shareware,  and  BBSs  as  well  as  authors  of  Shareware,  magazines and
newsletters.  The information is rated and complete.  The list  is  updated
daily  with  new  data files being distributed 3 times a year.  The program
lets you maintain and work with the data file, create and edit  post  cards
for  mailings  to  persons  in the data file.  Then you may retrieve either
listings of the addresses and cards, address labels, 4X6 cards, or  Roladex
cards.   The program will print post cards, and address them for you.  Post
cards cost 2/3 the price of a letter.

As the exclusive copyright holder for LessonPlanZ, Unicorn Software Limited
authorizes  on-line  distribution  only  in  accordance  with the following
restrictions.  Disk Vendors and Distributors should refer to the VENDOR.DOC
text file for complete license information.

The LessonPlanZ package is defined as containing all  the  material  listed
in  the PACKING.LST text file.  If any files listed in the PACKING.LST text
file, or the PACKING.LST file itself, are missing, then the package is  not
complete  and  distribution  is  forbidden.   Please contact us to obtain a
complete package suitable for distribution.

    o  The  LessonPlanZ package - including all related program  files  and
documentation  files  -  CANNOT  be  modified  in  any way (other than that
mentioned in the following paragraph) and must be distributed as a complete
package, without exception.  The PACKING.LST text file contains a  list  of
all files that are part of the OMNIDay package.

    o Many BBSs customarily add a small text file (advertisement)  to  each
archived  file.  This text file describes the BBS and tells people that the
file was downloaded from that particular  BBS.   Other  BBSs  add  a  small
one-line  message  with their BBS name and phone number into the compressed
file, which will display when the file is uncompressed.   Either  of  these
methods of mentioning your BBS are acceptable and may be used, provided the
program and documentation is otherwise unmodified and complete.

BBS Update Program:
-------------------

Most BBSs have standard procedures for acquiring new files.  They get  them
from  other  boards, new programs are uploaded by users, etc.  This is good
because most authors cannot  afford  to  mail  disks  or  upload  files  to
thousands  of  BBSs.  However, some BBSs prefer to obtain programs directly
from the authors.  If you would like to obtain programs directly  from  us,
automatically, then please help us to cover the cost.

If  your  BBS  would  like  to  receive  automatic  upgrades  to any of our
products, directly from us, then please refer to the information below. Due
to the time and expense we are generally unable to  upload  directly  to  a
large  number  of  Bulletin  Board  Systems.   However, we are able to mail
updates on disk (in a sealed envelope) to many BBS's.

If your BBS would like  to  receive  automatic  updates  then  please  take
advantage  of  our  BBS Update Program.  Under this program you can receive
updates for an entire year for only $10 for  all 14  programs  (this  helps
to offset our costs).

To  receive  updates,  simply send us a letter with the name and address of
your BBS, your mailing address, the name  of  the  person  we  may  contact
(preferably the SYSOP or CO-SYSOP), and a check or money order for $10 (for
countries  outside of North America please add an additional $10).  Payment
in U.S. funds drawn on a U.S.  bank only, please.

The  BBS  Update  Program  covers  all  eleven  programs in release.  For a
complete list see the file UNICORN.DOC.

NOTE: All BBS's participating in our BBS Update Program will  automatically
receive  any  NEW  programs  which  we  may  release while their BBS Update
Program is in effect.

The BBS Update Program is only intended to help us cover  our  expenses  in
those cases where a BBS desires to obtain the program directly from us.  If
you  have  other  standard ways to obtain programs, then you may prefer not
to use our BBS Update Program.
