           ---------------------------------------------------
       Copyright 1993, TRIUS, Inc.  All Rights Reserved Worldwide.
 

 This file provides information for the distribution of shareware copies of 
 ProtoCAD 3D.  Please note that this policy is for ANYONE distributing 
 shareware copies of ProtoCAD 3D for direct or indirect profit, or any sort 
 of commercial consideration. 

 Before we give you permission (in writing) to distribute ProtoCAD 3D, we 
 require that you: 

 (1)  Send us a copy of your standard written materials (catalogs, flyers, 
      ads, etc.) which clearly explain:
     
      -  the shareware concept 
      -  the requirement for users to register shareware they use
      -  the fact that the price for your disks, is a copying fee only
      -  the difference between Shareware and Public Domain software.
      
      Note: It is not sufficient to tell us that you explain these 
      issues to customers in person, it must be clearly reflected in 
      the written materials you sent us. 

 (2)  Send us a complete, final draft of the packaging that will be used 
      for ProtoCAD 3D.

 We find it necessary to insist on meeting these conditions, in order to 
 qualify for shareware distribution of ProtoCAD 3D.  Widespread confusion 
 about shareware and the occasionally troublesome practices of some vendors 
 unfortunately force us to do so.   We look forward to working with you in 
 the future.  If you distribute copies of ProtoCAD 3D, or other TRIUS 
 programs, without an Agreement from TRIUS, Inc., TRIUS will be entitled to 
 seek compensation and damages of up to $5 per disk distributed.  Please feel 
 free to contact us if you have any questions on our product or our policies.
