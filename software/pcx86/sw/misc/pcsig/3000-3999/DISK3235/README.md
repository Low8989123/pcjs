PC-SIG UPDATES PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM

For Immediate Release


PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM UPDATED TO INCLUDE A NEW USER INTERFACE AND MORE
THAN 800 MB OF PROGRAMS June 21, 1992, SUNNYVALE, CALIF. - PC-SIG, Inc.
today announced availability of The Eleventh Edition of the PC-SIG Library
on CD-ROM.  The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM contains over 800 megabytes of
shareware and includes more than 300 new programs, 550 updated programs,
and the addition of 75 megabytes of Windows 3.x shareware.  The
user-interface has been completely re-engineered to take advantage of the
HyperWriter! hypermedia and multimedia authoring system from NTERGAID, Inc.

The implementation of HyperWriter! provides significant performance and
ease of use enhancements.  Programs can access and download much faster
than with previous editions.  Programs have been reorganized and indexed
for better referencing.  Users just c lick with a mouse, or point with the
cursor, on a program name to see a complete description of the program.
Downloading or copying a program is handled automatically by HyperWriter!
Addition of a preview option is especially important for anyone who uses
images, icons, or fonts.  "You can preview the whole library of images to
find the right one," according to Bruce Kent, product development manager.
"This CD finally makes it possi ble to conserve your disk space and paper,
yet still have all the information you need to make an informed decision,"
said Kent.

All new and updated programs have been reviewed and tested by PC-SIG. Every
program goes through extensive virus checking using the most recent version
of VIRUSCAN from McAfee Associates, and other anti-virus software.
According to Kent, "In the ten ye ars we've distributed shareware, we have
never had a confirmed report of a virus on any of our distributed programs
or CD-ROMs."

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, Eleventh Edition has a list price of $179.

Upgrades from previous editions are available for $99.

Users of PC-SIG's Essential Home & Business Collection CD-ROM can upgrade
for $120.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

WINDOWS VIDEO POKER - VERSION 1.0

         WinPoker is distributed as user supported software, popularly
         referred to as SHAREWARE. You may freely copy and distribute
         the program so long as it is not modified and this
         documentation file accompanies it. A nominal service charge
         may be assessed for copying and distributing the program so
         long as it does not exceed $7. If you use the program you are
         expected to compensate the author for his efforts.  This
         encourages the continued development of better quality
         programs which are supported by their users.


DOUBLE UP OPTION TO REGISTERED USERS:

         The registration fee for WinPoker is $15 U.S. Dollars.
         An order form has been included with this package and is in
         the WINPOKER.ORD file.  Just print this form, fill it out,
         enclose payment, and mail it to me.  Those who register now,
         will receive an updated copy of WinPoker that has the Double Up
         Option included.  This is an option found in some Nevada Casino
         Poker machines that allows the chance to double your winnings.
         It adds an exciting twist to playing conventional video poker.
         This option is only available to registered users, so if you
         would like this addition to the standard Video Poker, register
         today.

         Also, the unregistered version has a reminder screen that pops
         up after about every 50 hands.  The registered version does
         not have this pop up screen.


THE FILES:

     There should be three files included with WinPoker

      winpoker.exe - The executable
      winpoker.doc - This file
      winpoker.ord - The order form


THE GAME:

     This game is modeled after the video poker machines  that are
     found in most Nevada casinos.  It is your basic five card draw
     video poker game, with odds paid based on the hand you draw.
     After selecting DEAL, the computer will display 5 cards face
     up.  You can hold any, all, or none of the five cards.  Any cards not
     held are replaced with new cards from the deck upon hitting DEAL
     again.  Your payoff is based upon the amount bet and the odds
     below


       ROYAL FLUSH    - 4000 Coins if 5 coins bet, otherwise, 300 FOR 1
       STRAIGHT FLUSH - 50 FOR 1
       4 OF A KIND    - 25 FOR 1
       FULL HOUSE     - 8 FOR 1
       FLUSH          - 5 FOR 1
       STRAIGHT       - 4 FOR 1
       3 OF A KIND    - 3 FOR 1
       TWO PAIR       - 2 FOR 1
       PAIR OF JACKS OR BETTER - 1 FOR 1

       For those of you who are not familar with odds, the word FOR means
       how much is returned FOR a unit bet (The amount is already bet and is
       NOT returned)  When odds are quoted as TO such as 1 TO 1 then you
       get 1 unit for 1 unit bet, plus the original bet is return.
       1 FOR 1 on the other hand, is like a push, you just get your bet back.

       Well thats it for my discussion of video poker.  If you would like
       more information on the game itself, I would suggest going to your
       local bookstore and getting a book on casino games.  A lot of the
       more popular ones include a chapter on Video Poker Machines due
       to their increased popularity in casinos.




THE CONTROLS:

     MOUSE USERS - The RIGHT mouse button will deal the cards at
                   the beginning of a new hand, AND when you need
                   replacement cards. ( An alternate way to deal or
                   start play is to click on the "Deal / Play" menu
                   item once with the left button.)

                   The LEFT mouse button is used to toggle the HOLD
                   on the cards you want to keep.  Just click the left
                   button anywhere inside the card you want to keep.
                   Click a second time to free the HOLD.

                   The BET menu is where you can change your
                   bet.  The game starts with 5 coins bet, and you
                   can change the bet from 1 to 5 coins.  Once the
                   bet is set, it will stay that way until you change
                   it via the BET menu.  The accelerator keys are
                   F1 (for 1 coin) to F5 (for 5 coins).

                   Thats all you need to play the game with a mouse.
                   Right button to start the game ... left button
                   to hold the cards you want to keep ... right button
                   again to deal the "new" cards.

  KEYBOARD USERS - To start play and deal the cards, hit ENTER.  An alternate
                   method is to use the hot key (Alt-D) to activate the
                   "Deal / Play" menu item.

                   To hold the cards you want to keep, enter the numbers 1 thru
                   5 with 1 correspinding to the card on the far left and
                   5 corresponding to the card on the far right.

                   To change the bet use the Alt-B hot key to get to the
                   BET menu item and cursor down to the bet you want.
                   An alternate, is to use the Accelerator Keys.  F1 to
                   bet 1 coin to F5 for 5 coins.
                   Remember, once the bet is set you don't need to enter it
                   each hand, unless you want to change it.

  OTHER OPTIONS -  The other option is to change the background color.
                   From the options menu item choose colors then pick one
                   of the three available colors (Black, Blue, or Green)

  BANKROLL      -  The bankroll will start at 0 whenever WinPoker is started.
                   If you end up with a positive number, thats is your
                   winnings, if negative, that is what you would have lost.
                   There is currently no option for the player to change
                   the bankroll.


MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION:

     This game is a Windows 3.0 application.  It will not run in
     real mode of windows 3, nor will it run in prior versions of Windows.
     It was designed for a standard VGA display.  Users of EGA displays
     will not see the bottom of the cards.  I am willing to fix this
     for the next release if there is any demand.  (Be sure to let me
     know via compuserv or U.S Mail and I will send you a copy when
     I add the EGA support).  It was not tested on any higher
     resolution than 640 X 480 (VGA).

     I only tested this program with a standard VGA display on
     an IBM PS/2 Model 70 with 3 MB of RAM.  It works in both
     the standard, and 386 enhanced mode of Windows 3.0.  If there
     are problems, I would like to know about them.  Leave me a
     note on Compuserv or send me mail and I will try to respond
     as soon as I can.


THE FINE PRINT:

     This software is for entertainment purposes only, and
     is sold "as is", without any warranty as to performance
     or any other warranties whether expressed or implied.  Because of the
     many hardware and software environments into which this program may
     be used, no warranty of fitness for a particular purpose is offered.
     The user must assume the entire risk of using the program.  Any
     liability of the seller will be limited exclusively to product
     replacement or the refund of the registration fee.

WinSolit is created to run under Window 3.x.  This is the very first version
of this program and keyboard support is limited.  This will be fixed in 
future versions.

WinSolit consists of three files: WINSPIDR.EXE, WINSPIDR.HLP and WINCARDS.DLL
All three files must be kept in the same directory OR WINCARDS.DLL and 
WINSPIDR.HLP may be put in the WINDOWS directory.  If you get errors that say
WINCARDS.DLL is not found or the help file is not found, you may NEED to copy
these two files to the WINDOWS directory.  

WinSolit will create a file called WINCARDS.INI in the WINDOWS directory.

WINCARDS.DLL is copyright 1992 by John A. Junod and may only be distributed
with WINSOLIT.EXE or WINSPIDR.EXE.

WinSolit is a Windows conversion of a program from myself called EGA-Solitaire.
WinSpidr is a Windows conversion of a program from myself called EGA-Spider.
