ASP Approved Vendors in good standing are hereby given permission to
distribute WinDex package.  Non-ASP member vendors must request prior
permission before distributing the WinDex package.

The WinDex package is defined as containing all the material listed in the
FILES.TXT text file.  If any files listed in the FILES.TXT text file, or the
FILES.TXT file itself, are missing, then the package is not complete and
distribution is forbidden.  Please contact us to obtain a complete package
suitable for distribution.

The WinDex package - including all related program files and documentation
files - CANNOT be modified in any way and must be distributed as a complete
package, without exception.  The FILES.TXT text file contains a list of all
files that are part of the WinDex package.

No price or other compensation may be charged for the WinDex package. A
distribution fee may be charged for the cost of the diskette, shipping and
handling, as long as the total (per disk) does not exceed $5.00 (US) in the
U.S. and Canada, or $10.00 (US) internationally.

Disk Sets & CD-ROMs:

The WinDex package may not be sold as part of some other inclusive package.
Nor can it be included in any commercial software packaging offer, without a
written agreement from the author.

ASP Approved Vendors who wish to distribute the WinDex package as part of a
collection (such as PsL's MegaDisk set, or a CD-ROM package) may do so
provided that all the other restrictions are met.

Vendors (non-ASP Vendor Members) who wish to distribute the WinDex package
as part of a collection (such as PsL's MegaDisk set, or a CD-ROM package)
must obtain permission from the author prior to beginning such a
distribution.

If you wish to add any of our programs to a CD-ROM or other collection,
please check the release date of the version you have.  If the version is
over six (6) months old then please contact us to ensure that you have the
most current version.  This version (1.1) was released in March 1993.

                             Registering WinDex

Do I have to pay for WinDex?  Basically, YES...  although you don't have to
pay before you decide if you will continue using it.  WinDex is not free -
it is Shareware.  You get to try it out, without obligation, to see if it's a
program that you are likely to continue using.  However, after evaluating
the program, you are required to either pay for it or to quit using it.
WinDex was released as shareware because it is a useful Windows Rolodex
program, and you will probably want to continue using it.  Therefore, you 
should register soon in order to take advantage of the introductory offer.  
There are many benefits to registering WinDex immediately.  Don't miss out.

How do I register?  It's easy!  To register WinDex, you need to print the 
file REGISTER.FRM, then fill it out and enclose a check or money
order and mail it to the address shown. 

How much does it cost?  You can register WinDex V1.0 for as little $20 in 
the US.  You can get additional copies for even less.  Site licenses are 
also available for large businesses (write to the address on the 
registration form for the details).

Copies  Cost
------  -----------
1       $20.00 Each
5       $17.50 Each
20      $15.00 Each
100     $12.00 Each


What do I get for registering?

Price Protection:  The next release of WinDex may have a higher price.  For 
only $20.00, you get the right to use this version of WinDex, plus all future
versions for no extra charge.  This offer only applies to V1.1, and may not
be repeated. So to insure that you can use future versions, register now.

Current Version:  When you register, you will get a diskette containing the
absolute latest release of WinDex.

New Versions:  If you want to be notified of new versions automatically, you
can ask to be added to the new version mailing list.  Every time a major new
version is released you will be notified automatically.  Your V1.1 license
will entitle you to use all new versions of the software for no additional
cost.

Documentation:   When you register, you will receive laser printed 
documentation that will help you get the most out of WinDex.

Support:  As a registered user, you will be able to ask questions and get
support via CompuServe or Internet mail.

Nag Screen:  WinDex has an annoying "Nag Screen" which displays when an 
unregistered version is run.  When you register, your license will contain 
instructions for disabling the nag screen.

                         WinDex Release Notes
                         --------------------

WinDex V1.0 - Released 1/18/93
(c) 1993 - John Miller - EastWin Software

WinDex V1.1 - Released 3/1/93
(c) 1993 - John Miller - EastWin Software

Dialer:  

V1.1 adds a dialer feature that can be used to dial the phone for you.  
The first time you use the dialer, check the dial command to make 
sure it is appropriate for your modem and phone line.  If you have Centrex 
lines, change the dial command to "ATDT9,".

In order to use the Dialer, you have to make your modem settings from 
Control panel.  Modem settings shouldn't matter though, as WinDex only sends
a dial command then hangs up the modem.

WinDex will only work with modems that support the Hayes command set.  It
should work with any internal or external modem.  However, due to limited
resources, it has only been tested with a few different modems.

Support for Windows 3.0:

WinDex V1.0 did not support Windows 3.0.  This was due to the code that
handled the "Always On Top" feature.  In WinDex V1.1, this code checks
the Windows version, and only makes a change in Windows 3.1.  WinDex 1.1
will now run on Windows 3.0 (without the Always On Top feature).
