     your computer while you work!  This version even plays wave
     files over the PC speaker.  Complete with Windows Help for
     playing files and instructions for how to register this
     product.

                            SHAREWARE

                       VERSION DESCRIPTION
                       ===================
     VERSION 2.0

     VB Jr version 2.0 was developed to work with the Multimedia
     extensions that are part of Windows 3.1.  The advantages are
     many, including automatic support for any audio card which
     has the Multimedia Drivers.  Since the multimedia standard
     digital waveform file is .WAV, this is the file used for the
     unregistered version of VB Jr 2.0.  The registered version
     will support the .VOC waveform files.

     VERSION 1.0

     Version 1.0 of VB Jr was written for Windows 3.0.  This
     version uses a Windows 3.0 DLL called "SNDBLST.DLL" written
     by Creative Labs.  This DLL is not compatible with the
     Windows Multimedia Extensions, and should only be used for
     Windows 3.0.  If you do not wish to upgrade to Window 3.1,
     then register for VB Sr and specify the Windows 3.0 version.
     There has been reported problems with using the "SNDBLST.DLL"
     with the Audio Vision Thunder card.  It is strongly
     recommended you upgrade to Windows 3.1 and use the latest VB
     Programs available today.

                            SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
                            ===================

     * 286 or better PC
     * Min of 1 MB Ram
     * Windows 3.1 or Windows with Multimedia Extensions
     * Any Windows supported Monitor
     * Mouse recommended but not required
     * Audio card with digital audio output and/or music output
       capability with Windows Multimedia Drivers
     * Will play waveform data through PC speaker with the
       speaker driver installed (available from Microsoft)

     Any sound card that has the Windows multimedia drivers
     installed will work with this program.  Some of these cards
     are the Sound Blaster, Sound Blaster Pro and Basic, Thunder
     Cards, Pro AudioSpectrum Series, and any other cards which
     have Windows multimedia drivers support for music or
     digitized sound.

     Contact the manufacturer of your audio card if you do not
     currently have the Windows multimedia drivers, or if your
     drivers are older than Jan 1992, chances are there are
     updates available via BBS or US mail.

     Creative Labs and Media Vision both have BBS for
     downloading the latest drivers (BBS numbers for Creative Labs
     and Media Vision are listed in the 'HELP' section of VB Jr)

                             INSTALLATION
                             ============

     VB Jr will run from a floppy drive, but since it is a
     windows application, it is better to install it onto your
     hard drive.

     Installation of VB Jr to a hard drive is easy. Here is what
     you do:

     1) Make a directory for VB Jr (if desired, recommended!)
     2) Copy all the above files to the new directory
     3) Run Windows 3.1 or Windows with Multimedia
     4) Add VB Jr to a program group or just run it

     Here is an example where C:\VBJR is the desired directory
     [PATH] = C:\PCPLUS\DWN ([PATH] is the directory where the VB
     JR files reside). If the files was on the "B:" drive, then
     substitute "B:" where you see [PATH]
                                                         - 4 -
     PROMPT        YOU TYPE THIS

     C:\           MD C:\VBJR
     C:\           CD C:\VBJR
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\VBJR.EXE
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\VBJRU.HLP
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\REGISTER.TXT
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\README.TXT
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\VENDOR.DOC
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\BBS.DOC
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\DESCRIBE.DOC
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\FILE_ID.DIZ
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\INVOICE.DOC
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\DEMO.MID
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\LOONYTUN.WAV

     Since VB Jr is shareware, all the above files must be kept
     together.  Of course, it would be better to use Windows File
     Manager, or any other file copy utility to copy the VB Jr
     files, but the above example was given for clarity.
     
     If you have received this package from a BBS, then it would
     be better to unzip all the files directly into the new
     directory. Here is an example of unarchiving the files into
     the new directory:

     PROMPT            YOU TYPE THIS

     C:\PCPLUS\DWN     MD C:\VBJR
     C:\PCPLUS\DWN     PKUNZIP VPLAYW.ZIP C:\VBJR

     If this package was received from a Shareware Company, then
     refer to the installation instructions that came with this
     file.

                       RUNNING THE PROGRAM
                       ===================

     Since VB Jr is a Windows application, it must be run from
     Windows. Run the program "VBJR.EXE" to run VB Jr.  After
     running the program, select the "HELP" button to receive on-
     line help for playing files and to receive instructions for
     how the register this product, and additional information
     such as audio card BBS support numbers, and more!

                       VOICE BLASTER QUICK PLAY

     █████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

     Voice Blaster Quick Play is offered for $50.00 U.S.  You do
     not have to register one of the Voice Blaster Products to buy
     VB Quick Play.

     Voice Blaster Quick Play is a program written to receive an
     optional passing parameter that is the filename you wish to
     play.  If the filename is found, VB Quick play will run
     minimized while playing the specified file.  After the file
     is played, VB Quick Play automatically exits.  An excellent
     program to use to add .WAV file support in your Windows
     applications.  The calling Window will remain active while
     the .WAV file is being played in the background in a
     minimized window.  An example of playing a .WAV file from the
     Program Manager is:

          Select "File", then "Run", and then enter
          "c:\windows\vbqplay.exe tada.wav"

     This program currently only supports .WAV files. A site
     license is available for multiple packages.

     playing files and instructions for how to register this
     product.

                            SHAREWARE

                       VERSION DESCRIPTION
                       ===================
     VERSION 2.0

     VB Jr version 2.0 was developed to work with the Multimedia
     extensions that are part of Windows 3.1.  The advantages are
     many, including automatic support for any audio card which
     has the Multimedia Drivers.  Since the multimedia standard
     digital waveform file is .WAV, this is the file used for the
     unregistered version of VB Jr 2.0.  The registered version
     will support the .VOC waveform files.

     VERSION 1.0

     Version 1.0 of VB Jr was written for Windows 3.0.  This
     version uses a Windows 3.0 DLL called "SNDBLST.DLL" written
     by Creative Labs.  This DLL is not compatible with the
     Windows Multimedia Extensions, and should only be used for
     Windows 3.0.  If you do not wish to upgrade to Window 3.1,
     then register for VB Sr and specify the Windows 3.0 version.
     There has been reported problems with using the "SNDBLST.DLL"
     with the Audio Vision Thunder card.  It is strongly
     recommended you upgrade to Windows 3.1 and use the latest VB
     Programs available today.

                            SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
                            ===================

     * 286 or better PC
     * Min of 1 MB Ram
     * Windows 3.1 or Windows with Multimedia Extensions
     * Any Windows supported Monitor
     * Mouse recommended but not required
     * Audio card with digital audio output and/or music output
       capability with Windows Multimedia Drivers
     * Will play waveform data through PC speaker with the
       speaker driver installed (available from Microsoft)

     Any sound card that has the Windows multimedia drivers
     installed will work with this program.  Some of these cards
     are the Sound Blaster, Sound Blaster Pro and Basic, Thunder
     Cards, Pro AudioSpectrum Series, and any other cards which
     have Windows multimedia drivers support for music or
     digitized sound.

     Contact the manufacturer of your audio card if you do not
     currently have the Windows multimedia drivers, or if your
     drivers are older than Jan 1992, chances are there are
     updates available via BBS or US mail.

     Creative Labs and Media Vision both have BBS for
     downloading the latest drivers (BBS numbers for Creative Labs
     and Media Vision are listed in the 'HELP' section of VB Jr)

                             INSTALLATION
                             ============

     VB Jr will run from a floppy drive, but since it is a
     windows application, it is better to install it onto your
     hard drive.

     Installation of VB Jr to a hard drive is easy. Here is what
     you do:

     1) Make a directory for VB Jr (if desired, recommended!)
     2) Copy all the above files to the new directory
     3) Run Windows 3.1 or Windows with Multimedia
     4) Add VB Jr to a program group or just run it

     Here is an example where C:\VBJR is the desired directory
     [PATH] = C:\PCPLUS\DWN ([PATH] is the directory where the VB
     JR files reside). If the files was on the "B:" drive, then
     substitute "B:" where you see [PATH]
                                                         - 4 -
     PROMPT        YOU TYPE THIS

     C:\           MD C:\VBJR
     C:\           CD C:\VBJR
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\VBJR.EXE
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\VBJRU.HLP
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\REGISTER.TXT
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\README.TXT
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\VENDOR.DOC
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\BBS.DOC
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\DESCRIBE.DOC
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\FILE_ID.DIZ
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\INVOICE.DOC
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\DEMO.MID
     C:\VBJR\      COPY [PATH]\LOONYTUN.WAV

     Since VB Jr is shareware, all the above files must be kept
     together.  Of course, it would be better to use Windows File
     Manager, or any other file copy utility to copy the VB Jr
     files, but the above example was given for clarity.
     
     If you have received this package from a BBS, then it would
     be better to unzip all the files directly into the new
     directory. Here is an example of unarchiving the files into
     the new directory:

     PROMPT            YOU TYPE THIS

     C:\PCPLUS\DWN     MD C:\VBJR
     C:\PCPLUS\DWN     PKUNZIP VPLAYW.ZIP C:\VBJR

     If this package was received from a Shareware Company, then
     refer to the installation instructions that came with this
     file.

                       RUNNING THE PROGRAM
                       ===================

     Since VB Jr is a Windows application, it must be run from
     Windows. Run the program "VBJR.EXE" to run VB Jr.  After
     running the program, select the "HELP" button to receive on-
     line help for playing files and to receive instructions for
     how the register this product, and additional information
     such as audio card BBS support numbers, and more!

     available only with one of the above registrations.  Even if

     Microsoft on numerous BBS's).  Please include the appropriate
     amount for each sound disk desired:

     Disk 1                                               $5.00

     effects

     Over 700 KB of sound files each from 10 - 30 sec long song
     cuts

                       VOICE BLASTER QUICK PLAY

     █████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

     Voice Blaster Quick Play is offered for $50.00 U.S.  You do
     not have to register one of the Voice Blaster Products to buy
     VB Quick Play.

     Voice Blaster Quick Play is a program written to receive an
     optional passing parameter that is the filename you wish to
     play.  If the filename is found, VB Quick play will run
     minimized while playing the specified file.  After the file
     is played, VB Quick Play automatically exits.  An excellent
     program to use to add .WAV file support in your Windows
     applications.  The calling Window will remain active while
     the .WAV file is being played in the background in a
     minimized window.  An example of playing a .WAV file from the
     Program Manager is:

          Select "File", then "Run", and then enter
          "c:\windows\vbqplay.exe tada.wav"

     This program currently only supports .WAV files. A site
     license is available for multiple packages.
