MULTILABEL

Version 2.5

INTRODUCTION

Need a lot of labels? MultiLabel's your program. Using MultiLabel 
with Microsoft Windows 3.x, you can create professional-looking 
labels in just a few minutes. It's far easier to create and print 
your labels in MultiLabel than by following the traditional path of 
using a word processor or desktop publishing program to do the job. 
Supplies are no problem, since MultiLabel uses standard Avery Laser 
Labels...all of them!

Using MultiLabel, you have complete control over the entire design 
process. Since you see your label on the screen, as it will appear 
when printed, you can make as many changes as you like, as often as 
you like.

PROFESSIONAL USERS

If you're a graphic design professional, or the owner of a small 
print shop, MultiLabel's your answer too. Instead of your customers 
trying to figure out what they want their labels to look like, they 
can see the design on paper--before you send it to the printer. The 
result is far fewer costly returns. You have a happy customer and 
cash in your pocket.

There's even more. Using MultiLabel's multiple copy printing option, 
you can print as many sheets of your customer's designs as you need. 
Being able to offer your clients a quick batch of labels while they 
wait can mean the difference between a sale and a walk-out.

MULTILABEL'S FEATURES

You can create just about any style of label with MultiLabel Here's a 
list of some of the features of the program:

*WYSIWYG Design Screen
*Use Any Avery Laser Label Format
*Create Custom Label Layouts
*Use Any Font Available in Windows
*Insert Clip Art on Label
*Preview Clip Art Before Loading
*Automatic Serial Number Creation
*Line, Box, and Circle Drawing
*Bold, Italic, Bold-Italic, and Reversed type
*Adjustable Margins
*Margins display on WYSIWYG Screen
*Text Alignment Tools
*Split Lines of Type
*Automatic Bulleted Lists
*Scale and Position Graphics and Lines to .005" Accuracy
*Insert Character Formats inside Lines
*Print As Many Sheets of Labels as You Need
*Save Completed Labels to Disk.
*Easy-to-use Interface
*Online Help


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

MultiLabel requires an 80286, 80386, or 80486 computer, with at least 
2 MB of RAM. You also need Microsoft Windows 3.x, plus a hard disk and 
mouse. For printing, any Hewlett-Packard LaserJet or compatible 
printer with at least 2.5 MB of memory is your best choice. The 
program does work with PostScript devices, but clip art images will 
not print on PostScript printers. On Dot-matrix printers, clip art may 
not be positioned accurately. For best results, TrueType fonts, or a 
font-scaling program, such as Adobe Type Manager, are strongly 
suggested. MultiLabel does not support the SuperPrint font scaling 
software.

MultiLabel does support PostScript devices. However, clip art images 
will not print on these printers in most cases. If you use a 
PostScript printer, you must have matching screen fonts for your 
PostScript fonts. If you use Adobe Type Manager, your system must be 
set up properly to download fonts as needed.

Since MultiLabel is designed to use laser printer labels, use with 
dot-matrix printers may not be satisfactory. Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 
printers, however, will work with MultiLabel, with adjustments to the 
Printer Fudge Factors, described below.

MultiLabel was written in Microsoft Visual Basic. To use it, as with 
any Visual Basic program, the file VBRUN100.DLL, included on your 
distribution disk, is required. If you do not have this file, you may 
download it from the OsoSoft BBS at (805) 528-3753, or from major 
online services.

LICENSE INFORMATION

MultiLabel is a shareware program. This is the unregistered version, 
which you may use for a trial period of 30 days. After that time, you 
must register your copy. The fee for registration is $15, and entitles 
you to support. You will receive a disk with the current registered 
version.

Registration of a single copy of MultiLabel entitles you to use it on 
as many computers as you have in a single location. If you have more 
than one location where you use MultiLabel, you must register 
additional copies for each location. A location is defined as a 
separate building or floor of a building. Registered users are also 
entitled to phone, E-mail, and FAX support. 

There are three ways to register your copy of MultiLabel:

1. Send a check for $15, drawn on a US bank to:

OsoSoft 
1472 Sixth Street 
Los Osos, CA 93402

NOTE: For your convenience, use the OsoSoft Program Info command in 
the Help menu to print a handy order blank.

2. If you prefer to register by credit card, you can call Public 
(software) Library at (800) 242-4775 and register with your Visa, 
MasterCard, American Express, or Discover card. NOTE: THIS NUMBER IS 
FOR ORDERS ONLY! There is a $4.00 fee for shipping and handling on 
credit card orders.

3. If you are a CompuServe user, you can register online. Use the GO 
SWREG command and register MultiLabel there. The $15 fee will be 
charged to your CompuServe account.


Current versions of all OsoSoft programs are available on the 
OsoSoft BBS. Call (805) 528-3753, 300-2400 bps, 8/N/1.


INSTALLATION

If you have manually installed other Windows software, you can 
probably skip this section, although it's a good idea to read it in 
any case.

To install MultiLabel, first create a directory especially for the 
program. If you need help with the DOS MKDIR (MD) command, see your 
DOS manual.

Now, copy all the files included with MultiLabel into your new 
directory. You can use the DOS command line, the Windows File 
Manager, or another Windows shell program to do this. Finally, copy 
the VBRUN100.DLL file into your Windows home directory.

Now, start up the Windows Program Manager, if it's not already on the
screen. If you use another program shell, such as the Norton Desktop 
Manager, you'll need to consult that program's instructions on 
manually installing a new program. Otherwise, with Program Manager, 
follow the instructions below:

1. Click once on the program group where you want the MultiLabel icon 
to appear.

2. Click the Program Manager's File menu command.

3. Click the New command.

4. Click OK in the next dialog box to create a new program item.

5. Type MultiLabel, then press the <Tab> key.

6. Type the Path to your MultiLabel directory, then type MLTLBL.EXE.

Your entry should look like this (with your own path information):

C:\MLTLBL\MLTLBL.EXE

NOTE: On a few laptops and desktop systems, MultiLabel may cause 
keyboard problems in it's default installation. If this occurs, 
change the line above by adding NF to the end of the line. Now your 
line will look like this:

C:\MLTLBL\MLTLBL.EXE NF

See the section below on the Flashing Scroll Lock LED for more 
information.

7. If you use Windows 3.1, enter the path for your MultiLabel 
directory in the Working Directory Field as well.

8. Check your information, then click OK.

9. The MultiLabel icon will appear in the program group box you 
selected. You may have to use the scroll bars to find it, but you can 
then drag the icon to a new location.

9. Remember: in order to save your new Program Manager screen, you 
must check the Save Changes box when you exit Windows after loading 
MultiLabel

This completes the installation of MultiLabel on your computer and 
into Windows.

STARTING MULTILABEL

To run MultiLabel, start Windows, then double click on the MultiLabel 
icon. That's all there is to it. However, if you use another program 
shell in Windows, you may have to use a different technique to start 
the program. Consult your shell program's manual for detailed 
information.

THE MULTILABEL INTERFACE

When you start MultiLabel, for the first time, you'll have a short 
delay while the program creates its font list and prepares the rest 
of the program. A notice will appear on your screen as the program 
loads. If you have a large font library, this may take up to a 
minute. Once this list is created, MultiLabel loads the font list 
from a file. If you add or delete fonts, MultiLabel will automatically 
update your font list the next time you start the program.

Next, you'll see the MultiLabel screen, which is maximized to take up 
the entire Windows screen. Unlike many other Windows programs, 
MultiLabel uses command buttons and drop-down list boxes to perform 
most functions. The commands you need to create label designs are 
always right on the screen, grouped according to function. Tradition 
Windows menus duplicate most button functions, and offer some 
less-used commands.

FLASHING SCROLL LOCK LED

Due to a missing feature in Visual Basic, I was forced to flash your 
Scroll Lock LED on and off rapidly.

On some systems, or with some other software running, this may cause 
difficulty with text editing. If this happens, simply add the 
parameter NF to the command line entry in the Program Manager's 
Properties dialog box. Put a space between .EXE and NF Example:

If your <Num Lock> or other toggle key LED's flash, simply press the 
offending key to shut the flashing off, or use the NF switch as 
described above.

C:\MLTLBL\MLTLBL.EXE NF

This will solve the problem, but you'll have to press the Shift key 
to force MultiLabel to update the line number when you move the cursor 
to a new line with the mouse.

EDITING AND DISPLAY BOXES

You'll see two windows on the screen. At the top is the text-editing 
box. Here, you'll enter and edit all the text to be included on your 
label. Just below it is another box, where a WYSIWYG display of your 
label appears. You can't edit directly in this WYSIWYG box.

Editing Text in MultiLabel

MultiLabel's editing box works just like your Windows word processing 
program. You can simply type your text in the box. To position the 
cursor in your text, either use the cursor keys or click the mouse 
cursor where you want to type. If you select text by dragging with 
the mouse, new text you type replaces the selected text.

Normally, to save time, MultiLabel only updates the WYSIWYG display 
when you change formatting. If you want more frequent updates, click 
the Edit menu and click on the Auto Updating Enabled command. This 
will place a check-mark next to the command and MultiLabel will update 
the WYSISYG display whenever you move to a new text line. Try it both 
ways.

As you type, MultiLabel repeats all formatting from the previous line 
whenever you press <Enter>. Use this feature to repeat formatting by 
setting the formatting on any line, then continue your typing.

You are limited to 36 lines of text in MultiLabel

LEFT SIDE BUTTONS

On the far left of your screen is a vertical row of buttons, in three
groups. These buttons handle basic file and printing operations.

The Text Group

This group has just two buttons:

[Edit] -- This button returns the cursor to the text editing box. 
Since MultiLabel always returns control to this box, you'll rarely, if
ever have to click this button.

[Exit] -- Click this button to leave MultiLabel You'll be asked 
whether you want to save the current file. Click [No] for an 
immediate exit, or [Yes] to save your current label.

The Label Group

Several buttons make up this group, which deals with files and your 
label design as a whole.

[Update] -- This button updates the WYSIWYG display. To prevent 
excessive delays, some commands used in MultiLabel do not 
automatically update this display. Any time you want to see an 
updated version of your label, just click this button. Note: you can 
also update your display by moving the cursor to a new line of text 
in the editing box, if the Auto Update option is checked in the Edit 
menu.

[Clear] -- This button clears your current label from the screen and 
from memory. You'll be asked to confirm this command.

[New] -- This button clears your current label and prepares MultiLabel
for an entirely new label, with no filename attached.

[Load] -- The Load command lets you retrieve an existing label design
from your hard disk. You'll see a typical Windows file opening dialog
box, listing the files available. Normally, your label designs will 
have the file extension .LAB, unless you specify a different 
extension.

[Save] -- Saves the current label with the current filename. No 
prompting takes place, and the design on the screen at the time of 
the save overwrites any previous data. If no filename has been 
assigned to the current label, the Save As dialog box will appear.

[Save As] -- Lets you assign a new name for a label design. If you're 
creating several variations of the same label, be sure to use this 
command to prevent overwriting a previous design. If you enter a 
filename without an extension, MultiLabel will add the .LAB extension.
It's best to stick to the default extension to avoid making changes 
in the dialog box when you load designs.

[Print] -- This button prints your labels, after asking you how many 
sheets to print.

NOTE: If you use serial numbers in your labels, print only one copy of 
the label sheet at a time, since multiple sheet printing uses your 
printer's multiple copy commands. If you print multiple copies, all 
sheets will have the same serial numbers. If you need multiple sheets, 
print each sheet separately, using the print command and one copy.

[Print 1] -- This button prints a single test label quickly on plain 
paper, in the upper left corner of the page.

[AddArt] --This button opens a dialog box for loading graphical 
images. You'll see a list of files in the BMP (Bitmap) format, 
including clip art files shipped with your copy of MultiLabel. 
MultiLabel can use images only in Windows BMP format.

To preview clip art images, click once on a clip art file in the 
filename box. If you click just once, you'll see a preview of the 
image in the size it will appear on your label. If it's too small or 
too large, you can scale it later from within MultiLabel. If you click 
on an invalid file, MultiLabel will simply ignore your selection. By 
clicking on additional clip art filenames, you can preview all the 
graphics you have available. Naturally, you can use normal Windows 
techniques to find files on other drives and directories.

To place an image onto your label, double click on the file name you 
want to load, or click OK to load the current image. If you click 
Cancel, no image will load.

[Serial #] -- Inserts a serial number at the cursor position, after 
asking you for the starting serial number. This serial number 
automatically increments when you print, and is saved in label files. 
When you load a serialized label, it automatically starts at the next 
number. You can insert serial numbers anywhere in a line of text. If 
you need continuous numbering for multiple sessions of running 
MultiLabel, be sure to save your label after printing to update the 
serial number.

NOTE: Serial numbers can't be used with the Split Line at Tilde 
alignment option.

NOTE: If you use serial numbers in your labels, print only one copy of 
the label sheet at a time, since multiple sheet printing uses your 
printer's multiple copy commands. If you print multiple copies, all 
sheets will have the same serial numbers. If you need multiple sheets, 
print each sheet separately, using the print command and one copy.

The Layout Group

[Format] -- Lets you choose one of the many Laser Label formats from 
Avery. As an alternative, you can design a custom label format for 
other sheets of laser labels. Formats are saved when you save a label 
file. The current Avery product number appears above this button.

[Margins] -- This button lets you set customized margins for your 
label. These margins affect only the top and sides. The default is .1 
inch. If an offset has been added with the next button, that offset is 
added to the margin automatically.

NOTE: It is entirely possible for you to create text which extends 
beyond the right and bottom of your label. This text will print, so 
watch the WYSIWYB box to make sure all your text fits on the label.


RIGHT SIDE COMMANDS

On the right side of the editing and WYSIWYG screens are three other 
groups of commands. These deal with text formatting and graphics. 
Some of these are buttons, while others present options in list boxes
for easy selection. Starting from the top:

Text Attributes (Insert Within Line)

These buttons allow you to insert boldfacing, italics, etc. within a 
line of type on your label. When you click one of these buttons a 
code, such as <Bold>, is inserted in your text, telling MultiLabel to 
change the attributes for all characters following the code. To 
remove such a code, use normal text editing tools to delete it in the 
text editing box.

HINT: You'll get the best results if you use these inserted commands 
sparingly. If you want to format an entire line, use the commands in 
the next group of commands.

NOTE: You cannot use these internal codes inside split lines.

NOTE: You cannot place two formatting codes next to each other. At 
least one character or space must separate formatting codes. For 
example, to add boldfacing AND italics, insert a bold code before a 
space, then an italic code just before the word to be italicized.

[Normal] -- This inserted <Norm> code shuts off all other codes. For 
example, to boldface a single word, insert a <Bold> code immediately 
before the word, then a <Norm> code immediately following the word.

[Bold] -- Inserts <Bold> in your text. Any font may be boldfaced.

[Ital] -- Inserts <Ital>.

[Underline] -- Inserts <Under>.

[Subscript] -- Inserts <Subs>.

[Superscript] -- Inserts <Supr>

NOTE: [Superscript] and [Subscript] allow you to position text above 
or below the current line. Text size is reduced to 66% of the 
original text. This may affect line spacing on your label.

NOTE: You cannot use any of the above buttons on lines which have the
Split at Tilde attribute, (See below). If you try, you'll see a 
message box telling you this.

[Bullet] -- This button inserts a standard bullet character at the 
current cursor position in the text editing box. Use it to create 
bulleted lists on your label. You can insert bullets anywhere in your
text, and even in split lines.


Text Attributes (Whole Line)

Unlike the previous set of commands, these commands affect an entire 
line, and offer a great deal of control over your formatting. You 
should use these commands whenever possible, rather than the inserted 
commands.

[Line] -- Displays the current line number, as determined by the 
position of your cursor in the text editing box.

[Dupe Previous] -- This button repeats the formatting of the line 
above the current line. This is useful whenever you want duplicate 
formats on several lines. Just format the first line to contain that 
format, then move to the next line and click this button. All line 
attributes will be duplicated.

[Font] -- This drop-down list box displays the current font, and lets 
you change a line to another font. Click on the arrow to drop down 
the font selection list. Scroll through the list, then click on your 
font selection. You'll see a sample of your selected font in a box 
just above this list box. To set a default font for the entire label, 
see the information on the Make Current Font the Default command, 
below.

[Size] -- Displays the current font size for the current line. Click 
the arrow to drop down a list of available font sizes for the line. 
Sizes range from 4 to 36 points, in one-point intervals for the 
smaller fonts. If you want a font size (whole numbers only) not shown 
on the chart, just enter the number in the size display area and 
press <Enter>. NOTE: if your font size is two-characters long, you 
may have to edit the size twice.

HINT: Changing the font size of a blank line affects line spacing. 
Use this trick to adjust line spacing in 1-point intervals.

[Align] -- This control affects the alignment of the selected line. 
The current setting shows in the display area. To change, click the 
arrow, then select your option. You can choose, left or right 
aligned, centered, or split lines.

NOTE: For split lines, you need to insert a tilde (~) in the text box
where you want the line to split. MultiLabel will automatically 
separate the two halves of the line. You cannot reliably insert 
internal formatting codes in split lines.

Normally, lines are split with the left half aligned with the left 
margin and the right half aligned with the right margin. By inserting 
spaces before or after the text, you can create custom alignments, 
such as blocks of text centered on both sides. Experiment to create a 
label that looks right to you.

[Style] -- Four check boxes control text attributes for the entire 
line. The Normal box, when checked, overrides all the others. You 
may, however, check as many of the others as you wish, creating even 
Underlined Bold Italic text.

NOTE: You can turn off any of these attributes within a line, by 
using one of the inserted buttons described above.

[Rev.] Makes text on the line reversed, with white letters on a black
background. You can increase the width of the black section by adding
spaces before and after the text.

NOTE: Large font sizes may show a thin white line between spaces if 
you add spaces to extend the black area.

The Graphics Objects Group

This group controls line drawing, plus positioning and scaling of 
both line drawing objects and inserted clip art images.

[Object] -- This drop-down list box lets you select an individual 
object for editing. As a default, the word PIC shows in the display 
area, identifying a clip art image as the current object. If you do 
line drawings, each line, box, or circle gets an object number, which 
appears on the WYSIWYG screen with the object. To manipulate an 
object, click the down arrow, then select the object of your choice. 
You may create up to 12 line-drawing objects.

[Width] -- This box controls the width of line drawing elements. 
Widths range from 1 to 24 pixels on the screen, which translates 
roughly to point measurements on the printer. If you change the 
current setting, it will affect the current object, if present, or 
the next object you draw.

[Draw] -- This check box enables line drawing. Click it before 
attempting to create a line, but after selecting the object type, 
line width, etc. MultiLabel will automatically select the next 
available object number.

[Line], [Box], [Circle] -- These options, only one of which can be 
highlighted, determine the type of object you want to draw.

Draw [Black] or [White] Options -- These options control the color of
the object you are going to draw, or change the color of an existing 
object. Black is the default color.


DRAWING AN OBJECT

To draw an object in the WYSIWYG screen, first select the type of 
object ([Line], [Box], [Circle]), then set the width for the lines 
used to draw the object. Next click on the [Draw] checkbox. Move the 
mouse pointer inside the WYSIWYG display and depress the left mouse 
button at the starting point of a line, the upper left corner of a 
box, or the center of a circle. While holding the button down, drag 
the mouse pointer to a new location. A rubber-band image of your 
object will appear as you draw. Draw slowly for best results. When 
the object is approximately the right size, release the left mouse 
button to place your object on the screen. A number will appear next 
to the object to identify it. Don't worry if size or positioning 
aren't exactly correct. You can move or size any object later.

NOTE: MultiLabel does not check to make sure your object is within the
boundaries of the label. That's your responsibility. Objects 
extending past the label's edges WILL print outside the label's 
boundaries.

[Move], [Size] Options -- These two options determine whether the 
scroll bars (see below) move or size the current object.

[Scroll Bars] -- Both horizontal and vertical scroll bars are 
available to control positioning of graphical elements. Depending on 
which of the option buttons above has the highlight, you can 
manipulate objects in .005 inch increments.


MOVING AN OBJECT OR CLIP ART IMAGE

Start by selecting the object in the [Object] list box. Next, click 
on the [Move] option button.

To move the object in .005" increments, click on the [Up], [Down], 
[Left], or [Right] arrows on the appropriate scroll bar.

To move the object in .1" increments, click the scroll bar regions 
between the arrows and the position button  (thumb) on the scroll bar.

To move the object in larger increments, click and drag the position 
button (thumb) on either scroll bar.


SCALING A LINE DRAWING OBJECT

First, select the object you want to resize, then click the [Size] 
option button. Then, use the scroll bars, as described above to alter 
the size of the object. The increments are the same as when you move 
an object. 

SCALING A CLIP ART IMAGE

1. First, select the PIC object in the [Object] list box.

2. Click the [Size] option button.

3. Use the scroll bars with the same increments as described above to
change the size of your image. The horizontal bar increases or 
decreases the horizontal dimension. The vertical bar alters the 
vertical dimensions. The upper left corner of the image remains 
fixed. Once the image is the size you want, you can re-position it 
with the [Move] option.

NOTE: For true proportional scaling of images, use the Graphics 
Scaling command on the main menu to display the scaling submenu. 
You'll find a complete description of this submenu in the section of 
this manual on Menu Commands.

[Erase Selected] -- This button erases the current image, as 
identified in the [Object] list box. This erasure is temporary.

[Restore] -- This button restores objects deleted with the [Erase 
Selected] button. Objects remain in memory unless removed by the 
[Clear] button, the [Draw] command is given, or until a new file is 
loaded.

[Erase All] -- This button removes all graphical elements from the 
screen. As with the erase selected button, the image remains in 
memory, and can be restored with the Restore button.


MENU COMMANDS

Some, but not all button and list functions are duplicated in 
traditional Windows menus. Other functions, less-often used, are 
offered only in menus.  For duplicated instructions, see the 
information in the section above for the equivalent button command. 
Here's a rundown:

FILE MENU

New Label Design -- Clears the current label and set up for a new 
design.

Open Label File -- Open an existing .CAR label design file.

Save Current Label -- Saves the current label with the current 
filename.

Save Current Label As... -- Lets you save the current design under a 
different filename.

Insert Graphic File -- Lets you select a clip art image for insertion
in your design.

Print Sheet(s) of Labels -- This command prints one or more sheets of
your labels. You'll see a dialog box asking how many sheets to print.

MULTIPLE COPIES

The print option lets you print multiple copies, using your printer's 
built-in multiple copy command for increased speed. Just enter the 
number of copies you want.

NOTE: If you use serial numbers on your labels, see the section on 
serial numbers above before printing.

Print Single Test Label -- This button prints a single test label 
quickly on plain paper, in the upper left corner of the page.


Update Font List -- This command updates your font list at any time.

Exit -- Quits MultiLabel, with a confirmation box.


EDIT MENU

To use this menu, you must first highlight text in the text-editing 
box by dragging the mouse over the text you want to use. Then, give 
one of the commands, or its keyboard shortcut.

Copy -- Sends a copy of selected text to the Windows Clipboard. Use 
<Ctrl>+<Ins> as a shortcut.

Cut -- Removes selected text from the editing box, then stores it in 
the clipboard. <Shift>+<Del> is the keyboard shortcut.

Paste -- Copies text from the Windows Clipboard to the current cursor 
location in the editing box.. Shortcut: <Shift>+<Ins>.

Auto-Updating Enabled -- This command, referred to above, is normally
off. Click it to add a check mark and enable updating whenever you 
change lines in the text editing box.


LAYOUT MENU

Select Label Format -- This command shows you a list of available 
label formats, with Avery Product numbers, dimensions, and notes 
about the label format. Be sure to match the number with your label 
type. The Custom menu command lets you create formats for other types 
of labels.

NOTE: If you create custom layouts, be sure to save them as blank 
labels. Then, when you need to create more labels in that format, you 
can load the blank label file as a template.

Margins -- Sets margins for label text.

Printer Fudge Factors -- Not all printers work identically. If your 
labels print slightly out of alignment, use this menu and its 
submenu to add or subtract measurements, in inches, to compensate. 
You can set the top space, left space, and the vertical or horizontal 
gap between labels. Enter positive or negative numbers.

NOTE: These fudge factors are saved with labels, so you can create a 
blank label to act as a template for future labels.

Hewlett-Packard DeskJet users: Use the Top Space fudge factor with a 
measurement of -.25 to compensate for that printer's top margin. This 
will keep your labels from printing off the page. You may have to 
experiment with this setting.

FORMAT MENU

Make Current Font Default -- this command sets all empty lines of a 
label design to the font currently shown in the font selection list 
box. Lines already having another font name will not change. 

Insert Character Styles in Line -- This command opens another menu, 
which lets you insert character formatting commands inside text lines 
in the editing box. These functions are the same as those in the top 
group of buttons at the right of the screen.

Insert Serial Numbers -- This command works just like the [Serial #] 
button. See that section of the document for more information.


PICTURE SCALING MENU

The functions in this menu are not duplicated with on-screen buttons.
Here you can re-scale a clip art image you've added to your design. 
All scaling percentages affect the image as it currently appears -- 
not the original image. Just click on the percentage of change you 
want.

Custom -- This button brings up an input box which lets you enter a 
customized scaling percentage for your clip art image. Type in a 
value between 1 and 500 to scale your image, then click OK. Remember, 
these figures are percentages and, in most cases values ranging from 
25% to 250% are most likely to give the effect you want.

HINT: Avoid large scaling changes whenever possible, since image 
quality will deteriorate if the image is scaled too small or too 
large. If you need a major scaling change, try editing your image in 
a paint program before using it in MultiLabel

HELP MENU

Help with MultiLabel <F1> -- This command opens a new window, which 
presents help information for MultiLabel On the left of this screen is 
an index of topics covered in the main help screen. To get help on a 
topic, just click on the topic's name. You can scroll through the 
list with the scroll bar to find other topics. Once the program finds 
the topic, the index name will appear highlighted at the top of the 
screen to the right, with the help information below. If your 
information cannot be read all on one screen, use the vertical scroll
bar next to the help screen to move through the information.

About -- License and registration information for MultiLabel. You'll 
need the version number if you make a support call.

OsoSoft Program Information -- Find out about other OsoSoft programs. 
You can even fill out and print an order form without leaving 
MultiLabel

TUTORIAL SECTION

In this section of the manual, you'll go through the process of 
creating a label, using all the features of the program. Just follow 
the steps below.

1. After starting MultiLabel, select a format for your label with the 
Layout Menu or the [Format] button. Be sure your labels you'll be 
printing on are same as the ones you select.

2. If the current font displayed under the Font box is not the one 
you want to use for most of the text in the label, choose another 
font, then give the "Make Current Font Default" command in the Format 
menu.

3 Now, enter text for your label in the text editing box. Press 
<Enter> after each line. The formatting from the previous line will 
carry over to the next line. If you'll place blank lines in your 
label, enter them now. You can alter the font size on blank lines to 
adjust vertical spacing.

4. Click on the first line of text in the editing box, then, using 
the command buttons and lists on the right of the screen, select a 
font, size, alignment, and any other formatting changes you want on 
that line.

Repeat this sequence for each line. Remember: You can use the [Dupe 
Previous] button to duplicate the formatting of the line preceding 
the current line.

5. If you need split lines, with text on both sides of the label, 
move the cursor to the line to be changed, then insert a tilde 
character (~) where you want the line to split, and type the right 
side of the line. Of course, you can do this when you first enter the 
text for the line as well. To split the line, select "Split Line at 
Tilde" in the [Alignment] list box.

HINT: MultiLabel normally updates the WYSIWYG display only when you 
change a formatting option, or when you press <Enter> or click the 
[Update] button. If you turn on Auto Updating, to avoid delays, always 
use the mouse to move from one line to another. Just click with the 
cursor where you want to work. Using the cursor keys means that the 
WYSIWYG display updates after each <Cursor Up> or <Cursor Down> 
keypress.

6. You can adjust the position of characters on your label by 
inserting spaces at the beginning or end of text. Experiment to get 
just the effect you want. Click the [Update] button to view your 
changes.

7. Once all your text is in place, you may want to add lines, 
circles, or boxes, using the tools in the Graphics Tools group of 
commands. See the instructions above for details. Remember: you can 
alter or delete any graphical element at any time.

LINE, BOX and CIRCLE HINTS: Don't forget that you can draw in white, 
as well as in black. You can erase part of a line or other object by 
drawing over it in white. This allows a great deal of flexibility.

8. You may want to add a clip art image to your label. To do this, 
click the [AddPic] button, or use the "Insert Graphic File" command 
in the File menu. Select your graphic from the file list in the 
dialog box, then click OK to place it in the upper left-hand corner 
of the label. Remember, clicking once on a filename in this dialog 
box lets you preview your clip art images. Once you find the image 
you want, click OK or double-click on the filename.

You can use any of the tools described earlier to position and size 
your image. Remember, if you change either the height or width of an 
image, you'll affect its proportions. To size an image without 
altering its proportions, use the commands in the Graphic Scaling 
menu.

9. Check your label design frequently, making changes wherever 
necessary. Once you're completely satisfied, Use the [Save] button or 
Save command to save your label. Then print a label sheet on plain 
papre and inspect the results.

HINT: It's always best to print a sample sheet of any new label 
design before committing to actual labels. Hold the sample sheet 
behind the blank label sheet, then hold the pair up to the light. 
You'll be able to see any misalignments easily.

NOTE: Due to differences in resolution between screen images and 
printed output, you may notice minor differences in your label. Check
your printout, then make changes in your design to produce the 
results you want.


EDITING YOUR DESIGNS

Once you've designed a few labels, you can use them as templates for 
future label designs. MultiLabel Professional comes with a number of 
stock label designs you can use as templates. It's easy to make 
changes.

Editing Text

To replace existing text with new text, the easiest way is to 
highlight existing text by dragging over it with the mouse, one line 
at a time. Once the text is highlighted, just type your new text, 
which will automatically replace the highlighted text. You can use 
this feature to create label templates. Just create a sample label, 
using dummy text for each line, then save it.

Controlling Line Spacing

You can make fine changes in the spacing between lines of text. To do
this, make sure there's at least one blank line between the lines you
want to change. Then, position the cursor on a blank line and change 
the font size for that line. You'll see the changes on your screen. 
You can make changes in 1-point (1/72") intervals. If you need a font
size smaller or large than those offered in the font size list, enter 
it in the display area of the list. MultiLabel does not accept 
fractional font sizes.


Placing Text Beside Clip Art Images

You'll often want to position text next to or around clip art images.
To do this, use the [Alignment] options. For example, to position 
text to the right of an image, choose the Right Aligned alignment 
option, then add spaces after the text to move it left to the 
position you want. Similarly, use the Left Aligned option to position
text to the left of an image. This time, however, place your spaces 
to the left of the text.

To wrap text on both sides of an image, insert a tilde (~) where you 
want the text to break, then choose the Split at Tilde alignment 
option. Once again, pad the text with spaces to achieve the position 
you need.


Working with Split Lines

MultiLabel's ability to split lines is very powerful, letting you 
position blocks of text on both sides of the label. Normally, the 
right half of the line is left-aligned, while the right half is 
right-aligned. Often, however, you'll want to center blocks of text 
or manipulate the alignment in other ways. As described above, use 
spaces to pad the text until it's aligned just the way you want. 
Click the [Update] button to view your changes. It only takes a few 
seconds to completely re-align your label.

NOTE: Don't use Serial Numbers on split lines. Alignment may not be 
accurate.


Printing Samples

When working with complex label designs, it's always a good idea to 
print occasional samples of your design on plain paper for checking. 
As mentioned above, your printed image may vary slightly from the 
image in the WYSIWYG screen. After printing a sample, you can make 
changes to correct slight misalignments.


MULTILABEL TIPS AND HINTS

As with all software, there are a number of tricks and techniques you
can use to save time and effort. Here are some ideas for using 
MultiLabel: Printing

Printing layout sheets and sheets of labels takes time. MultiLabel and
Windows have to compose graphical pages before a page emerges. You'll
need a little patience.

For maximum quality when printing MultiLabel label designs, be sure 
your laser printer has a good toner cartridge. If you can set print 
density, choose a medium or dense setting to achieve dark blacks for 
reproduction. 

MultiLabel can handle 16-color clip art images, but the final output 
will depend on how your printer interprets the colors in your clip 
art. You'll get the best results by far if you choose black and white 
line drawings, rather than color or gray-scale images.

Creating Multi-Color Labels

You can use MultiLabel to produce multi-colored labels for printing by 
a print shop. Simply design a complete label, with graphics and all 
text elements. Then, delete information which will not print in a 
color and print a layout sheet showing just the material for one 
color. Print a sheet for each color to be used on your label. 

Working With Clip Art Images

MultiLabel accepts only Windows BMP (bitmap) files as clip art images.
Graphics programs, such as Windows Paint, supplied with Windows 3.0, 
can create these tiles. You can convert other file types to BMP 
files, using any of a number of format conversion programs, such as 
HIJAAK, Publisher's PaintBrush, and others.

The size of your image is important. Art for labels is quite small, 
almost never exceeding 1" in any dimension. Since MultiLabel deals 
with 300 Dot Per Inch (DPI) printers exclusively, it's clear that a 
300 X 300 pixel image will print as a 1" square.

While MultiLabel can handle much larger images, it's usually better to
scale large images in a program specifically designed to do that. 
Windows Paint can handle preliminary scaling quite well. If you have 
a scanner, you can create your own clip art in minutes. Simply scan 
the image, then use your scanner software, or a program like Zsoft's 
Publisher's Paintbrush, to produce a BMP file approximately 300 
pixels in each dimension. Naturally, tall narrow images will use 
other dimensions, but you get the idea. While black and white line 
images reproduce best in MultiLabel, it's worth experimenting with 
16-grayscale or 16-color images. Just save them as BMP files, then 
pop them onto your label.

You can also create clip art images with any paint program which can 
produce Windows BMP files. Creating custom logos isn't difficult at 
all. Also, a number of clip art libraries are available, both 
commercially and as shareware. Most often, however, these images will 
need conversion to BMP format.

Finally, if you're not happy with the way an image prints in 
MultiLabel, remember these tips:

1. Very thin lines often don't print well.

2. Large black areas may present problems for your laser printer, and
sometimes don't reproduce as completely black.

3. Reducing a large image to label logo size often results in loss of 
detail.

4. Increasing the size of tiny images, such as Windows .ICO icon 
files usually results in jagged lines on your printout.

5. Keep your images simple for maximum impact.

6. Complex line drawings usually don't work as well as iconic art 
which attracts, but doesn't confuse, the eye.

7. For best results, set the density adjustment on your printer to a 
medium or dense setting. The darker your blacks, the better your 
label will look.

8. Select the feed option for your printer which sends the paper on 
the straightest path possible through the printer. Usually this means
using the read output tray.

9. Printing takes time. Depending on your design, printing a sheet of 
labels can take up to 5 minutes, or even longer on PostScript 
printers. Please be patient.

Lines, Boxes, and Circles

You cannot draw a graphical element which extends into a clip art 
image. The line will end at the edge of the image. You can, however, 
overwrite text with a line graphic. Let the WYSIWYG display be your 
guide. Be careful not to let lines, boxes, or circles extend past the
label's borders. Always check the WYSIWYG display for conflicts, and 
print plain-paper samples if you're working close to the label's 
edge.

Use the [Update] button to see the results of your changes. As you 
draw and move lines, text may not appear if it has been overwritten. 
[Update] to see the actual image.

Use the [Draw White] option to create special effects. Combining 
thick lines with intersecting white lines can create interesting 
effects. You can create quite complex drawings using the line drawing
tools alone, including simple logos.

You can also draw boxes or circles around existing text on your 
design. It's best to first create the text, then follow up with 
lines, boxes, and circles. Use the positioning scroll bars for 
precise sizing and placement.


DESIGNING EFFECTIVE LABELS

MultiLabel doesn't design your label.....You Do! With MultiLabel, your 
options are almost unlimited, and you can quite easily produce either 
an excellent design which will produce a powerful impact on those who 
see it. On the other hand, you can just as quickly produce an ugly, 
ineffective label.

The best way to get ideas for label designs is to study labels others 
use. Which labels jump out at you? Which labels present an effective 
appearance? Which ones do you think are loud, garish, or 
inappropriate? By looking at many label designs, you'll soon develop 
an eye for good design.

Still, there are a few basic principles to think about:

Make the label fit your purpose. If it's a product label, include 
your company's logo and set type to match your other stationery. If 
you're printing labels for computer diskettes, you can include 
information to help the user know what to do with the disk.

Don't overdo the use of fonts. While it's amazingly easy to include 
multiple fonts using Windows, MultiLabel and Adobe Type Manager, try 
to resist the temptation. Typically, your best bet is to choose one 
attractive font for your name, company name, or other main lines, 
then use a simpler font, such as Helvetica for details, such as 
address and telephone number information.

Similarly, watch your use of graphics. A garish or highly ornamental 
graphic is usually not the most effective tool in label design. 
Instead, select a company logo, or a simple line drawing which will 
catch the reader's eye without shocking him or her. Most companies 
have discovered that a highly-memorable icon logo is far more 
effective in reminding people about the company than an ornate image.

The same thing applies to line, boxes, and circles. Keep your design 
simple for best results. Don't let a too-bold line object overpower 
your label. After all, you want your customers or clients to remember
your name or company name....not a line.

Finally, if your label needs to display several items in a list, try 
using MultiLabel's bullet feature. It's automatic and effective.
