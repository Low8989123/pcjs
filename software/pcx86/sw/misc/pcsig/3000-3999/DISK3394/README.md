************************************************************
*             Shareware Definition                         *
************************************************************

Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software before buying it.
If you try a Shareware program and continue using it, you are expected to
register. Individual programs differ on details -- some request registration
while others require it, some specify a maximum trial period. With registration,
you get anything from the simple right to continue using the software to an
updated program with printed manual.

Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software, and the
copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific exceptions as stated
below. Shareware authors are accomplished programmers, just like commercial
authors, and the programs are of comparable quality. (In both cases, there
are good programs and bad ones!) The main difference is in the method of
distribution. The author specifically grants the right to copy and distribute
the software, either to all and sundry or to a specific group. For example,
some authors require written permission before a commercial disk vendor
may copy their Shareware.

Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. You should find
software that suits your needs and pocketbook, whether it's commercial or
Shareware. The Shareware system makes fitting your needs easier, because you
can try before you buy.  And because the overhead is low, prices are low also.
Shareware has the ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the
product, you don't pay for it.

************************************************************
*             Disclaimer - Agreement                       *
************************************************************

Users of DCMP92 must accept this disclaimer of warranty: DCMP92
Software is supplied as is.  The author disclaims all warranties, expressed
or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability
and of fitness for any purpose.  The author assumes no liability for damages,
direct or consequential, which may result from the use of DCMP92.

DCMP92 is a "shareware program" and is provided at no charge to the
user for evaluation.  Feel free to share it with your friends, but please do
not give it away altered or as part of another system.  The essence of
"user-supported" software is to provide personal computer users with quality
software without high prices, and yet to provide incentive for programmers
to continue to develop new products.  If you find this program useful and
find that you are using DCMP92 and continue to use DCMP92 Software
after a reasonable trial period, you must make a registration payment
of $50 to Droege Computing Services, Inc..  The $50 registration fee will
license one copy for use on any one computer at any one time.  You must treat
this software just like a book.  An example is that this software may be used
by any number of people and may be freely moved from one computer location to
another, so long as there is no possibility of it being used at one location
while it's being used at another.  Just as a book cannot be read by two
different persons at the same time.

Commercial users of DCMP92 must register and pay for their
copies of DCMP92 within 30 days of first use or their license
is withdrawn.  Site-License arrangements may be made by contacting Droege
Computing Services, Inc..

Anyone distributing DCMP92 for any kind of remuneration must
first contact Droege Computing Services, Inc. at the address below for
authorization.  This authorization will be automatically granted to
distributors recognized by the (ASP) as adhering to its guidelines for
shareware distributors, and such distributors may begin offering
DCMP92 immediately (However Droege Computing Services, Inc.
must still be advised so that the distributor can be kept up-to-date
with the latest version of DCMP92.).

You are encouraged to pass a copy of DCMP92 along to your
friends for evaluation.  Please encourage them to register their copy if they
find that they can use it.  All registered users will receive a copy of the
latest version of the DCMP92 system.
