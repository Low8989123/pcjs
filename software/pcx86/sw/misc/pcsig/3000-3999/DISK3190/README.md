             ShareDebate International - A  Diskette  Magazine
                       Winter 1991-1992 (Issue #7 & #8)

               Milton Friedman: "We Have Socialism, Q.E.D."
            ShareDebate International now copyrighted freeware!
       Print utility included for readers who hate computer screens

   Double-disk issue features 12 authors, including Economist & Nobel laureate
Milton Friedman; Japan Economic Institute & Citizens Against Statistical
Distortion Used to Further Protectionism (both on US-Japan Trade Myths);
Prometheus award-winning science fiction authors J.Neil Schulman & Victor
Koman; Columnists Joseph Sobran & Sam Wells; GEnie Management on new FCC cost
increases threatening computer services; Libertarian Party platform;
Republican Liberty Caucus; Drs. T. Urell & C. Lyon against socialized

   Prior to this issue there were 24 debate topics.  Two new debate topics are
added for this issue: US-Japan Situation and New Insights in the Abortion
Debate.  Long excerpts from two Prometheus-award winning novels are included,
Alongside Night, by J. Neil Schulman (continued from issue 6) and Solomon's
Knife by Victor Koman.

   ShareDebate International is a diskette-magazine. Formerly a shareware
semi-annual magazine, it is now copyrighted freeware with this double-disk
issue.  Between 550 to 1,450 listed Bulletin Boards (BBSs) or Shareware
dealers in 25 countries distribute the magazine.  It is an international
debate forum for computer users concerned about the present and the future,
carrying non-fiction & fiction, original and reprints.

   How does ShareDebate International impress readers of other pro-free
market, independent-thinking magazines?  George Cordahi, a subscriber to
American Spectator for nearly 20 years from Mississauga, Ontario, writes
"ShareDebate International is a terrific magazine, well edited and executed.
I am very interested in the nexus between economics, freedom and technology.
Add philosophy and it is a powerful brew.  It is the paradigm of the
publication of the information age."
