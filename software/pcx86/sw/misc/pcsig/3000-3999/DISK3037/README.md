Special Requirements: 512K RAM. Hard drive recommended.                 
                                                                        
You can now create a paperless catalog with CATALOG-ON-A-DISK. Just type
your product descriptions in standard ASCII format (most word processors
can do this) and CATALOG-ON-A-DISK creates an electronic catalog you    
send to your customers on floppy diskette. Your customers simply start  
up the program and easily search or browse through your catalog of      
descriptions and prices.                                                
                                                                        
With CATALOG-ON-A-DISK, organize and present your products any way you  
choose. It holds about 3,500-four line product descriptions on a        
standard 360K floppy diskette (more on larger capacity diskettes). Your 
customers can select products to purchase as they look through your     
catalog. When they're finished, an order form/invoice is printed listing
all the products selected, with sales tax and shipping information      
included. Your customer then can fax or mail the order form to you. This
could really help eliminate ordering mistakes.                          
                                                                        
Since you can only enter text descriptions about your products and not  
graphics or pictures, it may not work for all companies. But if it works
for your products, it's a great way to set you apart from your          
competitor and maybe be a little more productive at the same time.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION

1.1 What is this thing for????!



CATALOG ON A DISK makes it easy for  your customers see your catalog on 
their computers and order from it.  It is so easy to use that customers won't 
put off ordering from you.  Also a disk catalog is economical to produce, 
compared to printed ones.  It's simple for your customers to find what 
items they want by browsing or searching, and generate an order form that can 
be mailed, faxed, or sent to you by modem.  You can configure your catalog 
to give it your company's distinctive look.

Each category can hold from 61 to 790 items, including their order number,
name, price and a zero to twelve line long description of the product.  You
may have a total of 99 categories (for a total of up to 78210 items,
depending on the length of the long description, and disk space permitting). 
Your catalog is kept in compressed files so more product listings can fit on
the disk.  These are very easy to create on any word processor or text editor
that can save files in pure ascii format.  Then use the CATALOG-ON-A-DISK
Companion to compress the files.

1.2 USING THE PROGRAM

CATALOG-ON-A-DISK is two programs.  

The first, CATALOG.EXE is a catalog reader.  This is what you send to your
customers.  It displays your catalog, and lets your customers browse or
search for items to order.  It prints out order forms, coupons, and it can
even print the catalog on a printer.

CATCOM.EXE is the companion program that assists you in creating and
maintaining your catalog.  It is for your use only and you do not send this
to customers.

For building and maintaining catalogs you should have a catalog directory on
your hard disk (you may do this on a floppy disk if you prefer).  You should
keep all of the text files you use to make your catalogs here as well as the
CATALOG and CATCOM programs, the compressed (.CM) files, and any related
files.  You then copy the files you need onto a master disk (a floppy) which
you will then duplicate for your customers' copies of the catalog.

The file CATALOG.INI is a very important file for both programs.  It is the
initialization file that tells the two programs which screen colors to use,
and holds other important information the programs need internally.  For
example, if you want to change screen colors you use CATCOM to do it.  If
CATALOG is in the same directory and disk you'll see the colors have changed
the next time you use it.  When you copy CATALOG.EXE onto the master disk
make sure you also copy CATALOG.INI along with all of your catalog files.CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 5
===========================================================================

1.3 DEFINITIONS

In this manual a few terms are used:

Ascii Delimited    A file that has been saved in pure ascii (American
                   Standard Code for Information Exchange) format (most word
                   processors, data bases, etc. can do this), that has one
                   or more data fields delimited by quotation marks and
                   commas.
Catalog File       A compressed file containing catalog information with the
                   extension ".CM".  The format for these files is described
                   in section 3.3. 
Default File       A file CATALOG ON A DISK uses for anything except catalog
                   information, such as the opening screen, the main menu
                   header, and so on.  Most of these files have the
                   extension .CM.
Field              A database term meaning a type of information (such as a
                   name, address, etc.).
Menu               A box in CATALOG ON A DISK containing several items that
                   are chosen by placing the menu bar over the item you
                   want.CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 6
===========================================================================

CHAPTER TWO: VIEWING A CATALOG

2.1 HOW TO READ A CATALOG


Start the program by typing CATALOG (Enter).

The Opening Screen Comes on.  This will be one or more screens full of
company information, instructions, or other information.  To go to the next
screen press any key until you get to the main menu screen.

At any menu you may use the following keys:

(Alt) (x)    Exit the program
(Esc)        Back out of current window
(F1)         Help
(Alt) (i)    Program Information
(Alt) (p)    Print the whole catalog
(Alt) (h)    Display a Help Bar
(PgUp)       More Categories or Products
(PgDn)       More Categories or Products

When viewing the category menu or categories that are larger than one screen
the arrow keys work as follows:

(Up)         Up one choice.  Scrolls to next screen full.  Stops at first
             choice.
(Down)       Down one choice.  Scrolls to next screen full.  Stops at last
             choice with a message.
(Left)       Same as up arrow, but wraps to the bottom of the window instead 
             of scrolling.
(Right)      Same as down arrow, but wraps to the top of the window instead 
             of scrolling.

2.2 VIEWING CATALOG INFORMATION AND ORDERING

The Main Menu Screen may have information on the left of the screen and a
menu at the right.  The menu shows up to twenty categories of items at a time
you may look up and order.  If there are more than twenty use (PgUp) and
(PgDn) to view more.

To choose a category place the menu bar over it, using the arrow keys to move
the bar and press (Enter).


CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 7
===========================================================================

Now you will see a screen full of catalog items.  If there are more items 
than you can see on one screen use the (PgUp) (PgDn) (Home) (End) keys to 
see more items.  When you see an item of interest place the menu bar over 
it and press enter.  (To return to the main menu press (Esc).)

You may search for an item by pressing (alt) (s).  This is not a case
sensitive search.  If you are looking for an item called "widget" type
"widget" when prompted.  Type (Enter) to search forward from the current
item, or (b) to search forward from the beginning of the file.  This search
will find "WIDGET" or "Widget".

The search function looks through the entire catalog entry.  This means that
if a word, or part of a word exists anywhere in the order number, short
description, price, or long description CATALOG-ON-A-DISK will find it.  This
is perfect for product listings that use key words in the long descriptions.



Now you will see a product description (if it is present in the file).  To
order this product press (Enter), or press (Esc) to back out.

Type the number of this product you want to order.  CATALOG-ON- A-DISK
confirms your order and gives you the total for that number of items.  To
accept this order press (Enter) .  To change the quantity press (r) and re-
enter the quantity you want.  To exit without ordering this item press (Esc).

You may back into the main menu screen to choose other categories to order
from.  When you are done ordering go to the main menu screen and press
(Enter).  You may order up to 200 different items in one session.

2.3 THE EXIT MENU


Now you see the Exit Menu.  From Here you may
print an order form, view your order, go back to the main menu screen to
order more items, enter your name and address, or leave the program.


Printing an Order Form:

You can print the order form to your printer (to mail or fax) or to a file on
your disk (to send by modem if the company accepts orders this way).  If
printing on your printer MAKE SURE YOUR PRINTER IS ON LINE AND READY.

When printing to a file you will be prompted for a file name.

A catalog can be set up to work in a few different
ways that affect how you must deal with sales taxes and shipping/handling
charges.CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 8
===========================================================================

If the order form prints without asking you for any information you may have
to fill in the taxes and shipping/handling charges by hand, and add the final
total yourself.

A catalog may be set up so it will check the state or province you entered in
your address (see section on name and address below), and if it finds a match
it automatically charges the appropriate sales tax.  If you are ordering from
a different state or province it will not charge the tax.

Another way a catalog may be set is to ask you how much tax to charge.  In
this case a window pops up, and you fill in a percent.  Press (Enter) for no
sales tax.

Some catalogs will have a menu of shipping and handling options.  If so, a
menu of these options will pop up while the order form is printing, so you
may make the appropriate choice.

Reviewing Your Order:

Here you can see what you have ordered with the subtotal for the whole 
order (tax, shipping, etc. is not included here).  If there are more 
items than can be seen on one screen you may view the rest by using 
(PgUp) (PgDn) (Home) (End).

To delete an item press (Del) and type the number of the item you want to
delete.  The subtotal will be adjusted.



Go Back To Catalog:

If you want to add items to your order you can go
back to the main menu screen and order more
products.

Name and Address:

CATALOG ON A DISK will remember your name
and shipping address, and print it on your order form
whenever you order if you enter it here.  This is great
if you order from the catalog a lot, or even if you only order a few times.

Special Forms:

If special forms, coupons, company descriptions,and so on have been included
with a catalog this menu item will appear on the exit menu.  When you choose
it a menu appears with a choice of forms to print out.  First make sure your
printer is ready, then place the menu bar over your choice and press enter.
CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 9
===========================================================================

Exit:

You may exit the program by choosing this option. 
You may exit to DOS at any menu by pressing (Alt) (x).


2.4 THE HELP BAR

To display a bar at the bottom of the screen with reminders of the most used
keystrokes press (Alt) (h).



2.5 PRINTING THE CATALOG

If you want a printout of the catalog make sure your printer is ready (and
has plenty of paper) and press (Alt) (p).  The catalog will be printed
including the first screens, the categories in alphabetical order, a blank
order form, and special forms (coupons, etc).  This takes some time, so you
should be sure you want to do it before starting.CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 10
===========================================================================

CHAPTER THREE: MAKING A CATALOG

For each category of items you want in your catalog you need to create a
Catalog file.  You also need to create an Opening Screen file and a Header
file, and an Order Information File.  Any ASCII characters may be used in
these files.  

However, you should be aware that some printers
don't print the upper ascii characters (128-255) as expected.  If printing
catalogs is very important for your customers you'll want to stick to the
lower 127  (of course upper and lower case letters, normal punctuation, and
numbers are all contained within the lower ascii set). 

You could note this as part of your opening screen, and point out that if a
printer has an "IBM" setting it will probably print all the ascii characters.


3.1 HOW TO MAKE AN OPENING SCREEN FILE

The Opening Screen file is the first information your
customer sees when he or she starts the catalog program.  This can be your
company name, a brief general description of how to order, something about
your products or whatever.  You will want to keep this fairly short.

Using an ASCII text editor you can create the opening screen(s) that your
customers will see.  This information will be shown, a screen at a time, to
your customers when they first start the program.  

Make sure that no line is wider than 76 characters, and that you press Enter
at the end of the last line to put a newline character there (otherwise the
last line won't show up on the screen).  

Each screen has 23 lines (rows), so if you have more than one screen you
should start screen 2 on line 24, screen 3 on line 47, and so on.

When the file is finished you must compress it (see section 4.3, "COMPRESSING
CATALOG FILES" below).  The name of this file MUST be FIRST.TXT.

3.2 HOW TO MAKE A HEADER FILE

The HEADER is the information that appears on the
menu screen, just above the menu choices.

Use an ASCII text editor to create a file. This can have your company name,
a slogan, special help, advertising, or whatever you want.

CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 11
===========================================================================

Make sure that no line is wider than 40 characters, and that you press
(Enter) at the end of the last line to put a newline character there
(otherwise the last line won't show up on the screen).  This information
appears on the left of your screen, while the categories menu appears on the
right.  If you only have a few categories you may make the lines below the
menu 78 characters wide to give additional information.  Experiment with how
this looks.

This file should be 23 or fewer lines long.

When the file is finished you must compress it (see section 4.3, "COMPRESSING
CATALOG FILES" below).  The name of this file MUST be HEADER.TXT.


3.3 HOW TO MAKE A CATALOG FILE

Using an ASCII text editor it is easy to make a
catalog file.  There are three parts of a catalog file:  The category title,
the header line, and description blocks.  Just follow this format:  

Title:       Line one of the file is the category title.  Type your title,
             and if you want to password protect your file type a vertical
             line and your password.

Header Text: Line two can be a line for the category header.  This is
             optional, and it can contain any text.  It should begin with
             a double tilde symbol so CATALOG-ON-A-DISK will know it is 
             for your header.  These symbols will not appear on the 
             screen. For example you might want the header to say:

~~Order #:  Product Description:     List Price:      Your Price:

                Another choice is to use it for an advertising banner:

~~===WIDGETWARE is Your Choice In Tee Shirts!===

Description 
Blocks:      These are followed by one description block per item in your
             catalog.  A description block consists of from 1 to 13 lines.  
             On the top line is the marker, item number, a short product
             description, and the price.  These items must be in this order. 
             This is followed by a zero to twelve line product write-up 
             (long description).

Marker:      You have to use a ~ symbol at the beginning of the top line 
             of each description block.  It must be the left most character 
             on the line with no other characters or spaces in front of it.  
             This is mandatory.

CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 12
===========================================================================

Order Number  Can be any combination of numbers, letters and punctuation. 
              Must have NO blank spaces.  If you do not use order numbers
              you must leave one blank space at the beginning of the line,
              after the marker.  Order numbers are optional.

Short Desc:   Can be any number of letters, numbers and words as long as it
              fits with the Order Number and Price on 1 line (75 characters
              total maximum).  This is mandatory.

Price:        Must be numbers and decimal point only.  The best format to
              use is XXX.XX where you show two numbers after the decimal
              point, even if it is an even dollar figure.  This is
              mandatory.   Some good examples:                
              .55     132.12     12.00

Write-Up:     This can be any text, from 0 to 12 lines long. If you don't 
              want to use long description write ups, you don't have to.  
              This is optional.


Line#  What To Type:                                                                        # of chars Description

------+-------------------------------------+-----------+-----------------

Etc.


A catalog text file may have a maximum of 794 lines, including the title, all
the description blocks and the final line.

Catalog files may have any name except the following:

first header manual cmhelp cmoshelp orderinf manual temp

Make sure that you press Enter at the end of the last line to put a newline
character there.  When the file is finished you must compress it (see section
4.3, "COMPRESSING CATALOG FILES" below).

3.5 HOW TO MAKE AN EXIT SCREEN FILE

The Exit Screen File controls what your customer sees
beneath the exit menu when it is displayed on the screen.

Use an ASCII text editor to create this file.  This can have your company
name, a slogan, special help, advertising, or whatever you want.  You may
want to talk about special forms, or give ordering instructions.

The first line has a color instruction, followed by up to 10 or fewer lines
of text.  CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 16
===========================================================================

The color instruction tells the program which colors to display the file in. 
It should be one word with nothing else on the line with it.  Type Main to
use the main screen colors, Hilight to use the hilight colors, or Help to use
the help screen colors.

When the file is finished you must compress it (see section 4.3, "COMPRESSING
CATALOG FILES" below).  The name of this file MUST be EXIT.TXT.

3.6 HOW TO MAKE AN ORDER INFORMATION FILE

When CATALOG ON A DISK prints an order form it looks for a file called
ORDERINF.TXT.  If it finds this file it includes the information in it 
on your order form.  This is where you put shipping information, tax 
information, and any special ordering information, such as information 
for charge card orders.  Because there are so many ways to do this, 
CATALOG ON A DISK lets the customer fill in shipping, discount and tax 
information.

Using an ASCII text editor you can create the Order Form Information file. 
You should keep this file short, to keep the order form to one page.  It will
be printed at the bottom of the order form.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Make sure that no line is wider than 78 characters, and that you press Enter
at the end of the last line to put a newline character there (otherwise the
last line won't show up on the screen).  

When the file is finished you must compress it (see section 4.3, "COMPRESSING
CATALOG FILES" below).  The name of this file MUST be ORDERINF.TXT. 

CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 17
===========================================================================

3.7 HOW TO MAKE COUPONS AND OTHER SPECIAL FORMS

CATALOG-ON-A-DISK can display a menu of special forms, coupons and so on. 
These can contain special offers, company description, special instructions,
and so on.

If forms exist CATALOG-ON-A-DISK adds a special menu item to the Exit Menu
that reads Special Forms.  The customer can choose from a menu of forms and
print them to a printer (the printer must be attached to LPT1 for this to
work:  this prevents coupons from being printed to a file and changed by the
customer).

Using an ASCII text editor you can create a Form file.  Type any printable
ascii characters to make your form.

Make sure that no line is wider than 78 characters, and that you press Enter
at the end of the last line to put a newline character there (otherwise the
last line won't show up on the screen).  It is suggested that you keep forms
below 60 lines.

When the file is finished you must compress it (see section 4.3, "COMPRESSING
CATALOG FILES" below).  The name of this file MUST have the extension .FRM in
order for CATALOG-ON-A-DISK to place it in the Forms menu and treat it as a
form.
Example:  COUPON.FRM


3.8 AUTOMATING SALES TAX AND SHIPPING/HANDLING

You may choose the way your catalog handles sales taxes and shipping and
handling charges on the order form.  The simplest way to handle this is to do
nothing.  CATALOG-ON-A-DISK will print out blank spaces for sales taxes, S&H,
and the final total that your customers can fill in manually.  In this case
be sure to put your tax and S&H information in the ORDERINF file.

If you include a file called TOTAL.CM you can have CATALOG-ON-A-DISK figure
sales tax and/or S&H automatically or semi-automatically.

When the file is finished you must compress it (see section 4.3, "COMPRESSING
CATALOG FILES" below).  The name of this file MUST be ORDERINF.TXT. 
CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 18
===========================================================================

+--------------------------------------+
| Total                                |
| t NY | 7                             |
| s USPS (US)            3.00 | 3.00   |
| s USPS (Canada)        5.00 | 5.00   |
| s USPS (Elsewhere)     9.00 | 9.00   |
| s UPS Ground (US)      3.00 | 3.00   |
| s UPS BLUE (48 Sts)    6.00 | 6.00   |
| s UPS BLUE (AL HI PR)  8.00 | 8.00   |
| s UPS RED (US)        15.00 | 15.00  |
| s UPS RED (AL HI PR)  19.00 | 19.00  |
| s Customer Pick Up     0.00 |  0.00  |
| [End of file]                        |
+--------------------------------------+

This file must use a specific format:  The top line in the file must have the
word Total with nothing else (upper or lower case, or both is OK).

This should be followed by up to 13 lines that are formatted as follows:

If you want to automatically charge a specific sales tax percent for your
state or province include a line that has a t at the beginning of the line
(no spaces before it), then the name of the state or province (if a US state
you should use the two letter indicator recommended by the post office. 
Example: NY for New York).  Next there should be a pipe symbol (|) with a
space on either side of it.  Finally the sales tax percent age that applies
to your state.

Example:

                                t NY | 7

Some states have different taxes in their various regions.  If this is the
case in your state you set your tax line to 999.  CATALOG-ON-A-DISK will ask
the customer to enter the tax rate only if he or she resides in the chosen
state.

Example:

                                t NY | 999

To include shipping and handling options you use a similar format.  You start
with the letter s at the beginning of the line.  Next you type in the
shipping option you want to appear on the shipping menu (it is recommended
that you include the price here so your customers can see what they have to
pay for various shipping options.  Follow that with a pipe symbol (|) with a
space on either side of it.  And then type in the shipping price for that
entry.

CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 19
===========================================================================

Example:

                      s FedEx         8.50 | 8.50

You may have up to 12 options on this menu.  You are not required to have any
if you don't want the shipping menu to appear in your catalog.

When you are done typing this file you must compress it using the -c option
(see section 4.3, "COMPRESSING CATALOG FILES" below).  The name of the file
must be TOTAL.TXT.

Some companies must collect sales tax in more than one state.  CATALOG-ON-A-
DISK can be set to charge sales tax in just one state, or in all states.  You
set this by calling CATCOM with the -sa flag (for all) or the -so (for one)
from the DOS command line as follows:

                             catcom -s (Enter)

If you set CATALOG-ON-A-DISK for ALL states a window will pop up asking the
customer to fill in the correct percentage of sales tax for his or her state. 
You may still set one state to automatically charge a set percentage (using
the total file) if you want to.  If you do the sales tax will automatically
be figured in without asking for input from customers in that state.

Some states charge sales tax on shipping and handling as well as merchandise. 
Use the -mo flag for merchandise only, or the -mb flag to set CATALOG-ON-A-
DISK to charge tax on both.


3.9 CHANGING HELP

CATALOG-ON-A-DISK comes with two help files.  The first, CMHLP.CM, holds the
text you see if you ask for help at the command line (by typing "CATALOG -
h").  The second, CMOSHLP.CM, has the text you see when you press (F1) while
viewing a catalog.

If you want to customize your own help files, create text files called
CMHLP.TXT and/or CMOSHLP.TXT.  When they are as you want them compress them.
(see section 4.3, "COMPRESSING CATALOG FILES" below).CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 20
===========================================================================

CHAPTER FOUR:  THE COMPANION

Beginning with Version 2, CATALOG-ON-A-DISK has been split into two programs. 


The catalog viewer, CATALOG.EXE, lets your customers view your catalog.  

CATCOM.EXE is the CATALOG-ON-A-DISK Companion, which helps you make your
catalog.

In general you make these files in a text editor or word processor that has
the capability to save text in pure ascii format.  Most word processors have
this capacity.  Then you use CATCOM to compress your files into a form that
CATALOG can read, and that take up less space on your disk.  You can also use
CATCOM to change the colors of your catalog, to import and export catalog
files to a data base or other program, and so on.

CATCOM can be run in two ways.  Command line mode lets you use CATCOM'S 
capabilities using flags on the DOS command line.  For example, to compress
a file you would type:

catcom -c myfile.txt (Enter)

CATCOM also has an interactive mode that allows you to perform tasks
interactively within a menu driven program.  If you are new to CATALOG-ON-A-
DISK you'll probably want to start with interactive mode.

To start the Companion in interactive mode type:

                               CATCOM (Enter)

Important NOTE:  Some functions work only in command line mode (such as tax
settings), and others only in interactive mode (such as converting v1 to v2).

The main menu screen appears.  You are presented with four menu choices.  The
first three are for making a file conversion.  The last lets you exit back to
DOS.

In interactive mode at the main CATCOM menu press (Alt) (r) to review the
current settings for tax, currency symbol, and other settings.



4.1 COMMAND LINE FUNCTIONS:

CATCOM's catalog making functions can be called from the command line.  It is
very easy to use these functions.  Normally you call CATCOM with a flag and
a file name as follows:


                       catcom [flags] [filename] (Enter)CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 21
===========================================================================

NOTES:

■The flags can be upper or lower case (ex.  -E or -e).
■You may use \ instead of - in flags (ex:  -e or \e).
■The filename may come before or after the flag.

4.2 INTERACTIVE MODE

In interactive mode you are shown a main menu.  To go to a menu choice either
press the first letter of the choice and then press (Enter), or use the arrow
keys to go to your choice and press (Enter).

The menu choices are:  File Compression, Export a file, Import a file,
Convert v1 to v2, Set Colors, and Leave.  All but the last two require you to
specify a file you want to perform the operation on.

Both CATCOM.EXE and CATALOG.EXE use and operate on a file called CATALOG.INI. 
This initialization file is vital to the working of both programs.  When you
use CATCOM to set CATALOG-ON-A-DISK you must make sure that you ship the same
copy CATALOG.INI with your catalogs that CATCOM operated on if you want those
settings to take effect.



When you have made a choice a window appears in which you may type the name
of the file.  If you remember the file name you may just type it here.  If
you want to search for the file, press (F2).  Now you are asked for a search
mask.  This tells CATCOM what type of file to look for.

If you want to search all the files on the current disk and directory just
press (Enter).  This sets the default mask to "*.*", which is the same as the
DOS mask for searching all files.  If you wanted to search for files that all
have the .TXT extension, type "*.TXT".  Or if you want to only search files
with CATALOG in their name type "CATALOG.*".  To search for a particular file
type its full name.

Now press the space bar to toggle the files.  When you see the one you want
press (Enter).  At any time you can press (Esc) to escape back.

Note that when exporting you must export from a catalog file.  All catalog
files have the .CM extension.  CATCOM  automatically sets this extension for
searching, so just press (Enter) when you see "*.CM" in the window.

4.3 COMPRESSING CATALOG FILES

CATALOG ON A DISK gets all its information from compressed files.  Since
compressed files are smaller than regular ASCII files you can fit more of
them on
a floppy disk.  It is easy to compress a file.  Let's say you want to
compress HEADER.TXT.CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 22
===========================================================================


In interactive mode start CATCOM and choose File Compression.  Choose the
file you want to compress (see section 4.3) and press (Enter).  CATCOM will
compress the file for you.

At the DOS command line to compress a file called WIDGETS just type:

                         CATALOG -C WIDGETS

When CATALOG ON A DISK makes a catalog file it converts the tab character to
spaces.  The default is eight spaces per tab.  If your word processor uses a
different setting you may force CATALOG ON A DISK to use it by using the -T
flag.  Call the program as above, but adding the -T flag followed by a
number.  For example, to set the tabs in your widgets file to 6 spaces, type

                         CATCOM -C -T6 WIDGETS

Tab setting is not available in interactive mode.



4.4 ASCII DELIMITED FILES:

An ascii delimited file is a database file that only uses ascii characters
(does not have any special codes or headers).  Each field is identified
(delimited) by a system of commas and quotation marks.

Although this is supposed to be a standard that almost all data base, word
processor, etc. programs can read and write to there are some variations. 
For example, some programs just use a comma (,,,)for a blank field, while
others use quotes and commas ("","","",).  There are common general rules
that all these programs use, and CATCOM can read and write both variations.

4.5 EXPORTING CATALOG FILES:

When you export a file CATCOM reads the compressed catalog file (.CM) and
translates it into ascii delimited format, placing the translated data in a
file of the same name, but with the extension .ASC.

From the main CATCOM menu choose Export a file.  Now you will be presented
with a menu of ascii delimitation formats.  Most databases read type 1, but
check yours to see which format is appropriate.

Place the menu bar on the correct choice and press (Enter).

To export a compressed catalog file to ascii delimited format ("field1",
"field2", "field3", field4") you call CATCOM from the command line, using the
-e flag.  The resulting file can then be imported into a Database, Word
Processor, etc.

CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 23
===========================================================================
Use the following syntax:

                       CATCOM -E FILENAME.CM

NOTES:  ■You do not have to use the file extension.


Some databases import and export numbers with no quotation marks around them
in the ascii delimited field.  For this reason a window has been added to
CATALOG-ON-A-DISK to allow you some flexibility in dealing with such a
situation.

Examples:

You want the default, which saves 15 fields: the order number, the short
description, the price, and 12 long description lines of up to 75 characters
each:

                                Default Reg

Each line in the file will look something like this (it will probably all be
on one line, though):

"MS402", "Sixteen Ton Widget", "64.59", "The long description goes
here.....", "More Long Des", "More Long Des", "More Long Des", "More Long
Des", "More Long Des", "More Long Des", "More Long Des", "More Long Des",
"More Long Des", "More Long Des", "More Long Des"


You are using a number field for price, but not order number, and you do not
want quotations around the price.  To export in this format for a catalog
file called MYSTUFF.CM type the following at the command line:

                             Default P

"MS402", "Sixteen Ton Widget", 64.59, "The long description goes here.....",
"More Long Des", "More Long Des", "More Long Des", "More Long Des", "More
Long Des", "More Long Des", "More Long Des", "More Long Des", "More Long
Des", "More Long Des", "More Long Des"

You are using a number field for price and order number, and you do not want
quotations around them. To export in this format for a catalog file called
MYSTUFF.CM type the following at the command line:

                             Default Both

MS402, "Sixteen Ton Widget", 64.59, "The long description goes here.....",
"More Long Des", "More Long Des", "More Long Des", "More Long Des", "More
Long Des", "More Long Des", "More Long Des", "More Long Des", "More Long
Des", "More Long Des", "More Long Des"
CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 24
===========================================================================
4.6 IMPORTING CATALOG FILES:

CATCOM can import catalog files from a database or other program that can
produce an ascii delimited file in the following format:  

"Item_Number", "Short_Description", "Price", "Long_Description"

Item_Number, Short_Description, and Price should have a total length of 70
characters or less.  Long_Description can be up to 296 characters long, but
should NOT have any line feed characters in it.
There should be a line feed after the last entry, or the last item on the
list won't be read in.

In interactive mode choose Import a file from the main menu, and choose an
ascii delimited file to import.

From the command line use the following syntax:

                          CATCOM -I FILENAME.ASC


CATCOM reads the file and a window pops up on the screen.  You are asked for
the Category Title.  This is what will appear on the menu your customers see. 
Next you are asked for a password.  (This protects your final compressed
catalog file from being exported).  If you don't want to use a password just
press (Enter).

Now the window shows the first record in the database.  Each line on the
screen shows one field for that record, and a chart appears on the left hand
side of the screen.

You must tell CATALOG-ON-A-DISK which record is which by filling in the
chart.

If the field is for your order number place a letter n
next to it.

If the field is for your short description place a letter d next to it.

If the field is for your price place the letter p next to it.

If you do not want to include the field as part of your catalog file, place
the letter x next to it.

After you have marked the above fields you may number the remaining fields
for inclusion in the long description.  Number the first field 1, the next
one 2, and so on.

CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 25
===========================================================================
Any unmarked fields will be added to the long description in the order in
which they appear.  Therefore, if all the long description fields are already
in order, from top to bottom, you can just leave those blank.

When you are done filling in the chart press (Enter).  CATALOG-ON-A-DISK will
import the file and take you back to DOS.
If your original data base didn't have a price field CATCOM gives you the
opportunity to fill in prices now.  However, if you want to save this for
later just tell it to leave all prices at 0.00 when prompted.


If you choose to leave the prices at 0.00 you will have to go into your .TXT
file later with a text editor to change the prices.

As each item is processed it appears on the screen.

When CATCOM is done importing it has created a file with the .TXT extension. 
You are asked if you want to compress the file now.  

You may want to check out the text file for its spacing before compressing
it.  However, if you compress it now it will instantly be readable by
CATALOG.EXE.  The .TXT file is not erased, so you can always go back later,
fix the .TXT file in your text editor and then compress the file again.

Now you have a file with the same name as the original file, but with a .TXT
extension.  This file should look just like a file you would make from
scratch in a word processor.  It is always a good idea to check this file for
spacing, and you may edit it in your word processor.

Finally you must compress the file using the -c flag.  Example:

                         CATCOM -C FILENAME.TXT

Now CATALOG-ON-A-DISK can read the new file.

4.7 CONVERTING V1 TO V2

If you used a previous version of CATALOG-ON-A-DISK it is easy to convert
your old catalog files to the new format using CATCOM in interactive mode.

Simply choose Convert v1 to v2 and type in the name of the file you want to
convert.

Important Note:  You are converting the text file version of your catalog
file, not the compressed version.  Once the conversion has been done you must
still compress the new file.  CATCOM does not do this in one step, because
you may want to go back into the file with your text editor and add more
description lines, a password, or a category header.

CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 26
===========================================================================
When you view the new file you will notice that the ~ symbol has been placed
at the beginning of each product, and blank lines have been erased.  The
original file is given a new file extension "BAK."  So when you convert
WIDGETS.TXT the new file will have the original name, and the old version
will be called WIDGETS.BAK.

4.8 COLORS

You may change the display colors by pressing alt-c at the main menu. There
are three types of screen colors:

Main:                           Most of the displays from CATALOG
Help:                           Help screens displayed when F1 is pressed
Hilight:                        Special messages generated by the program.

Use the right and left arrow keys to toggle the color choices.  press enter
when a choice is set.  If you don't like the colors you have set, press alt-c
to set them again.  NOTE:  The color change doesn't take full effect until
you exit and re-enter the program.

4.9 CURRENCY SYMBOL

At certain points in the program and on the order form CATALOG-ON-A-DISK
displays prices with a currency symbol.  You can change this symbol to
reflect the one used for your country's currency.

There are two ways to set the currency symbol using CATCOM in command line
mode.

Since not all currency symbols appear on your keyboard, you may use the ascii
number (in decimal) to set yours.  For example, to use the British pound
symbol you could type:

                           CATCOM -*a156



For no symbol at all you should use the ascii number for a blank space:

                           CATCOM -a*32


If the currency symbol you want does appear on your keyboard you may use the
-*s flag.  To set the symbol to the dollar sign, for example, you would type:

                           CATCOM -*s$

CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 27
===========================================================================

4.10 DEFINING A HELP BAR

The help bar appears on the screen when you press (Alt) (h) in CATALOG.EXE. 
If you want to use it you should add a message in your Help screen, or on
your header screen telling your customers that it is there.  You also have to
define the help you want displayed.

Defining a help bar is easy.  On the command line type:

                                   CATCOM -hb

A Box will pop up.  You can type anything you want in the box.  When you
press (Enter) it will be saved.

Use -h+ to make it the default, or -h- to turn it off. 

4.11  NATIONALITY SETTING

CATALOG-ON-A-DISK now supports two customer address formats:  United States
and European/Canadian styles.  You use the -nu (Nationality) flag to set the
program to US style, and 
-ne for European/Canadian.  To do this type:

                             catalog -nu

The program will respond, "CATALOG-ON-A-DISK set for US Style Address", or
"CATALOG- ON-A-DISK set for European Style Address."

Examples:

US Style                   European/Canadian
Name                       Name
Address                    Address
Address                    Address
City, State Zip Code       City, Province or County, Postal Code
Country                    Country

CHAPTER SIX: FILES


6.1 EXPLANATION

When you want to look at a catalog, CATALOG looks for Default Files and
Catalog Files.  All of the files have the .CM extension.

Default files hold information for the opening screen, the catalog header, on
screen help, and so on.  These files have the .CM extension (CATALOG ON A
DISK's extension that identifies compressed files).

Catalog Files have the catalog information in them.  CATALOG-ON-A-DISK
automatically reads whichever Catalog Files are on your disk to create the
menu of categories.  Catalog files have the extension .CM (the compressed
product information) For example: WIDGETS.CM.  There must be no more than
ninety-nine of these files on the disk at any one time.  Each Catalog File is
listed in the Title file (CATALOG.TL) with the menu heading used to call it.

Special Forms files are optional.  They contain anything:  an explanation of
your company policies, special coupons, whatever you want to use them for. 
These compressed files have the .CM extension, and they are listed in the
file CATALOG.FM, along with the menu title used to call them.  Important
NOTE:  if CATALOG.FM does not exist on your disk, the Special Forms menu item
in the exit menu does not appear.

                     it.CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 31
===========================================================================
Appendix A:   Distributing Catalogs

CATALOG-ON-A-DISK is protected by US Copyright law.  This section tells how
you may distribute catalogs.  Distribution of your catalog must follow these
rules to avoid infringement of EmmaSoft's copyright.  If you have any
questions about catalog distribution requirements, call EmmaSoft for
clarification.

First, some definitions:

CATALOG-ON-   The software package
A-DISK        including CATALOG.EXE, CATCOM.EXE, and their accompanying
              files as shipped from EmmaSoft.

Your Catalog  Your company's catalog which included CATALOG.EXE,
              CATALOG.INI, and the files you have created to display your
              catalog using CATALOG.EXE.


1.   A registered user is an individual or company
     who has paid a registration fee to EmmaSoft and received 
     a registered copy with a valid serial number from EmmaSoft. 

2.   Only registered users may distribute catalogs using CATALOG.EXE.  If you
     are a registered user you may make unlimited copies of your catalog,
     including CATALOG.EXE and CATALOG.INI. 

     Associated individuals or companies not part of the registered user must
     be registered users before distributing catalogs with CATALOG-ON-A-DISK. 
     For example, each member of a franchise must individually buy a copy of
     the program.  An easy way to distinguish:  if you or your company can
     receive catalog orders directly from a customer you must be a registered
     user.

3.   If you charge a fee for your catalog it should be explicitly understood
     that you are not selling a copy of the CATALOG-ON-A-DISK product, but
     are simply charging for a copy of your catalog.  

4.   When distributing catalogs CATALOG.EXE MUST be included, unchanged from
     its original form.  In addition you must include the file CATALOG.INI
     for the program to work correctly.  Your FIRST, HEADER, ORDERINF, TL,
     FM, help, and CM files should be included as needed.  CATCOM.EXE must
     not be sent with your catalogs.


5.   Unregistered Users:  Unregistered users are invited to experiment with
     CATALOG-ON-A-DISK to see if the program meets their needs.  However it
     is a violation of EmmaSoft's copyright for an unregistered user to
     distribute catalogs using the program.CATALOG-ON-A-DISK MANUAL                                            page 32
