This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
700 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'GO' at the
DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy access
to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.

The Narc utility, newly instituted with the tenth edition, allows you to
look directly at all the compressed program files on the CD without
having to download the program to your hard disk.  So if you want to
look at the programmer's notes or on-line documentation before using
valuable hard disk space, you can.

The PC-SIG Encyclopedia of Shareware is included on the disk, and a
printed copy of the book is included so you can peruse the available
programs from the comfort of your favorite chair.  All the programs are
logically divided into one-hundred twenty categories making it easier to
find just the right software.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

Winner of the Optical Publishing Assn's Best Consumer Product Award.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed

by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word in the program
description.  A new utility, Narc, is implemented so you can look at the
program files and the author's on-line documentation without having to
first copy the program to your hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and
Narc, you can quickly find the program you want and review it to be
sure, without ever having to run it from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

                       Epic MegaGames Presents
                      
                      KILOBLASTER:  THE TRILOGY

                       Created by Allen Pilgrim
         with Dan Froelich, Bryon Neiman, and Samuel Goldstein

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Kiloblaster is a fast-action arcade game reminiscent of Galaxian
with lots of innovative, high-tech features!  This game features digitized
and ray-traced backgrounds in 256-color VGA which are truly out of this
world!  If you have an EGA you can still play the game,  but you're missing
a heck of a show!

   In Kiloblaster, you'll also find an incredible musical sound track and
digitized sound effects if you have a Sound Blaster card.  Kiloblaster also
features some wild sound effects through the tiny speaker in your PC.

   Each of the three Kiloblaster volumes features 30 unique levels, for
a total of -90- stages of arcade excitement!  Fasten your seatbelt and
prepare to be warped into another dimension of game playing!

                     FEATURES & REQUIREMENTS

     - Supports 16 color EGA and 256 color VGA
     - Sound Blaster music card supported (optional)
     - 80286 or faster processor is required
     - Requires at least 512K of memory and DOS 3.0 or later
     - Joystick is optional

                    IMPORTANT ** COMPATIBILITY NOTES

1.  This game requires a lot of free memory -- especially with Sound
    Blaster effects enabled.  Please load DOS HIGH (if you have DOS 5.0),
    and remove any TSR's from memory.

2.  Some mutant screen blankers and memory managers may cause trouble
    with Kiloblaster;  this can be solved by booting from a DOS disk
    without any TSR's or memory managers.

3.  This game is *not* compatible with STACKER and probably other hard-disk
    compression programs.  To get it to work properly,  please install it on
    a non-compressed drive.

4.  This game only supports the Sound Blaster and Sound Blaster Pro sound
    cards,  not the Adlib.

5.  If you have trouble running this game from Windows or OS/2, try running
    it straight from the DOS prompt.

                          INSTRUCTIONS

     To play the game simply type "KILO" and press <enter>. You will
be asked a series of questions to configure the game.

     To select something from the main menu simply move the cursor
to the item and press <enter> or the space bar. You can also press
the first letter to achieve the same results.

PLAY NEW GAME: This option starts you at level 1 with full
shields, bombs, ships and no points.

LOAD SAVED GAME: This is used to LOAD a game that you saved at
an earlier time. Simply move the cursor to the saved game you wish
to play and press ENTER. It will immediately take you to the proper
level and restore your points, weapons, ships and shields.

WARP TO LEVEL: This feature allows you to WARP to a level of
your choosing. If you want to see what a certain level looks like
use this feature. You will start with full shields, bombs, ships
and no points. There are 30 levels but you can only WARP up to
level 20.

STORY: You can read about why you are here and what your
mission is.  Bonuses and enemies are displayed here.

INSTRUCTIONS: This tells you how to control the ship, fire
missiles and use the other features.
     
HIGH SCORES: A list of the best fighters in the galaxy.
     
DEMO: This game comes with a self-running demo that will start
automatically if you don't touch the keyboard for awhile.

NOISE MAKER: Hear all the sounds that are used in the game
simply by pressing a key.

EPIC'S BBS: How to get in touch with Software Creations BBS.  Call it!

ORDERING INFO: Gives you information on how to order the other
2 volumes in the Kiloblaster trilogy. By ordering all 3 games you
will get several bonuses including a hint sheet and cheat code.

CREDITS: Find out the names of all the people who brought you
this quality game. At EPIC we have a MegaTeam!

QUIT: Use this command to return to the real world of spreadsheets,  word 
processors,  and life.

                     OPTIONS DURING THE GAME

FIRE: To fire the ship's main gun use either the SPACE bar or the SHIFT key.

BOMBS: The ALT key is used to fire the bombs/missiles.

MOVEMENT: Use the arrow keys to control the movement of your ship.

PAUSE: Press the letter 'P' to PAUSE the game.

SAVE: Press the letter 'S' to SAVE the current game. When the
window pops up move the cursor to the line where you want to SAVE
the game and press ENTER. You will be prompted to give a name for
your saved game that will help you remember what it is. All the
attributes will be set to what they were at the beginning of the
current level. So if you are almost totally wiped out just SAVE the
game and then LOAD it again. This will give you many chances to get
through a level.

LOAD: This is used to LOAD a game that you saved earlier.

HELP: If you can't remember what the keys are just press F1
for an instant HELP window. (note: not all features are listed).

EXPERT MODE: Press F2 to enable the EXPERT mode. The game will
go so fast most people will not be able to keep up. For the bold
and adventurous; use with extreme caution! (note: this can also be
used to SPEED up the game on a slower computer).

GRANNY MODE: Press F3 to slow the game down. This a great
feature for beginners or younger players.

SOUND TOGGLE: If you want to turn off the sound effects press
the letter 'S' while holding down the CTRL key. Do the same to turn
them back on again.

EXIT: To exit the game press ESC or 'Q' and you will be
prompted to verify that you wish to exit. Press the letter 'Y' to
exit, or any other key to return to the game.

                              
                              BOARD EDITOR

     The BOARD EDITOR is useful for creating your own customized
playing boards. To LOAD a board simply type the name with no
extension. For example if the board is named "BOARD1.KB1" you
simply press the letter 'L' and when prompted for the name type
"BOARD1" and press the <ENTER> key. To SAVE a board first press the
letter 'S' and type the name of the board, up to 8 letters. The
.KB1 extension will automatically be added for you. If the board
already exists it will be renamed using the .BAK extension instead.
(note: it will only do this the first time so the original is
always there). To retrieve any board with the .BAK extension press
the letter 'Z' and you will be prompted for a name. Again there is
no need to add the extension. Make sure you keep a backup copy on
a separate disk for your protection.

     To ADD a new block simply press 'A' and then the name of a
block. The blocks used to create the boards are numbered from 1-9,
and 'A' to 'U'. After you select a block press the <ENTER> key to
place it on the playing board. Use the ARROW keys to move to a new
location and press the SPACE BAR to put the same block there. If
you want to REPEAT a block that is already on the board then move
to that location and press <ENTER>. Now this block will be stored
in memory until you decide to change it.

     To CLEAR the entire board simply press the letter 'C'. You can
also fill the board with any pattern you desire by pressing the
letter 'F' and then any number or letter. You'll notice that some
of the patterns that are used as part of a bigger block cannot be
used with the FILL command.

     To use a board in the game it must have the same name as the
ones I used. In a future release you will be able to use any name.
          - Levels   1-3: board1.kb1
          - Levels   4-6: board2.kb1
          - Levels   7-9: board3.kb1
          - Levels 10-12: board4.kb1
          - Levels 13-15: board5.kb1
          - Levels 16-18: board6.kb1
          - Levels 19-21: board7.kb1
          - Levels 22-24: board8.kb1
          - Levels 25-27: board9.kb1
          - Levels 28-30: boarda.kb1

     Note: The extension will be different in each volume.

     The BOARD EDITOR is a way for you to express your creativity
and to enjoy a change of scenery once-in-awhile. Even if you have
a VGA I encourage you to start the game in EGA at least once just
to see what it's like. I really enjoy playing it in both modes;
it's like 2 different games.
     
 ** NOTE **  To play a game with the background boards you've created,
             you need to exit,  run KILO again,  and select EGA graphics
             mode (the boards don't appear in VGA mode).

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
