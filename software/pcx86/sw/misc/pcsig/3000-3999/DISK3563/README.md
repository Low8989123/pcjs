The brand new PC-SIG World Of Windows is a must-have for Windows users.
In order to produce the best possible Windows collection PC-SIG has made
an alliance with the acclaimed Windows OnLine BBS. So not only do you have
access to the collecting and weeding out efforts for which PC-SIG is
famous, but also the huge volume of fonts and sound files and the in-depth
software reviews of the world's best Windows BBS.

This CD contains every one of the best Windows shareware programs
available, 350+ in all, over 900 TrueType fonts which can be used
without royalties, 429 ATM fonts, over 2,000 sound files in .WAV,
.VOC, .SND, .SOU, .MID format and 2,794 icons! A major computer
catalog is offering a collection of 250 fonts for $49.95. They have
great prices on hardware and software, but this time they can't
touch us.

As if the files aren't enough, we thought you would want to preview
and use these sounds, fonts, icons and programs directly from the CD,
without taking the time and space to unarchive them. So we have
included a font previewer and installed, a sound player and an icon
manager. Over 200 of the programs can be run simply by clicking on
them in the File Manager. Nobody else offers you anything close to
this type of access.

We're not done yet. In add to all the Windows riches described above,
this CD also contains the text and programs from the July-August
issue of Shareware Magazine. This is the second in a six-volume PC-SIG
Encyclopedia of Shareware CD-ROM series (Games was the first). Each
volume includes the programs from a section of the PC-SIG Library plus
all the text and every program from the current issue of Shareware
Magazine. Software reviews for this issue cover over 100 programs
including games, communications, printing, text editors and more. 124
of the programs mentioned in the magazine are included, plus 225
programs updated since the May-June issue.

            The objective of CHEXO is to capture your opponents
            chips until he only has one left. The computer plays
            the Green and you play the Red. The pieces can only
            move forward on diagonals by jumping either your own
            chip or an opponents.  If you jump over a opponents
            piece, it will then captured and will be removed from
            the game board.  Each player takes turns moving only
            once (multipule jumps are not allowed). If one side
            cannot make a move then the other side will continue
            to move until either both sides have no moves left or
            the other player has a valid move.

            When all moves are exausted for both players, the board
            will reset itself with the number of chips remaining.
            This process of playing and resetting will continue
            until one player has just one chip left. All moves are
            made by clicking on chip you want to move and then
            clicking again to place it. The computer will only
            allow you to place the chip if it is a valid move.
            CHEXO is easy to play and no two games are ever the
            same.

                             * Objective *

      The object of Mice Men is to get all twelve of your color mice
      to the other end of the game board before your opponent does.
      In this version you will always be playing the blue mice and the
      computer will play the red mice.



                         * Setting Difficulty *

      At the opening screen, the game will ask you for the difficulty
      level of play.    <H>ard  <M>edium  <E>asy

      The computer will then randomly decide who will take the first
      turn.


                                 * Play *
 
      The game board consists of 19 columns and 13 rows of various cheese
      blocks.  At the start of play, the blue mice are located on the
      left side of the cheese board and the red mice are on the right.
      When it is your turn to play, special pushing poles will be shown
      at the bottom of those columns where you have mice located. Using
      your left and right arrow keys you can select the column you want.

      You can either push or pull the column up or down.  This will
      shift the entire column in that direction.  It will wrap around,
      so that if you have a mouse at the top of the cheese board and you
      push the column up, the mouse will now appear at the bottom.
      If it's at the bottom and you pull the column down, then it appears
      at the top.

      By pulling and pushing columns of cheese blocks, you can create
      passageways for your mice so that they can reach the right side
      of the cheese board.  The red mice are trying to get all the way
      to the left side.  After a column has been pushed, that player's
      mice move as far as they can within the maze.  When they can't
      move any further, the opponent's mice will then move if they can.

      Each side takes turns pushing and pulling columns of cheese blocks
      until one player has gotten all twelve of his mice off the game
      board.


                         * Columns Locked Out *

      There are times when you will not be allowed to select a column
      even though you have mice located in it.  When you have pushed
      the same column a total of 6 times in a row, it will not allow
      you to push or pull that column again until you've pushed one
      of the others.  This is not the case if you have only one possible
      column to push.

      Any column that has been pushed by an opponent on the previous turn
      is also locked out for the next turn.  A column that has been locked
      out will have a yellow 'X' over the pole.


                             * Win/Loss/Draw *

      The first player to get his twelve mice off the cheese board will
      be declared the winner.  If each player has only one mouse left
      on the cheese board, then there will be only 8 moves left for each
      player.  The mouse that's further along on the cheese board will be
      the winner.  If both mice are exactly the same distance, then the
      game will be declared a draw.  The game will warn you with 5 moves
      left that the game will end if no one has won by that time.


                               * Keys *

           Arrow Keys Left/Right  :   Select Column
           Arrow Keys   Up/Down   :   Pushes/Pulls Column

                      <L>oad      :   Loads a previously saved game
                      <S>ave      :   Saves a game to be loaded later
                      <Q>uit      :   Quit Mice Men Program


        The Key Definitions are shown at the bottom of the board at
        all times.

        Mice Men is easy to play, yet will involve a lot of strategy on
        your part in order to win, especially at the Hardest level of play.
        Each game board will be different, so no two games will ever be the
        same!


                           * NOTE WINDOWS USERS *

        Running Mice Men under Windows may cause unexpected results. The
        game should be played by loading it directly from the Dos prompt.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
