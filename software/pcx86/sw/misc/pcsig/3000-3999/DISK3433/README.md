This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
700 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'GO' at the
DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy access
to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.

The Narc utility, newly instituted with the tenth edition, allows you to
look directly at all the compressed program files on the CD without
having to download the program to your hard disk.  So if you want to
look at the programmer's notes or on-line documentation before using
valuable hard disk space, you can.

The PC-SIG Encyclopedia of Shareware is included on the disk, and a
printed copy of the book is included so you can peruse the available
programs from the comfort of your favorite chair.  All the programs are
logically divided into one-hundred twenty categories making it easier to
find just the right software.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

description.  A new utility, Narc, is implemented so you can look at the
program files and the author's on-line documentation without having to
first copy the program to your hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and
Narc, you can quickly find the program you want and review it to be
sure, without ever having to run it from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

World Time A.0.4 Release Notes
Written By Dan Hallock

General

Do you have to call people in other parts of the world frequently?
With the WorldTime program, you can check the time in the city you are
calling before you call.

This Windows program will display the current time for your location
(based on your PC's clock), the Greenwich Median time (GMT), and the time
for any city you select.

There is no copyright on this program. You are free to do with it
whatever you wish, and give to whoever you wish. I only ask that you
do not change it.

This is a pretty simple-minded program, I doubt too much can go wrong
with it; however, if you find an error please feel free to let me
know.

       Configuration
       Operation
       Using the City Editor
              GMT Offsets
              Day Light Savings
       Incorrect Times
       LAN Operation

Installation
------------

This program was written in Visual Basic which means you must have
VBRUN100.DLL in your PATH (put it in \windows\system if you're not sure).
You can find VBRUN100.DLL in the WINADV forum on Compuserve. I did not
include it in my zip file so that you don't have to pay to download it if
you already have it.

The files TIMEZONE.EXE and TIMEZONE.DAT should be copied to the
same directory. You may copy them to a new directory, or to an
existing directory. The file TIMEZONE.DAT MUST be in the same
directory as TIMEZONE.EXE.

TIMEZONE.DAT contains cities by their names. If you wish to use airport
codes instead (JFK instead of New York), copy TIMEZONE.APT to
TIMEZONE.DAT.

Once you have the files in the directory of your choosing, do the
following:

Select the group in Program Manager where you want to place the
World Time program. From the Program Manager menu, select File then New.
The "New Program Object" window will open. Select "Program Item" and
then click on "OK".

In the "Program Item Properties" field, enter any description you
wish such as "World Time". In the command line field, enter the fully
qualified program name, for example "C:\TIMEZONE\TIMEZONE.EXE".

In the "Working Directory" field, enter the path to the program such as
C:\TIMEZONE. Click on OK.

The World Time icon will now appear in the selected group. Double click
on the World Time icon to start the program.

Configuration
-------------

After starting World Time for the first time, you should go into the SETUP
window to configure the program. If you are in the United States, setup is
very simple. Select the Time Zone you are in: Eastern (EST), Central (CST),
Mountain (MST) or Pacific (PST). If Daylight Savings is in effect (mid-Spring
to mid-Fall), turn on Daylight Savings.

If you are not in one of the four listed time zones, then you need to enter
the correct GMT offset. The easiest way to do this is to go to the editor,
find your city and its GMT, then return to SETUP and enter the GMT.

For example, if you live in Frankfurt, go into the Editor and type "F" then
ALT-DownArrow. Press the DownArrow until you get to Frankfurt and finally
press ALT to select Frankfurt. You will see the GMT Offset for Frankfurt
is 1.00. Return to the SETUP Window, and enter 1.00 in the GMT Offset field.

Once you have completed the SETUP Window, press OK. Now check the times of
a few cities that you know what the current time is to make sure that you
have correctly configured World Time.

Operation
---------

When the World Time program starts, you will see your current time, the
GMT time, and the time for the first city in the TIMEZONE.INI file. To
see the time zone in another city, you can click on the down arrow and
then scroll through the cities. You can also use the up and down arrow
keys to scroll through the cities.

You can also type in the name of the city. As soon as you type in enough
characters of the city to fully qualify it, it will appear.

To exit the program, use ALT-F4 or the Quit button.

Using the City Editor
---------------------

You can Add, delete, and change cities that World Time knows about. From
the main window, click on Edit. This puts you in the city editor.

To add a new city, enter the correct city name (overwriting the current),
and enter the correct GMT Offset and Day Light Savings flag. Once you are
satisfied, click on the Add key.

To modify or delete a city, you must first find it. Use the mouse or the
keyboard to select the city from the city box.

To update the city, make the desired changes, then click on the Update key.

To delete the city, click on the update key. You will be asked to verify the
deletion before the record is actually deleted.

GMT Offsets
-----------

Determining the correct GMT Offset is easiest done by finding an existing
city in the same timezone. For example, to add Dusseldorf, first find
Frankfurt's GMT and then use it for DusselDorf.

Day Light Savings Flag
----------------------

This flag indicates the city observes Day Light Savings when it is in effect.
This flag does not indicate that day light savings is currently in effect
(that is done in the Setup Window).

For example, Chicago observes Daylights Savings (as does nearly all U.S.
cities); however, Phoenix does not. You will see that Phoenix does not have
this flag set.

I currently have no way of knowing which foreign cities use Day Light Savings
so most of those cities have the Day Light Savings flag turned off.

Incorrect Times
---------------

If World Time comes up with a wrong time, there are two likely reasons: the
GMT offset is wrong, or the Day Light Savings flag is wrong. If you find such
a mistake, please let me know so that the next version of World Time has the
data corrected.

World Time's GMT Offset comes from a corporate Data Base and has a high
probability of being correct. The GMT is an offset from the Greenwich
Median Time (the time in London when Day Light Savings in not in effect).

There is a map of GMT Offsets in the "Information Please" Almanac. This map
is not very detailed, but will probably be suitable enough if you already
know exactly where the city is.

The more probable reason for the time being incorrect is Day Light Savings.
In the US, Day Light Savings exists in nearly every city, but I do not
currently know who is using Day Light Savings outside of the US other than
England (they use it).

As such, I have assumed no foreign cities use Day Light Savings. If you call
another country and find out that World Time is wrong by 1 hour, find out if
they are using Day Light Savings. If so, update the city using the city
editor, and the time will be correct. I hope to find some reference to
day light savings in other countries so that World Time can correctly take
day light savings into account.

LAN Operation
-------------

I have World Time running on a Netware 3.11 LAN. Both TIMEZONE.EXE and
TIMEZONE.DAT are placed in a read-only directory. When a user cannot
gain write access to the TIMEZONE.DAT file, the SETUP and EDIT keys are
disabled.

Modification History
--------------------

A.0.4:  Dec 14 1992.

    Enh: The Window's position at closing is saved and used next time the
    application is run.

A.0.3:  Dec 12 1992.

    Fix: When typing in the name of a city, after a city is fully qualified,
    any other key resets the search (instead of just control-home).

    Enh: The active city is saved on exit and will be recalled when the
    program starts. Note: this is done by adding the [TimeZone] section
    header in the WIN.INI file.

A.0.2:  Nov 30 1992.

    Enh: Created new TIMEZONE.DAT file with 450 cities. NOTE: because
    of the large number of cities loaded, TIMEZONE loads slower than
    previously (it takes about 5 seconds on my 386/33). If the load
    time is unacceptable, you could delete cities from the data base.

    Enh: The TimeZone Code may now contain fractions for those cities 
    that are 1/4, 1/2, or 3/4 of a time zone. For example, India uses a  
    GMT offset of 5.5. In the entire data base I include, only one city, 
    Kathmandu uses 3/4 and none use 1/4.

    Enh: Redesigned the form to display all of the data in the smallest
    possible window.

    Enh: Added Online Help.

    Enh: Added City Editor

    Enh: New TimeZone.DAT format that allows easy updating for the city
    editor.

    Enh: When program is minimized, the timer interrupt is disabled so the
    program does not use any time.

    Enh: Setup screen now allows any GMT Offset.

    Fix: When scrolling through cities (without using the scroll bar - 
    ie. dragging), a subscript out of bounds would occur. While scrolling, 
    the timer interrupt keeps occuring, using what ever city index was 
    current. Apparently, this index is not always valid when using the 
    drag method of scrolling. Now the program turns off the clock for the 
    city during selection of a city. The other two clocks continue to be 
    updated.

A.0.1:  Jul 5, 1992.

    Fix: Removed use of True Type fonts so program will display
    correctly on Windows 3.0.

    Fix: Initial form now starts in the upper left hand corner.

    Enh: Added Date and AM/PM indicator.

    Enh: Local Time Zone, Daylight Savings flag, and location Database
    is now loaded from a file allowing end-user to change.

    Enh: Allow configuration in program via the new Options window.

A.0.0: Jun 16, 1992.

    Initial Release.

is not very detailed, but will probably be suitable enough if you already
know exactly where the city is.

The more probable reason for the time being incorrect is Day Light Savings.
In the US, Day Light Savings exists in nearly every city, but I do not
currently know who is using Day Light Savings outside of the US other than
England (they use it).

As such, I have assumed no foreign cities use Day Light Savings. If you call
another country and find out that World Time is wrong by 1 hour, find out if
they are using Day Light Savings. If so, update the city using the city
editor, and the time will be correct. I hope to find some reference to
day light savings in other countries so that World Time can correctly take
day light savings into account.

LAN Operation
-------------

I have World Time running on a Netware 3.11 LAN. Both TIMEZONE.EXE and
TIMEZONE.DAT are placed in a read-only directory. When a user cannot
gain write access to the TIMEZONE.DAT file, the SETUP and EDIT keys are
disabled.

Modification History
--------------------

A.0.4:  Dec 14 1992.

    Enh: The Window's position at closing is saved and used next time the
    application is run.

A.0.3:  Dec 12 1992.

    Fix: When typing in the name of a city, after a city is fully qualified,
    any other key resets the search (instead of just control-home).

    Enh: The active city is saved on exit and will be recalled when the
    program starts. Note: this is done by adding the [TimeZone] section
    header in the WIN.INI file.

A.0.2:  Nov 30 1992.

    Enh: Created new TIMEZONE.DAT file with 450 cities. NOTE: because
    of the large number of cities loaded, TIMEZONE loads slower than
    previously (it takes about 5 seconds on my 386/33). If the load
    time is unacceptable, you could delete cities from the data base.

    Enh: The TimeZone Code may now contain fractions for those cities 
    that are 1/4, 1/2, or 3/4 of a time zone. For example, India uses a  
    GMT offset of 5.5. In the entire data base I include, only one city, 
    Kathmandu uses 3/4 and none use 1/4.

    Enh: Redesigned the form to display all of the data in the smallest
    possible window.

    Enh: Added Online Help.

    Enh: Added City Editor

    Enh: New TimeZone.DAT format that allows easy updating for the city
    editor.

    Enh: When program is minimized, the timer interrupt is disabled so the
    program does not use any time.

    Enh: Setup screen now allows any GMT Offset.

    Fix: When scrolling through cities (without using the scroll bar - 
    ie. dragging), a subscript out of bounds would occur. While scrolling, 
    the timer interrupt keeps occuring, using what ever city index was 
    current. Apparently, this index is not always valid when using the 
    drag method of scrolling. Now the program turns off the clock for the 
    city during selection of a city. The other two clocks continue to be 
    updated.

A.0.1:  Jul 5, 1992.

    Fix: Removed use of True Type fonts so program will display
    correctly on Windows 3.0.

    Fix: Initial form now starts in the upper left hand corner.

    Enh: Added Date and AM/PM indicator.

    Enh: Local Time Zone, Daylight Savings flag, and location Database
    is now loaded from a file allowing end-user to change.

    Enh: Allow configuration in program via the new Options window.

A.0.0: Jun 16, 1992.

    Initial Release.
