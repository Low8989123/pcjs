Here's a fun game that teaches kids (6-12) basic addition as they catch 
computerized fish. They get bonus points if they avoid bugs and         
alligators, but win by answering questions quickly and accurately. The  
program is easy to use and the difficulty level is adjustable. The      
registered version includes subtraction, multiplication, and division.
