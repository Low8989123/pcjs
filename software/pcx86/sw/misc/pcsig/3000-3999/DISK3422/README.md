                                ____________


                                 OBJECTIVE

        The objective of Robix is get your color blocks to the bottom
        of the game board by shifting entire rows either to the left or
        right.  You can play Robix against the computer or a friend.
        When playing the computer, you will be assigned the Red blocks
        and the computer will always play the Blue.


                         SELECTING AND PUSHING ROWS

        At the start of each game, the computer will randomly decide
        who will go first.  Each player then takes turns pushing a row
        of blocks left or right.  When a row is selected, it will be
        shifted one grid space.  The rows can only be pushed a total of
        two times in either direction.  If your color block is pushed
        against one side of the grid board, then it will re-appear on
        the other side after the row has shifted.  When it is your turn
        to play, you will see an arrow pointing to the top row on the
        left side of the screen.  Use the arrow keys to select the row
        and the direction to push in.  The computer will only let you
        position the pointer icon on valid rows.


        Once you have selected a row, push the <Spacebar> to activate
        the push.  If a block has the space to keep moving downwards,
        it will continue to fall until it either reaches the bottom or
        hits another block.


                         SHORT / MEDIUM / LONG GAMES

        Robix has three types of games you can play.  The Short game
        ends when the first player can get 10 of his color blocks to
        the bottom.  The Medium game ends after 25 blocks, and the Long
        game is 50 blocks.  In the Medium and Long games, once a block
        reaches the bottom, it will move back up to an empty space on
        the top row.

Blind Wars is a strategy war game where the object
is to conquer all the cities on the game board. In
this sequel to Soleau Software's Isle Wars, the task
becomes quite challenging because you cannot see the
strength of the opposing armies. It plays like 'Risk'
yet adds elements such as production centers, volcanic
eruptions, floods, and much more! Options include, sound
toggle, save game, speed play and levels of difficulty.

Robix is another logic puzzle game from Soleau Software.
The objective of this pure strategy game is to get your
colored blocks to the bottom of the game board by pushing
entire rows either left or right. You can play Robix against
the computer or a friend. Written in beautiful EGA/VGA
graphics, it is both addictive and challenging for all ages!
