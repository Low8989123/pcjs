-----------------------------
Detailed Program Description:
-----------------------------
The colorful graphics, songs, and speech of Preschool Pack will
be sure to capture the attention of your preschooler.  From the
main menu screen, which contains a cat which meows and winks when
clicked, to the bee which frowns when a mistake is made in the
matching game, you and your preschooler will appreciate the
careful design and attention to detail of Preschool Pack.  The
program does not not require any keyboard input - all activities
may be performed entirely with a mouse.  Through five different
and entertaining activities your preschooler will learn about
counting, number recognition, the alphabet, colors, matching,
and classifying.

Activities include: "Animal Homes", where animals must be placed
in their appropriate homes - either farm, forest, or circus;
"Balloons", where the user must click on a color block matching
the color of a rising balloon before it pops; "Matching", a memory
game with an animated bee rewarding the user who locates all
matches; "Counting", where the user counts along with the computer
as a variety of colorful images, from dinosaurs to dolls, are
displayed; and "ABC's" where the user must find all letters which
match a displayed letter.  "ABC's" uses speech to pronounce each
letter as it is selected.  All activities are reinforced with
cheerful music and animation sequences.
