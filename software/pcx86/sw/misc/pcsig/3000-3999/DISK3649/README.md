 ------------------ README.TXT FOR THE LASER LETTERHEAD KIT -------------------

 Thank you for your trial use of The Laser Letterhead Kit. You will need an IBM
 286, 386, 486, or higher computer (no special extended or expanded memory 
 requirements), DOS 3.0 or higher, and a Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer or a
 100% compatible. All LaserJet printers, except the original LaserJet, may be 
 used. The printer must use HP's Printer Command Language (PCL) version 4 or 
 higher. Dot Matrix and most ink jet printers do not use this command language.
 The Kit will install on a hard disk or floppy diskette, 720K or larger. A 360K
 diskette will not hold the files expanded during the INSTALL program.      

 There should be five files on this disk: 

  (1) FONTS.EXE  (2) INSTALL.EXE  (3) LLHK.EXE  (4) PCX.EXE  (5) README.TXT
 
 If any of these 5 files are missing, please contact your shareware distributor
 or CPI Sofware. It is necessary to use the INSTALL program to properly set up
 the files and enter your installation input into The Laser Letterhead Kit's
 setup program. Immediately after the installation you may print letterheads.

 All of the necessary PCL bit map soft fonts and PCX images are included in the
 above. You do not need an additional program to download soft fonts to your
 laser printer. Nothing more is needed. The Laser Letterhead Kit does it all.

 You may install The Kit by placing this disk into any floppy drive on your 
 computer, logging on to that drive, and typing:

                       INSTALL   (then strike the ENTER key)

 Follow the on screen instructions. After The Laser Letterhead Kit is installed,
 the README.DOC file will be available in the directory or on the diskette 
 where you placed the program files. The README.DOC file contains instructions
 for using and customizing The Kit.

 You may view the README.DOC file by logging on to the directory or diskette 
 where The Laser Letterhead Kit is located, and typing:

                        BROWSE README.DOC (then strike ENTER key)
 
 Since you will need to use the README.DOC file as INSTRUCTIONS when The Kit is
 up and running, you may want to print a copy on your laser printer by typing
 either of the two commands, while logged on to The Kit's directory or diskette:

    PRINT README.DOC   or,   TYPE README.DOC > PRN  (then stike ENTER key)  
  
 The README.DOC file is 5 pages long and will supply you will all necessary 
 information to operate and customize The Laser Letterhead Kit to your needs.
