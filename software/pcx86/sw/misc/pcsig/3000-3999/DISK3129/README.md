Introduction:

This program is intended for non-commercial, evaluational
purposes only.  The PC-HyperText Architect program is designed to
allow the computer user to design color screens with music and
Hyper Text buttons with simplicity for any IBM PC or AT and
compatible.  The minimum configuration is:

     Hard Disk drive or High density disk drive
       (a low density drive could be used for very small          
       applications). 
     Monochrome, CGA, LCD or EGA/VGA display
     640K of memory

This program uses a central database of item names and associated
information that designate the location and length of each entity
created.  This version allows the following entities:

     Help screen or window 
     Songs.
     Static text screen.
     Passwords.
     File names.

The Master Index file contains the information needed to access
and retrieve each of these entities.  The Screen file contains the
definition of each screen or song in the database.  The physical
location (file, offset, length, etc.) is stored in the Master
Index file, and the logical name (32 characters, non-case
sensitive) is used to find these entities in this file.  Any
song, screen or Hyper Text button is referenced with this logical
name.  A Hyper Text button is an area on the screen that is
sensitive to the mouse or the cursor, and results in a song or screen
stored in the Screen file to be displayed or played.  When the
cursor is positioned without the mouse, the TAB and BACKTAB keys
move between active Hyper Text buttons and the ENTER key selects
the next item to display or play.  The ESC key returns to the
previous screen.  The mouse's left button is analogous to the
ENTER key, and the right button performs the same function as the
ESC key.  This program is menu driven, and takes little practice
to master.

Setup:

To extract the program and associated files, type these commands
(or the equivalent):

  MD \PCSCREEN  
  CD \PCSCREEN
  COPY A:*.* .
  PKZ092
  PKUNZIP PCSCEVAL.ZIP
  PKUNZIP PCSCSRCS.ZIP

The files require over 600K of disk space including the files
distributed with the PKUNZIP program (the PK* files may be
deleted if you so desire).
  
To run the Song / Screen Generator, type:

  BTCHBLDR /V TALNDEMO.RTP

This invokes the Song / Screen Generator in demo mode with the
Parable of the Talents from the New Testament of the Bible as the
example.  Whenever a screen is displayed, and a key needs to be
typed to continue to the next screen or cursor position, three
short beeps are heard on the computer's speaker.  After these
beeps type any key (Carriage Return, or space for instance), and
the next step in demo will be executed.  Any application
generated with this package can be run in this mode also.  

Another set of demos are on this disk that demonstrate the
Supervisory mode of this program.  Type:

       BTCHBLDR /S SUPRDEMO.RTP

This demo shows how password records can be displayed in
Supervisory mode.  

A Master Index and Screen file of songs are on this disk 
and may be viewed with the following command:

       BTCHBLDR /V SONGDEMO.RTP

This is a slideshow of songs and screens, and requires no 
intervention.  Type Cntl C or ESC to abort this program.

To run the program in interactive mode, type:

       BTCHBLDR /I

This begins the program in interactive mode where the input files
and the configuration can be specified (e.g. demo mode, output to
the screen, etc.).  The first prompt asks if all input should be
taken from a file.  This is where the input saved by this program
(in the file specified at the second prompt) is specified so
unaided generation of screens may take place.  The next prompt
asks if all fields should be written out to a file.  This feature
should be used if screens are to be rebuilt often, each field is
saved into the specified file for use later.  Of course, the
bifurcations at questions may be different (e.g. if files exist
the second time) so care must be taken.  If input is taken from a
file, then single step or demo mode may be selected.  In demo
mode, when each field is input, three short beeps are heard on
the speaker and then the program waits for a keystroke from the
keyboard (type any character except ESC).  The Master Index file
name is requested from the operator, with the password.  The
passwords for the default files are:

     PCSCREEN.MDX   External Password:  PASSWORDMDX
                    Internal Password:  MDXPASSWORD
     PCSCREEN.SCR   External Password:  PASSWORDSCR
                    Internal Password:  SCRPASSWORD
     Supervisory    External Password:  SUPERPASSWORD
                    Internal Password:  PASSWORDSUPER

The Master Index file contains the name and location of every
screen, song and item in the database.  The Screen file name is
requested from the operator with its password next.  This file
contains all the HyperText screens and the songs in the database. 
After this, a blue screen shows the control record of the Master
Index File that was specified.  The program after this point is
almost self-explanatory. The fields entry allows the use of the
cursor key pad to edit the field.  The insert, delete, page up,
and page down keys are all supported.  Notice that the screens 
that have HyperText links in them are type 10 (Major Help Screen 
for Help Level 2) or type 11 (Minor Help Screen for Help Level 1) 
but the ones that are the end of a chain of HyperText or do not 
have HyperText links are type 12 (Screen Commands).  The Help 
levels are used in the new PC-APPLICATOR product, and allow the 
designer to choose the size and detail of two levels of help.  
This could be used by screen designers with this version of 
PC-HyperText Architect for upward compatability with future releases.  
A good suggestion is to choose option number 4 on the main menu 
and step through the screens one by one to examine each one.  
The following screen files and Master Index Files are on this disk:

  SONGS.MDX            (* Master Index file for songs.   *)
  SONGS.SCR            (* Screen file for songs.         *)
  TALENTS.MDX          (* Master Index file for Parable  *)
  TALENTS.SCR          (* Screen file for Parable        *)
  PCSCREEN.MDX         (* Supervisory and password demo  *)
  PCSCREEN.SCR         (* Empty with this version.       *)
  PCSCR$$$.MDX         (* Master Index file for BTCHBLDR *)
  PCSCR$$$.SCR         (* Screen file for BTCHBLDR       *)

All of these files have a secret Supervisory pass key except
PCSCREEN.MDX.  This file uses the default Supervisory pass key. 
See the section in the user's guide about Valid Options or
Passwords for more information about pass keys.  These files all
have passwords.  The Runtime Parameter files contain the external
passwords in them.  The SONGS files contains some songs to
demonstrate the music capability of this system.  The TALENTS
files contain a tutorial on one of the parables of the New
Testament of the Bible.  The PCSCR$$$ files are the internal
files used by the Song / Screen Generator itself.  A description of
the text processor commands may be found later in this file. 
These commands allow the user to build windows of color static
text in a manner similar to a text processor.  Once you build
your own screens with Hypertext capabilities (see the example TXT
files for ideas), you may test them with selection 6 on the main
menu of the Song / Screen Generator program.  

The starting or initial screen is prompted for when you select
option 6.  After entering the initial screen's name, everything
is automatic.  The Hypertext capability is database driven from
the Master Index File and Screen File generated with the Batch
Screen Builder program.  The initial screen name:

     DEMO_INITIAL_SCREEN 

invokes the same set of HyperText help screens used by the Batch
Screen Builder program (the password for this screen is the same
as for the Screen file: PASSWORDSCR).

The SONGS files contain songs to replay.  Run the BTCHBLDR
program and specify SONGS.MDX for the Master Index file, and
SONGS.SCR for the screen file.  Choose option 4 to cycle through
those screens.  A runtime parameter file is provided called:
SONGS.RTP for your convenience.

The TALENTS files contain a short tutorial on the Parable of the
Talents in the New Testament of the Bible.  Choose option 6 and
specify START_THE_TALENTS_PARABLE at the prompt, this steps the
user through the tutorial.  The runtime parameter file:
TALDEMO.RTP begins the talents parable in demo mode, as described
before.  The runtime parameter file: TALENTS.RTP begins the Batch
Screen Builder with the talents database for your interactive
perusal.  

Another file: PCSCR$$$.ERR, is required in the directory that
BTCHBLDR is run.  This file contains the error messages for
runtime errors encountered in the Song / Screen Generator.

Valid Options:

The following options are available (or proposed) for use:

       /I - Interactive input for initialization (replaces the
            *.RTP file).
       /L - Use the LCD color table specified in the Runtime
            parameter file (overrides the autosense nature of the
            software to detect the display type).
       /P - Process using the prompt file instead of the Menu, 
            Form, and associated files.  This gives bootstrap
            capability to applications that need further testing
            of the menus and forms.  It runs slower, but the
            menus and forms may be more volatile until the        
            application is stable. (Not available with the        
            evaluation version 1.6).
       /D - Use defaults for:
            Keyboard input file = NONE
            Keyboard audit trail file = NONE
            Screen output = YES
            Sound output = YES
            Demo mode = NO
            Printf escape character = ~
            Monochrome VLT values = 0 .. 15
            CGA VLT values = 0 .. 15
            EGA/VGA VLT values = 0 .. 15
            LCD VLT values = 0 .. 15
            End of Line characters = 9 222 5 13 155 21 4 27 0 0
                                     96 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
       /F - Use defaults for the Master Index file and screen
            files: 
            Master Index file = PCSCREEN.MDX
            Password for above = BLANK
            Screen file = PCSCREEN.SCR
            Password for above = BLANK
       Note: BTCHBLDR /D /F  
            is the same as an *.RTP file with the above defaults.
       /S - Supervisory mode for extended debugging and utility
            functions such as password perusal.  In Supervisory
            mode, internal passwords are displayed whenever any
            records are displayed.  An internal Supervisory
            password cannot be viewed without entering it.  This 
            prevents people that know the external Supervisory
            password from viewing or changing the internal one
            (the Supervisory pass key is also displayed with the
            Supervisory password as the file name).
       /K - User provided pass key.  The option: /Kxxxxxxx        
            designates the string: 'xxxxxxx' (32 chars. max.) as
            the current pass key for Supervisory password         
            processing.  This gives the operator the capability  
            to encrypt the Supervisory password with a unique    
            key.  The Master Index file specified at startup must
            have this pass key in its control record or the Batch
            Screen Builder aborts (unless the Master Index file  
            was created at startup).  This will prevent people   
            from modifying or trashing your valuable data without
            this key.  If this option is not used, a default pass
            key is used.  This pass key is: 

               ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ123456

            Anyone creating a Supervisory password should give
            this string, (or the one with the /K option) at the
            prompt:

               Enter the file name this password protects:

            When creating a password from the main menu (option
            7).  This gives another level of protection for the
            designer's data (without this, anyone could create a
            Supervisory password, and view or modify your data).
       /E - User error recovery. (Not available in evaluation
            version 1.6).
       /J - Open journal file that logs all I/O operations.
            This file(s) are named: ERROR$$$.Lxx, and are recreated
            whenever this option is used.  This option can only
            be used in Supervisory mode. (Not available in 
            evaluation Version 1.6).
       /T - Audit trail file is opened for tracing procedure
            calls. (Not available in evaluation version 1.6).
       /R - Row/Column mode for the X and Y coordinates input,
            format is: Y, X instead of X, Y as usual.
       /V - View only or read only mode.  Records can only be
            viewed, not modified.  Passwords cannot be viewed. 
            The /S option (Supervisory mode) overrides this flag. 
            If the Master Index file and the Screen file need a
            password, viewing cannot be done without knowing
            them.
       /U - User HyperText mode.  When this option is used, the
            last line in the xxxxxxxx.RTP file specifies the name
            of the screen to display as the entry screen.  With later
            versions of this program, imbedded programming language
            commands or menu commands may allow applications to be 
            built this way. (Not available in evaluation Version 1.6).
       /M - Inhibit the internal Master Index from being used.  This
            option is for the production version, when rebuilding a
            new database version, or for sidestepping the entry screen.
            (Not available with evaluation Version 1.6).
       /C - Custom version string.  The option: /Cxxxxxxx allows running
            this software with databases that had other version strings
            than the default version string.  Any data generated will 
            inherit this version string.  (Not available with evaluation
            Version 1.6).
       /A - Any version string.  The data generated with this option will
            work with any version of this software.  This is useful for 
            data intended for the public domain to be freely used.  (Not 
            available with evaluation Version 1.6).

The format of the Runtime parameter file (*.RTP) is:

       Keyboard input file if batch or demo modes
       Audit trail log file for keystrokes
       Demo mode flag (YES or NO)
       Process delay for delaying between fields (used in batch   
         mode to slow down processing so it can be viewed).
       Screen output flag (YES or NO)
       Sound output flag (YES or NO)
       Alternate escape character for SPRINTF().  This controls   
         the special format sequences.  For example: '%~s' is a   
         pointer to a pointer to a string variable in SPRINTF(). 
         The default character is: '~'.
       Master index file name
       Master index file password
       Screen file name
       Screen file password
       Monochrome VLT or color table, sixteen values that are the
         actual values sent to the screen when that color number
         is selected.
       CGA color table
       EGA/VGA color table
       LCD color table
       End of Line characters.  

End of Line characters description:

This is an array of eighteen character codes that are accepted as
the terminators for fields.  The following are given special
positional significance:

           Position 1 and 10: TAB character
           Position 2 and 11: BACKTAB character
           Position 3 and 12: End of Form
           Position 4 and 13: Carriage Return
           Position 5:        Tab-o-matic flag, set to non-zero,
                              denotes that the cursor should
                              advance to the next field if a
                              destructive character is typed in
                              the last position of the input
                              field.
           Position 6 and 15: Field above character - moves to
                              the field above
           Position 7 and 16: Field below character - moves to
                              the field below
           Position 8 and 17: Abort character, usually ESC

       The alternate positions are to allow non-printable or odd
       key combinations for batch input in forms.  Position 12    
       defaults to the grave accent or circumflex character, so   
       forms may be terminated in batch mode.

Passwords:

This program allows passwords on files.  Each entity associated
with that file inherits the password that protects the file.  A
blank password is not processed, and allows infinite access to
the data associated with the password.  A password, like all
other entities, has a record in the Master Index file.  To
protect shared data bases, each password has an internal or
hidden password associated with it.  When a database is shared
with others, the internal password is not known to everyone using
it, just the external password or the password key.  This
prevents people from taking the useful data generated by you and
using it for their programs.  The external password is 32
characters, and can be any character sequence, and is always case
sensitive.  The internal password is the same, but is encoded
into a form that is not readable by just glancing at it.  When
using a program, the external password must be known to use the
data, but to change the internal password, the current internal
password must be known.  Only someone in Supervisory mode can
view the password field of any record.  The option to change
a password in the main menu of the Song / Screen Generator program
allows new password records to be added, or existing passwords to
be changed.  Three tries are given for completing these
operations: external password search in Master Index file and the
validation attempts against the Master Index file record for the
file that the password protects.  Three tries are also given for
the internal password verification if the internal password is to
be changed.  This process can be confusing, but gets easier with
practice.  If the operator is one that can create a password, a
new password record will be created if the external key entered
is not in the Master Index file, and the operator desires to
create one (external passwords are all that are allowed at
program startup).  If the external key is one that exists in the
Master Index file, but is not valid for the given file, three
tries are given to get it right.  A chance is given to change the
internal password, after validation.   Of course, the old
internal password must be known in order to change the internal
password, and this feature gives this system an advantage over
conventional password processing; in order to change the true
password, the internal password must be known.  Everyone else can
know the external password key, but in order to change the
password that is stored, you must have more information.  One
level of passwords is insufficient in a system that is publicly
accessed because once someone knows the entry password, they can
change this password if desired (such as the UNIX system).  The
procedure that inputs the password is very versatile, and is used
in a different mode when a password is to be changed rather than
created.  This one feature gives PC-HyperText Architect an edge
over most other products in its category.

The Supervisory mode (/S option) requires a password that is
stored in the Master Index file.  Actual internal passwords
cannot be viewed unless the operator is in Supervisory mode.  A
blank password for a file cannot be changed unless the operator
is in Supervisory mode.  The basic idea behind the Supervisory
password is that each Master Index file generated should contain
a Supervisory password entered by the System Administrator, or
the one responsible for that file.  The Supervisory password is
different because the file name that the password protects is an
internal key (pass key), and can be specified to be unique for
different versions of the data this product generates (see the 
/K options).  This method will guarantee file security if the /K
option is specified when the Master Index file is created. The
unique pass key option (/K) provides a method of restricting the
access to any file's password records by allowing entry into the
system with only the pass key that was used when the Master Index
file was created.  The internal passwords that are generated will
be unique for different file names, because the file name (or
pass key for Supervisory passwords) is combined with the password
when the internal password is generated.  The encryption
algorithm is one that minimizes flukes of translation that
generate duplicate internal passwords.  Passwords should be some
sequence of characters that are unique and contain few duplicate
characters.  The same internal password typed from the keyboard
should generate a different internal password that is stored for
file names that are not the same, the operator may use their own
descretion about this choice (all passwords are deencrypted when
viewed in Supervisory mode).  When a new password is entered from
the main menu option 7, the file name the password protects has
to be a file that has a record in the Master Index file, or the
pass key entered when the Master Index file was created.  This
prevents any extraneous Supervisory passwords from being entered
into any Master Index file; they all must use the pass key
entered when the file was created.

File names and keys:

A file name is a upper or lower case string including path and
disk drive specifier, and they may be up to 32 characters long. 
These are kept internally in the Master Index file, but the name
is always accessed by the file name key.  The file name key is
internally generated by this program and consists of the body of
the file name and the extension concatenated together.  Remember
that any item name is case sensitive, so the case of file names
is critical when they are being entered.  An example of a file
name and the file key is:

     C:\PCSCEVAL\TEST.SCR

would have the following key:

     TESTSCR

blank filled.  This will be the key that this file name is to be
accessed with when the program runs.  Any file access uses this
key to find the actual name and associated information for this
physical data file.

If the file key generated is not in the user specified Master
Index file, but one that is in the control Master Index file
(e.g. PCSCR$$$.MDX), then the internal pass key for the control
Master Index file is requested before the operator can continue. 
This prevents unauthorized use of the system files.  The internal
pass key in the control Master Index file is checked when it is
opened to guarantee that the Song / Screen Generator program is
running with its own file.

This section describes the operation of the built-in full screen
editor in the Song / Screen Generator program:

       The keys on the keyboard that are active are:

       Ins  - Inserts a space at the cursor position
       Del  - Deletes the character under the cursor
       PgUp - Scrolls the information above the window down into
              the window (moves the window up)
       PgDn - Scrolls the information below the window up into
              the window (moves the window down)
       Home - Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line
       End  - Moves the cursor to the end of the line
       Right arrow - Moves the cursor one position to the right
              with wrap around to the left side of the screen.
       Left arrow  - Moves the cursor one position to the left
              with wrap around to the right side of the screen.
       Up arrow    - Moves the cursor up one position with wrap
              around to the bottom of the screen.
       Down arrow  - Moves the cursor down one position with wrap
              around to the top of the screen.
       Ctrl PgUp   - Deletes the line at the current cursor
              position.
       Ctrl PgDn   - Inserts a blank line at the current cursor
              position.
       Ctrl Right 
            Arrow  - Moves the cursor over to the next word to
              the right.
       Ctrl Left
            Arrow  - Moves the cursor over to the next word to
              the left.
       Enter       - Moves everything from the current cursor
              position to the right down to the next line, and
              puts a carriage return where the cursor was.
       Esc  - Exits the editor.  A prompt asks whether your work
              is to be saved.

     This editor is different from others in that the carriage
     return, or end of line character shows up in the source file
     as a little note character that you would see on a musical
     scale.  This allows lines with trailing blanks, and allows
     explicit placement of the end of line.  The limitations of
     this editor are:

               1) No way to merge two lines.
               2) No way to cut and paste.
               3) Mouse moves the cursor only.
               4) No search and replace.

     This is not a complete list, but improvement will come with
     later versions.

Known Idiosyncracies occurring in this Release:

  1) The mouse works with the HyperText screens and the data
     input screens (Option 5 on the main menu of the Batch Screen
     Builder), but not on the one line input prompts at the
     bottom of the screen, and menus.  The FLDPROC module was
     used for the one line input prompts, and these were not
     meant to have mouse support (the right button acts like
     ENTER since no checking for the type of line terminator is
     done in these procedures, and an ESC (mouse right button) is
     functionally the same as ENTER).  The data entry screen
     (Option 5) was implemented with the FORMPROC module of the
     PC-Applicator package (yet to be offically released),    
     and the mouse is fully supported for this module.  The
     MENUPROC module of the PC-Applicator package supports the
     mouse also, but none of the menus in the Batch Screen
     Builder were implemented with the MENUPROC.
  2) This program was designed to handle multiple screen files,
     but it can be a headache depending upon how the application
     is designed.  Imagine trying to build the screens for the
     Song / Screen Generator when the program itself requires the
     use of the screens it is building.  Please take care in
     backing up files that are known good, and copying them back
     into the working files before rerunning the Batch Screen     
     Builder, this will save much work.
  3) The error checking with this release is good and will be
     refined upon with time.  Sometimes an error is reported on a
     file, and the next operation to the file fails also. 
     Generally, retrying the operation will cure this problem.

The Song / Screen Generator utility may be used to build static windows of 
text in multiple colors with a command language resembling a text 
processor.  Highlighted areas on the screen may be designated as 
Hypertext buttons that activate other windows of static text.  
The HyperText feature is totally database driven.  
The link to the next screen is specified in the command language defining 
the window, not hardwired into any source code.  
Once screens are built with this utility program, 
user programs may take full advantage of the screen database.  
A full screen editor is built into the Batch Screen Builder program.  The 
PC-SCREEN Utilities and PC-HyperText Architect are described further 
from screens below.

The output of the Batch Screen Builder utility are two 
files: the Master Index File, and the Screen File.  The Master Index File 
contains the name, location, offset, length, create date, and update date of 
each screen built (among other things).  This file may contain records 
describing every item in an application program eventually 
(after the menu and form processors are released).  Songs may 
be written and stored in the screen file under a unique name and replayed 
anytime.  These songs may be played in the background, concurrent with
processing.  Windows that are drawn may overlap, and the area underneath them 
may be saved, and then restored after the window is no longer active.

The PC-HyperText Architect may be used to build: 
an off-line help system for any topic, 
a children's (or adult's) learning tool, 
a juke box for playing songs, among other things only limited by your 
imagination.  
The package comes complete with a method to traverse the databases 
that are generated with the Song / Screen Generator program.  There is no 
limitation (for all practical purposes) on the number of screens that may 
be built with the production version of the Song / Screen Generator program.  
The Song / Screen Generator program can build song records in Screen Files that 
may be replayed anytime.  The note's pitch and duration are easy to specify 
alongwith the tempo of the tune.

  14. For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far 
country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
  15. And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another 
one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took 
his journey.
  16. Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with 
the same, and made them other five talents.
  17. And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.
  18. But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and
hid his lord's money.
  19. After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and 
reckoneth with them.

  20. And so he that had received five talents came and brought other 
five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto five talents: behold, 
I have gained beside them five talents more.
  21. His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: 
thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over 
many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
  22. He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou 
deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents 
beside them.
  23. His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou 
hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many

  24. Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, 
I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not 
sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:
  25. And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, 
there thou hast is thine.
  26. His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful 
servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather 
where I have not strawed:
  27. Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, 
and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.
  28. Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which 
hath ten talents.
