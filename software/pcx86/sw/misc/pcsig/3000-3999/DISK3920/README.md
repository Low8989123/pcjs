The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or

The brand new PC-SIG World Of Windows is a must-have for Windows users.
In order to produce the best possible Windows collection PC-SIG has made
an alliance with the acclaimed Windows OnLine BBS. So not only do you have
access to the collecting and weeding out efforts for which PC-SIG is
famous, but also the huge volume of fonts and sound files and the in-depth
software reviews of the world's best Windows BBS.

This CD contains every one of the best Windows shareware programs
available, 350+ in all, over 900 TrueType fonts which can be used
without royalties, 429 ATM fonts, over 2,000 sound files in .WAV,
.VOC, .SND, .SOU, .MID format and 2,794 icons! A major computer
catalog is offering a collection of 250 fonts for $49.95. They have
great prices on hardware and software, but this time they can't
touch us.

As if the files aren't enough, we thought you would want to preview
and use these sounds, fonts, icons and programs directly from the CD,
without taking the time and space to unarchive them. So we have
included a font previewer and installed, a sound player and an icon
manager. Over 200 of the programs can be run simply by clicking on
them in the File Manager. Nobody else offers you anything close to
this type of access.

We're not done yet. In add to all the Windows riches described above,
this CD also contains the text and programs from the July-August
issue of Shareware Magazine. This is the second in a six-volume PC-SIG
Encyclopedia of Shareware CD-ROM series (Games was the first). Each
volume includes the programs from a section of the PC-SIG Library plus
all the text and every program from the current issue of Shareware
Magazine. Software reviews for this issue cover over 100 programs
including games, communications, printing, text editors and more. 124
of the programs mentioned in the magazine are included, plus 225
programs updated since the May-June issue.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

  artists then to just scan images into the computer. Some of the collections
  are cover screens from our Trivia Shell Game Collection. These cover screens
  came out so well that people have been asking us to make them into 
  collections for use with Picture Puzzle. A description of all the screens
  are as follows:

 		     History of Picture Puzzle Revisions

   Ver 1.3 
       -  Corrected Initial window that said Puzzle Program was unregistered.
       -  Fixed same screen that said it was a 15 Puzzle version. Its 13.
       -  Order Form now more clear about the Deluxe Version and what you get.

					Thank-you - Jacqueline Anderson

       -  After a file type has been specified (i.e *.GIF) then that file
           type will be the default till it is changed.
       -  Changing file type now uses overstrike instead of insert.
       -  The grid size, color, sound, etc is now remembered when the game
           is exited. Creates a file called pp.cfg on exit.

     What is a Puzzle program ?

          Puzzle programs are programs that load a graphics  picture  up on
     your computer screen and then scramble the picture for you to put back
     together.  Using  the  Mouse  or  the   keyboard,  you  will  have  an
     assortment of scrambled tiles on your screen  that you must place back
     into  the  correct place to rebuild the Picture. There are currently a
     lot of programs on the  market  today  that  do  this and they are all
     pretty  much the same in features, capabilities,  and  options.  After
     looking  at some of the features that where missing from all the other
     puzzle type programs I  decided  to  create a puzzle program which had
     them.

     What is Picture Puzzle ?

          Picture Puzzle is not just another puzzle program. Picture Puzzle
     is  different  in  many ways. Because I did not want the difficulty of
     the puzzle to be dependent on how complex the picture was I thought it
     would be nice to have you be able to select what size and shape puzzle
     you  would  like. So by using the arrow keys you can adjust the number
     of puzzle pieces from  4  all  the  way to 1400. When you build a very
     large puzzle some pictures will have pieces that  are  identical (i.e.
     Blue Sky, or Green Grass). Picture Puzzle has the ability to recognize
     this and will finish the  puzzle  as soon as you have the picture in a
     completed form, even if some of the pieces that are the same happen to
     be  mixed.  Picture  Puzzle  also recognizes when you have put a piece
     beside a piece it belongs  next  to and removes the grid between them.
     This will allow you to see the picture as it  is  being  built.  There
     are  many  many  more features in Picture Puzzle so read on, and enjoy
     the program !

     Installation

               Registered Version

                    If you have purchased the registered version of Picture
               Puzzle  just  run  the  install program that  comes  on  the
               program disk.

               UnRegistered Version

                    To  install  the unregistered version of Picture Puzzle
               you will have a file called  PPuzz12.exe. Take the following
               steps.

                         1) Create a Directory Called Puzzle
                         2) Copy PPuzz12.exe to this directory
                         3) Type PPuzz12.exe
                         4) erase PPuzz12.exe

                    PPuzz12.exe  is  a  self-extracting  file  which   will
               uncompress  all  of the files that are needed to run Picture
               Puzzle into this directory  for  you.  When you are finished
               you  can  erase the PPuzz12.exe program. (NOTE:  be  careful
               that you erase PPuzz12.exe and NOT Puzzle.exe).






     Mouse

          The  only  Mouse  that  is  supported  by  Picture  Puzzle is the
     Microsoft Mouse and driver.  Any  Mouse  that  is 100% compatible will
     work, however, you must be using the MicroSoft  driver  or use a mouse
     driver  that  is  100%  compatible  with the MicroSoft Mouse.  Picture
     Puzzle does not support the Mouse Systems mouse unless it is using the
     a MicroSoft  Mouse driver.  Problems with incompatible  mouse  drivers
     will  show up with the cursor being inversed, or the screen displaying
     erratic behavior with the movement of the mouse.


























     General Information

          Picture  Puzzle  was written  by  myself  (Dan  Linton)  and  the
     graphics puzzles where drawn by a friend of mine  and  a member of the
     Software  Creations  BBS,  Gary  Sirois. The Program was written using
     Turbo C++ from Borland  International  and the graphics user interface
     was developed using Island Systems graphics-MENU.

          Gary's Puzzles can all be recognized by the GLS logo that he puts
     on all his pictures. Gary developed all the puzzles using Deluxe Paint
     II and Deluxe Paint II  Enhanced.  The  digitized  pictures  that  you
     receive with more of Gary's Puzzles on the registered  copy where done
     using  my  RCA  video camera and the Computer Eyes Video Capture board
     from Digital Vision. These pictures where photographs that were either
     taken by Gary or my wife Ranele Linton.




     Puzzle Formats

          Picture Puzzle can load several types of Picture  formats.  There
     are  four  of them all together. (.PUZ .PCX .GIF .SAV).  Currently the
     program only supports one  resolution  picture and that is 640x350x16.
     That means any pictures that are 640 pixels wide  by  350  pixels high
     with 16 colors, and are in one of the above formats, can be loaded and
     used by Picture Puzzle.  In a later release to registered users I will
     incorporate  VGA  ability  (320x200x256)  and  SuperVGA  (640x480x256,
     800x600x256,  and  1024x768x256). So be sure and get on the registered
     list !



          PUZ Files

              Filenames that end with  the suffix .PUZ are puzzles that are
          stored  in  Picture Puzzle's own format. These  files  have  more
          information  in  them  than a standard PCX or GIF file would have
          and allow you to rescale  the picture into a small help window in
          the corner of the working puzzle screen. This  allows  you to see
          the  complete  picture  as well as what you are working on at the
          same time.  Kind of like  looking  at  the  picture on the puzzle
          box. You  will find that the PUZ files tend to be  a  bit  larger
          than  the  standard  PCX  and  GIF  type  files  due to the added
          information.

              These PUZ files are only  created  at Software Creations. You
          can  find  the  latest  ones on the Software  Creations  BBS  for
          download. Or  write to us for the full list of available PUZ file
          libraries.

















          PCX Files (tm)

              This is the most common  of  formats and was created by Zsoft
          corporation  for  use  with  their PC Paintbrush  program.   This
          format  is  in  wide  use  today among many programs and is also
          supported by Picture Puzzle.  There  are at least 6 different PCX
          formats in use and there may be more. Picture Puzzle handles most
          of  these  and  will  recognize  the  format it needs to use when
          loading the picture. As  with  the  other  file  formats  Picture
          Puzzle will check the resolution of the picture you are trying to
          load  to insure that it is one of the formats supported before it
          loads it.




          GIF Files (tm)

              This format pronounced  "JIF"  is  copyrighted  by Compuserve
          corporation  and stands for the Graphics Interchange  Format.  Of
          all  the formats here this tends to take the least disk space due
          to a compression technique  known  as the LZW algorithm and named
          after  the people who developed it. Picture Puzzle  does  support
          the  loading of GIF files, however, you must have another program
          in order to use it.  This  program  is  called  VPIC.exe  and  is
          distributed as another shareware product by Bob  Montgomery. VPIC
          is  not  distributed  with  the Picture Puzzle program but can be
          downloaded  from  most   BBS  systems,  Compuserve  and  Software
          Creations BBS. The minimum version should be Ver 2.1A. If Picture
          Puzzle  does not find a copy of Vpic.exe in the CURRENT DIRECTORY
          when you try to load a  GIF picture, then Picture Puzzle will not
          attempt to load the picture and will give you  a  warning that it
          could not find the vpic program.

              As of this writing the latest version of the VPIC.exe program
          can  be  found  in  a file  called  vpic40.zip  on  the  Software
          Creations BBS. You can register and obtain the  latest  copy from
          the author Bob Montgomery at the following address:

                              543 Via Fontana #203
                         Altamonte Springs, FL  32714-3172

















          SAV Files

              Because  Picture  Puzzle  has the ability to save the puzzles
          you are currently working  on  it  made sense to create a special
          format for saved puzzles. Not only can you  tell  that  it  is  a
          saved  puzzle but it allowed us to save just the information that
          is required to put you back where you left off, instead of saving
          the whole picture again.  This provides us with a tremendous disk
          space savings. Puzzles that take almost 100k of disk space can be
          saved in as little as 2.2k  of  space. Because we are saving just
          the changes and not the picture, SAV files do  require  that  you
          have  the  original picture still on the disk when you go to save
          it. So if you loaded a puzzle  called pooch.puz and then saved it
          as pooch.sav, when you go to load pooch.sav up  at  a later time,
          Picture  Puzzle  will still have to find pooch.puz on the disk to
          get the picture information that it did not save.


     Using the Menus

          There are three different  ways  of  using  the  Menus in Picture
     Puzzle.  You can select menu items with the Mouse by pointing  at  the
     item you would like. This will cause the item to either be selected or
     inversed depending on the  function  being  accessed. You can also use
     the keyboard to select items in one of two  ways.   Either  using  Hot
     Keys  (Items  which have the first letter of the name highlight) or by
     using the arrow keys to move a highlighted cursor bar over to the item
     you would like selected and hitting the enter key to select it.


     Loading Puzzles

          To load a Puzzle you must first select Load/Save on the Menu Bar.
     When  this window drops down you will be presented with three options,
     Load Puzzle, Save Puzzle,  View  Stats.  Select  Load  Puzzle  on  the
     vertical menu either with the mouse or the keyboard.  Loading a puzzle
     takes two steps, you must first give it the path you want to load from
     (The default is your current  directory),  and  then  the filename you
     would  like  to load. This can all be done  using  the  Mouse  or  the
     Keyboard.

          A window  will  pop  up on the screen that asks you to enter your
     filespec. What is a filespec? Well  what  the  program  is looking for
     here is the path you want to load the puzzle  from  and  any wildcards
     you  may  want  to  use  in  locating  the  puzzles  names.   It  will
     automatically put a default filespec in of "*.puz".


         This means that you want  to see all the files that end in .puz in
     the current directory. If you put A:\*.pcx, you  would get on the .pcx
     files  on  drive  A:.  Picture  Puzzle supports the DOS convention for
     wildcards. (I.E. " *.*" means all files, "?an.*" this means ignore the
     first letter and the suffix). To find out more  about  DOS wildcarding
     refer to the a good DOS book.

          If  the filespec entered cannot locate any files then you will be
     returned to the main menu. If it does locate the files, another window
     will pop up with the filename in it. This window  is  the  file window
     and  has  three  buttons located on it at the bottom.  These are Move,
     Esc, and Enter.




          Move - Will allow you  to  move  the  file  window  around on the
     screen while the left mouse button is being held  down.  The box
     around the window will move until the button is released and then the
     rest of the contents will be drawn.

          Esc - This will Escape you out to the main menu without selecting
     anything in the file selection window.

          Enter - Enter is the same as hitting the return  key. If you have
     selected any of the files with the keyboard and it is highlighted then
     the enter key will cause this selection to be accepted.

         If a filename is selected  which  is  not supported by the Picture
     Puzzle Program then a window will pop up letting  you  know  that this
     file  is  the  wrong  file  type. You will then be brought back to the
     filespec window with your  previous  filespec  still  in tack. At this
     point,  you  can  either  change your filespec  or  select  it  again.
     (Hopefully  this  time selecting a different file.) Note: This type of
     problem would only occur if you were use a wildcard specification that
     allowed you to see none supported Picture Puzzle files, like *.*.

     Saving Puzzles

          Saving a Puzzle that you have been working on  is  very  easy and
     quick.  Because  Picture  Puzzle only saves the changes that have been
     made to the puzzle and  not  the  whole  picture  again  it takes very
     little  disk  space  and  is  fast. To save the  puzzle,  just  select
     Load/Save  on  the  Menu Bar. When the vertical menu drops down select
     Save Puzzle. Picture Puzzle will pop up a window and try to guess what
     name you would like to save the puzzle to.  If you had loaded a Puzzle
     called  pooch.puz  and then tried to save it, Picture Puzzle would ask
     you if you would like to  save it as Pooch.sav. You can at this point,
     type  in a different name or accept the one Picture  Puzzle  selected.
     All  Puzzles  that get saved will be saved as .sav files.  Even if you
     type in a different name the program will make sure it ends with .sav.


          Once you have chosen  a  filename  and  accepted  it,  either  by
     hitting the enter key or hitting the left mouse  button  in  the  file
     window,  Picture Puzzle will check to see if that file already exists.
     If there is already a file  by that name then a Yes/No window will pop
     up asking you if you would like to overwrite  the file that is already
     there. Selecting  Yes will write the current puzzle over that file and
     anything that was in the  file  previous  to this will be lost! If you
     select No then Picture Puzzle will pop the filespec window back up and
     ask you for another path or name to save the Puzzle to.

          Once  you have loaded up a Puzzle, the program will keep track of
     whether or not you have  made  any changes to the screen. If you have,
     and you try and quit out of the program or  if  you  try  to  Select a
     different  Puzzle Size, the program will ask if you would like to save
     the Puzzle first. Otherwise,  if  you  select No, then all the changes
     made up to that point will be lost.
















     Resizing A Puzzle

          This is one of the best features in Picture Puzzle.  You can make
     the Puzzle any size and shape you want by selecting Resize Grid on the
     Grid Options Menu. This  can  also  be  done after the Puzzle has been
     loaded,  but this is like starting over because  the  Puzzle  will  be
     re-scrambled  from  scratch. If the program detects that you have made
     some moves and you are  attempting  to resize the Puzzle then you will
     be asked if you want to save the current Puzzle.

          Once you have selected this Option the screen will be cleared and
     white Grid on a Blue background will appear. The grid will be the size
     of the current Puzzle  you  are  working  on or the default size if no
     Puzzle has been loaded. You must now use your arrow keys to change the
     size  of  the Puzzle pieces. The Left and Right arrow keys will create
     more or less pieces across the screen while the Up and Down arrow keys
     will create more or less pieces from the top  to  the  bottom  of  the
     screen.

         Once  you  have  selected  the  size Puzzle you want, just hit the
     enter key to accept the  current  grid. If you have done this from the
     title screen and there is no Puzzle loaded then  you will be asked for
     a filespec  and  name  so  the  program  can  load the Puzzle.  If you
     selected this option while  a  Puzzle  was  already  loaded,  then the
     current Puzzle will be loaded to the new grid size.




     Picture Recognition

          Another feature that is unique to Picture Puzzle  is  its ability
     to  tell  when  you  have  the Puzzle done. Because you can resize the
     Puzzle to any size you  want,  and  because  you can load any .PCX and
     .GIF  files  that  are  around  (As  long as  they  have  the  correct
     resolution), you could end up creating a Puzzle that has tons of tiles
     that are all the same colors.  For  instance, what if you have put all
     the pieces together that are different and have  only  blue  sky tiles
     left  or lots of green grass tiles left. Well, Picture Puzzle can tell
     that these tiles are not  in the correct place, but the pieces that go
     there  are  the  same, so it will consider the  Puzzle  finished.  The
     program  will  only  do  this for pieces that are identical, and we do
     mean identical. If the  piece that belongs there and the current piece
     have only one dot that is different, Picture Puzzle will consider them
     as NOT being the same.






















     MColors


          MColors  is going to need some explaining. Picture Puzzle has the
     unique ability to be able  to  have  the Menu Bar pop up while you are
     working on the Puzzle. This makes it really easy to select things from
     the  Menu  Bar  with  the  Mouse while you are working on your Puzzle.
     Picture  Puzzle  also lets  you  load  any  Puzzles  with  any  colors
     whatsoever. Because each picture that is loaded can change  the  color
     palettes the Menu Bar uses, you could load a picture which uses colors
     that make it very hard  to  see  the  Menu Bars text, if at all. So by
     selecting  Mcolors  you  can cycle the Menu Bars  colors  through  the
     current  Palette  until you find colors that are to your liking. These
     colors will also be saved with the Puzzle if you save it to work on at
     a later time.

          MColors can be selected in several ways. The  first  is  just  to
     point  to  the  Label MColors on the Menu Bar and click the left Mouse
     Button. Each time you click on  the  MColors  label you will cycle the
     menu colors to the next set on the palette. This  can also be achieved
     by  using  the M key on the Keyboard. Each time the M key is typed the
     colors will also change.   That  is  because M is the HOT KEY for this
     selection on the Menu Bar. The third and final  method  for  selection
     would be to use the arrow keys to move the highlighted selector on the
     Menu Bar to the MColors  Label.   Just  passing  over  this label will
     cause it to change, so care should be taken not  to  pass through this
     selection  unless you want to change your menu colors. You can quickly
     cycle through the possible  menu  colors  by  using the right and left
     arrow keys to toggle back and forth over this selection.






     Grid Options

          Grid On/Off

               You  may  not  like using the grid in Picture  Puzzle  while
          working  on  building your picture. If this is the case, then you
          can shut it off by selecting "Grid Off" on the Grid Options menu.
          You may also want to just turn it off to help you locate a puzzle
          piece  that was harder to find with the grid covering some of the
          pattern. In either case you can  turn the Puzzles grid on and off
          as you like.

               If  you do not want to go to the bother of bringing  up  the
          Menu  Bar  and selecting On or Off under Grid Options you can use
          the F8 Function key to turn the Grid On and Off.













          Grid Colors

               Because different graphics  Pictures  use different palettes
          from which their colors are chosen, it is hard  to tell what grid
          colors  will  be  best  for that picture. You can change the grid
          color to something that  would  be  easier on your eyes and suits
          you better. Use the Grid Options Menu and select  "Colors".  Once
          you  have chosen this selection, each time you hit the left Mouse
          Button or type a key on the keyboard (other than the return key),
          the  Grid  color  will  cycle to the next color  in  the  current
          palette. Once  you  have  a  color  that you are happy with, just
          click on the right mouse  button  or  hit  the return key to keep
          that grid color, and go back to working on the Puzzle.

              If  you  do not want to go to the bother of bringing  up  the
          Menu Bar and selecting colors from the grid menu you can just use
          the F7 function key to cycle to the grid color you like.


          Grid CrossHair

              Each time you select a  tile  on  the  Puzzle Screen with the
          Mouse,  the tile you have selected is indicated  by  a  crosshair
          that  pops  up in that tile. If the piece you have selected is in
          the correct place then  the  tile  is  considered  locked and the
          program will not let you select it. So if you  select  a tile and
          do  not  get  the crosshair on it, that means you are not able to
          move that piece and must select another.  This can also happen if
          you have picked up a piece and are trying to  drop  it on a piece
          that  is  in the correct place. The program will not let you drop
          your tile on a piece that  is  in  the correct location. You will
          then have to select a different place to drop the tile.

             If you have selected a tile, indicated by the  crosshair being
          present  on  that piece, and you decide that is not the piece you
          want to move, just click  on  that  piece again and the crosshair
          will disappear indicating that the piece has  been dropped. There
          is  no  penalty for doing this and stats screen will not indicate
          that a move has been made.

             The Crosshair can also  be  made any color you like by hitting
          the F9 Function Key. Understand though that you  can  only change
          the  color of the Crosshair while it is visible, so you must have
          a tile selected to change  it.  This crosshair color will also be
          saved with the Puzzle if it is stored for later use.

     Help Windows

          There are two different modes of help in the  program. This makes
     for a wide variety of ways in which you can figure out how to get that
     Puzzle built. One of these  modes  however, Windowed Help, can only be
     used with PUZ files because of the information  those  files have that
     allow you to use that mode.














     Windowed Help

              This mode, when selected, will scale the Puzzle into a window
          in one of the four corners of the Puzzle screen. It allows you to
          see the complete picture of the Puzzle while  you  are looking at
          the screen you are working on. The window will be one quarter the
          size of the full screen  and  when it opens it will locate itself
          in the opposite corner from which you are working. It can tell by
          the  last move you made where it should relocate itself. Windowed
          help can also be selected  with  the F1 function key while on the
          Puzzle screen, but not the title screen. Windowed help only works
          with Puz files.



          Full Screen Help

              The full screen help I call Cheat Mode. This is really a give
          away. The entire Puzzle screen will be redrawn with all the tiles
          in their correct place so that you can see where  they  go.  This
          mode  I would suggest you use on only those real tough pieces. To
          use this mode just select  Help  on  the  Menu  Bar (While on the
          Puzzle Screen, NOT the Title Screen) and select Full Screen Help.
          Once  the  screen  has  been redrawn, just hit any key or a mouse
          button to continue. You  can  also  select  the  Full Screen Help
          using the F2 Function Key.



          Finding A Tile

              On some of the really big Puzzles it can be very hard finding
          a certain tile. Well, there is a way you can get help finding it,
          but it will cost you! If you select a tile and then hit the SHIFT
          F1, the tile that belongs where the tile you  have  selected  is,
          will  be  moved  there.   You  will  hear two double beeps in the
          speaker and it will be  counted as an incorrect move. (After all,
          we can't let you have credit for that one!).

             There is of course another variation to this. You can select a
          tile and hit ALT F1, and that will put the tile you have selected
          where it belongs. Again  you will get the double beep and receive
          NO credit for finding that tile. This can be  a  little confusing
          but once you get the hang of it, it is a very helpful feature for
          those tough ones. Just  remember,  once  you have selected a tile
          (the crosshair is on the tile), you are either going to move that
          tile where it belongs or move the tile that belongs there to that
          spot.


















     Function Keys

          The function keys can be  used  in place of the menus or hot keys
     while working on the Puzzle. They allow you to  select things a little
     faster  than  if  you have to pop up the menu, scroll to that function
     and then select it.  Not  everything can be selected from the function
     keys, just options that would be used while in a Puzzle.


          The function keys CANNOT be used while the Menu  Bars  are on the
     screen,  simply  because  they  have their own Hot Keys used to select
     items on the menu faster.  (The first letter of each word on the Menus
     is highlighted for this purpose). The Function Keys for Picture Puzzle
     have the following definitions.


               F1 - Windowed Help            F2 - Full Screen Help
               F3 - Sound Off/On             F4 - Load Picture
               F5 - Save Picture             F6 - Stats Window
               F7 - Grid Color               F8 - Grid On/Off
               F9 - Crosshair Color          F10 - Quit

               ALT F1 - Find Tile       SHIFT F1 - Place Tile


     Sound

          Sound in Picture Puzzle can be disabled or enabled. There will be
     one low beep that lets you know that you have disabled the sound. When
     the  sound  is  enabled  you  will get various  tones  throughout  the
     building of a Puzzle. These tones will become more familiar as you use
     the program.

          Scramble

              Scrambling will sound just  like  scrambling.  For every tile
          that is being placed on the screen a random sound  will be heard.
          No matter how big or small the Puzzle or the pieces, the range of
          the sound will be adjusted.

          Load

              During a load you will  again get a sound for every tile that
          is being placed on the screen. This time however,  the tones will
          be incremented up the scale as the pieces are being saved.


     Tile Correct

              This  is a very distinctive sound that starts low and goes to
          a higher frequency very quickly  to  let  you  know  that you
          have placed that tile in the correct place.

          Tile Locked

              This is a very quick double click to let you  know  that this
          piece  cannot  be  picked up or moved by placing another piece on
          the  top  of it. You will  also  know  from  the  fact  that  the
          crosshair will be visible in a tile that is in  the  proper place
          (Locked).





          Tile Moved

              This  is  a  single  click that lets you know the pieces have
          been moved or swapped  but  the  tile  that you picked up was NOT
          placed in the correct position. If the tile that  is  swapped out
          with the tile you selected lands in the proper place you will not
          get the Tile Correct  sound  because  it  was  not  the  tile you
          selected. It was just moved by the one you selected, and happened
          to move in the correct spot.

          Find A Tile

              Both  the  ALT F1 and the SHIFT F1 have a distinct sound.  It
          is a double beep that  is  quickly  evident.  If you are going to
          cheat we might as well tell the world !


     Viewing Your Stats

          The stats screen is a real handy thing to have  and can be popped
     up  on  the  screen  at any time, even before you load a Puzzle.  This
     screen will always let  you know where you are in the Building of your
     Puzzle. You get to the stats screen by selecting the Load/Save item on
     the  Menu  Bar at the top of the screen. You may have to use the right
     mouse button or the ESC  key  to pop the Menu Bar up. At the Bottom of
     the Load/Save vertical menu you will see View  Stats  (Sorry it was an
     afterthought!). When   the  window  comes  up  it  will  indicate  the
     following statistics:


          Puzzle Size:

              The Puzzle size is the number of pieces across as well as the
          number of pieces down. The default grid size is 16 x 7 which will
          give you 16 pieces across the Puzzle and 7 down.  That is a total
          of 112 pieces. You can have a Puzzle that is as small as 2 x 2 or
          as large as 40 x 35 which would give you a 1400 piece Puzzle.

          Number of Pieces:
              This  will show you how many pieces are in your  Puzzle.  The
          default  size  is  112 pieces. The grid can be adjusted to have a
          minimum of a 4 piece puzzle or a maximum of a 1400 piece puzzle.

          Moves to Finish:

              Indicates how many pieces are in the wrong place, which tells
          you how many moves it would take to finish. This,  of course, can
          be beat because you could put a piece in the correct location and
          may bump the piece that was there into its correct spot also.

          Total Moves:

              This is the total number of moves you have made on the Puzzle
          so far, including both Correct and In-Correct  moves. If you pick
          a piece  up  however, and drop it in the same place you picked it
          up, it is NOT considered a move.

          Correct Moves:

              Indicates how many pieces you have picked up and then
          dropped in the correct place.





          Incorrect Moves:

              Indicates how many pieces you have picked up and then
          dropped in the wrong place.

          Most times a single piece was moved:

              Keep your eye on this  statistic  as  it  may  surprise you !
          This will keep track of how many times you have  moved any single
          piece. The  program  will keep track of how many times each piece
          has been moved.  It then  uses  the  value for the piece that was
          moved the most. This does not indicate how many times a piece has
          been  moved  in a row, it indicates the most times a single piece
          has been moved.



          Number of times the help screen was used:

              This will track the number  of  times  that you have used the
          help function. Whether you use Windowed Help  or  the Full Screen
          help,  it  will be counted. It will not however, count the number
          of times you use the SHIFT F1 or the ALT F1 (Find A Tile).

          Number of times the Puzzle was saved:

              This indicates how many  times you have saved the Puzzle.  It
          is helpful when you work on the really large  Puzzles and want to
          know how many times you have come back to it.



     Command Line Options

          Picture  Puzzle  allows  you  to  select your Puzzle right on the
     command line if you prefer.  Just type the name of the Puzzle you want
     right after you type Puzzle to start the program.  Picture Puzzle will
     however,  bring  up  the  title screen first and then when you hit the
     return key it will proceed to load your Puzzle. The only limitation is
     that  it  will  be  the  default grid that is  used  unless  you  have
     specified  a  .SAV  Puzzle  which  will load whatever grid size it was
     saved with. All formats  will work in this manner, but be sure to give
     a valid Puzzle filename or the program will just  exit  when  it finds
     out  that  it  cannot  load  the Puzzle. The following are a couple of
     examples for loading a Puzzle from the commandline.

                 Puzzle pooch.puz     - Load the Pooch.Puz Puzzle
                 Puzzle hplane.gif    - Load the HydroPlane Puzzle


     Title Screen

          The title screen is the  first screen you will see when you start
     up Picture Puzzle. It will come up whether you have specified a Puzzle
     on the command line or not.

          You  will  see the title box for Picture Puzzle at the top of the
     screen and then a window will pop up below the title box with a scaled
     down version of one of the Puzzles in it. The  Puzzle  will  sit there
     and  scramble  itself  randomly into all different sizes until you hit
     the return key to move  on.  REMEMBER  however,  once  you  do hit the
     return key, give the Puzzle a chance to finish  scrambling  the screen
     that it is on !



          Next,  if  you  have  an  unregistered  copy  of Picture Puzzle a
     window, will pop up with  all  the  registration  information  in  it.
     Along with this window, at the top of the screen  will  be  a Menu Bar
     that  will  allow  you  to  select  where to go from here. A couple of
     things are different on  the  title screen Menu Bar than on the Puzzle
     Screen  Menu Bar. Those are the Info and Help  Selections.   The  Info
     Selection  drops down a menu that has all kinds of information screens
     about how Picture Puzzle was written, by whom it was developed, how to
     register,  how  Picture  Puzzle is supported,  and  a  special  thanks
     section. This  same  information  is  provided later in this manual in
     more detail. The Help selection  drops  a  window down that will allow
     you  to  select help on most any features and  modes  in  the  Picture
     Puzzle program.  This is the Online help section. If you have not read
     all of the sections in  this manual, or just need a refresher on a few
     things, that is the place to look.



     Puzzle Screen

          The Puzzle screen is used after a Puzzle has been loaded into the
     system  and  is  ready to be worked on. Like the title screen, you can
     pop up the Menu Bar and  select items with the mouse just like you did
     on the title screen. However, two of the selections  on  the  Menu Bar
     are  different  when  you  are  located  on the Puzzle screen.  On the
     Puzzle screen's Menu Bar  "Info"  has been changed to MColors (See the
     MColors section) and the "Help" selection still says help, but instead
     of  dropping  a vertical menu down that has parts of the manual in it,
     it now is used for getting the Windowed or Full screen help.

          Once you are on the Puzzle  screen  the Menu Bar can be popped up
     by clicking on the Right Mouse Button. Once  up,  a  selection  can be
     made  or  you  can just point to pieces of the puzzle and start moving
     them. The Menu Bar will know  when  it is supposed to go away.  If you
     click  on the Menu Bar in a place that does  not  select  any  of  the
     labels,  the  Menu  Bar will disappear and the tile underneath will be
     selected. If you find that this was  not  what you intended to do just
     click on the selected tile again and the move will be cancelled.

     Special Thanks

          You can't write a program like Picture Puzzle without having some
     people to thank. Without  these  people this program would have either
     taken a lot longer or not existed at all. They are as follows:

          Gary Sirois  (Pooch, Ski, Hplane, Swan, Lemond, etc, etc)

              Gary has done more than a fantastic job on all  of the Puzzle
          Pictures. This  allowed  me to release Picture Puzzle to you with
          all of our own original Pictures. Gary drew these Pictures all by
          hand using Deluxe Paint II and Deluxe Paint II  Enhanced.  If you
          have  an  interest  in using some of Gary's Graphics or his color
          clipart collection, he  can  be  found  on the Software Creations
          BBS. Gary has also created several disks full of great Puzzles.

          Nels Anderson  (Mah Jongg, Shooting Gallery, SuperFly, etc)

              I can't  count  the  times  Nels  has  given  me  advice  and
          encouragement.  In  writing  Shareware,  and with my own Software
          Creations BBS. Without  Nels  Software  Creations  would not have
          been where it is today. Nels is the Sysop of XEVIOUS, the support
          board  for his and Dick Olsen's software products. They have been
          producing quality software  now  for several years and supporting
          the  shareware  industry. You can try their programs  by  calling
          Xevious  at  (508)  875-3618.  Or  get  them  from  the  Software
          Creations BBS.


          Dick Olsen  (BassTour, Tikler, etc)

              Along with Nels, Dick gave  me  many tips, hints and pointers
          on putting out good Shareware. Dick's programs  are  of very high
          standards  and  are  among the first programs you should look for
          when trying to find quality software for your enjoyment.

          Samatha Anderson

              Samatha is the daughter  to  a very close friend of mine.  He
          mentioned to me one day that she really liked  playing  with  the
          mouse  on  his computer but didn't really have anything she could
          use it with that would  be  simple  for  her.  Thats  how Picture
          Puzzle got started.  Thank-You Sammi ! (Note: No Relation to Nels
          !)


















     Helpful Hints

       What are valid paths ?

          Here are some examples:

          C:\PPuzzle\Puzzles\*.puz

          Finds  all  the  puz files in the directory Puzzles from the root
          directory on drive C.

          If you are already in the  directory  PPuzzles  you can just type
          \Puzzles\*.puz and it will find them also.

          *.gif will locate all the gif files in the current
          directory.

       Resizing the Puzzle :

              If  you  have  loaded  and already scrambled the  Puzzle  but
          decided that you did not want that size, you can still change it.
          Before you make any moves  just  reselect  the Resize Grid Option
          again, select another size grid and reload the  puzzle.  This can
          be  done  as  many  times  as you want. It's better to reload and
          resize before you move any pieces on the screen, because you will
          just  loose those moves anyway unless you save  them  as  another
          Puzzle.


          Sometimes the grid can hide things

              You may notice while you are building a Puzzle that you think
          the picture is all done  and  the tiles that are left are all the
          same. If the grid did not remove itself from the screen  then the
          Puzzle  is  not  complete  yet.  There  are still pieces that are
          different.  The difference may be hidden under the grid.  You can
          select  the grid OFF option and look at the  tiles  again.   This
          will clearly indicate which of the pieces are different.

   ABOUT SHAREWARE...
   
   Shareware (also known as user supported software and other names) is a
   concept not understood by everyone.  The authors of Shareware retain all
   rights to the software under the copyright laws while still allowing
   free distribution.  This gives the user the chance to freely obtain and
   try out software to see if it fits his needs.  Shareware should not be
   confused with Public Domain software even though they are often obtained
   from the same sources.
   
   If you continue to use Shareware after trying it out, you are expected
   to register your use with the author and pay a registration fee.  What
   you get in return depends on the author, but may include a printed
   manual, free updates, telephone support, etc.  Only by paying for the
   Shareware you use do you enable the Shareware author to continue to
   support his software and create new programs.  Considering that the
   Shareware registration fees are almost always far less than the purchase
   price of comparable commercial software it's obvious that Shareware is a
   good deal for everyone.
   
   There are real advantages to you in the Shareware system.  You get to
   try out software to make sure it is compatible with your hardware and
   that it fits your needs before you "buy" it with your registration.
   The author saves the expense of advertising, packaging and distribution
   and passes the savings on to you.  Plus, most Shareware authors are
   much more accessible than commercial software sources so that your
   questions and suggestions are much more likely to be responded to.
   

                         Thank you for your support.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
