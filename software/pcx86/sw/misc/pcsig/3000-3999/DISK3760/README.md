DocuPower
*********
Powerful Macro System for 
Microsoft Word For Windows 

After you create Word for Windows documents, how do you find them?
You know they're on your hard drive, or on the LAN file server... 
somewhere. So you keep clicking through the "File Open" list box. 
If only you could remember the file name (click, click), or the directory
(click, click) - you might actually be able to get some work done! 

Give long, descriptive names to documents! 

DocuPower breaks the eight character DOS file name barrier. It's a 
powerful document management tool that makes it easy to organize and 
quickly access your work. Best of all, DocuPower integrates seamlessly
into WinWord. It's a quality macro system from Total System Solutions, 
the makers of the award winning Fileware macro collection.

Regardless of how you have your DOS directory structure organized 
(or disorganized), DocuPower  keeps all the files you need always 
on hand, immediately available.

If you create or use a document that you know youÆll come back to
again, just point and click to put it in a DocuPower "folder". Give
each folder a descriptive title, and keep related items grouped together 
in each folder. Every DocuPower item can be opened, inserted or printed. 

OPEN ANY FILE that you want to work on - just highlight its 
description. No need to search through directory after 
directory every time you need it.

INSERT THE CONTENTS of one document into another. This can be 
a very powerful tool for automated document assembly. 
Keep standard document components in separate files. 
Group similar elements together in each folder. Access these 
items in any order to compose complex, individualized 
documents in minutes.

PRINT A DOCUMENT without having to open it first - just by 
selecting its description.

DocuPower  crosses document management and office 
automation to turbo-charge Word for Windows. It's a  
valuable tool for word-smiths like attorneys, paralegals,
secretaries, writers - anyone whose job includes word processing. 

DocuPower is available now for only $24.95

DocuPower Pro  2.0
##################

After you create Word for Windows documents, how do you find them? You know
they're on your hard drive, or on the LAN file server... somewhere. If only 
you could remember the file name, or the directory - you might actually be 
able to get some work done.

DocuPower Pro  breaks the eight character DOS file name barrier! 

Give long, descriptive names to your documents - up to 45 characters long. 
DocuPower Pro is a total document management solution that makes it easy to 
quickly access your work. On stand-alone PCÆs as well as across networks, it 
can completely organize your documents. Best of all, it integrates seamlessly
into WinWord. 

Check Out These Incredible Features 
###################################

* Break the eight character DOS file name barrier. With DocuPower Pro you can 
  give your documents real, meaningful descriptions - up to 45 characters long! 

* Assign enhanced DocuPower Pro descriptions while maintaining your original 
  file names. YouÆll never misplace a file again. Use DocuPower Pro descriptions 
  for fast access, or, if you prefer, look at the regular path and file name.

* Get organized - itÆs fast and easy. Create an unlimited number of folders for 
  your documents, and give each folder its own descriptive title. 

* Each folder holds an unlimited number of document descriptions. Add as many as 
  you like, because theyÆll be displayed in alphabetical order. Simply touch the 
  keyboard to jump immediately to any part of the list.

* Lightning fast folder list display! See hundreds of files instantly.

* Toggle folder list displays instantly between DocuPower Pro document 
  descriptions and DOS file names.

* One file can appear in multiple folders simultaneously. This enables you to 
  organize the same material in different ways while avoiding version control 
  problems. 

* Because itÆs tightly integrated into Winword, DocuPower Pro will automatically 
  prompt you every time you save a new file. So youÆre never more than one 
  keystroke or mouse click away from adding your new work directly to a folder. 

* Sophisticated folder management allows you to create, rename, or delete entire 
  folders. Plus you can easily move documents from one folder to another. 

* Print single or multiple copies of a document directly from any folder - you donÆt 
  need to open the file first. 

* Print all documents in a folder with just one command.
 
* Fax documents directly from a folder.

* Insert the contents of one document into another. Clicking the "Insert" button 
  lets you perform automated document assembly.

* Integrated File Find and Text Search utilities find the files you need fast. 
  Select multiple entries from the list of files found. Open all selected files 
  at once, or add all selected files directly to any DocuPower Pro folder.

* Integrated file management functions enable you to make directories, copy, 
  rename, delete or move files. The file management window is easy and intuitive 
  to use - a dual list box with file names on the left, and your descriptions on 
  the right. Do it all without ever leaving Winword or DocuPower Pro. 

* Print a detailed folder status report. List document descriptions and file names 
  for all documents in any folder (or just list descriptions which have invalid file 
  paths). 

* Free DocuPower Pro Tool Kit includes powerful WinWord macro utilities: Close All 
  Open Files; Display Date On Menu; Exit Windows; Restart Windows; List All Files 
  In Directory; Run Program (Command Line); Windows System Status.

* Additional tool kits are available to meet specialized needs. The WriterÆs Tool 
  Kit includes the following utilities: Font Minder, Text Jumper, BookMark Lister, 
  Edit Templates, Open Most Recent Files, Print All Open Files, Compare Documents 
  and Winword INI Changer.

Danger! 
Beware of Conventional Document Management Systems 
##################################################

DocuPower Pro is unique. Because we do it all, and do it safely. All document 
management systems are not alike. To appreciate our revolutionary design, itÆs 
important to understand the dangers of conventional document management systems. 
These programs also allow you to assign descriptive names to your files. However, 
to keep track of what description goes with which file, they take control of your 
computer. First, they create their own DOS directories for your documents (for 
example C:\MEZ001A2). Next, they rename each file at the DOS level with their own 
proprietary file names, like L000310.DOC. Finally, the new directory structure and 
proprietary file names are indexed and tracked by their database engine.

And thatÆs the problem with conventional systems - they take too much control away from 
you. As long as your descriptive names are viewed from inside their program, everything 
is fine. But if you want to find a file on your own, youÆre out of luck. Just try 
figuring out what C:\MEZ001A2\L000310.DOC means!

This can be a real problem. If you need to copy directories or files to a diskette, 
youÆll be stuck. The names that the document management program assigns are totally 
meaningless to you. So using any file management program becomes impractical. 
Backing up your data also becomes either difficult or impossible. How can you back up 
your documents when you donÆt know where they are or what theyÆre named?  

We believe that the benefits offered by these programs are outweighed by the price you 
have to pay. ItÆs just never worth it to give up complete control of your system. 

DocuPower ProÆs Revolutionary Design
####################################

Unlike ordinary document management systems, DocuPower Pro enhances rather than 
replaces your existing directory structure and file names. YouÆll always have it 
both ways. Assign long, descriptive names to your documents. Retain your original 
directory structure and file names. DocuPower Pro puts you in complete control.
 
DocuPower Pro gives you the power you need to always be in charge of your documents. 
Try it yourself and see what it's like to always have your files at your fingertips.

Call Today!
###########

DocuPower Pro costs only $59.95 (hundreds less than other document management 
systems). It is optimized for use on stand-alone PCÆs as well as networks. 
(Discounted prices are available for site licenses). Your satisfaction is guaranteed. 
If you arenÆt completely happy with DocuPower Pro, we will promptly refund your money. 
A fully functioning demo is also available. We accept Visa, MasterCard and American 
Express. To order, or for more information call 718-375-2997.

FILEWARE 2.4
************
File Maintenance, Document Management
& Program Launching Macro Utilities 
For Microsoft Word For Windows 2.x

FILEWARE is an award winning suite of thirteen file maintenance, 
document management & program launching utilities which integrate 
seamlessly into Microsoft Word for Windows 2.x. It provides the many 
commonly requested features that Microsoft "forgot" to include. After 
auto-installation to the "File" or "Tools" menu, the Fileware system
is never more than a mouse click or keystroke away. NOW YOU CAN DO 
EVERYTHING YOU NEED WITHOUT EVER LEAVING WORD FOR WINDOWS...

FORGET FILE MANAGER. Make directories; delete, rename, copy or move files. 
Because it's integrated into WinWord, Fileware  is the easiest, safest way 
to manage files - on stand-alone PCÆs or over networks.

FORGET PROGRAM MANAGER. Launch programs instantly with "Run 
Buttons", a customizable toolbox of pushbuttons (or type a 
command on the convenient "Quick Run" line).

FORGET EIGHT CHARACTER DOS FILE NAMES. "Fast Files" keeps a 
customizable list of document descriptions close at hand. Just 
point and click to open the files you want.

FORGET COMPLICATED DIRECTORY PATHS. "Directory Jump" gives you 
pushbutton access to the directories you use the most. Just one 
click jumps you anywhere on your PC... or across your network.

ABOLISH REPETITIVE KEYSTROKES. Close all open files at the same 
time with just one command. Options include "Close Without Saving" 
& "Prompt To Save".

PROTECT YOUR CONFIDENTIAL DATA. "Word Lock" provides password 
protection for the complete Word for Windows application (not 
just certain files).

EDIT DOCUMENT TEMPLATES instantly even if you don't know which 
directory they're in.

EXIT WINDOWS when you're done working with just one click.

Fileware is a powerful yet inexpensive suite of utilities. 
It was chosen one of the "48 Best Add In" products by PC Magazine; 
PC Week says, "...adds a good selection of file and program management 
features that were left out of Word for Windows." In "Hacker's Guide to
Word for Windows" (Addison Wesley) Woody Leonhard (creator of WOPR)writes,
"...the system that Microsoft forgot...makes WinWord stand on its ear."

Please note: Fileware has been upgraded and enhanced. 
Its features now include:
