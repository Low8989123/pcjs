Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

The brand new PC-SIG World Of Windows is a must-have for Windows users.
In order to produce the best possible Windows collection PC-SIG has made
an alliance with the acclaimed Windows OnLine BBS. So not only do you have
access to the collecting and weeding out efforts for which PC-SIG is
famous, but also the huge volume of fonts and sound files and the in-depth
software reviews of the world's best Windows BBS.

This CD contains every one of the best Windows shareware programs
available, 350+ in all, over 900 TrueType fonts which can be used
without royalties, 429 ATM fonts, over 2,000 sound files in .WAV,
.VOC, .SND, .SOU, .MID format and 2,794 icons! A major computer
catalog is offering a collection of 250 fonts for $49.95. They have
great prices on hardware and software, but this time they can't
touch us.

As if the files aren't enough, we thought you would want to preview
and use these sounds, fonts, icons and programs directly from the CD,
without taking the time and space to unarchive them. So we have
included a font previewer and installed, a sound player and an icon
manager. Over 200 of the programs can be run simply by clicking on
them in the File Manager. Nobody else offers you anything close to
this type of access.

We're not done yet. In add to all the Windows riches described above,
this CD also contains the text and programs from the July-August
issue of Shareware Magazine. This is the second in a six-volume PC-SIG
Encyclopedia of Shareware CD-ROM series (Games was the first). Each
volume includes the programs from a section of the PC-SIG Library plus
all the text and every program from the current issue of Shareware
Magazine. Software reviews for this issue cover over 100 programs
including games, communications, printing, text editors and more. 124

                     DPMI USER DOCUMENTATION
                 Borland Pascal With Objects 7.0

This file documents the use of RTM.EXE, RTMRES.EXE, DPMI16BI.OVL,
DPMIINST.EXE and DPMILOAD.EXE is intended for redistribution
under the terms of the license statement accompanying this
product. 

Included is documentation about these topics:

  o Running a DOS Protected-Mode Program

  o What to do if Borland's DPMI server does not run on your
    system

  o How to set DOS environment variables that affect all
    protected-mode programs generated by Borland Pascal with
    Objects 7.0

  o Special notes for running under Windows

  o Controlling the amount of memory the run-time manager uses

  o Special note for Borland C++ and Paradox 4.0 users

================================================================
Running a DOS Protected-Mode Program
================================================================

When you run a DOS protected-mode application, you must ensure
that DPMI16BI.OVL (the DPMI server), RTM.EXE (the run-time
manager), and any DLLs used by the application are present in the
current directory, the same directory as the application, or on
the DOS path.


Protected Mode and Memory
-------------------------

A DOS protected-mode program uses DPMI (DOS Protected Mode
Interface) to run in protected mode which gives the application
access to all your computer's memory. With the exceptions
outlined below, the DOS protected-mode technology is completely
transparent and no extra steps are necessary in order to run a
protected-mode application.


DPMIINST

One such exception might be when you run a protected-mode program
for the very first time on a 286-based system. The protected mode
technology uses an internal database which contains various
machine characteristics to determine how to enable protected mode
operation on your system, and configures itself accordingly. If
you have a computer with an older 80286 microprocessor, your
system might not be recognized. You'll see this message when you
try to run a protected-mode application:

  Machine not in database (RUN DPMIINST)

If you get this message, simply run the DPMIINST program by
typing DPMIINST at the DOS prompt and following the program's
instructions.

DPMIINST runs your machine through a series of tests to determine
the best way of enabling protected mode, and automatically
configures accordingly. Once you have run DPMIINST, you won't
have to run it again.

Some memory managers, device drivers, and memory-resident (TSR)
programs can interfere with DPMIINST's ability to analyze your
system. If DPMIINST fails, try temporarily disabling or removing
these programs. That gives DPMIINST the unrestricted access it
needs to determine the best way to enter protected mode.

Note that running DPMIINST.EXE will never be required on any
system running HIMEM (or equivalent) or on any system based on
an 80386 (or later) processor.


DPMIMEM

By default, the DPMI interface allocates all available extended
memory for its own use. If you don't want all of the available
memory to be taken by the DPMI kernel, you can set a DOS
environment variable to specify the maximum amount of memory to
use. This variable can be entered directly at the DOS prompt or
inserted in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, using this syntax:

  SET DPMIMEM=MAXMEM nnnn

where nnnn is the amount of memory in kilobytes.

For example, if you have a system with 4MB and want the DPMI
kernel to use only 2MB of it, leaving the other 2MB alone, the
DPMIMEM variable would be set as follows:

  SET DPMIMEM=MAXMEM 2048

Some memory managers, like QEMM or 386^Max, allow allocating the
same area of memory as either extended or expanded and many older
applications can use only expanded memmory (EMS). By using the
DPMIMEM DOS environment variable to limit the amount of extended
memory used by the DPMI server, your system will still have
expanded memory available for use by older applications.


RTMRES

RTMRES preloads the protected-mode system. Preloading the DPMI
server lets you load a protected-mode program slightly faster.
RTMRES will start a program if you specify a program name as a
parameter. If no parameter is specified, RTMRES will run a DOS
shell. Type EXIT to close the shell.

RTMRES is especially useful if you start, exit, and start a
protected-mode program frequently. Normally, every time you run a
protected-mode application, the DPMI server is loaded. If you've
run RTMRES previously, the server is already present, and the
protected-mode application loads faster.


EXTENDED MEMORY

A protected-mode application interacts with the DPMI server
through Borland's run-time manager (RTM.EXE). By default, a
protected-mode application uses all the extended memory reserved
by the DPMI kernel.


================================================================
Running A DOS Protected-Mode Program from Windows
================================================================

A DOS protected-mode program will run in Windows in 386 enhanced
mode. To configure the amount of memory available to the
application, create a Windows PIF file. To learn more about PIF
files, see your Microsoft Windows User's Guide.


Running Your Program in Windows Standard Mode
---------------------------------------------

In order to run a protected-mode program from Windows
standard-mode, you must set the DPMIMEM DOS environment variable
and run RTMRES (both are described above) before running Windows.
Make sure your DPMIMEM setting leaves enough physical memory for
Windows to operate.

Note that once you've run RTMRES, you won't be able to run
Windows in 386 enhanced mode until you exit the RTMRES shell (by
typing EXIT at a DOS prompt).


Running from a Windows DOS Prompt
---------------------------------

To run a DOS protected-mode application from a Windows DOS
prompt, you must first modify the DOSPRMPT.PIF file found in your
Windows directory so that the protected-mode program will be able
to use extended memory.

Using the Windows PIF editor, open the DOSPRMPT.PIF file, and
indicate the amount of extended memory you want the
protected-mode program to use. If you are unsure how to use the
PIF editor, see your Microsoft Windows User's Guide.


================================================================
Controlling the Amount of Memory the Run-Time Manager Uses
================================================================

The run-time manager attempts to free as much conventional memory
as possible (by moving moveable memory blocks into extended
memory, for example) before starting an application. No attempt
is made to release extended memory, however. Therefore, if you
are going to run other protected-mode applications that don't use
the run-time manager (Paradox 4.0, for example), use the RTM DOS
environment variable to control the run-time manager's allocation
of memory.

Use the DOS command line to add the RTM environment variable to
your system's DOS environment. Here is the syntax:

  SET RTM=[option nnnn]

The following table lists the options you can use. nnnn can be a
decimal number or a hex number in the form of xAB54 or xab54.

   Option          Description
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   EXTLEAVE nnnn   Always leave at least nnnn kilobytes of
                   extended memory available. The default value
                   is 640K.

   EXTMAX nnnn     Don't allocate more than nnnn kilobytes of
                   extended memory. The default value is 4
                   gigabytes. In Windows, the default value is
                   one-half the available memory.

   EXTMIN nnnn     If fewer than nnnn kilobytes are available
                   after applying EXTMAX and EXTLEAVE limits,
                   terminate with an Out of Memory message. The
                   default value is zero.

   REALLEAVE nnnn  Always leave at least nnnn paragraphs of real
                   memory available. The default value is 64K or
                   4096 paragraphs.

   REALMAX nnnn    Don't allocate more than nnnn paragraphs of
                   real memory. The default value is 1 megabyte
                   or 65,535 paragraphs.

   REALMIN nnnn   If fewer than nnnn paragraphs are available
                  after applying REALMAX and REALLEAVE, terminate
                  with an Out of Memory message. The default
                  value is zero.

The following DOS command limits RTM to 2M bytes of extended
memory, and ensures that 128K bytes of real memory are left
unallocated:

  SET RTM=EXTMAX 2048 REALLEAVE 8192


================================================================
Important Note for Borland C++ and Paradox 4.0 Users
================================================================

The DPMILOAD.EXE and DPMI16BI.OVL files provided in this package
replace the older ones that came with Paradox 4.0 and BC++ 3.0 or
later. Delete or rename the older versions and make sure the
newer ones are on your DOS path (both Paradox and BC will search
the path and find the newer versions).

If you plan to shell out from Paradox or BC++ to run another
protected-mode application, first limit the amount of extended
memory used by Paradox or BC++. For Paradox, use its /extk
command-line parameter; and for BC++, use its /x command-line
parameter. Refer to the Paradox or BC++ documentation for more
information on the use of command-line options.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
