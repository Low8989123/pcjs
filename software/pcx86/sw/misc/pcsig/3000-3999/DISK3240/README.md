                             (1.0)


                  Programed by William Soleau
                    Version 1.0   (c) 1992

                Requirements: EGA and Brain Power
                              Hard Disk Recommended

    Welcome to Alpha Man.  This game will test your problem solving
    abilities, as you try to solve 25 word puzzles.


                             OBJECTIVE

    The object of the game is quite simple. Each puzzle has the
    letters for the word located somewhere on the 7 x 11 grid
    board.  Each letter is contained in a block which when pushed
    by your man, (Alpha Man), it will slide in that direction until
    it either hits the side of the grid board or another block.
    The object is to push all these letter blocks onto the
    corresponding letters that are located somewhere else on the
    game board.


                       PERSONAL SCORE CARDS

    When playing the game for the first time, the program will ask
    you to create your own personal score card.  There can be up to
    five individual player cards.  These personal score cards will
    keep track of your number of moves, number of attempts, for each
    word puzzle.  When you solve a puzzle, it will be recorded as
    *SOLVED* on your score card.  If you have solved that puzzle
    with the least amount of moves on record, then your initials and
    scores for that word puzzle will be entered on the Best Scores
    List.



                    ALPHA MAN & THE MASTER BLOCK


    You control Alpha Man using the arrow keys.  There is one Green
    Block called the Master Block for each puzzle.  This block does
    not slide when pushed, it will move only one grid at a time when
    pushed by Alpha Man. This Master Block can be positioned so that
    the letter blocks, when pushed, will slide into it and can then be
    strategically positioned into the right places on the grid board.

    The concept is very easy, yet the actual solving of each puzzle
    is quite difficult as you will soon discover.





                  KEYS & SOLUTIONS & TAKE BACK MOVE


    To get you started, I have provided the solutions to the first 5
    puzzle words.  If you select one of the first 5 words, you can see
    Alpha Man solve the puzzle for you by pressing the s<O>lution
    button.  However some might consider this cheating, but perhaps by
    maybe letting Alpha Man solve puzzle #1, you can see how the game
    is played.  I have also included a take back move for those times
    when you make a mistake that make the puzzle impossible to solve.
    This take back move records only the last move made, so if you make
    a mistake and want to take back your last move, then immediately
    push the <T>ake back key.  This too, could be called cheating but
    it's up to you whether or not you want to use it.



    All the Key Definitions are shown on the screen at all times.
    They are as follows:
