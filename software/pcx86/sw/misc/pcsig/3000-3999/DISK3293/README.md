Disk No             Title: The Stock Trader     Version 7.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      The Stock Trader is a menu driven program tracking stock performance
      and generating buy and sell signals according to the technical market
      indicators, placed in the program by the user, for each stock.

      The program generates a high quality 100 day graph with recommendations
      for trading the stock, futures, or mutual fund equity. There are 3
      stocks at the start for demo purposes. Stocks may be added, deleted,
      updated and graphed.

      Version 7.0 adds an entirely new feature - a stock importing
      module.  This can import stock quotes from Compuserve, Prodigy,
      and any quotes service that supplies the user with and ASCII file.
      Registration activates the Stock Portfolio Manager.
