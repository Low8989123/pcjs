PC-SIG UPDATES PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM

For Immediate Release


PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM UPDATED TO INCLUDE A NEW USER INTERFACE AND MORE
THAN 800 MB OF PROGRAMS June 21, 1992, SUNNYVALE, CALIF. - PC-SIG, Inc.
today announced availability of The Eleventh Edition of the PC-SIG Library
on CD-ROM.  The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM contains over 800 megabytes of
shareware and includes more than 300 new programs, 550 updated programs,
and the addition of 75 megabytes of Windows 3.x shareware.  The
user-interface has been completely re-engineered to take advantage of the
HyperWriter! hypermedia and multimedia authoring system from NTERGAID, Inc.

The implementation of HyperWriter! provides significant performance and
ease of use enhancements.  Programs can access and download much faster
than with previous editions.  Programs have been reorganized and indexed
for better referencing.  Users just c lick with a mouse, or point with the
cursor, on a program name to see a complete description of the program.
Downloading or copying a program is handled automatically by HyperWriter!
Addition of a preview option is especially important for anyone who uses
images, icons, or fonts.  "You can preview the whole library of images to
find the right one," according to Bruce Kent, product development manager.
"This CD finally makes it possi ble to conserve your disk space and paper,
yet still have all the information you need to make an informed decision,"
said Kent.

All new and updated programs have been reviewed and tested by PC-SIG. Every
program goes through extensive virus checking using the most recent version
of VIRUSCAN from McAfee Associates, and other anti-virus software.
According to Kent, "In the ten ye ars we've distributed shareware, we have
never had a confirmed report of a virus on any of our distributed programs
or CD-ROMs."

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, Eleventh Edition has a list price of $179.

Upgrades from previous editions are available for $99.

Users of PC-SIG's Essential Home & Business Collection CD-ROM can upgrade
for $120.

PC-SIG CD-ROMs are distributed worldwide through a network of distributors
and resellers. Based in Sunnyvale, Calif., PC-SIG, Inc. markets and
supports one of the world's largest collections of shareware for IBM PCs
and compatible systems.  PC-SIG also publishes Shareware Magazine, which is
devoted solely to shareware.  The magazine is availa ble by subscription
and on newsstands nationwide.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

Returns: Varies with type field.
Errors: Varies with type field.



WINDOSIO TYPES(first argument to WinDosIO)



WD_DESTROY
Example: WinDosIO(WD_DESTROY,hInstance,0);

This function must be called from the WM_CLOSE handler in the main window procedure, to insure proper surrender of all resources to Windows. It can optionally be called as the last line of the program, if the window should not persist until the user clicks on the close icon. 

Returns: Nothing



WD_GETERRNO
Example: WinDosIO(WD_GETERRNO,0,0);

This function returns the last value of WDErrno as set by the WinDosIO C functions. This value will be overwritten anytime a WinDosIO C function is called. 

Returns: WDErrno (For values, see below)



WD_INIT
Example: WinDosIO(WD_INIT,hInstance,0);

This function must be called prior to using the WinDosIO library. Functions will set WDErrno to WDE_UNINITIALIZED if this function has not been called. It is called with the instance handle of the application. If WinDosIO.c is compiled and linked with the application, this function is called automatically.

Returns: Nothing



WD_SELECT
Example: WinDosIO(WD_SELECT,hwndTermIO,0);

This function selects the termIO window whose handle 		(returned, for instance, from CreateWindow) is specified , to have both the input and output focus.

Returns: WDE_HANDLE_OUT_OF_RANGE, WDE_UNINITIALIZED



WD_GET_HANDLE
Example: WinDOsIO(WD_GET_HANDLE,0,0);

Returns: The handle to the termIO window.



WD_GET_HDC
Example: HDC hdc = WinDosIO(WD_GET_HDC,0,0)

Returns the device context used internally by the termIO window to insure persistent output. With this device context and the screen device context obtained from the window handle, applications can use any Windows functions to write to the termIO window.

Returns: The handle to the termIO windows device context.



WD_REGISTER_WINDOW
Example: WinDosIO(WD_REGISTER_WINDOW,hPrevInstance,0);

This function registers a main (not a termIO) window for the application. If you register your own main window, you must also write at least a minimal window procedure to be compatible with WinDosIO. If you compile and link with WinDosIO.c, this function will be called automatically.



WD_CREATE_CHILD_WINDOW
Example: HWND hwnd  = WinDosIO(WD_CREATE_CHILD_WINDOW, 0, &cws);

This function creates a termIO window with the left, top, right and bottom specified in the CWS structure. You can create your own termIO window with Windows CreateWindow. If you compile and link with WinDosIO.c, your first termIO window is created automatically for you to the largest size that will fit within the main window.

Returns: The handle of the created child window.



WD_CREATE_MAIN_WINDOW
Example: HWND hwndMain = WinDosIO(WD_CREATE_MAIN_WINDOW, cmdshow, (long)((LPSTR)"My Graphics Program"));

Create the main window previously registered with WD_REGISTER_WINDOW. If you use CreateWindow to create the main window , create a window of the class WinDosIO, unless you also used Window's RegisterWindow  to register the main window, in which case at least the minimal window proc is required.



WD_SETTITLE
Example: WinDosIO(WD_SETTITLE,0,(long)((LPSTR)"My Title"));

Sets the title of the current termIO window to the specified string.



WD_DEFERPAINT
Example: WinDosIO(WD_DEFERPAINT,TRUE,0);

Defers painting to the screen device context until painting is turned back on with a call to the same function with FALSE as the second argument. At that time, the entire screen is painted from the internal device context.





WINDOSIO ERRORS

The following errors are supported in version 2.0. They are either returned directly or returned from WinDosIO(WD_GETERRNO,0,0), depending on function.

TERMIO STYLES

Styles are or'd in with WS_ window styles in such calls as CreateWindow.
Mneumonic                      	Value


WDS_SELECT			1L

This style allows a termIO window to gain the input and output focus if clicked on with the left button of the mouse.
