educational. Young children will love it!

Long description:
Crayon Box is a computer coloring and sketch book and learning tool for 
young children.  Over 450 different colors and patterns can be used to 
paint different nature scene drawings, or drawings that the child 
creates.  In addition, Crayon Box tests the child's math,  counting, 
and color identification skills. The math feature displays large 1" 
high numbers and prompts the child for answers.  10 different skill 
levels from easy (2+3=?) to difficult (45x13=?). The counting and color  
identification feature displays a screen of randomly numbered and 
randomly colored marbles.  The child must identify and count the number 
of each group when prompted. Spirographs can be created which can 
likewise be painted on the screen.  Very easy user interface (with 
large colorful point and click buttons) makes Crayon Box simple and fun 
to use.
