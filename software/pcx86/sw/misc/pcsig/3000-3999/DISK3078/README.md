ABC'S is an educational program to help children in preschool or        
kindergarten learn the letters of the alphabet.  Eight simple games are 
on this disk.  These include matching a letter to its lower or upper    
case form, typing in the letter that appears on the screen to           
familiarize children with the keyboard, and selecting a missing letter  
in a sequence of three letters.  Other games consist of typing in a     
letter and a picture related to that letter will appear, or matching a  
letter to a picture that appears on the screen.  Simple music is        
included for entertainment.  In ABC'S Keyboard input has been made as   
simple as possible for young children.

Thanks for trying out TeachABC's V1.0 by Logical Thought
Software.

This program was created using Turbo PascalV6.0.  A better
version using Grasp V4.0 with digitized speech, graphics for each
letter, and soundblaster music is in the works.  I also am
working on a program I call Grid Paint.  It allows kids to
construct pictures using "blocks" or triangles, squares, circles,
diagonals, birds, fences, etc.  Allows sixteen colors and
requires VGA graphics.  I also have a spelling program called
Spell Wizard V1.0 that displays a picture, says the word,
and shows the number of letters to spell the word.  Will include
a help button to encourage kids to keep progressing.  So far it
includes 20 pictures of 3 to 5 letter words.  Requires VGA
graphics and a Soundblaster board.  I am also working on a
program that teaches the time.  Write about these programs if you
are interested in receiving them when they are completed.

To run TeachABC's V1.0, type teachabc <enter>.

Hints:

To bypass the opening screen, press any key.

To turn the sound off or on in the main screen press the F10 key.

Press F1 key to show where the letter's key is located. 

After two presses of the wrong key, the screen will show the
location of the correct key.


My philosophy is to keep my program's cost as low as a paperback
book.  Therefore, I will usually charge from $5 to $8.  To
register this program, send $5.00 to:

Everyone that registers has the opportunity to receive the source
code to this program also.  Please indicate this on your request.
