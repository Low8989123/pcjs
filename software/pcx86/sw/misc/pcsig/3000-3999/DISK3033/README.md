Disk Title: DOS-Joke                                                    
PC-SIG Version: S1                                                      
                                                                        
Program Title: DOS-Joke                                                 
Author Version: 1.7                                                     
Author Registration: $14.90                                             
Special Requirements: Graphics monitor (EGA/VGA recommended). Hard drive
                                                                        
It sure looks like a usual computer with the DOS "C:" prompt on the     
screen, but it sounds as if it has flatulence! This is no normal        
computer; it's a computer with DOS-JOKE installed. Once you run         
DOS-JOKE, it displays the standard DOS prompt, but it's ready for fun.  
As with other DOS prompt practical joke programs, it displays           
smart-aleck remarks when the user types something in. DOS-JOKE is unique
because it uses your built-in speaker to also "speak" the jokes. It     
includes remarks, music, noises (a phone ringing), and noises of a      
deeply personal nature-but those are probably the things that practical 
jokers enjoy the most. You can even set it to go off at regular         
intervals during your absence. It's a wacky program, but be warned that 
some people may be offended by some of its actions. You have to decide  
if that's good or bad.
