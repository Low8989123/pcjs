Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,

Update Your Mailing List Using The NCOA On Disk
by Scott M. Olmsted, Nuts & Bolts Software

Are you a small business with a mailing list maintained on a desktop PC? If so, you know it takes work to maintain your list: purging bad addresses, entering forwarding addresses, and so forth. Up to 20% of the U.S. population moves every year, and a mailing list can go "stale" very quickly, increasing the cost of reaching each prospect.

How much would it be worth to you to receive address correction and ZIP+4 for your list without the time and cost of manual data entry? Almost any reasonable numbers for printing, postage, and data entry costs will yield a value of several cents per name in your list. And yet, though it is little known among small business owners, there is such a service available for $7.00 per 1000 names. That's less than one cent per name!

The information is supplied by the National Change Of Address Center (NCOA), a part of the US Postal Service. The services are actually provided by a dozen or so vendors under license to the NCOA. While most NCOA users are large mailers that supply their lists on magnetic tape, one vendor provides the service on floppy disks.

To use the service, you send your mailing list on disk in a fixed-field format. The NCOA vendor returns your disks accompanied by additional disks. On these they write your original fields, plus an additional 470 characters in 24 fields. Included is a standardized version with ZIP+4 of the address you supplied, a forwarding address if one is on file, and several flags with information about these addresses. It is left to you to combine all this information into a form you can use.

This is more complex and time-consuming than most small businesses can handle. That is why Nuts & Bolts Software has created a shareware product to do it all for you. With EZ-NCOA, you merely export your mailing list in comma-delimited ASCII format. From this file EZ-NCOA creates the disks you send to the NCOA. EZ-NCOA then reads the disks returned by the NCOA, and creates a new comma-delimited ASCII file for you to import into your mailing list.

You need do no programming, nor figure out any complex file formats. EZ-NCOA preserves all the non-address fields in your list and makes using the NCOA a breeze. In addition, EZ-NCOA can make the results more attractive. The NCOA supplies all addresses in upper case only because the Postal Service prefers this. Upper case is easier for their automated mail sorters to read. The registered version of EZ-NCOA can convert addresses to upper and lower case if that is what you prefer.

What kind of results can you expect? While the NCOA does not have a forwarding address for every move, our experience is that you can obtain 70% to 90% of those that have been filed by the addressee. The older your list, the more valuable the NCOA service becomes; however, even a list that has not been corrected for only six months can be cost-effective to process. In addition, every invalid address can be removed from your list and ZIP+4 added to all addresses. For mailers adding barcodes, the NCOA is now supplying the extra two "Delivery Digits" needed to qualify for barcoding discounts after March 21, 1993.

A registered copy of EZ-NCOA is available from Nuts & Bolts Software, 1324 Calle Scott, Encinitas CA 92024, (619) 942-9692, for $55.00 plus $4.00 shipping and handling ($5.00 Canada and $8.00 outside North America).

    1. Introduction                                               Page 1
    ===============
    EZ-NCOA is a software product for IBM PC's and compatibles
    that is used to send mailing lists to the National Change of Address
    Center (NCOA) on diskette. The services provided by the NCOA include
    supplying forwarding addresses on file, standardizing addresses, and 
    adding ZIP+4 and Carrier Route codes. 
    
    The NCOA is a part of the U.S. Postal Service and contracts with a
    dozen or more vendors to supply NCOA services to mailers. While all
    large mailers use these services, they do so using 9-track tape as
    the medium. One vendor has a contract to supply these services on
    diskette. While the formats that the NCOA vendor uses to accept and
    return data are not complex, in practice it is difficult to combine
    the information supplied by the NCOA with an existing mailing list.
    In general, it is a job for a database programmer--unless you have
    EZ-NCOA.
    
    EZ-NCOA handles all the details of preparing diskettes to
    send and reading the diskettes received. All you do is export your
    mailing list in a standard format (comma-delimited ASCII text) from
    whatever database or mailing list program you are using and run
    EZ-NCOA. Then send the diskettes produced to the NCOA vendor 
    and wait for their return. When the NCOA returns your diskettes, run
    EZ-NCOA again, then import the standardized and updated list
    into your database or mailing list program. That's all!
    
    What Will This Shareware Version Of EZ-NCOA Do For Me?
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    With this version, you are able to create a new version of your list
    from which records with invalid addresses have been removed, and
    which has forwarding addresses substituted where appropriate. All
    names and addresses will be in upper case (the NCOA supplies only
    upper case). ZIP codes are regular five digit ZIP or ZIP followed by
    ZIP+4, separated by a dash.
    
    What Will The Registered Version Of EZ-NCOA Do For Me?
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    With a registered version of EZ-NCOA you can retain all records and
    can retrieve flags indicating whether an address is invalid or has
    been replaced by a forwarding address. You can retrieve ZIP+4,
    carrier routes, and "Nixie" flags, which indicate close but not
    exact matches to the change of address file. And, you can have
    EZ-NCOA convert names and addresses to upper and lower case. If you
    have sent a job to NCOA with the unregistered version, you need NOT
    resend your job to the NCOA to process it with the registered version
    as long as you save the SOURCE file you created or are able to create
    another SOURCE file with names in the exact same order.
    
    How Do I Register?
    ------------------
    Run EZ-NCOA and choose the Register option. At the Register
    screen, hit the HOME key. EZ-NCOA will create a file called
    "invoice.txt". Print this file and send with the registration fee,
    plus shipping, to Nuts & Bolts Software, or give it to your Accounts
    Payable Department for payment.
    2. How Does EZ-NCOA Work?                              Page 2
    ================================
    EZ-NCOA is an enhanced and specialized file format converter.
    It converts your mailing list to a format understood by the NCOA and
    converts the NCOA output back into a form understood by your
    database or mailing list program.
    
     ----------                 ---------                     --------
    |          |               |         |                   |        |
    | Database | -> SOURCE --> |         | -> NCOA INPUT --> |        |
    |    or    |     File      | EZ-NCOA |       File        |  NCOA  |
    | Mailing  |               |         |                   | Vendor |
    |   List   | <- FORWARD <- |         | <- NCOA OUTPUT <- |        |
    |          |     File      |         |       File        |        |
     ----------                 ---------                     --------
    
    The first step is to create the SOURCE file by exporting from your
    database or mailing list program the records to be updated.
    
    The next step is to run EZ-NCOA and choose Send Data. Here
    you tell EZ-NCOA the name of your SOURCE file. You will also
    tell EZ-NCOA which fields in the SOURCE file contain name and
    address information.
    
    EZ-NCOA analyzes the SOURCE file and tells you how many
    diskettes you will need to send your list to the NCOA. At this point
    you may format diskettes if needed. EZ-NCOA then writes the
    NCOA INPUT file to diskette(s).
    
    Optionally, you may simulate an NCOA OUTPUT file. This has exactly
    the same format as the file to be sent to you by the NCOA, though of
    course it does not contain forwarding information. Use this if you
    wish to test the entire updating process before sending diskettes to
    the NCOA.
    
    The next step is to print the file EZ-NCOA has created
    showing the first 20 records and to fill out the NCOA Processing
    Order Form. EZ-NCOA will show you exactly how to fill out
    this form.
    
    You then send the NCOA INPUT diskettes, Order Form, and printout to
    the NCOA vendor. In two to three weeks you will receive their
    package COD. It will contain your NCOA INPUT diskettes and their
    NCOA OUTPUT diskettes.
    
    The next step is to run EZ-NCOA and choose Receive Data. Here
    you tell EZ-NCOA the name of your SOURCE file and the name of
    the NCOA OUTPUT file (which the NCOA has assigned). EZ-NCOA
    then constructs a new file, the FORWARD file, from these two files.
    The FORWARD file has the same fields as your SOURCE file, but
    contains standardized and updated addresses. Records with invalid
    addresses have been removed.
    
    The last step is to import the FORWARD file into your database after
    first making provisions that you do not end up with duplicate
    records.
    3. Prepare Your Computer                                      Page 3
    ========================
    
    Make enough disk space for the SOURCE and FORWARD files
    -------------------------------------------------------
    In order to work with a wide variety of database and mailing list
    programs, EZ-NCOA inputs the SOURCE file in the most common
    "interchange" format available: comma-delimited ASCII (see the
    Glossary for a definition).
    
    You must have enough free space on your hard drive (or floppy, if
    that is your working drive) to hold the SOURCE file, and when the
    NCOA returns its output to you, the FORWARD file as well (at the
    same time). Generally, the size of each of these files will be
    roughly 100 bytes per record, unless your records have fields with
    more than just name, address, and phone number. Just a comment field
    can average 50 or more bytes per record (but not if this field is
    empty on most records). 
    
    To calculate how much free space you need, multiply the number of
    names you intend to send to the NCOA times the average record size
    times 2. Compare this with the amount of free space available. This
    can usually be found by typing "chkdsk" to the DOS prompt. If this
    command does not work for you, please don't call us; simply continue
    to the next chapter. Your database or mailing list program will tell
    you if you run out of disk space while creating the SOURCE file.
    
    If you discover that there is not enough disk space to create the
    SOURCE file, you must delete or archive some files to make space. Be
    very careful what you delete! If there is enough space for the
    SOURCE file, but not for the FORWARD file, you may postpone the day
    of spacemaking until the NCOA returns its information to you, but
    you will need to create enough space at that time.
    4. Send Your Mailing List To The NCOA                         Page 4
    =====================================
    
    Step 1 -- Print the NCOA Diskette Processing Order Form
    -------------------------------------------------------
    Print the file "order.frm". It is adapted from the official NCOA
    Processing Order Form supplied with the registered version of Please
    Forward.
    
    Step 2 -- Export your list to the SOURCE file
    ---------------------------------------------
    Export from your database a comma-delimited ASCII text file (not a
    fixed field or dBase or any other type of file) of the records that
    contain the addresses you wish to update. You may choose any name
    for this SOURCE file (Example: july13.src). Typically you tell your
    database program the directory and name in one step:
    
        Export to: c:\ezncoa\july13.src
    
    Export all fields and do not change the order of the fields. This
    will make importing the updated list easier later.
    
    Step 3 - Start EZ-NCOA
    -----------------------------
    Start EZ-NCOA by exiting your database, exiting to DOS from
    your menu program (if you use one), and typing:
    
         cd \ezncoa
         ezncoa
    
    Each command in EZ-NCOA will be highlighted. Hit ENTER to set
    a command in motion or accept an item, and TAB to skip to the next
    allowed command or item. To return to a previous item, hit TAB
    several times to go "around the circle". Generally, ENTER is the
    right choice for taking the next step.
    
    Step 4 - Create the NCOA INPUT file
    -----------------------------------
    At the Send Data command hit ENTER to move to the Create NCOA INPUT
    File screen. 
    
    First, enter the directory and filename (the "path") for the SOURCE
    file.
    
    Next, select Choose Fields. EZ-NCOA displays the input fields
    understood by the NCOA and allows you to designate your fields as
    containing that information. See Figure 3. For each item highlighted
    use SPACE or up and down arrows to select a field from your database
    or mailing list.
    
    For example, if your list contains a Prefix field ("Mr.", "Mrs.",
    etc.), and it is the seventh field in each record, hit SPACE seven
    times until '7' shows in the top of the left column headed "Field:"
    and the right column shows the Prefix of the first record in your
    file. If your file contains no Prefix field, simply hit ENTER.
                                                                  Page 5    

    Do this for each field. At a minimum you must specify a Name field,
    and Delivery Address, City, State, and ZIP fields. If both the first
    and last name are in one field, choose that field for Last or Both.
    
    At See Next Record you may hit SPACE to display the next record.
    Hit ENTER to move to Accept Fields and ENTER again to accept your
    choices.
    
    EZ-NCOA will save the information from this screen so that
    you will not have to repeat the input process should you repeat the
    Choose Fields screen.
    
    After accepting these fields and returning to the Send Data screen,
    choose the Output Drive and the drive size. You may choose a drive
    other than A or B, such as C, for doing a test run. EZ-NCOA
    assumes drives C and above are hard drives, so no drive size
    selection is offered.
    
    Next, select Analyze Input. EZ-NCOA will read the SOURCE file
    and analyze it in preparation for creating the NCOA INPUT file.
    EZ-NCOA will display the number of records in the file and
    how many diskettes are needed to hold the NCOA INPUT file to be
    created.
    
    If you need to format diskettes, select DOS: Format Disks to invoke
    a DOS shell. Type "exit" to return to EZ-NCOA.
    
    Next, choose Write NCOA INPUT File. EZ-NCOA will prompt you
    to insert each diskette in turn and will report on how many records
    it has written. Label each diskette with its sequence number and the
    total number of diskettes: "3/5" means Disk 3 of 5.
    
    Step 5 -- Fill out the order form
    ---------------------------------
    Select "Display Filled Out Form". Copy the information displayed to
    the NCOA Diskette Processing Order Form. Where you are required to
    make choices not yet made, you will see question marks. Make the
    appropriate choices.
    
    If you have not yet printed the order form, TAB to DOS: Format
    Diskettes to invoke a DOS shell from which you can print. When you
    return, TAB to "Display Filled Out Form" and proceed.
    
    Step 6 -- Print the file showing the first twenty records
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    EZ-NCOA creates a file with the extension ".prt" showing the
    first twenty records of the NCOA INPUT file. Type "print july13.prt"
    (or the name of your file) to DOS. This printout is desirable but
    not absolutely necessary; you may send your order without it.
    
    Step 7 -- Backup Your Data
    --------------------------
    Backup your source file and two files that EZ-NCOA has
    created; for the example: july13.src, july13.fld, july13.ezd.
    EZ-NCOA must have these files when your data is returned by
    the NCOA!
    
    Step 8 -- Send order to NCOA                                  Page 6
    ----------------------------
    Send your diskettes, order form, and printout to the NCOA vendor:
    
        NCOA Diskette Processing
        Lorton Data
        43 Main St SE Suite 504
        Minneapolis MN 55414-1068
    
    The charge is $7.00 per thousand names, with a $25 minimum, plus a
    $10 shipping charge, and a few dollars for postage. They ship C.O.D.
    The vendor will often call to tell you how much the C.O.D charges
    will be. To make this more likely, write "Please call with C.O.D.
    charges" on the order form.
    5. Receive The NCOA Output                                    Page 7
    ==========================
    
    The return package from the NCOA vendor will contain your original
    diskettes and one or more NCOA OUTPUT diskettes. In this section we
    will describe how to retrieve the updated information on these
    diskettes.
    
    Step 9 - Create the FORWARD file
    --------------------------------
    Start EZ-NCOA, tab to Receive Data and hit ENTER to move to
    the Read NCOA OUTPUT File screen. Type the SOURCE directory and
    filename. EZ-NCOA will show the number of records in the
    SOURCE file.
    
    Next, choose the drive from which to read the NCOA OUTPUT diskettes
    and enter the name of the NCOA OUTPUT file on the first diskette. It
    is written on the diskette and is usually made from your business
    name. Here we will call it "bizname". EZ-NCOA will construct
    a path for reading this file. You may make corrections if Please
    Forward's assumptions are wrong.
    
    Finally, select Read NCOA OUTPUT File. EZ-NCOA will prompt
    you to insert the NCOA OUTPUT diskettes. Reading and processing the
    NCOA OUTPUT diskettes will generally take one to two minutes each.
    The speed will be highly dependent on the speed of your disk drives
    and, to a lesser degree, on the speed of your processor.
    
    Step 10 - Import the SOURCE file into your mailing list
    -------------------------------------------------------
    As was suggested earlier, the best way to handle your list is to
    import the FORWARD file into a new, empty database to avoid creating
    duplicate entries. If you have to import a part of your list into a
    database, your last task will be to remove duplicates.
    6. Technical Notes                                            Page 8
    ==================
    
    Simulate NCOA OUTPUT File
    -------------------------
    One option on the Send Data screen is Simulate NCOA OUTPUT File.
    This choice will write a file identical in format to that supplied
    by the NCOA. Use it to test the entire cycle of sending and
    receiving data.
    
    Each record in an NCOA OUTPUT file requires 470 bytes; thus a 10,000
    record file will require about 4.7 megabytes. You may write this
    file to diskettes, or you may select a hard drive to hold this file
    (EZ-NCOA treats any drive except A and B as a hard drive). Unlike
    the NCOA vendor, which chooses a new name for the NCOA OUTPUT file,
    the simulated NCOA OUTPUT file will have the same name as your
    source file, with the extension ".001" (and ".002", ".003", etc. if
    you write it to multiple diskettes).
    
    Most of the entries in the simulated NCOA OUTPUT file will be
    simulated standardized addresses (on "Standardized Blvd") or
    simulated forwarding addresses (on "Forwarding St").
    7. Error Messages                                             Page 9
    =================
    Couldn't create directory
      EZ-NCOA could not create the directory in which to install
      its files. The drive may be full.
    Couldn't find filename
      The file is not where EZ-NCOA expected to find it. Check
      the spelling of the file and directory. If you are on the Receive
      screen and the file is the SOURCE file, you must restore it from
      your backup. EZ-NCOA must have your SOURCE file to create a
      FORWARD file.
    Couldn't open file example.ezd
      You must first run the Send procedure and choose Simulate NCOA
      OUTPUT File before running the Receive procedure on the example
      data. See page 12 for more information on the example.
    Couldn't open file filename.ezd
      Some condition is keeping EZ-NCOA from opening this file.
      If this file has been erased, you must create it again by running
      the Send procedure on your original SOURCE file.
    Data on diskette does not match SOURCE file
      The NCOA OUTPUT file does not match the SOURCE file. Check to see
      that the proper NCOA OUTPUT disk has been inserted.
    Diskette is write-protected
      Remove the write-protect tab or slide.
    Drive not ready
      Insert a disk in the floppy drive.
    Error in record length
      Call Nuts & Bolts Software.
    Error in writing file 
      Some condition is keeping EZ-NCOA from writing a file.
      Check disk drives.
    Error seeking start of SOURCE file
      Call Nuts & Bolts Software.
    Must contain PERSONAL NAME or COMPANY NAME field
      Each record must contain at least one of these two fields. Hit TAB
      until one of them is highlighted, then hit SPACE to choose a name
      field.
    Must contain DELIVERY ADDRESS or CITY or STATE or ZIP field
      Each record must contain this field.  Hit TAB until the indicated
      field is highlighted, then hit SPACE to choose the field.
    No more records
      There are no more records to be displayed.
    Not enough space on diskette
      Diskette will not hold the data you wish to place on it. Choose
      another diskette or delete the data on the diskette.
    Not enough space on drive
      The drive will not hold the data you wish to place on it. Choose
      another drive or delete some files from the drive.
    SOURCE file analysis interrupted
      A key was struck during analysis. Hit TAB to return to command and
      ENTER to restart.
    SOURCE path empty
      You must type a SOURCE directory and filename.
    SOURCE path invalid
      The indicated SOURCE path does not describe an existing file.
                                                                  Page 10

    STATE field exceeded 2 characters in one or more records
      This is a warning that EZ-NCOA found an entry in the STATE
      field that contained more than two characters. You may continue,
      but a better course of action is to check the database or mailing
      list file for errors.
    Too many SOURCE fields
      EZ-NCOA can handle up to 300 fields in the SOURCE file.
    Unknown drive
      The indicated drive was not found on your system.
    8. Glossary                                                   Page 11
    ===========
    9-track tape -- magnetic tape that is 1/2" wide and comes on 12"
    reels.
    
    ASCII -- refers to characters that are meant to be printed or
    viewed, as opposed to special characters that indicate formatting,
    such as fonts, paragraphs, etc. An ASCII file has none of these
    special characters. ASCII stands for American Standard Code for
    Information Interchange.
    
    comma-delimited ASCII text -- a format for data files with the
    fields of each record on one line separated by commas. Example:
    
        "Sally","Field",49,"actress"
        "Dan","Quayle",48,"politician"
    
    Fields can be surrounded by quotes. An empty or blank field is
    represented by double quotes ("") or consecutive commas. Each record
    ends with a carriage return/line feed.
    
    database -- refers both to a program for manipulating large amounts
    of data (dBase, Paradox, Q&A, FileMaker, etc.) and to the data that
    it manipulates.
    
    DOS shell -- an invocation of the DOS program from inside another
    program, such as EZ-NCOA. You will see the DOS prompt, but be
    able to return to the program by typing "exit".
    
    export -- refers to creating a copy of a database outside the
    database itself. Usually the format of the exported file is chosen
    to facilitate its transfer to another program.
    
    format a diskette -- to make a new diskette ready to receive
    information. Every diskette ("floppy disk") must be formatted prior
    to use (unless it comes "pre-formatted").
    
    field -- the place in which a single piece of information is saved
    in a database. Examples: the address field, the city field, etc.
    
    file -- a collection of data referred to by one name. Example:
    july13.src.
    
    fixed field format -- a database file format with each record on one
    line and each field padded with blanks to contain a fixed number of
    characters. No quotes or commas separate fields. Example:
    
        Sally   Field    49   actress
        Dan     Quayle   48   politician
    
    import -- to bring data into a database from an outside file, often
    in comma-delimited ASCII or fixed field format.
    
    record -- the name given to all the information in a database about
    one person, one product, one event, or the like. A database is a
    collection of many records.
    9. An Example                                                 Page 12
    =============
    
    The installation disk contains a typical comma-delimited ASCII file
    exported from a mailing list program. To observe the entire Send and
    Receive cycle, use this file to simulate an NCOA OUTPUT file, and to
    read the file created. You may do this after installation or
    directly from the installation diskette. Substitute your hard drive
    or diskette for c: and a: below if they are different.
    
    To Send and create a simulated NCOA OUTPUT file
    -----------------------------------------------
    SOURCE Path: c:\ezncoa\example.src, or a:\example.src to run
      directly from installation diskette.
    Choose Fields: Hit ENTER to see the selections taken from
      example.fld, or ESCAPE to skip.
    NCOA INPUT Write To (drive): Hit SPACE twice, ENTER, choose drive
      (usually a hard drive such as "C").
    NCOA INPUT Path: c:\ezncoa\example.fix. Hit ENTER.
    Analyze Source: Hit ENTER.
    DOS: Format Diskettes: Hit TAB to skip.
    Write NCOA INPUT File: Hit TAB to skip. Normally you would ENTER
      here to create the NCOA INPUT file.
    Simulate NCOA OUTPUT File: Hit ENTER.
    
    These steps will create several files: example.prt (you would print
    this file and attach to the Processing Order Form), example.001 (a
    simulated NCOA OUTPUT file) and example.pdf and example.fld
    (information files used internally by EZ-NCOA).
    
    To Receive the simulated NCOA OUTPUT file
    -----------------------------------------
    SOURCE Path: type the same as SOURCE Path above.
    NCOA OUTPUT Read From (drive): choose the same as NCOA INPUT Write
      To above.
    NCOA OUTPUT Filename: example
    NCOA OUTPUT Path: c:\ezncoa\example.001. Hit ENTER.
    [X] Get all records: Hit ENTER.
    [X] Make upper & lower case: Hit ENTER.
    Read NCOA Output File: Hit ENTER.
    
    The SOURCE directory should now contain a simulated NCOA OUTPUT file
    named example.fwd.

EZ-NCOA Version 4.03

Version 4.03--Bug Fix
---------------------
Fixes a bug in 4.0 that caused EZ-NCOA to lock up if the Last Name field
contained "&" or " and ".

Version 4.02--User Interaction
------------------------------
Some minor changes were made to the interaction for choosing files.

Version 4.01--Bug Fix
---------------------
Fixes a bug in 4.0 that would not allow the up and down arrow keys 
to be used on the INPUT FIELDS screens.

Version 4.0--New Features
-------------------------
The following designators should be used in your FIELDS file to describe
your data file:

        "PFX"            Prefix
        "FIRST"          First
        "M"              Middle
        "LAST"           Last or Both
        "SFX"            Suffix
        "COMPANY"        Company
        "DELIVERY"       Delivery Addr
        "SECONDARY"      Secondary Addr
        "CITY"           City
        "ST"             State
        "99999"          ZIP or ZIP-ZIP+4
        "1000"           Record ID
        "4444"           ZIP+4 Only
        "99"             Delivery Point
        "9"              Check Digit
        "CARR"           Carrier Route
        "X"              Bad Address Flag
        "1"              ZIP Code Flag
        "2"              Apartment Indicator
        "3"              RR/HC Indicator
        "T"              Move Type
        "D"              Deliverability Code
        "9009"           Move Effective Date
        "N"              Nixie Flag
        "NIXIE"          Nixie Footnotes

Most users will find the Bad Address Flag and perhaps the Deliverability Code
to be all the information they need. The Nixie Footnotes field contains all
27 columns from A to the one past Z that does not yet have a label. The Nixie
Flag field contains either an "A", "B", or "C", depending on which of these
Nixie Footnotes is present (one and only one always is).

If You Must Make Changes To Your Database During NCOA Processing
================================================================
The User Manual warns you not to make changes to your database while you are 
waiting for NCOA output. This is because the output is combined with your
SOURCE file in the exact order it was created. If you were to delete or
add any records, EZ-NCOA will be unable to work.

However, if you simply make changes to the fields of existing records without
adding or deleting records, and you then create a new SOURCE file in the SAME
ORDER as the original, EZ-NCOA will have no problem combining the NCOA
output with the new SOURCE file.

Be sure to backup or rename the original SOURCE file before creating a new
one!

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Outside the U.S.A.: Call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer near

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
