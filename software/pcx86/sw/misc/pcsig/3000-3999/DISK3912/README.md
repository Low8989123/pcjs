The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, winner of the Optical Publishing
Association's Best Consumer Product Award, has added a hypermedia
interface that makes it easy to find and download any type of program
you could want. The WordCruncher text retrieval program has also been
implemented to assist you insearching this vast collection.

This CD-ROM contains over 3700 fully functional shareware programs, each
with a detailed review. The 12th Edition has added over 300 new programs
and over 500 updates since the release of the 11th Edition. The
collection is always kept current and now contains over 70 megabytes of
Windows 3.0 and 3.1 applications, fonts, icons, games and wallpaper
files.

The range of software is phenomenal! There are huge assortments of
games, everything from adventure games with full SVGA and SoundBlaster
support to favorites like Klondike, Chess and Othello. Spreadsheets,
databases, wordprocessors and graphics programs are instantly available
and there are literally hundreds of unique and specialized programs that
will save you time and money. This amazing collection will help you get
a handle on all your business and home accounting and also teach your
children about zoology.

Each of the more than 3700 programs has a one-line description for quick
reference, Just pick one of the 13 software categories and a subcategory
to begin browsing for a program that interests you. You might choose the
Games Category, where you can pick from 12 subcatgories including
Adventure, Arcade, Cards and more. A mouse click (or keyboard stroke) on
the program title takes you to a detailed description of the program.
you can immediately download the software to your hard or floppy drive,
and in many cases view a screen shot.

You can find any program in the collection quickly and easily by using
the search button. When you are in a program category just type in the
title of the program and you will be taken to the description of that
program. The popular WordCruncher text retrieval program has been added
to allow searching every description for any word within that
description, not just in the title or keywords chosen by someone who
thinks differently than you do. The WordCruncher is ideal for finding
programs which perform a specific function, just try searching for
"split", "math" or "subtract". Or switch to the Disks section where you
will find an alphabetical list of all the programs which can be searched
by program title or disk number.

Everyone has their favorite programs and we're no exception. Our 44
favorite programs can be run immediately. No downloading is necessary,
all you do is click on the word "RUN" in the program description and
you'll be working or playing with top notch software right on the CD.

The power of hypermedia will allow you to try out more software than you
ever thought possible. We are sure that you will find a multitude of
programs to your liking on the P-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

System Requirements: IBM PC/AT PS/2 or compatible with 640K, DOS 3.3 or
higher, Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions and a CD-ROM player. We
recommend a 386 with a VGA monitor.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed by title, filename, PC-SIG disk
number, and every word in the program description.  A new utility, Narc,
is implemented so you can look at the program files and the author's
on-line documentation without having to first copy the program to your
hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and Narc, you can quickly find the
program you want and review it to be sure, without ever having to run it
from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 3500 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

		       This game is Shareware

		    Video Graphics Array (VGA)



o  WARRANTIES AND LIABILITY

This program is copyrighted and all rights are reserved by the author and
Atsirk Software. No warranty is expressed or implied with regard to program
function, or suitability to any purpose. The author and Atsirk Software will
not be responsible for any damages caused by use, misuse, or inability to use
this program. The only exception is, if the program was ordered directly from
Atsirk Software and the program disk is found to be physically defective.
Under such circumstances, Atsirk Software will replace the defective disk if
it is returned within 30 days of purchase. By using the program, you agree to
abide by the above agreement. This agreement is governed by the laws of
Oregon.


o  SHAREWARE

What is shareware? Shareware is a concept of distributing software, where you,
the user, do not have to pay the author for evaluating the program.

You may have obtained the program from a friend, downloaded the program from a
BBS, or bought a disk from a shareware distributor for a small duplication fee
(this fee is only for the distributor's cost of duplicating and distributing
the disk, and the author receives no compensation from this fee). As
shareware, you have the opportunity to take the program on a "test drive",
practically risk free, when you obtain the program.

If you find the software useful and wish to continue using it after an
adequate trial period, you are obligated to register it with the author (we're
on the honor system here). Your registration allows the author to survive and
continue writing programs in the shareware market. However, if you do not like
the program or do not find it useful, you simply discontinue using it and you
owe the author nothing.


o  REGISTERING THIS GAME

This game is shareware. You may copy and distribute the shareware version of
this game freely as long as you do so with all of the original files listed
below. You are encouraged to pass the program along to your friends so that,
they too, can take it for a "test drive".

If you play the game and like it, and wish to continue using it, you are asked
to register it (refer to the file ORDER.DOC). When you register the game, you
will also gain the following benefits:


(1) You will receive the most current version of Touchdown Trivia with a soon
to be mucho enlarged database of challenging football trivia questions.

(2) You receive a game with no shareware reminder screens at the start.

(3) You will receive upgrade and follow-up notifications when new sports
database questions become available for the game and when new Atsirk products
are introduced.

(4) You become eligible for the new-user recruitment rebate when people you
show the game to register (see below for details).

(5) You receive information on a programmer's secret to using Touchdown
Trivia, so that you can answer every question correctly (you'll need a sharp
eye for this one though).

(6) You will receive a bonus shareware game by Atsirk Software.

o  INTRODUCTION

Touchdown Trivia is a program that puts your football sports trivia knowledge
to the ultimate test ... on the field. Go head to head with your sports
buddies and see who is the ultimate armchair quarterback. It's the perfect
party game!! Form teams together to answer questions. It also serves as a
perfect tutor, gain knowledge of the sport's world by playing this game.


o  INSTALLATION

The program should be installed onto a hard disk for best results (although,
it may be run from a floppy drive with slower drive access). This is
accomplished by copying all files into an appropriate directory. Use the MD
command to make a directory (e.g., MD C:\FOOTBALL). Then use the COPY command
to copy the files into this directory (e.g., COPY A:*.* C:\FOOTBALL). If you
have difficulties using or understanding these DOS commands, please consult
your DOS manual or your favorite computer buddy.


o  INSTRUCTIONS

OBJECTIVE -- The object of the game is to score the most number of points
possible before the end of the game. A score is done in a similar manner as
the real game of football; by scoring a touchdown by moving the ball into the
end zone or by kicking a field goal.

TO START THE GAME -- To start the game, go into the DOS directory where the
program is installed (e.g., type CD \FOOTBALL). From this directory, run the
game by typing START. The game will place you in the intro screen where you
have the option to select Play, Options, or Exit.

PLAYING THE GAME -- Select Play by typing 'P' and the program will put you
into the play mode. The Playing Field is drawn in the topmost part of the
screen and a Dialog Window is present in the lower part of the screen. The
game will interact with players through the Dialog Window.

Follow the instructions presented in the dialog window to play the game.
Players alternate turns as dictated by the dialog window. The active player is
the player whose helmet token has the ball. The active player first selects
the type of play he wishes to use and must answer a football trivia question
to complete the play.

Note that running plays are more conservative than passing plays. On the
average, you will gain less yardage on a running play than you would on a
passing play, but if the play goes bad, you have a lesser chance of mishap
with a running play (loss of yardage, interception, and fumble).

The active player answers the question by typing in the number corresponding
to the answer he wishes to select. The top row of number keys work fine and
the numeric keypad should work also (providing you remember to turn num lock
on). A player maintains possession of the ball as long as he continues to
answer the questions correctly. If a player answers the question wrong, he
will lose possession of the ball and the turn goes to the next person.

If you lose the ball through an interception or fumble, you will start back at
your own 20 yard line. A missed field goal attempt will also put you back a
the 20 yard line.

TIME PENALTIES -- Watch the time of the penalty clock. If you do not answer
the question in the allocated time, you will be penalized. Also watch the game
clock. You have four quarters before the end of the game. After half time, all
players return to the 20 to start the second half.

GAME HINTS -- Play conservative when you are close to your own end zone,
because if you are downed behind the goal line, your opponents will be awarded
2 points for a safety.

Drive for the touchdown when you can, but play the field goal if you feel you
are within range and you don't think you can make it into the end zone. Don't
try kicking from too far out though. A touchdown is worth 6 points and you get
a try at making an extra point afterwards. A field goal is worth 3 points.

THE OPTIONS SCREEN -- Select Options from the intro screen to change the play
characteristics of the game. You can modify the number of players from 1 to 4,
change the quarter lengths, turn off the sound, or change the penalty times.

PARTY FUN -- Group people together into teams for great party fun.


o  SPECIAL KEYS

F10 -- Boss key for those special moments (also substitutes as a pause or
time-out function key).

ESC -- All purpose back out of situation key.


o  A REBATE FOR RECRUITING NEW USERS

We hope you have a lot of fun with this game and will share it with your
friends. It's a great party game! As a special bonus to those registered users
that help us pass the shareware version of this game along, we will send a $2
registration rebate to anyone who recruits a new registered user.

To receive the rebate, you must fulfill the following criteria:


(1) You must be registered with us or be in the process of registering.

(2) The person you help recruit must send in his/her registration order on a
completed printed ORDER.DOC file (included with each game) and he/she must
reference your name under the "Where did you first find out about our product"
field.


The rebate will be sent to your registered address. This offer is not valid in
areas where it is prohibited by law and is subject to limitation and
termination at any time at the discretion of the author.


o  NOTES FOR BBS USERS

If you are a BBS user and you like Touchdown Trivia, you can help us pass
along the shareware version of the game by uploading this program to any
popular local BBS that you frequent. Please refer to the VENDOR.DOC file for
more information on uploading the file. Your help is appreciated.


o  SO YOU THINK YOU KNOW YOUR TRIVIA

If you know your football trivia, you can contribute your trivia knowledge to
us for possible publication. All you need is your football knowledge and a
text processor. Your trivia information must be in the following format:

The question is preceded with a question mark and can be of no more that 150
characters long.

The correct answer follows next (preceded with a blank line) and preceded with
an ampersand mark (&) at the beginning of the line. The answers should be no
longer than 40 characters.

Three alternative answers (wrong ones) follow, each on its own line preceded
with an exclamation mark (!) at the start of the line. Again, they should be
no longer than 40 characters.

A blank line follows and then is followed with the rationale (the reasoning
why the correct answer is the best choice). The rationale line is started with
an "at" mark (@). This line can be no longer than 150 characters.

Each question is separated by a blank line.

Follows is an example of the proper layout:


?Who was the head coach of the Steelers in all four Super Bowl Victories?

&Chuck Noll

!Chuck Knox

!Tom Landry

!John Robinson

@Chuck Noll led the Pittsburgh Steelers to 4 Super Bowl titles.


?Who did the Kansas City Chiefs defeat in Super Bowl IV?

&Minnesota Vikings

!Los Angeles Rams

!Dallas Cowboys

!Baltimore Colts

@The Chiefs defeated the favored Minnesota Vikings 23-7 to win their first and
only Super Bowl title.


The text must be in a plain ASCII ("DOS") text format (most word processors
support a save function in such a format). The minimum number of questions
with each submission is 25 questions. Each submission must be sent to us to
the address above on floppy disk.

If we use your trivia in the next release of the game and you are a registered
user, you will receive a complimentary VIP update. Any submissions become the
property of Atsirk Software and cannot be returned.


o  COMMON USER QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS

QUESTION: Can I run Touchdown Trivia from a floppy disk?

ANSWER: Yes you can run Touchdown Trivia from a floppy disk. However, the
program will run slower than running from a hard drive.


QUESTION: I get the message "Requires a VGA system" when I try to run
Touchdown Trivia. What can I do?

ANSWER: Your IBM compatible PC doesn't have a VGA video system. You will need
to upgrade your video system in order to run Touchdown Trivia.


QUESTION: Can I use my mouse with Touchdown Trivia?

ANSWER: No, Touchdown Trivia does not support a mouse at this time.


QUESTION: What is "shareware". Why do I have to register Touchdown Trivia if I
wish to continue using it?

ANSWER: The shareware concept is defined in the top of this document. Please
refer to this for an explanation.


QUESTION: The program appears to be repeating some of the questions that I
have already answered. Why does the program do that?

ANSWER: The current Touchdown Trivia has a database of 150 plus questions. It
will recycle questions when the question database has been exhausted. When you
register, you will recieve the latest version with an extended database. New
questions will be compiled for distribution to registered users for a nominal
fee in the future.


QUESTION: I wish to add my own trivia questions to the program, can I do that?

ANSWER: If you wish to go through the work to create your own custom set of
questions for a personalized program, Atsirk Software can create a custom
program for you for a fee. Please contact us for more information on this.


o  TROUBLESHOOTING

If you have any problems with the program, please first try to 'boot clean'
from your system to eliminate extraneous variables such as TSR's and shell
programs (consult your favorite local tech to find out how to do this if
necessary).

Also make sure that the files are intact by recopying the files from your
original disk.

If all this does not solve the problem, please carefully describe your problem
(include any error messages), and include a brief description of your system
(cpu type, video, DOS version, memory configuration, etc.) and send it to the
address above.
