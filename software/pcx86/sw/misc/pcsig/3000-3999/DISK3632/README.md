Thank you for choosing the quality programming of MP Software.  Unfortunately,
we are required to include the following legalese to cover our tails.  If
you find this offensive, skip down the page.

1.  This is shareware!  Therefore, we cannot warranty the shareware version
of PSV.  Check with your vendor about bad disk replacement hype.  The
registered version is warrantied for 60 days, however, this covers disk and
manual only.  If your computer blows up, we will not be held responsible.
If something should happen to the disk or manual within the 60 days, send the
mangled remains to us with the receipt.  After the 60 days, there will be a
$5.00 charge (you have to buy a whole new program, sorry.)

2.  The contents are (c) 1992 MP Software.  This means the two files, PSV.DOC
and PSV.EXE.  All rights reserved.

Now, interesting stuff.  How to use the program:

To Start:  type PSV at the prompt.

When at the menu, press 1 to print a registration form or 2 to continue. 
If you press 1, a form will be printed to PRN (LPT1:) and you will return 
to the opening screen.  Press 2, and enter the file (path and name).

examples:   c:\ps\grdata.dat
            z:\free\games\grafx\direct\trash\sierra\mps\grudata.dat

some of these files are included on the disk to prove as examples.

Thank you for your interest in MP Software.  If you are interested in 
distributing this or any other MPS product, read on:

1.  No per disk charge over $10 can be charged.
2.  We have no problem with you including this with a set of programs.
    It's small; why not?  CD's too!
3.  All we ask is that you send us a copy of the catalog listing the 
    program.

Sincerely,
MP Software
