        more than one person to legally use one copy of a program on more
        than one computer at a time.  Site licenses are designed for
        companies, offices or workgroups where more than one person in
        the organization needs to use a product, but does not need
        additional manuals or disks.  Site licensing enables companies,
        departments, government agencies, etc., to equip their personnel
        with the tools they need at a minimal cost.

        How do site licenses work?  The company purchasing a site license
        (the licensee) provides a single point of contact for shipping,
        technical support, upgrades, etc., and we (the licensor) provide
        a "golden master" of the diskettes, manual, and any other parts
        of the package.

        Exhibit 1 gives a breakdown of the cost of site licensing and how
        much you save per site licensed.  For instance, if you purchased
        a site license for 15 users (sites) your cost would be $539.40,
        which saves you $209.85 of the cost of 15 separate purchases.  The
        more sites you license, the more you save.

        The following document is the complete license agreement.  Simply
        print it, fill it out, sign under LICENSEE, enclose a check or
        money order for the correct amount, and mail it to:

                             WINTERRA Software Group
                                  P.O.Box 4106

                            Voice/Fax: (303) 470-6323

        Upon receipt of the completed, signed form, and a check or money
        order for the correct amount, we will send you the required
        "golden masters" and a copy of the license agreement with an
        authorized signature under LICENSOR.

        If you have any questions, or if you need site license information
        for more than 100 sites, please call our offices.

        6.0 LIMITED WARRANTY

             6.1 WINTERRA Software Group warrants that for a period of sixty
        days from the date of delivery of the licensed program, the program,
        if unmodified by the Licensee, will perform in substantial
        conformity with the user documentation.  WINTERRA Software Group
        does not warrant that the licensed program is free from coding
        errors.  Any program problems reported to WINTERRA Software Group
        during the warranty period and determined by WINTERRA Software Group
        to be actual coding errors will be corrected by WINTERRA Software
        Group within a reasonable time.  Any modifications to the licensed
        program shall thereafter be licensed AS IS.

             6.2 The above warranty does not apply to the extent that any
        failure of the licensed program to perform as warranted is caused
        by the licensed program being (1) not used in accordance with the
        user documentation, or (2) modified by any person other than
        authorized WINTERRA Software Group personnel.

             6.3 LICENSOR MAKES AND LICENSEE RECEIVES NO OTHER WARRANTY OF
        ANY KIND, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY

        suppliers for any claim or damage arising out of the use of the
        licensed program or otherwise related to this license shall be
        limited to direct damages which shall not exceed the license
        fee(s) which have been paid by Licensee to WINTERRA Software Group
        for the specific client project which is the subject of such claim
        or damage.

             7.2 IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE FOR
        ADDITIONAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS OR
        OTHER INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE

        agreement between the parties hereto, superseding all previous
        agreements, representations, understandings and negotiations.

        1.1  What Is Stable Investment Software?
        ----------------------------------------
        Stable (tm) Investment Software is planned as an integrated set
        of programs seeking to provide both experienced and novice
        investors and traders with useful software tools focusing on the
        study of the financial markets.
        
        It is the goal of WINTERRA Software Group to provide useful, easy to
        use programs, beneficial in meeting your day to day investment needs.
        It is hoped that you, as an interested and/or experienced user of
        market related software, will provide comments and suggestions
        assisting us in meeting this goal.  You are encouraged to let us
        know what you think of the product - and what features and/or
        functionality are important to you.
        
        This software program - Technical Graphs - addresses one specific 
        area of financial market investing; the analysis and study of market
        movement and direction through the interpretation of technically-
        oriented graphs.
        
        Stable - Technical Graphs can be used to graph data associated with
        individual stocks, mutual funds, commodities, interest rates, major
        stock and bond indexes (i.e., Dow Jones, Standard & Poor's, Lehman
        Brothers, etc.) - essentially any data that has (at a minimum) a
        date and price value associated with it.

                                                            Introduction  1-2
   
   
        1.2  Features
        -------------
        This latest update of Stable - Technical Graphs contains many of
        your most requested features as well as being Windows 3.0/3.1
        compatible.  Written for experienced and novice users alike,
        Stable provides powerful - yet easy to use - stock market
        technical analysis capabilities ideal for the technical trader
        with existing (or access to) historical financial data for stocks,
        bonds, commodities, mutual funds, indexes, and options.
        Combining popular technical indicators with features such as DDE
        (Dynamic Data Exchange), chart printing, selectable graph styles,
        new data import formats, popup graph menus, enhanced desktop
        management features, and more - Stable is likely to become your
        technical analysis tool for the Windows environment.  Reads CSI,
        Technical Tools, MetaStock, and ASCII formatted data files.

        Stable - Technical Graphs reads CSI, Technical Tools, MetaStock,
        and ASCII formatted data files; allowing you to use your existing
        data more effectively.  All Stable charts support horizontal
        scrolling - giving you the ability to study as many as 1,024 units
        (days, weeks, etc.) of data in a single graph. And when you
        identify a chart worthy of more attention, simply print it to one
        of your system printers.

        All Stable charts provide an easy to use "slider" for accurately
        comparing a specific day's activity across several graphs.  Also
        available for every chart is a "toolbar" providing single mouse
        click operation of frequently used charting operations and tools.

        In addition to the above capabilities, other standard features
        found in Stable - Technical Graphs include:
   
           - The display of up to 64 market charts for individual and
             comparative study, with each chart containing as many as
             1,024 units (days, weeks, months) of data.

           - DDE support letting you communicate directly with any Stable
             chart through the use of third-party software (such as
             Microsoft Excel) to open, print, display - or to dynamically
             add new data to a chart.

           - Windows 3.1 "Drag and Drop" support allowing CSV and Technical
             Tools data files to be opened simply by "dragging" the file from
             the File Manager directly to the Stable logo window or icon.

           - User-selectable graph styles; including High/Low Bar, Line,
             and Histogram graphs.

           - Popup menu support within any graph allowing you to quickly
             perform many common graph functions.
        
           - Improved desktop chart management features such as closing
             or minimizing all charts, and easily moving from one chart
             to another.

           - The ability to print your technical charts to any attached
             printer using the provided print functionality of Windows.

           - On-line help documentation using the standard Window's Help
             program.
   
           - All chart and graph colors are easily selected and changed
             to suit your own personal preference.

           - An "Auto Chart Configuration Mode" giving you the option of
             having Stable automatically save your chart colors and
             technical indicator parameters.

           - Runs on most Windows supported displays; including EGA, VGA,
             VGA (monochrome), extended VGA resolutions (800 x 600 and

                                                            Introduction  1-4
   
              
        1.4  Installing Stable
        ----------------------
        Stable - Technical Graphs requires only four program files to run
        (not including any of the data files which you will graph):

           - STABLE.EXE
           - STABLE.HLP
           - DDEML.DLL
           - SHELL.DLL

        When executing Stable v1.10, all of the above files MUST BE available
        at runtime; either from the current directory or a directory found
        in your AUTOEXEC.BAT "PATH=" statement.

        To simplify the process of running Stable - Technical Graphs within
        your Windows environment, the DOS directory that you choose to store
        the product files should be one that you have specified in your
        environment's PATH statement ("\STABLE" is recommended).

           For example, if you choose to place the Stable - Technical Graphs
           package in the recommended directory named "\STABLE", you should
           edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and add "\STABLE" to your "PATH="
           environment variable.

        The data files that have been provided with the product allow you to
        immediately use the program in your own environment.  While these
        (and other) data files can be placed in any directory, you may want
        to at least keep all of the Stable distribution files together within
        the same directory.

        If you have a compressed copy of the Stable - Technical Graphs
        package (ie, STABLE.ZIP, STABLE.ARC, STABLE.LHZ), the simplest
        installation procedure is:
        
           1.  Create a new subdirectory on your system called \STABLE.
           2.  Copy the compressed Stable file to this new directory.
           3.  Decompress the Stable file using the appropriate decompression
               program (PKUNZIP.EXE for .ZIP file, PKXARC.EXE for .ARC, etc.)
           4.  Add the \STABLE directory to your "PATH=" statement in your
               AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
           5.  Reboot your system.

        If you have received the Stable - Technical Graphs package as the
        complete set of uncompressed individual files listed in Section 1.3
        "Distribution Files", perform the same steps as above with the
        exception of step 3).

                                                            Introduction  1-5
   

        As a final step to installation, you should consider removing the
        file named STABLE.INI from your Windows directory if you have a
        previous version of Stable installed.  In order to support many of
        the enhanced features of Stable v1.10, several minor changes had to
        be made to the file's syntax.

        If you delete the STABLE.INI file, you will have to save any chart
        configuration information once again.  If you do not delete the
        file, Stable will still operate, however, it will not recognize any
        previously save configuration information anyway.
        
        1.5  If Stable Won't Run
        ------------------------
        If you try and run Stable - Technical Graphs and encounter a Windows
        error message similar to either of the following...

                CANNOT FIND DDEML.DLL, PLEASE INSERT IN DRIVE A:

                CANNOT FIND SHELL.DLL, PLEASE INSERT IN DRIVE A:

        ...this indicates an invalid installation of Stable on your computer.
        If you installed all the Stable distribution files into a single
        directory, then all you need to do is include the directory name
        in your PATH statement - AND REBOOT YOUR COMPUTER.  Any changes made
        to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file will not become effective until after a
        system restart.

   
        1.6  Backup You Files
        ---------------------
        Before you actually begin using Stable - Technical Graphs, it is
        strongly suggested that you at least perform the following task:

               !BACKUP YOUR STABLE DISTRIBUTION FILES OR DISKETTE!

        Accidents do happen!  While there may not be any way to prevent the
        loss of your program, you can take action now to help avoid the 
        problem of being without it in the future.  Making a backup copy now
        is insurance that you won't have to be without Stable - Technical
        Graphs when you need it.

              Closes and removes all chart's from the desktop.  If "Auto
              Chart Configure Mode" has been selected, each chart's
              configuration is saved before closing the chart.

              automatically be used.
        
           Save Chart As Default
              Saves the chart's configuration as the "default" chart.  All
              security chart's that have not been previously saved will
              use the "default" configuration when the chart is loaded.

        The Graph menu includes commands that control the appearance of a

              set for the graph.
        
           Set Parameters
              Allows you to change graph-specific data parameters.  The
              availability of this selection is dependent upon the current
              graph.  Not all graphs will support this option.
           
              The Price Graph allows you to control the display of moving
              averages and a Price Channel on the Price Graph.
        
           Select Indicator
              Allows you to select an indicator from a list of available 
              Indicator Graphs.  Specific items in the list are dependent
              upon the data content of the security.  For example, if
              volume data is not available for the security, a Volume Graph
              will not be available as an Indicator Graph selection.
        
              This option is available only for Indicator Graphs displayed
              on the chart.

           Line
           Histogram
              These menu selections allow you to change the appearance of
              the currently selected graph.  The availability of each option
              is dependent upon the type of graph.
     
                                                                Commands  4-4
   
   
        4.5  Select Menu Commands
        -------------------------
        The Select menu allows you to select one of the graphs on the chart
        as the current graph.  The selected graph appears with its border 
        highlighted.  Graph menu selections always apply to the current graph 
        only.
        
           Price
              Selects the Price graph as the current graph.  Menu options
              found in the Graph menu will apply to the Price Graph.

   
           Graph 1, 2, 3
              Selects one of the Indicator Graphs as the current graph.  Menu
              options found in the Graph menu will apply to the selected

                               Chapter 5  Procedures
   

        This chapter describes those procedures that are most commonly used
        in Stable - Technical Graphs.
   
   
        5.1  Adding/Removing Additional Graphs on a Chart
        -------------------------------------------------
        You may choose to have up to three (3) Indicator Graphs displayed on
        a chart for analyzing and studying specific technical information
        related to the underlying financial data.
        
        To add or remove Indicator Graphs:
   
           *   Select Indicator Graphs from the Options Menu on the chart 
               and choose the number of Indicator Graphs you would like to
               display on the chart.
               -OR-
           *   Click on either of the [One], [Two], or [Three] buttons.
        
        
        5.2  Automatically Saving a Chart's Configuration
        -------------------------------------------------
        You can have Stable automatically save the current configuration
        of any chart you have created by checking this option.  When a
        specific chart is closed, the program will automatically store the
        current colors, the number and type of Indicator Graphs, and any
        other specific graph parameter setting for you.
        
        To enable Auto Save Chart Configuration mode:
   
           1.  Select Chart Defaults from the Configure Menu on the Logo 
               window.
           2.  Check the box labeled "Auto Save Chart Configuration".

        5.3  Changing the Default Settings for New Charts (Menu Method)
        ---------------------------------------------------------------
        When new charts are created, they automatically take on specific 
        characteristics stored in Stable -  Technical Graphs.  You can change
        these default settings to suit your own personal preferences.  Only
        new charts (charts that have not been previously saved) will take on
        the default settings.  (See 5.25 for a more extensive method)
     
                                                              Procedures  5-2
   
   
        To change the default settings used for all new charts:

        5.11  Displaying a Technical Indicator
        --------------------------------------
        The graphing of technical indicators for analysis and study is
        performed through the indicator graphs displayed on a security chart.
        Up to three Indicator Graphs can be displayed along with the standard
        Price Graph for any security.

        To display a technical indicator:

           1.  Select the Indicator Graph that you want to display the
               technical indicator in from either the Select Menu on the

        You can, at any time, save the current configuration of a chart 
        regardless of the state of "Automatic Chart Configuration Mode".
        Among the information saved for a chart is the following:
        
           -  The current colors used in the display of all graphs.
           -  The actual number and type of Indicator Graphs.
           -  All parameters specific to all graphs in the chart.
           -  The screen location and size of the chart.

        The next time a chart is created for the security, all previously
        saved information will be used to recreate the chart.

        To save the current configuration of a chart:

               -OR-
               Press Alt+L on the keyboard.

        To use normal text labeling on your Stable charts:

           1.  Select Chart from the Configure Menu on the Logo window.
           2.  Clear the box labeled "Automatic Price Chart Labeling" using
               the mouse.
               -OR-
               Press Alt+L on the keyboard.


        5.24  Quickly Selecting Any Chart For Study
        -------------------------------------------
        As you create new charts, you may find that you've lost sight of a
        chart because it is hidden behind another chart, or it has been
        minimized to an icon and not currently visible.

        Stable provides a quick and easy way to recall or display any of the
        charts you've created and to make it the topmost window on the
        display.

        To display an existing chart whether hidden from view or minimized:

           *   Select the Window Menu from the Stable logo window or on any
               available chart and choose the chart you want to view.


        5.25  Setting the Default Chart Characteristics (Window Method)
        ---------------------------------------------------------------
        When new charts are created, they automatically take on specific 
        characteristics stored in Stable -  Technical Graphs.  You can change
        these default settings to suit your own personal preferences.  Only
        new charts (charts that have not been previously saved) will take on
        the default settings.

        This method allows you to set the default chart settings to any one
        of your currently displayed charts.  All characteristics of the
        chart, including; chart size, position, colors, indicator graphs,
        and moving averages are saved and later used in creating a new chart.

        To save the characteristics of any chart as the default settings:

           *   Select Save Chart As Default from the File Menu of any chart.

                                                             Procedures  5-11


        5.26  Setting the Size of the Price Graph
        -----------------------------------------
        When new technical indicator graphs are placed within a chart, the
        size of the Price Graph changes to make room for the additional
        graphs.  In Stable v1.00, this size was a fixed percentage of the
        chart area dependent upon the number of indicator graphs.

        You can now specify in v1.10 the amount of space that the Price Graph
        should occupy when 1, 2, or 3 indicator graphs are displayed in the
        chart.  This specification can be made either manually through a
        dialog box, or interactively with your mouse directly on the chart.

        Using the manual method, the Price Graph size is entered as a
        percentage of the total chart's display area.  For example, if you
        want the Price Graph to occupy one-half of the chart's total area,
        you will specify fifty percent (50%).

        To set the amount of space that the Price Graph is to occupy via the 
        manual method:

           1.  Select Price Graph Size from the Options Menu on the chart.
           2.  Enter the size of the Price Graph as a percentage of the total
               chart area for 1, 2, and 3 technical indicators.

        To change the size of the Price Graph interactively with the mouse
        (only when one or more indicator graphs are visible):

           1.  Move the mouse between the Price Graph and the first indicator
               graph until the mouse cursor changes to a double vertical
               arrow.
           2.  Press and hold down the left mouse button.
           3.  Move the mouse vertically to set the new bottom of the Price
               Graph.  As you move the mouse, a horizontal line is drawn to
               identify the new bottom of the Price Graph.
           4.  Release the mouse to set the new Price Graph size.


        5.27  Changing a Graph's Drawing Style
        --------------------------------------
        The drawing style for any graph can be changed so that you can
        interpret the data more easily.  Stable supports three basic drawing
        styles; a High/Low Bar graph, a Line graph, and a Histogram.  The
        High/Low Bar style is available only for the Price Graph.

        To change the drawing style for a graph:

           1.  Select the graph that you want from either the Select Menu of
               the chart, by clicking within the graph, or by "tabbing" to
               the graph.
           2.  Select either High/Low Bar, Line, or Histogram from the Graph
               Menu on the chart.
               -OR-
               Click on the associated toolbar button to change the graph's
               drawing style.

        5.28  Using the Popup Graph Menu
        --------------------------------
        Stable provides a method by which you can even more effectively use
        your technical charts.  This method allows you to access some of the
        more frequently used graph functions while you concentrate your
        attention directly on the graph.

        To take advantage of the popup menu support:

           1.  Move the mouse within any visible graph and click and hold the
               right mouse button.
           2.  If you are running Windows 3.1, you can make a selection from
               the popup menu by selecting an item, then releasing the right
               button.

               Under Windows 3.0, you must make a popup menu selection using
               the left mouse button.


        5.29  Drag and Drop (Windows 3.1 Only)
        --------------------------------------
        Stable charts can be opened using a feature specific to Windows 3.1
        called "Drag and Drop".  By simply selecting a file from the File
        Manager, and "dragging" that file with the mouse into the Stable
        window or icon, you can easily create new charts without the need to
        interact with the New Chart dialog.

        Stable supports "Drag and Drop" using two types of historical data
        files; CSV and Technical Tools data files.  Any other data file
        format is ignored by Stable.

        Refer to your Windows 3.1 documentation for more information on the
        Drag and Drop facility of Windows.

   
   
                               Chapter 6  Data Files
   

        Stable - Technical Graphs can read and chart existing historical
        stock market data supplied by you in any of the following formats:

           o  Technical Tools
           o  Commodity Systems, Inc. (CSI)
           o  MetaStock
           o  ASCII (comma-separated value CSV)

        
        6.1  ASCII Data Files
        ---------------------
        Stable - Technical Graphs can read data files containing "flat"
        ASCII information - where each record in the file consists of ASCII
        data terminated by a carriage return/linefeed combination.  Each
        record in the file consists of multiple fields separated by either a
        comma (",") or tab character.  White space may freely be interspersed
        within the data file.
   
        Stable - Technical Graphs itself does not provide facilities for
        retrieving or creating the data files that you will graph.  However,
        ASCII files can be created or generated in a variety of ways:
    
           o  Downloading of financial information from online databases such
              as Dow Jones News Retrieval and CompuServe.  Once retrieved,
              this data must usually be editted by you to conform to this
              ASCII file format.
   
           o  Exporting of data from spreadsheet programs such as Microsoft
              Excel or Lotus 1,2,3.  For example, if you are using Excel,
              simply save your securities data in ".CSV" (comma-separated
              values) format with the necessary header information identified
              in this section.  Read your specific product documentation on
              how to save and/or export spreadsheet files.
   
           o  Manually using a text editor that can create ASCII file 
              information.  This method would be described as the manual
              method of creating data - where you enter the data printed
              in your local newspaper or business journal.
   
        Almost any type of data can be graphed using Stable - Technical 
        Graphs, so long as each line of data contains at least a date and a 
        closing value.  The closing value can represent any numeric value; 
        such as the daily close for a stock or mutual fund, the prime rate
        for that day, or the closing Dow Jones Industrial Average.
   
        Stable - Technical Graphs reads and interprets ASCII numeric values
        found in your data files in a variety of formats:
        
           o  Floating point decimal values (i.e., 34.65) for data related 
              to such items as market indexes (i.e., DJIA, SP500), mutual 
              funds, and various currency information.

                                                              Data Files  6-2
   
   
   
           o  Standard fractional values (i.e., 64 1/8, 20 1/2) for 
              representing data specific to stocks, options, and corporate 
              bonds.
   
           o  Special fractional values (i.e., 76:18) for data representing
              1/32ths; such as Government Agency Issues (ie. FNMA, GNMA,
              World Bank) and Treasury Bonds, Notes and Bills.


        6.2 General ASCII Format
        ------------------------
        The general format of all ASCII data files that Stable - Technical
        Graphs can interpret is as follows:
        
           <Record_Count>
           <Format_String>
           Data_Record_1
           Data_Record_2
                 -
                 -
           Data_Record_N
        
        <Record_Count> is the number of actual data records in the file
        (excluding the <Record_Count> and <Format_String> records).
        
        <Format_String> is a description of the format of each data record
        in the file.  This string consists of the characters "DVOHLCI" which 
        specifies both the sequence and type of data fields in each record:
        
           D represents a Date field
               This entry can be either 'D' for daily data, 'W' for weekly
               data, 'Q' for quarterly data, 'M' for monthly data, or 'Y'
               for yearly data.

               Additionally, a modifier character can follow the 'D' entry
               to identify a specific date format as identified below:
               
                  0   = mm/dd/yy  (also the default if '0' is omitted)
                  1   = mmddyy
                  2   = yy/mm/dd
                  3   = yymmdd
                  4   = dd/mm/yy
                  5   = ddmmyy

           V represents a  Volume field (or short interest).
           O represents an Open   field.
           H represents a  High   field.
           L represents a  Low    field.
           C represents a  Close  field.
           I represents an Open Interest field.

                                                              Data Files  6-3
   
   
   
        Data_Record_n represents each ASCII record in the file, up to 
        <Record_Count> entries.  All data records must be of the same field
        sequence and contain identical types of fields.


        THE FOLLOWING NOTES APPLY TO ALL DATA IMPORTED BY STABLE:

           o No numeric values (ie. volume, open, close, etc.) may be
             formatted with a comma (e.g. Use 12900 instead of 12,900).

           o Holiday data, or any data that includes zero (0) numeric values 
             for volume, open, high, low, or close should not be included in
             any of your data files.

           o Data is not adjusted for splits or ex-dividends by Stable.

   
        6.3  Examples
        -------------
        The following are examples of various ASCII data files which Stable
        Technical Graphs can read.  Each example is a general representation
        of a particular market group.  In all examples, the use of the comma
        to separate individual fields can be replaced by a tab character in
        your actual data.
   
        Market Index:
   
           5
           DHLC

           1/08/90,2803.90,2753.40,2794.30
   
           The above illustrates a file containing 5 data records. Each data
           record contains four fields identified by the "DHLC" line.  The
           sequence of the fields is "D"aily Date, "H"igh, "L"ow, and
           "C"lose.  Decimal values are used for numerics.  Note that 'D0'
           could have also been used to represent this date format.

           The above illustrates a file containing 5 data records. Each data
           record contains two fields identified by the "DC" line.  The
           sequence of the fields is "D"aily Date and "C"lose.  Special
           fractional values are used representing 1/32ths.  NOTE the use
           of double-quotes in the data.  Stable - Technical Graphs ignores
           these.

                        Chapter 7  Dynamic Data Exchange


        This chapter summarizes the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) support
        provided within Stable - Technical Graphs.  Much of the discussion
        in this chapter assumes you are familiar with the concept of
        interprocess communications using DDE in the Windows environment.

        The first section 7.1 addresses DDE communications as it relates
        to programming in Windows.  Section 7.2 describes DDE functionality
        as it relates to Microsoft Excel usage.

        As an additional aid in understanding DDE communications with Stable,
        refer to the file STABLE.XLM for an example of not only communicating
        with Excel, but also as a reference to the DDE command structures.


        7.1  Programmers Reference
        --------------------------
        This section assumes that you are familiar with the concepts and
        functionality associated with DDE Client/Server communications.

        Stable - Technical Graphs functions as a DDE server application;
        responding to client applications by providing technical graph
        services in the areas of chart display management and real-time
        data update.

        In the area of display management, Stable - Technical Graphs provides
        basic control over the creation and display of technical charts.

           o Charts can be opened or created by a DDE client application
             through the use of execute transactions issued to Stable within
             the "SYSTEM" topic.

           o The main Stable logo window can be controlled using DDE execute
             transactions.  Supported commands allow the window to be
             minimized, shown (normal), and closed.

           o Individual charts can be controlled visually through DDE
             execute transactions.  Among the supported command actions are
             minimize, maximize, print, show, close, and update.

        Real-time data update of Stable charts is also supported.  By passing
        ASCII data record information conforming to the underlying security's
        content, new financial data can be submitted to a Stable chart for
        immediate update and display.


        7.1.1  Application (Service) Name
        ---------------------------------
        For all DDE communication connections made to either the main Stable
        logo window or a Stable security chart, use the name "STABLE" as the
        application or service name.

        7.1.2  Topics
        -------------
        The following application topics are supported by Stable.  Generally,
        there are two classes of topics; the SYSTEM topic and individual
        chart topics.

        "SYSTEM"

           The "SYSTEM" topic represents the logical data context associated
           with the main Stable logo window.  It is through a DDE
           conversation with the "SYSTEM" topic that visual control of the
           main logo window is performed - as well as creating or opening
           new Stable technical charts through a DDE conversation.

        "<chart_name>"

           The "<chart_name>" topic represents a specific Stable chart that
           is currently in existence on the Windows desktop.  The use of the
           label "<chart_name>" in this context represents the actual file or
           security name associated with the window, and is found in the
           window's caption or title bar.

                For example, a chart created from data contained in the
                file "DJIA.CSV" results in a "<chart_name>" of DJIA.CSV.

           DDE conversations with "<chart_name>" topics allows you to control
           the chart's display (ie., minimize, maximize, show, close), the
           printing of the chart, and to dynamically add new data into the
           chart.


        7.1.3  DDE Request Transactions
        -------------------------------
        A client can send request (XTYP_REQUEST) transactions to a Stable
        server in order to receive specific information about the server.

        The following request "items" are supported within the "SYSTEM"
        topic (or Stable logo window):

           SZDDESYS_ITEM_TOPICS

                A list of topics supported by the "SYSTEM" topic.  Currently
                return information is:

                   "SYSTEM"
                   "<chart_name>"       * For each created chart.

           SZDDESYS_ITEM_SYSITEMS

                A list of items supported under the "SYSTEM" topic.  The
                following information is currently returned:

                   "SYSITEMS"
                   "FORMATS"
                   "TOPICS"
                   "STATUS"

           SZDDESYS_ITEM_FORMATS

                A list of clipboard formats supported by the server.  At the
                present time, the following formats are supported:

                   "TEXT"
                   "CSV"

           SZDDESYS_ITEM_STATUS

                The status of the server (busy or ready).


        The following request "items" are supported within a "<chart_name>"
        topic (an individual Stable chart):

           SZDDE_ITEM_ITEMLIST

                A list of items supported by the "<chart_name>" topic.  The
                currently supported items are:

                   "TOPICITEMLIST"
                   "FIELDDEF"
                   "STATUS"
                   "NEWDATA"

           SZDDESYS_ITEM_STATUS

                The status of the server (busy or ready).

           "FieldDef"

                Returns a description of the data contents associated with
                the chart.  The returned description is identical to the
                description of the <Format_String> described in section 6.2
                of "Chapter 6  Data Files".

                The importance of the "FieldDef" information is that it
                describes the expected format of any ASCII data record
                submitted to the chart for the purpose of data update through
                a DDE conversation.

        7.1.4  DDE Execute Transactions
        -------------------------------
        A client can send execute (XTYP_EXECUTE) transactions to a Stable
        server in order to perform a command or series of commands.

        The following execution "command strings" are recognized by the
        "SYSTEM" topic (Stable logo window):

           "[MINIMIZE]"

                Minimizes the Stable logo window.

           "[SHOW]"

                Displays the normal Stable logo window.

           "[CLOSE]"

                Closes the Stable logo window, essentially terminating the
                Stable program.

           "[OPEN(<type>,<path>,<file>)]"

                Opens a new chart.  This command is basically the same as
                the File New Chart menu selection with the exception that
                the associated file information is specified in the execute
                command string itself.

                <type> represents one of the data file formats supported by
                Stable - Technical Graphs.

                        CSV     Comma separated value (ASCII format).
                        TT      Technical Tools data format.
                        CSI     Commodity Systems, Inc. data format.
                        MS      MetaStock data format.

                <path> specifies the fully qualified path to the data file
                which is to be used in creating the new chart.  The file name
                itself (if applicable) IS NOT a part of this field.

                <file> is the name of the symbol or data file for chart
                creation.  In the case of CSV and Technical Tools data,
                this field represents the actual name of the file on disk.
                For CSI and MetaStock data, the field identifies the symbol
                description.

                EXAMPLE 1:  The following execution command string instructs
                Stable to open a chart using the CSV data stored in the file
                HRB.CSV (H&R Block) located in the C:\MKTDATA directory:

                   "[OPEN(CSV,C:\MKTDATA,HRB.CSV)]"

                                                   Dynamic Data Exchange  7-5


                EXAMPLE 2:  The following execution command string instructs
                Stable to open a chart using the CSI data identified with
                "PORK BELLIES" in the C:\QUICK\DATA\MEATS directory:

                   "[OPEN(CSI,C:\QUICK\DATA\MEATS,PORK BELLIES)]"

                EXAMPLE 3:  The following execution command string instructs
                Stable to open a chart using the MetaStock data identified
                with "BOEING" in the C:\MS\DATA directory:

                   "[OPEN(MS,C:\MS\DATA,BOEING)]"

                EXAMPLE 4:  The following execution command string instructs
                Stable to open a chart using the Technical Tools data stored
                in the file SP___88Z.TTT (S&P Dec '88 Tick Data) located in
                the C:\TECHTOOL\SP directory:

                   "[OPEN(CSV,C:\TECHTOOL\SP,SP___88Z.TTT)]"

        The following execution "command strings" are recognized by a
        "<chart_name>" topic (an individual Stable chart):

           "[MAXIMIZE]"

                Maximizes the chart window to full screen.  This is useful
                for when a chart will be printed.

           "[MINIMIZE]"

                Minimizes the chart window to an icon.

           "[SHOW]"

                Displays the chart in its last display size.

           "[CLOSE]"

                Closes the chart's window, effectively removing the chart
                from the Windows desktop.

           "[PRINT]"

                Instructs a chart to print itself to the default system
                printer.  Before instructing a chart to print itself, the
                chart should either be displayed normally, or maximized.
                This can be accomplished by issuing the following DDE execute
                command string to the chart:

                   "[MAXIMIZE][PRINT]"

           "[UPDATE]"

                Instructs the chart to redraw its contents.  Normally this
                instruction will never be necessary as charts update
                automatically when new data is submitted.

        7.1.5  DDE Poke Transaction
        ---------------------------
        A client application can send unsolicited data to a Stable chart
        through use of the DDE poke (XTYP_POKE) transaction.  This is the
        method by which new or real-time data can be submitted to a Stable
        chart for display and update.

        The item name used to indicate new financial data being submitted to
        a chart is the text "NEWDATA".

        Data information representing new chart data is passed as an ASCII
        string of information conforming to the data field definition for
        the chart.  The data field definition for a chart can be obtained
        by issuing a "FieldDef" request transaction to the chart.  The chart
        will return a field definition string of the format described in
        section 6.2.

        Content-wise, an ASCII data string passed to a chart containing
        new financial information looks like a single record found in a CSV
        data file.  Regardless of the data type used to originally create a
        Stable chart, ASCII information is the only format supported for
        updating a chart.

        As an example, assume a chart has been created from a MetaStock data
        file - and further assume the data file is associated with the
        Dow Jones Industrials.  After establishing a DDE conversation with
        the chart, you execute a request (XTYP_REQUEST) transaction for
        "FieldDef" and receive the data string "DVHLC" (date, volume, high,
        low, close).

        In order to update the chart with new data, you must first formulate
        an ASCII string similar to the following (which represents the field
        definition previously returned), and then submit it as the data
        portion of the "NEWDATA" poke (XTYP_POKE) transaction:

                "04/01/92,32190,3232.45,3209.51,3220.52"


        7.2  Stable DDE Communications with Excel
        -----------------------------------------
        Performing DDE communications directly with Stable through Microsoft
        Excel is relatively straight-forward since all of the programming
        details are automatically performed for you.  Following a simple set
        of rules, you can easily communicate with Stable, or any of Stable's
        charts, from within a spreadsheet.

           For additional information, please refer to the STABLE.XLM macro
           file provided with Stable - Technical Graphs.  By having Excel
           display the actual formulas on the STABLE.XLM macro sheet, you
           can actually see examples of working formulas used to communicate
           with Stable.

        The following briefly describes some of the macros and formulas used
        in the STABLE.XLM macro sheet.  Details on how to create proper
        formulas and macros within Excel can be found in your Microsoft
        Excel documentation.


        7.2.1  Open HRB Macro
        ---------------------
        This macro demonstrates how a Stable chart can be created from DDE
        commands placed in a spreadsheet.  This example requires that
        STABLE.EXE be in your "PATH=" statement and that the HRB.CSV file
        resides in the C:\STABLE subdirectory (you are free to change the
        directory if required in order to access the data file).

        =INITIATE(Stable,"System")

             Establish a DDE channel with the Stable logo window.

        =EXECUTE(channel,"[OPEN(CSV,C:\STABLE,HRB.CSV)])"

             Open a new chart using the CSV data file HRB.CSV found in the
             C:\STABLE subdirectory.

        =TERMINATE(channel)

             Terminate the DDE conversation.

        =RETURN()

             Terminate the macro.


        7.2.2  Poke HRB Macro
        ---------------------
        This macro demonstrates a technique for adding data found in a
        spreadsheet directly into an existing Stable chart.

             * If you want to see the visual results of the data being
               added to the HRB.CSV chart, resize Excel and the HRB.CSV
               chart so that both are visible on the screen before
               executing this macro.


        =INITIATE(Stable,"HRB.CSV")

             Establishes a DDE conversation with the HRB.CSV chart window.

        =POKE(channel,"NEWDATA",$A15:$E15)
        =POKE(channel,"NEWDATA",$A16:$E16)
        =POKE(channel,"NEWDATA",$A17:$E17)

             This set of instructions retrieves the six rows of financial
             data found in the macro sheet and submits each individually to
             the HRB.CSV chart.  The "$A12:$E12" parameter essentially tells
             Excel to format the data in that row as ASCII and comma
             separated.

        =TERMINATE(channel)

             Terminate the DDE conversation.

        =RETURN()

             Terminate the macro.


        7.2.3  Show HRB Macro
        ---------------------
        This macro demonstrates how commands can be issued to a chart in
        order to control its appearance.

        =INITIATE(Stable,"HRB.CSV")

             Establishes a DDE conversation with the HRB.CSV chart window.

        =EXECUTE(channel,"[SHOW]")

             This command instructs the HRB.CSV chart to display itself.

        =TERMINATE(channel)

             Terminate the DDE conversation.

        =RETURN()

             Terminate the macro.


        7.2.4  Supported =EXECUTE() Commands

        The list of commands that can be used with =EXECUTE() formula are
        explained above in section 7.1.4.

   
   
                        Chapter 8  Technical Indicators


        This appendix summarizes those technical indicators found in the
        evaluation copy of Stable - Technical Graphs, Version 1.10.

        8.1  Moving Averages
        --------------------
        Generally, moving averages are used to smooth out the data values
        used for technical analysis; helping to eliminate both large and
        small fluctuations normally found in the data, and to help identify
        the directional trend of the data being averaged.

        Stable - Technical Graphs supports three different types of moving
        average calculations; the simple moving average, the weighted moving
        average, and the exponential moving average.  Any of these moving
        averages can be applied to the base data associated with almost all
        graphs found in the product.

        The calculation of the simple moving average simply adds together a
        number of the most recent data values and divides the resulting sum
        by the total number of values being added together.  For example, a
        ten day moving average is computed as the sum of the ten most recent
        data values, divided by 10.  In the simple moving average system, all
        data values are given an equal "weight" - effectively assigning the
        same importance to each data element used to calculate the average.
        Some people feel that it would make more sense to assign greater
        importance to the more recent data and criticize the simple moving
        average for lacking this.

        The weighted moving average is similar to the simple moving average
        except that each value being considered in the average is assigned a
        specific "weight".  The greatest weight is assigned to the most
        recent data value, while the least weight is given to oldest value.
        This has the effect of associating "greater importance" to more
        recent data when calculating this average.  The assignment of
        specific data value "weights" is performed automatically by the 
        program.  Stable uses the method of assigning the ordinal value of
        the data item within the list as the weight.  Calculating a 5 day
        average for example, the first value is multiplied by 1, the second
        by 2, the third by 3, the fourth by 4, and the fifth by 5.  The five
        resultant products are then added together and divided by 15 
        (1+2+3+4+5) to determine the average.

        The exponential moving average is somewhat similar to the weighted
        moving average in that the most recent data is also assigned more
        importance than data further back in time.  However, instead of
        "weighting" each individual data value, a "fixed weight" is assigned
        to today's (the most recent) value, while all of the remaining weight
        is given to the previous value of the exponential moving average
        itself.  In calculating this moving average, you begin by first
        establishing the average as equal to the first day's data, then
        moving through the series of data - multiplying each new recent
        value by some fixed weight (like 12%) and the previous value of the
        average itself by the all the remaining weight (88% in this case).

        -----------------------------------------------
        Both the Negative Volume and Positive Volume Indexes are indicators
        based upon the premise that trading volume increases when
        unsophisticated investors are active in the market, while the so-
        called "smart money" investors are busy in the market during periods
        of declining volume.  The price direction on days of declining volume
        may then indicate "smart money" accumulation or distribution if the
        change is positive or negative respectively.  The primary distinction
        between these two indicators is simply which volume move is being
        measured.
        
        The NVI calculation is related to negative, or falling volume.  When
        the volume decreases from the previous period (rising volume does not
        affect this indicator), the NVI is adjusted by the percentage change
        in the price.  Specific to the NVI, long positions are taken when the
        indicator crosses ABOVE its moving average.
        
        The PVI calculation is related to positive, or rising volume.  When
        the volume increases from the previous period (falling volume does
        not affect this indicator), the PVI is adjusted by the percentage
        change in the price.  Effectively, PVI measures what the "uninformed"
        masses are doing - and long positions are taken when the PVI crosses
        BELOW its moving average.
        
   
        8.3  On-Balance Volume
        ----------------------
        The On-Balance Volume Indicator (developed by Joseph Granville) is
        used to indicate whether an accumulation or distribution of shares
        for a security is occurring by studying the security's volume
        activity in relation to the price change.  The basic theory behind
        the OBV indicator is that it tends to exhibit trend changes in
        advance of price changes - therefore look for a change in the OBV
        trend to suggest a forthcoming change in the price trend.
        
        The OBV indicator is a cumulative total of volume calculated by
        adding the entire day's volume to the total if the price rises for
        that day, and subtracting the entire day's volume if the price falls
        for that day.  (See Volume Trend for a variation of this indicator).
        
        
        8.4  Oscillators (Price and Volume)
        -----------------------------------
        The Price and Volume Oscillators are indicators representing the
        difference between two moving averages of the respective price or
        volume data.  When plotted, the oscillator rises and falls through
        a "zero line" - and represents the actual "crossing" of the two
        moving averages.

                                                    Technical Indicators  8-3
   
   
        As the oscillator crosses and moves above the zero line, this
        indicates that the first moving average is moving upwards at a faster
        rate than the second average.  This can be interpreted as a rising
        trend and, if the first average is based on a shorter time period
        than the second, that the short term trend is currently stronger than
        the long term trend.
        
        If the oscillator crosses and moves below the zero line, this is an
        indication that the first moving average is falling at a rate faster
        than the second average.  This can be interpreted as a falling
        trend and, if the first average is based on a shorter time period
        than the second, that the short term trend is now weaker than the
        long term trend.
        One way to help visualize an oscillator is to create a Stable chart
        containing both a Price Graph (with two moving averages), and a Price
        Oscillator Graph based on the same two moving averages.  As the
        moving averages cross each other on the Price Graph, you will see the
        Price Oscillator line cross its zero line.

        You can also use an Oscillator graph to track when a single moving
        average crosses the data which it is based upon - by setting the
        first oscillator unit to 1 and the second to the moving average units
        you want to plot.  The resultant oscillator graph then shows when the
        moving average crosses the underlying data.  The higher the
        oscillator, the greater the data is above its moving average, and
        conversely on the downside.


        8.5  Price Channel (Trading Band)
        ---------------------------------
        Available only on Price Charts, the Price Channel or Trading Band is
        a special indicator used to envelop price activity within a specific
        trading range.  The Price Channel is created by calculating a single
        moving average (either simple, weighted, or exponential), and then
        displaying the moving average line (shifted vertically) an equal
        percentage both above and below its calculated value.
        
        While the Price Channel can be manually created using two individual
        moving averages, the Price Channel greatly simplifies the task.

        
        8.6  Price Momentum
        -------------------
        Price momentum is the ratio between today's price and the price some
        specified number of units in the past.

        High Momentum readings sometimes imply that the security is in an
        overbought condition, while extremely low readings may suggest an
        oversold situation.

                 (Today's value - N_units_ago value) * 100

        Price Momentum and Price Rate of Change are essentially the same
        technical indicator.

                                                    Technical Indicators  8-4
   
   
        8.7  Rate of Change (Price and Volume)
        --------------------------------------
        The Rate of Change (ROC) is a method used to measure the momentum of
        a security.  Rate of Change is computed as the percentage change
        between today's value (price or volume) and the associated value some
        specified number of units in the past.

        High Rate of Change readings sometimes imply that the security is in
        an overbought condition, while extremely low readings may suggest an
        oversold situation.

                 (Today's close - N_units_ago close) / N_units_ago close


        8.8  Volume
        -----------
        The Volume Indicator displays the security's trading volume as
        vertical bars for each day of data.  The base value for the Volume
        Graph is the lowest volume value for the current graphing period.


        8.9  Negative/Positive Volume Trend (NVT/PVT)
        ---------------------------------------------
        The Volume Trend indicators are variations of the basic On-Balance
        Volume indicator.  The primary difference between these indicators
        and the OBV is in what portion of the day's volume is used to
        determine the new indicator value.  Unlike the OBV (which applies
        the entire day's volume), both NVT and PVT use only a portion of
        the volume determined as a percentage of the price change from the
        previous day.  In effect, these indicators consider the magnitude of
        the period's price change - whereas OBV does not.

        The major distinction between the NVT and the PVT is that the NVT
        theorizes that the LESS volume required to move the price, the more
        significant is the event.  All things being equal, a period of low
        trading volume will affect this indicator more than if the same
        period was driven by high trading volume.  This, in effect, is
        similar in concept to the Negative Volume Index - where we're looking
        for "smart money" activity in the market.

        
        8.10  Weighted Close
        --------------------
        The Weighted Close is simply a weighted indicator of the closing
        values for a security.  It is calculated daily by adding the
        security's high and low value to the closing value doubled - then
        dividing the result by four.

                  ( (Today's close * 2) + High + Low ) / 4

                                                    Technical Indicators  8-5
   
   
        8.11  Commodity Channel Index (CCI)
        -----------------------------------
        The Commodity Channel Index, originally developed by Donald Lambert,
        is a tool that assists in identifying when an underlying security's
        cycle trend is in effect.  The indicator is displayed as an
        oscillator with major signal lines at +100 and -100.  The general
        interpretation is that when the oscillator breaks through either
        of these lines, it is an indication that the security may be starting
        a new trend.


        8.12  Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD)
        --------------------------------------------------
        Developed by Gerald Appel, the MACD is a widely used oscillator
        derived from the differential of two exponential moving averages;
        a short term average and a longer term average.

        In a trending market, the shorter term average will rise or fall
        more quickly than the slower long term average, thereby resulting
        in a larger difference between the two.  By plotting the mathematical
        difference of the two averages, an oscillator is created that rises
        and falls around a "zero-line".  The farther away the oscillator
        is from the zero-line, the greater the strength of the trend.

        By calculating an exponential average of the oscillator itself,
        you have what is described as a "signal line".  The time frame
        normally used for the signal line ranges from 5-10 days in length.

        Basic interpretation theory suggests that buy and sell signals are
        generated whenever the oscillator (MACD) line crosses its signal
        line.  When the MACD line crosses from below to above the signal
        line, a buy signal is in effect.  When the MACD line crosses from
        above to below the signal line, a sell signal is generated.

        Experiment with different exponential average periods for the MACD
        oscillator and look for divergences between the price action and
        the MACD oscillator itself to help identify the most profitable
        trading signals.


        8.13  Open Interest
        -------------------
        The Open Interest Indicator displays the security's open interest as
        vertical bars for each day of data.  The base value for the Volume
        Graph is the lowest value for the current graphing period.

                                                    Technical Indicators  8-6
   
   

        8.14  Relative Strength
        -----------------------
        The Relative Strength graph allows you to compare the price action
        between two securities or other financial index - typically used
        to compare a security against its associated "index" or base.  For
        example, you might construct a relative strength graph comparing how
        IBM is performing against the DJIA as a whole , or how Exxon is
        performing against Chevron.

        Calculated simply by dividing the security's value by the comparitive
        financial item, the Relative Strength measures the relationship
        between the two.  An important point to remember is that this
        indicator represents the relative relationship between the items,
        and does not directly reflect individual price action.  As a result,
        even if both securities prices are falling, the Relative Strength
        line will move upwards if the primary security's prices are falling
        less than the relative security.


        8.15  Relative Strength Indicator (RSI)
        ---------------------------------------
        The Relative Strength Indicator was developed by Wells Wilder in an
        effort to measure the internal strength of a security.  Unlike the
        Relative Strength graph described above which compares two financial
        items, the RSI oscillator determines the momentum strength within
        a single security.

        The RSI calculation serves to resolve two issues related to the
        normal determination of a momentum indicator; the smoothing out
        of erratic price movements, and to provide a normalized trading range
        for comparison purposes.

        The RSI graph presents the indicator as fluctuating between the
        values of 0 and 100.  Traditionally, lines are drawn on the graph
        at the 70 and 30 levels; representing overbought and oversold points
        respectively.  Once an overbought or oversold situation presents
        itself, look for a price trend reversal for an actual buy or sell
        signal.
