        PREFACE
        
        ABOUT THIS MANUAL
        
        You will notice that this manual is concise.  This is intentional
        as we strived to make WinDupe the easiest program of its type to
        use.  We opted to provide an extensive built-in user help system.
        Feel free to use this reference manual to install and get
        acquainted with the program.
        
        For many of you, this may be your first exposure to Shareware.
        To help eliminate possible confusion, we have included a short
        description of the Shareware marketing concept, explaining what
        it is and why it relies on YOU for its survival.
        
        What is Shareware?  Shareware is not a kind of software.  It is a
        revolutionary method of marketing Commercial software.  Our
        software is Commercial software that we are allowing you to
        examine for 15 days before you make the purchase decision.  With
        traditional marketing methods, you have to purchase Commercial
        software from a computer store or through mail order businesses,
        then try it out, and hope it does what you want.  Shareware
        allows you to "try before you buy!"
        
        We rely upon you, the customer, to examine our software.  If you
        find it useful, please register.  Your support is needed for us
        to continue to improve our products.
        
        Enough of this verbage.  The real fun and learning begin when you
        use the program.  So, enjoy!
        
        With warmest regards,

        WHAT IS WINDUPE?
        ================
        
        WinDupe is a powerful diskette duplicator for Windows 3.x that
        allows you to:
        
        1.  Load any size diskette into memory in a single pass.
        
        2.  Copy, compare, or write the diskette to a disk file.
        
        3.  Format diskettes providing several options like quick format.
        
        4.  Work with diskettes in the background allowing several things
        to take place at once.
        
        5.  Automatically convert diskettes from a lower capacity to a
        higher capacity during the copy and compare operations.  For
        example, load a 360K diskette and copy it to a 1.44M diskette.
        Try that with DOS!

        HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
        =====================
        
        1.  IBM PC/XT/AT, IBM PS/2, or fully compatible computer capable
        of running Windows 3.0 or later.
        
        2.  At least one 5.25" or 3.5" floppy disk drive.  Two floppy disk
        drives or one floppy and a hard disk (300K free space minimum for
        the full system) are strongly recommended.
        
        3.  Enough free memory (real or virtual) to hold an entire diskette
        in memory.
        
        
        INSTALLATION - README.DOC
        =========================
        
        For all installation information see the README.DOC on the main
        distribution diskette.  You can view the information on-line or
        print it out on your printer.  README.DOC is constantly updated
        to contain the latest information.
        
        P.S. The Shareware version of WinDupe is complete.  However, it
        is a 15 day trial version.  Also, additional product information
        screens are added.
        
        Feel free to share ONLY the Shareware version with friends and
        potential users of WinDupe for 15 day trial/evaluation purposes
        only.  You may not use the Shareware version on other machines in
        order to avoid purchasing additional copies of the full program.
        You may not give away any copies or make more than one copy of
        the fully operational program for other than archival purposes.
        The full version of WinDupe has a unique serial number embedded
        in each copy for traceability.

        IMPORTANT INSTALLATION NOTES:
        
        1.  Diskette #1 contains many files in addition to WD.EXE.
        Please make sure these files are all installed in the same
        directory when running the program.
        
        2.  If WinDupe does not run properly:
        
            A.  Your machine may not be 100% IBM PC operating system
            compatible or Windows may be installed incorrectly.  This is
            not always disastrous and a quick call to our phone support
            staff may solve your problem.
        
            B.  You may have a slightly incompatible Windows video
            driver.  Usually, updating your driver or re-installing
            Windows solves the problem.
        
            C.  If you have any memory resident programs or system
            drivers, try running without them loaded on your computer.
            On some computers, ANSI.SYS is suspect.
        
        3.  This manual is designed to give you a general overview and
        familiarity with the program.  More complete, up-to-date
        information is available to you through the extensive built-in
        user help (F1) system and the help button on the dialog boxes.
        When using the more advanced features of the program, the help
        screens will guide you through the toughest questions with ease.
        As WinDupe continues to add more features, you can be sure that
        the built-in help will give you the guidance needed.  This way
        everybody wins.  We don't spend money continually revising
        manuals and charging you higher prices.  You get what you want
        and deserve: accurate up-to-date information. So fire up the
        computer, dig in, and welcome to WinDupe!

        GETTING STARTED
        ===============
        
        After you run WD.EXE using the file manager, the MAIN MENU will
        appear on your screen.
        
        The Main Menu options with descriptions are below.
        
        ** File:  This menu option provides the basic exit from WinDupe.
        
        ** Load:  Load a source diskette into memory.  The diskette may
        be a previously stored diskette image (a WinDupe Disk File with a
        WDF file extension).
        
        A diskette must be placed into memory before you can do a copy or
        compare with it.  Only good source diskettes without any bad
        sectors may be used.  If you have some old source diskettes with
        bad sectors on them, format a new error free diskette and copy
        the files to it either from DOS or the File Manager.  This will
        allow you to create a new error free diskette.
        
        ** Copy:  Once you have a diskette in memory, the copy option
        will become enabled (menu option is no longer grayed) and you can
        make duplicates of the in-memory diskette.  You can even write
        the diskette to a compressed disk image.
        
        Like the load option, you must have error free diskettes. If a
        diskette write error occurs during the copy operation, you will
        need to start the copy over with a new diskette.  With todays
        diskettes there is really no good reason to work with
        questionable diskettes.
        
        Some very hard work went into this area allowing you to copy a
        lower capacity in-memory diskette to a higher capacity diskette.
        This means that you can load a 360K diskette into memory and then
        diskcopy it to a 1.44M diskette.  There will be a little over 1MB
        free space on the 1.44M diskette (1.44M-360K) when you finish.
        This is a very advanced feature that we hope you take a little
        time to admire.
        
        ** Compare:  Compare will allow you to compare the diskette in
        memory against a diskette you insert into one of the drives.
        Like the format command, compare also provides format conversion
        allowing you to compare lower capacity diskettes against higher
        capacity diskettes.
        
        ** Format:  Numerous options are provided for the format command.
        You can do a quick format, full format, full format with system,
        etc.  A diskette must format error free or you will be given an
        error message saying it is bad.
        
        ** Help:  This area provides general help for WinDupe and
        provides an easy way to print the ORDER.DOC invoice form.
        
        You may choose any of the displayed options by holding down the

        Alt key, then pressing the letter which is underlined on the menu
        item or by selecting it with the mouse.
        
        
        TUTORIAL (DUPLICATING A DISKETTE)
        =================================
        
        Now let's do something simple to demonstrate how WinDupe works.
        
        Choose the Load menu option.  Then pick the Diskette to Memory...
        option.  A Load Options dialog box will appear allowing you to
        select the source drive and whether to read only the data areas
        or the entire diskette.  Insert a diskette into either drive A:
        or B: and select that drive from the source list box.  Click on
        OK when ready.  The diskette should be read into memory.  Did you
        notice that the Copy and Compare main menu options are now
        enabled?  Also, the status area will be updated to show that the
        diskette was successfully loaded.
        
        Pick the main menu Copy Option.  A dialog box will appear
        asking you for the destination drive.  Remove your source
        diskette and place a target diskette into the same drive.  Click
        on OK.  The in-memory diskette will now be copied to the new
        diskette.
        
        Did you notice that the status area was updated to reflect the
        status of the last operation.
        
        You have just completed your first operation with WinDupe.  The
        same type of steps will work with compare and format.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
                                   Page 9

        ADDITIONAL FEATURES
        ===================
        
        BACKGROUND OPERATION
        
        WinDupe has been designed to support background use.  For example,
        you can start loading a diskette and switch to another Windows
        program.  WinDupe will continue to work in the background loading
        the diskette.  The WinDupe status area will be updated when the
        operation is completed.  If there are any errors during the read,
        WinDupe will bring up an error message box thru your current
        application informing you of the error.
        
        DISKETTE COMPRESSION
        
        WinDupe automatically compresses diskettes both in-memory and in
        disk files.  This ensures the smallest possible memory impact for
        working with diskettes.
        
        SMART LOADING
        
        WinDupe calculates the last data area on your diskette and only
        loads the diskette to that point.  This results in much faster
        operation.  This feature can be disabled at your option.
        
        AUTOMATIC FORMAT CONVERSION
        
        Automatic diskette format conversion from lower capacity to higher
        capacity formats is supported.  For example, you can load a 360K
        diskette and diskcopy it to a 1.44M diskette.  You will have
        roughly 1MB of free space on the 1.44M diskette after the
        operation.
        
        SINGLE PASS OPERATION
        
        WinDupe pulls the entire source diskette into memory at one time.
        You no longer have to swap diskettes in order to make copies.
        This saves time on diskette operations and saves you the hassle
        of swapping diskettes.
        
        STATUS AREA
        
        As you use WinDupe, the status area of the main window is updated
        to keep you informed of the status of what is in memory and
        whether the last operation was successful.  To the greatest
        extent possible, all successful operations will simply update the
        status area.  If the operation is unsuccessful, you will be
        notified via an error message box and the status area will be
        updated to reflect the error.

        TROUBLESHOOTING
        ===============
        
        If WinDupe will not run, you may have insufficient memory or
        too many memory resident programs.  Try running WinDupe with
        no memory resident programs or allocate a larger swapfile under
        Windows.  See your Windows User's Guide for help with the
        Swapfile program.
        
        If WinDupe just stops running and you get an "Unrecoverable
        Application Error," you may have incompatible hardware/software.
        Try running WinDupe in the 386 Enhanced mode (if you have a
        386 computer) to see if that corrects the problem.
        
        Occasionally, certain memory resident TSR or "pop-up" programs
        conflict with WinDupe.  In general, there is no problem, but
        there are many new programs being written without regard to the
        system requirements of other programs that may be running at the
        same time.  Remove them from memory, and try again.  If that
        fails, try getting rid of device drivers in your CONFIG.SYS file.
        
        USE WITH STACKER
        
        Stacker (tm of Stac Electronics, Carlsbad, CA) works beautifully
        in doubling the storage capacity of drives.  However, in very
        rare and demanding situations we have noticed a couple of
        apparent incompatibilities.  The following sequences generate an
        apparent incompatibility between Stacker 3.0 (r) and DOS:
        
        1.  (Assume both diskettes are already inserted into appropriate
            drives.)
        
            a.  Load a 360K diskette from an unmounted drive.
            b.  Copy to a 720K diskette in an automounted drive.
            c.  Load the 720K diskette without removing the diskette from
                the automounted drive.
            d.  Remove the 720K diskette, insert a 1.44Mb diskette to the
                same automounted drive and copy to the 1.44Mb diskette.
            e.  Select Directory from the main menu and select the
                automounted drive.  The target diskette may show no
                files.
        
        2.  Insert the 360K diskette into the unmounted drive and do not
            yet insert the 720K diskette into the automounted drive.
        
            a.  Load a 360K diskette from the unmounted drive.
            b.  Copy to a 720K diskette in the automounted drive.
            c.  Select Directory from the main menu and select the
                automounted drive.  The directory listing may show
                garbage.
        
        If either of these cases occur, it may be that there is in fact
        no problem with the way WinDupe functions.  Simply open the drive
        door of the automounted drive and close it again.  If WinDupe
        copied correctly, the Directory will display correctly at this
        
        
        
        
                                   Page 11

        point.  Alternatively, select Directory on the unmounted drive
        and then retry the automounted drive.  Again, if Windupe copied
        correctly, the directory listing will display correctly at this
        point.
        
        MISCELLANEOUS
        
        WinDupe works closely with your computer's hardware to gain
        much of its speed.  However, it never directly addresses the
        hardware without using standard DOS calls.  If you have any
        memory resident software that modifies the way DOS works, then
        WinDupe may not function properly.  We strongly recommend that
        you remove all memory resident software before running
        WinDupe.
