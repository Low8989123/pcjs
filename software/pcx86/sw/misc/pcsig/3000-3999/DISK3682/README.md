This file provides information for Shareware Distributors, Disk Vendors,
Computer Clubs, Users Groups, BBS Sysops, Information Services,
Consultants, Businesses, Organizations and others who wish to distribute
the subject software package.

THE "DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS" IN THIS DOCUMENT EXPLAIN HOW THIS SOFTWARE
MAY BE DISTRIBUTED, AND WHO MAY DISTRIBUTE IT.

Important: This program REPLACES our earlier program, BOOK OF CHANGES.
BOOK OF CHANGES should be removed from distribution at this time.

Note that the correct name of this program is "Wynter Stone's I Ching",
not just "I Ching". Please use the full name to correctly identify the
program and to avoid confusion with other I Ching programs.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
====================
WYNTER STONE'S I CHING: Author: Rosemary West (ASP); Registration $29.00 US

VERSION: 1.0b

REQUIREMENTS: DOS 2.1 or later; 512K RAM

BBS FILE NAME: ICHI??.???

APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATIONS: Metaphysics, New Age, Fortune Telling,
Astrology, Entertainment. (This program will appeal to the same customers
who buy astrology programs, so it's a good idea to list it in the same
catalog section.)

LONG DESCRIPTION: The I Ching, or Book of Changes, one of the classics of
Chinese literature, is a book of divinations originating in antiquity. Its
poetic messages are used for both fortune-telling and their insight into
humanity's role in the natural world. By tossing coins or sticks, you
create a pattern of six lines to form a hexagram for interpretation. The
"yin and yang" philosophy of the I Ching is ideally suited to the "yes and
no" or "0 and 1" mentality of the computer and its ability to generate
number patterns. Select the traditional yarrow-stick method, coin-toss, 
Computer's Choice, or build your own. You can edit the text for each
hexagram, so that the readings can incorporate your favorite translation
and commentaries. You can also add your own comments separately from the
regular text, and choose whether or not to include them in the readings.
Readings can be printed, or saved on disk for reference and editing.

SHORT DESCRIPTION: The I Ching is an ancient Chinese book used for both

Select the traditional yarrow-stick method, coin-toss, Computer's Choice,
or build your own. You can edit the text for each hexagram on screen, so
that the readings can incorporate your favorite translation and
commentaries. You can also add your own comments. Readings can be printed,
or saved on disk for reference and editing.
