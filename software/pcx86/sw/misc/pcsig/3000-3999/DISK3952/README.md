- ASCEND is not just software, but a total system.  Along with the software,
  ASCEND comes with Franklin's 4-hour time management seminar on cassette
  tape.  You can also purchase ASCEND with a Franklin Day Planner including
  a binder and a one-year supply of forms and accessories.
- ASCEND prints tasks, appointments, calendars, projects, address and phone
  numbers, etc., onto either blank pages or Franklin Day Planner pages.
  ASCEND is an incredible value at only $249 without a Franklin Planner or
  $299 with a Franklin Planner and a one-year supply of forms and accessories.
- ASCEND also interfaces with certain handheld technology and a special
  version is available for pen-based computers.  Call NewQuest for more
  information on these options.
- ASCEND is developed and marketed by NewQuest Technologies, Inc., an
  affiliate company of the Franklin International Institute Inc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q4: How Do I Install ASCEND?

- Start Windows on your computer.
- Place the Bernoulli Shareware Program Disk in one of your Bernoulli
  drives.
- From the Windows' Program Manager Menu, pull down the File option.
- Select the Run option from the File menu.
- Enter D:\ASCEND\SETUP at the Command Line then press OK.
  (If you have inserted this program diskette in a different drive other
  than D, modify the above command accordingly, i.e., E:\ACSEND\SETUP, etc.)
- The ASCEND Setup program will now run.  Enter the drive location
  where you placed the ASCEND diskette.  (This field will default to A:\).
  Press TAB to advance to the next prompt.
- In the Destination Path field, enter the drive and path where you
  would like to install ASCEND. (This field will default to C:\ASCEND.)
  After you have entered the appropriate source and destination paths,
  select OK.
- ASCEND will now be installed in the appropriate path of your hard
  drive and a new program group will be created containing two icons
  (ASCEND and ASCEND Tools & Utilities).
- Double click on the ASCEND icon (the pyramid) to run ASCEND.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q5: What is the Best Way To "Explore" ASCEND?

- You may load "demo data" into ASCEND by performing the following steps:
- Quit ASCEND if you currently have it running. Run the ASCEND Tools &
  Utilities program. Choose Demo from the menu to turn the demo data on.
- When this process is completed and the ASCEND Tools & Utilities window
  is closed, run ASCEND by double clicking on the ASCEND icon.
- The demo data will now be loaded into the ASCEND program.  Each icon
  will have demo data loaded to experiment with.  You can add, delete,
  or move the demo data in anyway you desire.
- To go through the demo data again, simply reset the demo data from
  the menu in ASCEND Tools & Utilities.  When you are ready to input live
  data, use the menu option in ASCEND Tools & Utilities to remove the demo
  data.
- Even after live data is entered into the evaluation copy of ASCEND, it
  is still possible to load the demo data again.  By turning on the demo
  data from the ASCEND Tools & Utilities, the program will automatically
  retain any live data and will automatically restore the live data when
  the demo data is removed.
- ASCEND has extensive on-line help.  The entire ASCEND manual is contained
  in summary format in ASCEND's help files.  For a quick index of the
  subjects covered in the help, select the Help/Index menu from within
  ASCEND.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q6: How Does The 60-Day Evaluation System Work?

- All ASCEND program diskettes have been designed to run for 60-days
  from the time of installation onto a hard drive.  At the end of the
  60-days, the program "times out" and will no longer allow you access.
  This allows someone to "test drive" ASCEND for 60 days before their
  purchase.
- If you wish to continue using ASCEND beyond the 60-days, simply
  purchase a copy of ASCEND and you will receive special instructions
  and "key numbers" to enter into ASCEND that will "unlock" the program
  and your data.  Any live data that you input into ASCEND during the
  evaluation period can then be utilized once again.
- If you do not wish to purchase ASCEND to continue using it beyond
  the 60-days, simply erase the files contained in the ASCEND directory
  and remove the ASCEND directory from your hard drive.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
