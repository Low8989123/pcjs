ONE MUST FALL

Written by Rob Elam & Ryan Elam



System Requirements:

500k conventional memory
540k XMS memory
VGA-compatible video card
Sound Blaster or Sound Blaster Pro (optional)

Gameplay:


This game can be played by keyboard or joystick.  To access the main menu,
press the ESC key.  Keyboard preferences can be set from within the program by
choosing keyboard and pressing ENTER for the move to change.  Better
documentation is on the way, folks!  Have fun figuring this out. The moves
should be pretty evident and self-explanitory, except for some special moves:

High fireball - Duck, Down-Away, Away, and press Punch button.
Low fireball - Duck, Down-Away, Away, and press Kick button.
Teleport - Duck, Down-Towards, Towards, and press Punch button.
     Press Towards or Away to teleport to opposite sides of play area.
     Press nothing to teleport behind enemy.
Shadow Kick - Duck, Down-Towards, Towards, and press Kick button.



Troubleshooting sound:

The driver included with this program is the CT-VOICE.DRV Sound Blaster Pro
driver supplied by Creative Labs.  If you are using a Sound Blaster 1.X/2.0
you will need to replace this driver with the CT-VOICE.DRV driver packaged
with your Sound Blaster or compatible card.  The sound has only been tested
on a Sound Blaster Pro.



Authors note:

This program is still in it's developement stages.  This release is not
intended to be a finished product, it is more like a beta test.  Look forward
to the first implimentation of this system, scheduled to be released just as
soon as I finish it...  If you want the latest release, call:
