## Information about "MISCELLANEOUS 123 WORKSHEETS"

    This disk contains a variety of spreadsheets, ranging from printing
    utilities to common financial applications (loan amortization,
    checkbook manager, etc.).  Included is the demo version of Toolkit and
    ACII driver, with mathematical calculators for solving triangles,
    creating ASCII tables and more.  Another math spreadsheet performs
    polynomial regressions.  Miscellaneous utilities allow default colors
    to be changed, the preparation of using chronological dates as column
    titles, intructions for using PRTGRAPH.COM to generate special fonts,
    etc.  There are also worksheets for time management, mail list database
    and vendor database.

Program name:  MISCELLANEOUS LOTUS 123 WORKSHEETS  
 
Author names:  NEW YORK LOTUS SOFTWARE LIBRARY
 
Program Descriptions:

An immense variety of LOTUS 123 workssheets can be found on this disk.  There 
are printing utilities to embed ASCII characters, scientific symbols, shading
characters and others in worksheet applications.  Included is a utility to re-
configure the default LOTUS 123 colors to the user's tastes, two loan analysis
worksheets, and two databases: one for mailing lists, and one for vendors.
Scientific applications are represented by one to perform polynomial regress-
ions and one to solve triangle problems. There is also a worksheet to perform
time management, and one to manage a personal checkbook ledger.

System requirements are an IBM or compatible PC with 256K, a monochrome or
Color Board, the LOTUS 123 program disk, and, optionally, an IBM compatible 80
column printer.
