## Information about "DBASE II PROGRAMS"

    Here are seven routines that will enhance your overall business use of
    dBASE II. Included are mini-programs for such tasks as: form letter
    generator, mailing label manager, a back-up routine, a library
    routine, a state-zip code checker, and a conversion program.
    
    System Requirements: dBASEII software.
    
    How to Start:  Copy the programs marked *.prg to your DBASE II disk,
    then from the DOS prompt enter TYPE DOC.TXT for instructions on how to

PC-SIG Disk No. #126, version v1 

The following is a list of the file checksums which should be produced by
the CRCK4 program on disk #9 (and others).  If the CRC numbers do not match
you may have a bad file.  To use type:  CRCK4 <filespec>

Dear Mr. Jones        

This  is  the body of a form letter.  It was first written with  a  word 
processor and then modified to become a command file.  The modifications 
are:  placement  of  question  marks at the beginning of each  line  and 
enclosing  the text in single quotes or square brackets.  In  this  way, 
each  line of text is written to the ALTERNATE file by means of the  SET 
ALTERNATE commands in MAILLTTR.CMD (which calls this command file). 

The text of the letter can be altered based on the database data fields. 
For instance,  if the content of the letter should change for  different 
states,  then  this condition can be checked and the appropriate  action 
can be taken. 


                                              Yours truly
