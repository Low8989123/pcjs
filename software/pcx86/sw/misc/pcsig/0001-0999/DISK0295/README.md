 THE FOLLOWING IS A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THE FILES THAT
 ARE CONTAINED ON THE TAX-FILE DATA BASE SYSTEM DISKETTE.

  The files ending in .PRG are the program files that make TAX-FILE work.
  MENU.PRG is the main menu program.  The SETUP.PRG contains a brief
  message on setting up system.

  The files ending in .DBF are the data base files in which records
  are stored.  The main files are TAXFILE.DBF and CHECKS.DBF

  The files ending in .MEM are memory variable files and contain the
  transaction codes and the sales tax rate (set at .04).  The sales tax
  rate can be modified.  Run the SETUP.PRG program for information.

  The DATABASE.BAT transfers .DBF files to Drive B for TWO FLOPPY SYSTEM.

  The files ending in .FRM are the forms/reports files, which produce
  dBASE II generated lists from the various data bases which are
  created by ORGANIZE.PRG.

  The files ending in .TXT are text files that explain the TAX-FILE.
  They are not run in dBASE II.  ENTER "READ" at the A> to view files.

                           ***************
                             Version 1.2
                        Copyrighted (C)  1985
                           by Peter T. Dyer

     The TAX-FILE software is a very complete TAX RECORD KEEPING system.
It enables a person with very little effort to collect records of income
and expenses and to assemble them in quick fashion in order to prepare
yearly income tax forms.

     The TAX-FILE requires that the user have available a copy of
dBASE II (copyrighted by Ashton-Tate).  At the "." prompt simply enter
DO MENU <RETURN>.  You will be taken directly into TAX-FILE.  It is
best to use TAX-FILE with a hard disk as the .DBF files grow large!

     The TAX-FILE makes use of the "MENU" approach for entering and
editing data.  It also has several built-in reports.  ESSENTIALLY, IF
THE USER ENTERS ALL EXPENDITURES AND INCOME INFORMATION ON A REGULAR
BASIS (i.e., daily or weekly at least), AT THE END OF THE TAX YEAR THE
DATA NEEDED TO PREPARE YOUR RETURN CAN BE GENERATED BY JUST "PUSHING
THE BUTTON!"  Relatively little time and effort, other than to write
the numbers on the tax forms, must be expended at "tax preparation time."

## READ2.TXT

```
     While TAX-FILE organizes all the information into neat groups, adds
up the numbers, and prints reports, the user still has much control.  A
knowledge of the dBASE II query commands will add greatly to the utility
of the programs.  The author makes no guarantee as to the accuracy of
the data entered or of the results obtained.  The user should check his or
her work.  The user must also calculate taxes owed using tax tables
supplied by the Federal Internal Revenue Service.

     TAX-FILE software is distributed free to the public.  It may be
copied and given to a friend.  If a user wants to receive a complete
manual of instructions on diskette, and the latest update of TAX-FILE
software, it can be obtained by writing to the following:
