## Information about "PRESENT"

    This diskette contains the complete set of PRESENT programs (version
    5.1), and associated utilities. It also has a set of pictures (.PIC)
    that can be used to provide a demonstration.  The PRESENT program
    provides the ability to have your computer act as an automatic or
    manual slide projector. But this slide projector is special, it has
    fades,  color changes, picture "piecing", and other things that a
    computer can do to video.
    
    System Requirements:  128K RAM, color graphics, and joysticks.
    
    How to Start:  Load DOS and type PRESENT to enter the main program.
    Consult PRESENT.DOC for program documentation.

INTRODUCTION
 
    System Description.
 
    The PRESENT Slide Presentation System is a set of easy to use programs
    that allow you to save screen images to a disk or diskette, arrange
    those images in any desired order and turn your Personal Computer into
    a full featured Slide Projector to display those images on a color
    monitor.
 
    PRESENT consists of three main programs and two utilities:
 
     The CAMERA program, once installed will remain in memory and will
     allow you to save screen images of just about any program that
     runs under DOS.
 
     The PREPARE program allows you to arrange those screen images or
     pictures into a "Slide tray file" in the desired order to be used
     by the PRESENT program.
 
     The PRESENT program turns your Personal Computer into a Slide
     Projector to make professional presentations.
 
     Two utilities are provided to enhance compatibility between
     PRESENT and other programs that store screen images in Basic's
     "BSAVE" format. These utilities are used to convert Present's
     Compressed picture files into BSAVE type files and vice-versa.

INTRODUCTION

    System Description.

    The PRESENT Slide Presentation System is a set of easy to use programs
    that allow you to save screen images to a disk or diskette, arrange
    those images in any desired order and turn your Personal Computer into
    a full featured Slide Projector to display those images on a color
    monitor.

    PRESENT consists of three main programs and two utilities:

	 The CAMERA program, once installed will remain in memory and will
	 allow you to save screen images of just about any program that
	 runs under DOS.

	 The PREPARE program allows you to arrange those screen images or
	 pictures into a "Slide tray file" in the desired order to be used
	 by the PRESENT program.

	 The PRESENT program turns your Personal Computer into a Slide
	 Projector to make professional presentations.

	 Two utilities are provided to enhance compatibility between
	 PRESENT and other programs that store screen images in Basic's
	 "BSAVE" format. These utilities are used to convert Present's
	 Compressed picture files into BSAVE type files and vice-versa.


    Features.

    PRESENT has many features that make it very well suited for making
    presentations on a personal computer. These features are best
    appreciated when using the programs.

	 * PRESENT can be run in manual or unattended modes.

	 * PRESENT will support high or medium resolution graphics
	   images, and 40 or 80 columns text screens.

	 * Slide colors can be set for each slide with 16 different
	   background colors and up to 6 palettes (4 on color composite
	   monitors).

	 * The transition from slide to slide can be selected from 12
	   different dissolve types for all slide types.

	 * Slide timings and the dissolve type can be set for each
	   individual slide in unattended presentations.

	 * If joysticks are attached, these can be used to control your
	   presentation and to move an on screen pointer.

	 * If both monochrome and color monitors are attached to the
	   system, you can "Look aside" at supporting slides without
	   disrupting the order of your presentation, skip over a part of
	   it or re-show a sequence of slides.

	 * PRESENT slides are stored in a compressed format which allows
	   for about 100 slides to be stored in a 360k diskette.

	 * PRESENT is compatible with standard BASIC BSAVE type image
	   files.

RUNNING THE DEMONSTRATION

    The demonstration can be run in either manual or unattended modes. To
    run the demonstration in unattended mode place all the .PIC files
    described above into a single diskette together with the DEMO.PRS file,
    place the diskette in drive A, make sure that PRESENT.COM is in the
    default drive and when the DOS prompt appears enter:

	   PRESENT A:DEMO *

    A title screen will appear for a few seconds and in a short while, the
    first slide will appear on the color screen and you will hear a beep.

    The beep is an indication that the presentation was started in the
    unattended mode and that it is ready to begin.

    Press the Esc key to begin the show. Each slide will remain on the
    screen for approximately 8 seconds and then proceed to the next

    When the presentation is running in unattended mode you may stop it at
    any time by pressing the Esc key. The presentation will stop and may
    be resumed by pressing the Esc key.

    To end the demonstration you must first stop it as described above and
    then press Ctrl-End, or wait until the last slide (which has been
    programmed to stop the show), press Ctrl-End and you will return to the
    DOS prompt.

    The demonstration may also be run in the manual mode, to do this, type:

	   PRESENT A:DEMO

    In a short while, after the Title screen, the first slide will appear
    on the color screen, press the space bar on the keyboard to continue to
    the next slide.

    Pressing the space bar or the plus (+) key (either one) will advance
    the presentation to the next slide, pressing the minus (-) key, will
    return to the last slide.

    Pressing the letter "A", will turn the Auto dissolve feature on
    and off. When auto dissolve is on, the slides will be dissolved
    according to the dissolve type programmed in the presentation. When
    it is off, the slides will simply be replaced.

    If you have joysticks connected to the system you may use the stick on
    joystick A to move an on screen pointer.  Pressing the letter "P" will
    turn the pointer on and off.  You may also advance to the next slide or
    return to the last slide by pressing buttons 1 and 2 on joystick A
    respectively.

    To end the presentation when running in the manual mode, press Ctrl-End
    and you will return to the DOS prompt.

    If you have both a monochrome and a color monitor, you will see that
    the monochrome will have some information displayed. This information
    is needed for using PRESENT's advanced features which will be
    described later.



HOW TO USE PRESENT

    Using PRESENT is similar to what you would do to prepare a slide show
    on a slide projector. You must first either take your own pictures with
    a camera or use pictures that you already have. You then gather all the
    slides together and put them in the desired order, place them on a
    slide tray, put the slide tray in your projector and off you go. With
    PRESENT you do exactly the same. You use the CAMERA to take pictures,
    PREPARE to put them together and assemble a "tray" and PRESENT is your
    projector.

    I. GATHERING PICTURES FOR YOUR PRESENTATION

    PRESENT has been designed to use the most common form of storing
    graphics images, the BSAVE format.	However, this method it rather
    inefficient in the use of disk space as a graphics image requires
    16K bytes of disk space for each picture.

    Compressed pictures are more efficient both in their use of space as
    well as in the speed with which they are read.

    To gather picture images you can use just about any file generated by a
    program than stores its pictures in a BSAVEd format. However, you must
    first rename the file with a .PIC extension so that it can be
    recognized by the system as an image file.

    As for text image files, there is really no common protocol other than
    possibly a BSAVE type. Text images on the other hand cannot be easily
    compressed, so the PRESENT system will only handle them in an expanded
    form.

    When PREPARE or PRESENT encounters an uncompressed file, it will use
    its size to determine the type of image. If the file size is between
    4096 and 4351 bytes (1000H and 10FFH) in length, the system will assume
    that the file is an 80x25 text image. If the file is greater than 4351
    bytes long a graphics image will be assumed. If the file size is lower
    than 4096 bytes, a 40x25 text file will be assumed.

    If you intend to use your own text image files please make sure that
    they comply with the above conditions of size and that the files have
    the .PIC extension.

    The CAMERA program was designed precisely to aid in the gathering of
    all types of picture images and it's use is especially recommended for
    getting text image files.

    In order to make a better use of disk space (and speed) it is advisable
    to compress your graphics pictures. This can be accomplished by using
    COMPRESS which will not only compress the pictures but it will also
    allow you to copy them into a single diskette.

    II. USING THE CAMERA

    To use the camera, it must first be installed.  The program when
    installed will remain resident in memory.  The program is invoked by
    pressing Alt PrtSc which will take the contents of the currently active
    screen's buffer and save it in a file, the contents of the mode and
    color registers will also be saved so that the image will be displayed
    with the settings in effect when its picture was taken.  If the image
    on the display screen is a graphic image it will be stored in a
    compressed mode.  Text screens will be saved "as is", in other words a
    40x25 screen will use 2048 bytes of storage and an 80x25 screen will
    use 4096 bytes.

    The camera's "film" consists of a file name pattern with an optional
    drive address.  The name pattern is a valid file name only 6 characters
    long.  Pictures will be stored in a file whose name begins with the 6
    characters of the pattern followed by a two digit number which will be
    incremented every time a picture is taken.	The extension will always
    be forced to .PIC.	If less than 6 characters are specified in the
    pattern, zeroes will be added to the right.  However, the count will
    always be between 00 and 99.  If more than 100 pictures are taken the
    number will be reset to 0.

    Command syntax:

    There are two options for the Camera command:

    Option 1:

	CAMERA [Drive:]Pattern

	Where:	Drive (optional, if not present the default will be used)
		is the drive letter where the pictures will be stored.

		Pattern is a one to six character field (no wildcards) that
		will become the first six characters of the filenames of
		the pictures to be stored. If less than 6 are given, the
		remainder will be filled with zeroes.

	Note: Path names are not permitted.

    Option 2:

	CAMERA	(enter)


    Option 1 is used to install the camera or to change the drive and
    filename pattern. (to change its "film")

    Option 2 is used to toggle the camera on or off. If the camera was on
    it will be turned off and vice-versa. (when the camera is turned off it
    will remain in memory but it will not take pictures)

    TAKING PICTURES

    When the camera is installed and active, two key combinations can be
    used to take pictures.  Pressing Alt-PrtSc will store the contents of
    the currently active screen buffer into the specified file and pressing
    Alt-Shift-PrtSc will store the contents of the color screen buffer into
    the specified file and assume that a graphics picture is being taken.
    This command can be given at either the command level or at an
    application program level.	Although I have taken the necessary
    precautions to allow its use at anytime, I would recommend that you
    take "still pictures".  That is to say that there be no disk activity
    in progress when a picture is being taken.	The camera will not signal
    when it has finished taking a picture, you will simply notice that the
    disk in use light goes off.  On the other hand if CAMERA encounters a
    problem while taking a picture, it will beep to indicate that something
    went wrong, either that the disk was full, the drive was not ready, the
    disk was write protected, or that there was another error related to a
    disk I/O operation.  Because of this audible signal, I would urge you
    to be on the lookout when taking a picture while the speaker is making
    sounds.

    Because of the way CAMERA is interfaced with DOS the picture taking may
    not always be immediate and the program may have to wait for an
    interrupt to occur before storing the display contents into a disk, so
    be patient. One of these occasions occurs when taking pictures from the
    DOS prompt, when you press the keys nothing will happen but if you
    press the enter or enter a command, the picture will be stored.

    NOTE: When CAMERA's graphics shutter (Alt-PrtSc) is released, it will
	 look at the BIOS Video Display Data Area to determine the current
	 mode setting in order to take the correct graphics, 40x25 text,
	 80x25 text or monochrome picture.

	 However, there are some programs that do not update the BIOS Video
	 Display Data Area when changing modes directly without using BIOS.
	 These tend to be camera shy when displaying text screens and
	 CAMERA may not be able to take the right picture.  One of these
	 programs is 1-2-3 (TM Lotus Corp.).  Pressing Alt-PrtSc will take
	 a picture of the text screens, pressing Alt-Shift-PrtSc will take
	 the picture of the graph when it is being displayed.  If you press
	 Alt-Shift-PrtSc when the color screen is displaying text, the
	 result will be a "compressed" garbage file.

    The pictures taken by CAMERA will always have file sizes that are
    multiples of 512 bytes to make the best use of a diskette.	Text files
    will either be 2048 or 4096 bytes in size depending on whether they are
    40 or 80 columns texts respectively.  Graphics picture sizes will vary
    from 512 bytes to 16K depending on the pictures complexity.  Obviously,
    CAMERA's pictures will be compatible with the PRESENT system programs.

    The CAMERA program behave like a single lense reflex camera in the
    sense that what you see is what you get.  Technically speaking this
    means that if you are displaying a text screen on the color monitor,
    CAMERA will point to the buffer currently being used so if what is on
    the screen is one of the 8 buffers of a 40 column image, CAMERA will
    get the right buffer.


    MESSAGES

    The camera program has two types of error messages; visual and audible.
    Visual messages are displayed following a CAMERA command at the command
    level.  The audible message, a beep, will sound when a picture
    is being taken and a problem was found while trying to write it on
    disk. The following messages are self explanatory:

    Using option 1 to install.

	  Invalid file mask, cannot install.

	  Camera installed and ready. Pictures will be stored in D:XXXXX00.PIC

    Using option 1 to change output.

	  Invalid file mask

	      (The current file mask will be unchanged)

	  New file set and ready. Pictures will be stored in D:XXXXX00.PIC

    Using option 2

	  No file mask specified, cannot install.

	      (You cannot use option 2 if the camera is not installed)

	  Camera OFF.

	  Camera ON.



    III. USING THE PREPARE PROGRAM

    Once you have created or taken all the screen images that you want to
    have in your presentation put them all together in the same diskette
    and make sure that they all have the .PIC extension.  This task can
    also be accomplished by using the COMPRESS program to transfer them to
    the presentation disk in a compressed form.  (see below)

    Please make sure that PREPARE.COM and PREPARE.HLP are in your default
    drive. If PREPARE.HLP is not available, the program will run, but you
    will get a message saying that help is not available.

    Now type:

	PREPARE  filename

    (where filename is the drive, name and extension of the slide tray file
    you wish to create or modify)


    The system will then read all the names of the .PIC files in the
    selected diskette (up to 100) and display them on the left half of the
    screen.  If a tray file did exist, the names in that file (up to 80)
    will be displayed on the right half of the screen.	This is the main
    editing screen.

    Assuming that you are creating a new file, the screen should look
    something like this:


    Available picture files		       D:NAME.EXT

    IMAGE01  IMAGE21  IMAGE41		       IMAGE01
    IMAGE02  IMAGE22  IMAGE42		       .
    IMAGE03  IMAGE23  IMAGE43		       .   S
    IMAGE04  IMAGE24  IMAGE44		       .   L
    IMAGE05  IMAGE25  IMAGE45		       .   I
    IMAGE06  IMAGE26  IMAGE46		       .   D
    IMAGE07  IMAGE27  IMAGE47		       .   E
    IMAGE08  IMAGE28  IMAGE48		       .
    IMAGE09  IMAGE29			       .   T
    IMAGE10  IMAGE30			       .   R
    IMAGE11  IMAGE31			       .   A
    IMAGE12  IMAGE32			       .   Y
    IMAGE13  IMAGE33			       .
    IMAGE14  IMAGE34			       .   A
    IMAGE15  IMAGE35			       .   R
    IMAGE16  IMAGE36			       .   E
    IMAGE17  IMAGE37			       .   A
    IMAGE18  IMAGE38			       .
    IMAGE19  IMAGE39			       .
    IMAGE20  IMAGE40

    (--------- Message area ------------)		Delay	Dissolve
    (------ Function key display area ----)    IMAGE01	(Time)	( Type )


    The top legends will appear underlined on a monochrome display (blue on
    a color display). The legend on the right is the name of the slide tray
    file that you are creating.

    A Bright (bright green on a color display) block cursor will appear
    over the first name of the image list.  Using the arrow keys on the
    numeric pad, the cursor may be moved up, left, right or down,
    pressing Home will take the cursor to the first name on the list and
    End will take it to the last name.	The name pointed by the cursor is
    called the "cursor" name.

    On the bottom part of the screen there is an area for messages from the
    program as well as an area where a "Delay and Dissolve indicator" will
    appear whenever the block cursor is on the right part of the screen or
    "Slide Tray Area". The last line of the screen will display those
    function keys that are currently active.

    You will also notice that when the block cursor is not on the first
    name, it will be darker (white on a color display) and the first name
    will then be brighter (light green) than the others.  This indicates
    that the first name is currently the "selected" name.  The use of the
    selected name will be described further on when explaining the SELECT,
    INSERT and MOVE functions.

    The cursor movement keys will only move the cursor within the names in
    the image list or within the names in the slide tray.  The Tab key is
    used to switch the cursor between the two lists, it will not work if
    the tray list is empty.

    When the cursor is on the slide tray, a delay and dissolve indicator
    will appear on the lower right side of the screen and will look
    something like this:
				 Delay	  Dissolve
		       FILENAME  4 secs.  Sweep

    This indicator displays the time setting for the slide currently under
    the cursor and the type of dissolve that will be used to place that
    slide on the screen.  In the above example, the slide "FILENAME" will
    have a 4 second time delay and when that slide is displayed, it will be
    placed on the screen with a "Sweep" type dissolve.  More on this later.

    The commands that follow describe how you can fill the tray, organize
    it, select slide colors and resolution, select a slide's dissolve type,
    and if you are preparing a stand alone slide presentation, set the
    individual slide timings.


    COMMANDS

    There are several single key commands that allow you to ADD, DELETE,
    INSERT, MOVE or SAVE the names in the tray file, a command to LOOK at a
    slide in either the image list or the tray file, a command to set a
    slide's dissolve type and a command to set the timing delay for each
    slide for unattended slide presentations.

    HELP (F1)

    If you started up PREPARE with the PREPARE.HLP file available, you will
    be able to press F1 and get a summary of these commands on the color
    screen. If you are only using the color monitor, you must press the
    Escape key to return to the main editing screen. If you are using both
    a color and a monochrome, the help screen will remain displayed.

    When using both monitors and a picture is being display with the 'LOOK'
    command, the monochrome screen will provide an additional help panel
    with a summary of the keys used for setting a screen's colors. The
    system will determine what type of screen is being displayed and show
    the appropriate panel.

    If you have only the color screen, this help facility is provided by
    two picture files GRAPHELP.PIC and TEXTHELP.PIC . To use this facility,
    copy these two files onto the disk you will be using, and LOOK at them
    as required. (see the LOOK command below)

    ADD (+)

    The ADD command will add the name currently under the cursor (the
    cursor name) to the end of the tray file (if the tray file is
    empty, the added name will be placed as the first name in the tray
    file).  This is accomplished by pressing the plus "+" key (either one).
    The cursor name will be added regardless of whether the cursor is in
    the image list or the tray list and only while the number of names in
    the tray file is less than 80. In this fashion, if the cursor is
    currently in the tray list, the cursor name will be repeated at the end
    of the list.

    SELECT (enter)

    The SELECT command will select the name to be used by an INSERT or MOVE
    command. This is accomplished by placing the cursor over the name you
    wish to select and pressing the enter key. You will notice that the
    color of the previously selected name will change to normal and that
    the cursor will become bright (light green). The select command will
    operate regardless of whether the cursor is in the image list or the
    tray list, however, names that have been selected in the image list
    may only be used by the INSERT command.

    INSERT (Ins)

    The INSERT command will insert the selected name at the current cursor
    location provided the cursor is in the tray list. It will not operate
    with the cursor in the image list as such list cannot be modified. This
    is accomplished by first selecting from either list the name you want
    to insert then placing the cursor at the location in the tray list
    where you want the name inserted and pressing the Ins key. The selected
    name will then be placed at the location and the remaining names will
    be moved down.

    MOVE  (Backspace)

    The MOVE command will move the selected name in the tray list to the
    current cursor location in the tray list. It will not operate if either
    the selected name or the cursor is in the image list. To move a name,
    take the cursor to the tray list (tab key), SELECT the name to be
    moved, move the cursor to the new location where you want the name
    moved and press the Backspace key (large left arrow in the top row).
    The selected name will be removed from its old location and inserted at
    the current cursor location.  You will also notice that the cursor will
    change to bright as it will now be over the currently selected name.

    DELETE (Del)

    The DELETE command will remove the cursor name from the tray list.	It
    will not operate with the cursor on the image list as such list cannot
    be modified.  To delete a name, place the cursor over the name in the
    tray list you want removed and press the Del key.  The cursor name will
    be removed and the remaining names moved up.  If the deleted name was a
    selected name, the name then resulting under the cursor will become the
    selected name.  By the same token, if the name removed was the last one
    on the tray list, it will be removed and the cursor will also move up.
    If only one name is left on the tray list the delete command will not
    operate.

    SAVE (S)

    The SAVE command will write the tray file to disk.	To save the file
    press the S key and the tray file will be saved.  You will notice
    that the disk drive "in use" light will go on while the file is being
    written.  However, if no changes were made to the file since the last
    save (with ADD, DELETE, MOVE, INSERT, SET DELAY or SET DISSOLVE), the
    unnecessary save will not be executed.  The save command may be given
    regardless of where the cursor is located.


    SET DELAY (F7 - F8)

    The timing delay is the amount of time a slide will remain on the
    screen when the PRESENT program is run in the unattended mode.

    When the cursor is in the tray area, the delay and dissolve indicator
    in the bottom right of the screen will display the name of the slide
    pointed to by the cursor and the time currently set for the slide.
    Every time you move the cursor, this information will change to show
    the setting for each slide.

    To set or change a slide's time setting, point to the slide in the
    tray area and press F7 or F8 to scroll to the setting desired. Every
    time you press one of theses keys, a new setting will appear
    indicating the new delay. Delays are expressed in second with the
    following exceptions:

	 Delay	   Comment
	 --------  -----------
	 Flash	   The slide will flash on the screen
		   during the time it takes the system to
		   read the next slide from the disk.

	 STOP	   When the presentation reaches this slide
		   it will stop, the *STOPPED* message will
		   appear, and the system will beep.  To
		   resume you MUST first advance manually to
		   the next slide and press escape.
		   OTHERWISE IT WILL DISPLAY THE SLIDE AGAIN
		   AND STOP AGAIN

	 Default   The time will default to the one set when
		   starting PRESENT.


    Whenever a slide is added to the list, its timing will be set to
    "default".  If a slide is inserted from the list area its timing will
    also be "default".  If a slide is moved to another place, its timing
    will go with it.


    SET DISSOLVE TYPE (F9 - F10)

    The dissolve type is the method used to place a slide on the screen
    when it is to be displayed.

    When the cursor is in the tray area, the delay and dissolve indicator
    in the bottom right of the screen will display the name of the slide
    pointed to by the cursor and the dissolve type that will be used for
    that slide.  Every time you move the cursor, this information will
    change to show the setting for each slide.

    To set or change a slide's dissolve type, point to the slide in the
    tray area and press F9 or F10 to scroll to the desired type.  Every
    time you press one of these keys, a new dissolve type will appear.

    PRESENT offers 12 different dissolve types as follows:

    Name	Description
    ---------	-----------
    Replace	The slide will immediately replace the old one.

    Fade in	The slide will slowly fade in and the previous slide will
		gradually fade out.

    Pull Down	Starting from the top of the screen, the slide will be
		pulled down over the old one.

    Pull Up	Same as pull down but starting at the bottom and pulled up

    Close	The slide will start to appear on both sides of the screen
		moving toward the center and closing in the middle.

    Merge	The slide's image is divided evenly into two sets of lines,
		each set will start to appear on one side of the screen
		moving toward the other and form the new image as they
		merge in the middle.

    Pull Right	Same as pull down but starting on the left side of the
		screen moving right.

    Pull Left	Same as above but right to left.

    Open	It is the opposite of Close, the image starts in the center
		and moves out to the side like an opening curtain.

    Sweep	Simulating a radar screen, the slide will begin as a line
		going from the top center of the screen and sweep around
		over the old slide.

    Squeeze	The slide will start at all the screens edges moving
		towards the center squeezing out the old slide.

    Expand	The opposite to squeeze, the slide starts in the middle of
		the screen and expands out to all the edges.


    Whenever a slide is added to the list, its dissolve type will be set to
    "Replace".  If a slide is inserted from the list area its dissolve type
    will also be "Replace".  If a slide is moved to another place, its
    dissolve type will go with it.



    LOOK (L)

    The LOOK command displays the picture image of the cursor name.  To
    look at a picture, place the cursor over the name of the picture you
    want to see, press L, and the color screen will display the picture.

    If you are using both the monochrome display and a color display, and
    the PREPARE program was brought up from the monochrome display, the
    monochrome provide you with a help screen with the commands that are
    available to change the color settings of the type of picture being
    displayed. If PREPARE.HLP was not available, the message:

	Color keys active, press Esc to end

    will appear in the message area.  This is to indicate you are now in
    the display mode and that the keyboard will only respond to commands
    that affect the displayed picture.	To return control to the list
    screen, press the Esc key, the picture will remain on the color display
    but the message will disappear indicating that the keyboard now
    controls the list screen.

    If on the other hand, you are using only the color display, the editing
    screen will be saved and the picture will be shown.  However, although
    the above message cannot be seen, it still hold true.  In other words,
    you are now in the display mode and the keyboard will only respond to
    commands that affect the displayed picture until the Esc key is
    pressed.  When the Esc key is pressed the picture will be cleared and
    the editing screen restored.

    Once in the display mode you may change the color settings and if you
    wish, place the new settings in the selected picture image file.


    Changing the background color (Border color on text screens)

	 The standard 16 background colors are available.  Three keys can
	 be used to change the color as follows.

	 Pressing the left arrow key will decrease the color (change it to
	 the previous color).

	 Pressing the right arrow key will increase the color (change it to
	 the next color).

	 Pressing the up arrow key will change the color's intensity
	 (change from light to dark or vice-versa)

    Changing palette colors (Graphics screen)

	 PREPARE and PRESENT provide six different color palettes to chose
	 from as follows:

	 1. Cyan, Magenta, White       2. Lighter shades of palette 1
	 3. Green, Red, Brown	       4. Lighter shades of palette 3
	 5. Cyan, Red, White	       6. Lighter shades of palette 5

	 NOTE: Palettes 5 and 6 are only available in RGB monitors.


	 To change palettes, press the down arrow until the desired palette
	 of colors appears.

    Switching Resolution (Graphics screens)

	 The system normally assumes that a picture file is a medium
	 resolution picture image.  Pressing the Home key will change the
	 screen to a high resolution display mode and back.

	 High resolution pictures will always have a black background and
	 the foreground color may be any of the 16 colors available as
	 background for medium resolution.  therefore, you may change the
	 foreground color of a high resolution picture by pressing the
	 left, up and right cursor arrows described above.

	 You will notice that the screen may sometimes go black, this will
	 happen when the medium resolution's background color was black and
	 thus will be the pictures foreground color.  To remedy this, press
	 the left, up or right arrow keys to change the foreground color.

    Reversing a picture (Graphics screens)

	 Pressing the PgUp key will "Reverse" the displayed image producing
	 the effect of a negative image.  In high resolution the result is
	 that the background color becomes the foreground and vice-versa,
	 in medium resolution, color 3 will switch with the background
	 color (color 0) and color 2 will switch with color 1.	On text
	 screens this key will be ignored.

	 Reversing a picture image may produce interesting results in some
	 pictures.  Keep in mind however that switching the background
	 color in a reversed image will have the effect of changing one of
	 the foreground colors.

    Changing the blink attribute (Text screens)

	 You will notice that on some text screens, you will get either an
	 odd blinking pattern or a background color that doesn't quite match
	 the surroundings.  This is due to the setting of the blink bit on
	 the color graphics card.  Pressing the down arrow will toggle the
	 blink bit on or off.

    Saving the color settings

	 Once you have changed the colors to the one you desire you may
	 place the colors into the picture image file by pressing the
	 letter "S".



    ENDING THE SESSION

    Once you have finished creating you slide tray and made all the
    modifications you wished press the letter "S" to write out your file
    and then press Ctrl-End.

    MESSAGES

    The following messages may be encountered when running PREPARE:

    Incorrect file name

	 This message indicated that you either omitted a file
	 specification when starting the program, or the file
	 specifications were not accepted.  You must re-enter the PREPARE
	 command.  (path names are not allowed)

    Bad Tray file

	This message indicates that the file you specified is not a
	valid tray file.

    No picture files on disk

	 This message appears when the drive specified in the file
	 specification does not contain any .PIC files.  You must transfer
	 the picture files to the diskette that will hold the tray file and
	 restart.

    Help not available

	This message will appear after starting PREPARE and the PREPARE.HLP
	file was not found. F1 will not operate and it's prompt will not
	appear.

    Picture not found

	 This message will appear when you attempt to LOOK at a picture and
	 it is not in the diskette.  This may happen when after having
	 created a tray file you deleted one of the picture image files,
	 and then tried to look at it.

	 NOTE: Some utility programs that assign paths to data files (i.e.
	 a PATH command to look for files in other directories and/or
	 disks) may also cause this message to appear whenever the Disk Not
	 Ready condition occurs.

    Are you Sure ? (Y/N)

	 This message will appear when you try to end the program and
	 changes were made to the tray file after the last save.  Pressing
	 the "Y" key will force the program to end without saving the
	 changes, pressing any other key will clear the message and resume
	 normal operation allowing you to save the changes.

    No room for file, Directory full

	 An error occurred while trying to open the tray file for output
	 because there was no room in the directory.  Press any key to
	 clear the message then exit the program.  You cannot use another
	 diskette as the picture files and the slide tray must reside on
	 the same disk.

    No room for file, Disk full

	 An error occurred while trying to write the tray file because the
	 disk was full.  Press any key to clear the message then exit the
	 program.  You cannot use another diskette as the picture files and
	 the slide tray must reside on the same disk.  It is strongly
	 suggested that you save the pictures in a compressed form to save
	 disk space, expanded files take up 16K of space allowing you to
	 fit only 21 image files on a 360K diskette leaving room for the
	 tray file.

    Disk media error

	 This is a disk read/write hardware error meaning that the disk
	 operation was not successful due to either a defective disk or
	 diskette or a device malfunction.  Retry the operation and if
	 still unsuccessful try another diskette.

    Drive not ready

	 The drive door has not been properly closed.

    Disk Write Protected

	 You are attempting to write on a write protected disk, remove the
	 write protect tab.

    File allocation error

	 You are in trouble, DOS has detected that the file allocation
	 table is incorrect.  Try starting over again, if the error
	 continues, you must try another diskette.

    Standard DOS messages will appear in lieu of the last 4 above during
    the initial phase of the program before the main screen appears, please
    refer to the DOS manual for recovery.



    IV. USING THE PRESENT PROGRAM

    The PRESENT program is very straight forward in its use. Once you have
    created a Slide Tray file, place the diskette containing the slide tray
    file as well as the required picture files in the desired drive,
    connect the joystick(s) if any (if you only have one make sure it will
    be stick A otherwise don't use it).

    If you want to be able to print hard copies of any slide during the
    presentation, make sure that a screen dump program is installed before
    starting the PRESENT.

    If both a monochrome screen and a color screen are available, PRESENT
    will allow you to use an extended set of commands for controlling the
    presentation.  If you have both screens, you should start the program
    from the monochrome screen making sure that the PRESENT.HLP file is
    available in the default drive.

    Command format

	 Option 1:  Manual Mode

	 PRESENT filename

	    Where filename is the drive, name and extension of the slide
	    tray file you wish to present.

	 Option 2: Unattended Mode

	 PRESENT filename *n

	    Where filename is the drive, name and extension of the slide
	    tray file you wish to present.

	    The asterisk (*) MUST be entered.

	    n is a number from 0 to 8 that will indicate the system's
	    default delay number. If n is not present or it is not within
	    the indicated limits, a default value of 4 (8 second)will be
	    assumed.

	    The following are the available delays numbers and their
	    significance to the PRESENT program:

	     Number	Time	 Comment
	     -------   -------	-----------
	     0		Flash	The slide will flash on the screen
				during the time it takes the system to
				read the next slide from the disk.
	     1		1 sec
	     2		2 sec
	     3		4 sec
	     4		8 sec
	     5	       16 sec
	     6	       32 sec
	     7	       64 sec
	     8	      128 sec


    Either way it is started, the PRESENT will begin by reading the first,
    second and last pictures into the buffers and displaying the first one.

    A. UNATTENDED MODE

    Before starting the unattended mode, please make sure that you have set
    the desired slide timing for each slide as described above.  If you did
    not set any timings, the system will use the default setting.

    Start PRESENT using option 2.  The value entered for "n" will be
    determine the default timing for those slides whose setting is the
    default.  If nothing is entered, or if the value entered is not between
    0 and 8, a setting of 4 will be assumed (8 seconds).

    After the first slide appears on the screen you will hear a loud BEEP.
    This is to indicate that the system is ready to begin and that it is in
    a stopped state.  The program will always begin in a stopped state
    regardless of the first slide's time setting, this is to give the user
    control of when he wants to begin the show.  To begin the show, press
    the Escape key, this will start the timer for the first slide and then
    proceed sequentially slide after slide.  When the last slide is
    reached, the show will automatically begin again without stopping.

    When the system is running unattended, the on screen pointer will be
    forced off.  It may be turned back on when in the stopped state but
    resuming will again force it off.

    At any time during an unattended presentation, the show can be stopped
    by pressing the Escape key and you will again hear a loud BEEP
    acknowledging your command.

    The presentation can also be stopped from within the presentation
    itself by setting a slide's timing to stop.  When PRESENT encounters
    one of these slides it will BEEP and enter a stopped state.  However,
    considering that when Escape is pressed to resume a presentation, the
    timing used will be the one of the slide currently being displayed, to
    resume a presentation that has been stopped by a slide's time setting,
    you must first advance to the next slide manually and then press
    Escape.

    The stopped state.

    As mentioned above, there are several conditions that will result in
    stopping an unattended presentation.  In other words, it enters a
    stopped state.  When PRESENT is started up in the unattended mode and
    it has entered a stopped state, it's operation is then the same as if
    it had been started up in the manual mode.	In the stopped state, all
    the manual commands are operational.  The manual commands are described
    below under MANUAL MODE.  The only difference is that the Escape key
    will resume unattended mode whenever it is pressed while being in a
    stopped state.  The Escape key will not be operational in the manual
    mode.


    B. MANUAL MODE

    The manual mode is entered by either stopping an unattended
    presentation or starting up the PRESENT program with option 1. However,
    if the program was started with option 1, the Escape key will have no
    effect. To describe the operation of the manual mode the commands have
    been separated into two categories; basic and dual monitor commands.
    Basic commands are always available and do not require the monochrome
    screen to be used. Dual monitor commands on the other hand will only be
    available if you have two screens and you start the program from the
    monochrome monitor, these commands allow you to move around the
    presentation, look aside at supporting slides, change the dissolve
    types and therefore require that you be able to see what you are doing.


    1. Basic Commands

    As mentioned above, the standard commands do not require the use of a
    monochrome monitor, these commands are pretty much straight forward and
    will operate as indicated.



				  KEYBOARD     JOYSTICK A     JOYSTICK B
				------------  ------------   ------------

    NEXT SLIDE			+ or Space	Button 2	  *

    PREVIOUS SLIDE		 - (minus)	Button 1	  *

    BLACKOUT (1)		  Ctrl-Home	   *		  *

    POINTER ARROW ON/OFF	  Letter P	   *	       Button 1

    AUTO DISSOLVE ON/OFF (2)	  Letter A	   *	       Button 2

    MOVE POINTER		     *		 Stick		  *

    QUIT			  Ctrl-End	   *		  *

    STOP or RESUME (3)		  Esc


    (1)  Blackout will blackout the screen (it will NOT clear the display)
	 pressing Blackout again or displaying another slide will turn the
	 screen back on.

    (2)  When Auto dissolve is on, the slides will appear on the screen
	 with the dissolve type set in the tray file. Turning it off, will
	 set the  dissolve type to "replace" to allow you to advance or go
	 back faster. Turning it back on will resume the programmed type
	 of dissolve.

    (3)  The Esc key will Stop or Resume an unattended presentation.


    The speed with which you may advance depends on the drives you are
    using, although the pictures may change instantaneously (if auto
    dissolve is off), the next or previous slide must be read into memory
    before it can be displayed.  This is fairly fast, but not fast enough
    to achieve a motion picture effect even with a RAM disk.  If you are
    using the joysticks and the arrow pointer is turned on, the arrow will
    serve to indicate when you may change slides as the system turns it off
    while the disk is reading and turns it back on when finished.

    The arrow pointer on texts screen is the ASCII 27 character (an arrow
    pointing left) this character will be placed on the screen in lieu of
    the underlying character and will assume the underlying character's
    screen attributes (it may disappear if the underlying character has a
    non-display attribute).

    Notes on the use of joysticks

	 The arrow pointer will only be enabled if there is a joystick in
	 position A.

	 Holding a joystick button down will not produce a typematic
	 effect.

	 When the program starts, it checks to see if any button is pressed
	 or continuously on.  If it finds this condition it will assume
	 that the buttons are defective or not available and they will be
	 disabled so please make sure you are not pressing any buttons when
	 starting the program.

    Hard Copies

	 To print a hard copy, first turn the arrow off then press PrtSc.
	 When the printer is finished you may turn the arrow back on.
	 Please make sure that a screen dump program was loaded prior to
	 starting up PRESENT.

    Messages

	 Messages will always appear on the monochrome screen (except
	 during the initial startup phase as described later). However,
	 PRESENT will always BEEP when a message is given, all messages are
	 explained below.


    2. Dual Monitor Commands

    The dual monitor commands are those that allow the user to alter the
    sequence of the presentation or to include slides that are not in the
    presentation file but present in the disk. The latter is particularly
    useful in those situations where you may want to have supporting slides
    but only show them if the need arises, such as to answer questions or
    to cover a particular subject in depth etc.

    When in dual screen mode, you can also change the dissolve types of the
    following slides or set a constant dissolve type for the entire
    presentation. Help will also be available.

    In order to be able to accomplish this, you must be able to see what is
    going on during the presentation.  In particular, you need to know at
    any point in time what slide will be shown next, which one is on the
    screen, which was the last one shown, as well a to be able to point to
    a slide you want to show or to where in the sequence you want to jump
    to.  If a monochrome display is attached, it will do just that.

    When the program is started up, the monochrome screen will look
    something like this:


  Available picture files		       D:NAME.EXT

  IMAGE01  IMAGE21  IMAGE41		       SLIDE01
  IMAGE02  IMAGE22  IMAGE42		       SLIDE02
  IMAGE03  IMAGE23  IMAGE43		       SLIDE03
  IMAGE04  IMAGE24  IMAGE44		       SLIDE04
  IMAGE05  IMAGE25  IMAGE45		       SLIDE05
  IMAGE06  IMAGE26  IMAGE46		       SLIDE06
  IMAGE07  IMAGE27  IMAGE47		       SLIDE07
  IMAGE08  IMAGE28  IMAGE48		       SLIDE08
  IMAGE09  IMAGE29			       SLIDE09
  IMAGE10  IMAGE30			       SLIDE10
  IMAGE11  IMAGE31
  IMAGE12  IMAGE32
  IMAGE13  IMAGE33
  IMAGE14  IMAGE34
  IMAGE15  IMAGE35
  IMAGE16  IMAGE36
  IMAGE17  IMAGE37
  IMAGE18  IMAGE38
  IMAGE19  IMAGE39
  IMAGE20  IMAGE40
  *STOPPED* ---------------- Message area -------------------	  ** AUTO **
  Look Aside: IMAGE01	      Last: SLIDE10  Showing: SLIDE01  Next: SLIDE02
  F1:Help							       Merge


    As you will notice, this resembles the PREPARE screen, all the picture
    files on the disk (up to 100) are listed on the left under the
    Available Pictures Files label, and the presentation pictures list will
    appear on the right under the name of the presentation file.

    You will notice two block cursors, one of them will be on the first
    name of the image list and the other will be brighter and will be on
    the second name of the tray list.  You will also notice that one of the
    title legends, (most likely the Available Pictures Files legend) will
    appear to be brighter than the other one (adjust your monitor if not).

    Along the bottom, in the next to the last line, you will see the Status
    line showing several slide names.  The first one labeled "Look Aside"
    shows the name of the slide pointed to by the cursor on the image list.
    The second one shows the last slide of the tray list as this will be
    the slide that would be shown if you were to go back one slide.  The
    third one shows the name of the slide on the screen and is in reverse
    video.  The fourth and last shows the name of the next slide to be
    displayed if you were to advance in the presentation.  In the screen
    shown above, this would coincide with the name under the cursor in the
    tray list.

    Above the status line is an area reserved for messages.  In the screen
    shown above, the legend "*STOPPED*" appears to the left of the message
    area, this legend only appears when the program is running in the
    unattended mode and it is in a stopped state, otherwise if the
    presentation is running, "*RUNNING*" will appear instead.  If the
    program was brought up in the manual mode, neither will appear.  To the
    right of the message area the legend "** AUTO **" appears only when
    Auto dissolve is ON.

    The area below the status line is reserved for help information. If the
    PRESENT.HLP was available the prompt F1:Help will Appear. To the right
    and below the Next Slide's name, the dissolve type of the next slide
    will appear.

    The cursor arrow keys are used to move the cursors around the list
    where they are located.  Home and End will move the cursor to the first
    and last names of the list.  What cursor moves depends on the shift
    status of the cursor keys.	When the cursor keys (numeric key pad on
    the right of the keyboard) are in their base state (Num Lock off and
    unshifted) you will notice that the "Available Picture Files" legend
    will be brighter, this means that pressing the cursor keys will move
    the cursor in the image list.  If you press the Num Lock key you will
    notice that the top legends will interchange brightness, now the cursor
    keys will move the cursor on the tray list.  The same is true when a
    shift key is pressed, the legends will also interchange brightness but
    only while the shift key remains depressed.

    When you move the cursor on the image list, you will notice that the
    'Look Aside' in the status line will always show the name under the
    cursor. On the other hand if you move the cursor on the tray list, you
    will notice that the cursor will lose its brightness but one of the
    names in the list will be highlighted. The highlighted name in the tray
    list points to the name of the 'Next' slide to be shown, if the cursor
    happens to be on the highlighted name, the cursor will go bright.

    When a slide is advanced, you will see that the status line changes.
    The name that was on the screen will go to the 'Last' name, the 'Next'
    name will go to the 'Showing' name, a new name will appear on the
    'Next' name and the 'Look Aside' name will be unchanged.  You will also
    see that the cursor in the tray list will be on the highlighted name
    and will be bright. This will also happen if you go back in the
    presentation, the status line however will change the other way.


    LOOK-ASIDE

    To 'Look-Aside' at a slide, move the cursor in the image list to the
    slide you want to look at, it's name will appear in the status line.
    Now press the letter "L" and the slide will go on the screen.  Now look
    at the status line, you will see that the slide that was on the screen
    will have moved to the 'Last' name and the next name will be unchanged.
    If you now pick another slide and 'Look-aside' at it the last name will
    remain unchanged.  In other words, 'Look-Aside' slides will never go
    into the 'Last' name.  This will preserve the sequence of the
    presentation meaning that if you go back, the 'Last' name will go to
    the screen, the 'Look-Aside' slide that was on the screen will
    disappear and the 'Next' name will remain unchanged.  Conversely, if
    you go forward after a 'Look-Aside' the 'Last' name will remain
    unchanged and the 'Next' name will go on the screen.

    All Look-Aside slides will 'replace' the slide currently being
    displayed. The dissolve feature is not available for looking aside.

    SKIPPING

    Skipping is jumping within the sequence of the presentation to either
    skip over a series of slides or to go back to a certain point and
    reshow a sequence of slides.  To skip, move the tray cursor to the
    slide you want to skip to.	You will notice that the cursor loses it's
    brightness and one of the names will be highlighted, the highlighted
    name is the current 'Next' name.  To make the name under the cursor the
    next name press Enter.  Three things will happen, 1) the in-use light
    goes on as the disk reads that image into the 'Next' buffer, 2) the
    status line will be changed to show the new 'Next' name and 3) the
    cursor will go bright and the previously highlighted name will lose its
    brightness.  The system will now respond to the forward command by
    jumping to the 'Next' slide.

    HELP

    Help will only be available in the dual command mode if the PRESENT.HLP
    file was in the default drive when starting PRESENT. To ask for help,
    press F1 and both the tray and image lists will be replaced by a help
    screen. To return to the main screen, press the Esc key.

    DISSOLVE SETTING

    When PRESENT starts, the dissolve type for each slide will be set
    automatically to the type that was given to that slide with the PREPARE
    program. This is called the 'Auto-dissolve' operation and it is
    indicated by the ** AUTO ** legend appearing above the 'Next' name in
    the status line.

    The type of dissolve to be used for the NEXT slide will be shown below
    the 'Next' name in the status line.

    In other words, when the ** AUTO ** legend appears, the type of
    dissolve that will be used for the NEXT slide will be taken from the
    tray file and will be displayed below the next slide's name. If you go
    back a slide, the dissolve type that will be used will be the one set
    for the slide you go back to (it is not displayed).

    If you want to override the displayed setting, press F9 and F10 to
    scroll through the different types of dissolve available until the
    desired one is shown. The new setting will be the one used next slide
    ONLY. The following types will be taken from the individual settings.

    If you want to override ALL the settings, turn Auto-Dissolve off by
    pressing the letter 'A' (for Auto-dissolve). The legend ** AUTO ** will
    disappear and the dissolve type displayed will changed to 'Replace'.
    If you now scroll in a new type of dissolve, that new type will be used
    for all slides (except Look-Aside) until you manually change it. To
    return to the automatic dissolve settings, press the letter 'A' again.


    MESSAGES

    During execution, there are two phases in which messages appear, the
    startup phase which ends when the first slide is displayed, and the
    running phase.

    Startup phase messages (These messages appear on whatever display the
    program was started on):

    File not found

	 This message will appear if the specified tray file cannot be
	 found. The program will be terminated.

    Incorrect file name

	 This message indicated that you either omitted a file
	 specification when starting the program, or the file
	 specifications were not accepted.  Your must re-enter the PRESENT
	 command.  (Path names are not allowed)

    No picture files on disk

	 This message appears when the drive specified in the file
	 specification does not contain any .PIC files.  You are using
	 the wrong disk.

    Initial picture load failed

	 This message is an indication that there was a critical error
	 during the loading of the first pictures. This would be due to
	 either a picture file not found, a hard read error, disk not ready
	 etc.

    Bad Tray file

	 This message is an indication that the tray file you specified was
	 not a proper tray file (i.e. PRESENT PRESENT.COM).

    Tray file too short

	 Tray files must have at least 2 pictures to be used, if only one
	 picture is in the list, this message will appear.

    DOS messages

	 DOS messages for critical disk errors will appear if such an error
	 occurs in the startup phase. Please refer to the DOS manual.

    Running phase messages (these messages will only appear on the
    monochrome display)

    *RUNNING* Press Esc to stop

	 This message appears when an unattended presentation is
	 running.

    Press Esc to return to Main Screen

	This message appears when the help screen is being displayed

    Help not available

	 This message indicated that the file PRESENT.HLP was not found.
	 The Help function (F1) will not be available.

    Basic Commands only, Help not available

	 This message will only appear if you start PRESENT from the color
	 monitor and you have both screens. It tells you that the dual
	 screen commands nor Help will be available.

    The following messages will only appear on the monochrome display and
    will produce a BEEP.

    *STOPPED* Press Esc to resume

	 This message appears whenever the program, when running in
	 unattended mode enters a stopped state. The word *STOPPED* will
	 remain on the screen to indicate this condition until the program
	 is resumed, the rest of the message will be cleared.

    Picture not found	      Quit (Ctrl End) or Ignore (any key)

	 This message indicates that a picture in the tray file was not
	 found in the diskette. Make sure that once you created a tray file
	 you do not erase any of its component picture files. Pressing any
	 key will continue the presentation and the file will be skipped
	 (you will notice this on the status line). The other alternative
	 is to terminate pressing Ctrl-End.

	 NOTE: Some utility programs that assign paths to data files (i.e.
	 a PATH command to look for files in other directories and/or
	 disks) may also cause this message to appear whenever the Disk Not
	 Ready condition occurs.

    Disk media error	      Quit (Ctrl End) or Ignore (any key)

	 This is a disk hardware read error meaning that the disk
	 operation was not successful due to either a defective disk or
	 diskette or a device malfunction.  Pressing any key will continue
	 the presentation and the file will be skipped (you will notice
	 this on the status line).  If the operation that was interrupted
	 was a Skip or a Look-Aside, ignoring the error will simply cancel
	 the command.  The other alternative is to terminate the program by
	 pressing Ctrl-End.

    File allocation error     Quit (Ctrl End) or Ignore (any key)

	 DOS has detected that the file allocation table is incorrect.
	 Pressing any key will continue the presentation and the file will
	 be skipped (you will notice this on the status line).	If the
	 operation that was interrupted was a Skip or a Look-Aside,
	 ignoring the error will simply cancel the command.  The other
	 alternative is to terminate the program by pressing Ctrl-End.

    Drive not ready	      Quit (Ctrl End) or Retry (any key)

	 The diskette drive door is probably not properly closed, press any
	 key to retry the interrupted operation or press Ctrl-End to end
	 the program.



    V. USING COMPRESS AND EXPAND

    COMPRESS and EXPAND are similar in their operation to the file copy
    utility and allows you to specify input and output drives.

    The command format is as follows:

    To Compress

    COMPRESS [drive1:]filename [drive2:]

    To Expand

    EXPAND [drive1:]filename [drive2:]


    Where:

	[drive:1] is the source drive letter (optional, if not present the
		  default drive will be used)

	[drive:2] is the target drive letter (optional, if not present the
		  default drive will be used)

	filename  is the name of the file you wish to convert. The filename
		  may contain "wild-card" characters to indicate a filename
		  pattern or simply an asterisk (*) to select all the
		  files. An extension need not be specified as it will be
		  ignored, the program will only select files with a ".PIC"
		  extension.


	NOTE: Path names are not supported


    When the program starts, the following message will appear:


			   Picture Image Compress

		    ***********   WARNING  ************

		    ORIGINAL FILES WILL BE OVER-WRITTEN

		Press Y to compress, N to skip, Esc to stop

    NOTE: The warning message will only appear if the source and target
	  drives are the same.

    The program will search for the first file matching the pattern
    and ask you if you wish to convert that file thus:

		    Compress X:NNNNNNNN.PIC to X: ?

    Typing a "Y" or "y" will compress the picture, "N" or any other key
    will skip to the next file and pressing the Escape key will terminate
    the program.

    The program will continue until all the matching picture files are
    prompted or until the Escape key is pressed.

    When compressing a file, the program will check to see if the file is a
    text image file or if it is already in a compressed form and if so, it
    will simply copy the file onto the target drive.  Conversely when
    expanding a file, if the file is not in a compressed form, it will
    simply copy it onto the target drive.

    If the source and target drives are the same, the resulting compressed
    or expanded files will be written over the original files.

    The program was intended for compressing and expanding "BSAVEd" picture
    files only, but it will NOT check for their validity as such, it will
    simply read a maximum of 16K bytes and proceed to compress. If an
    extraneous .PIC file is present, the result will be garbage.


    MESSAGES

    The following messages may appear


    Invalid drive(s) specified

	 This is to indicate that a drive specified in the command line is
	 invalid.


    No files found

	 This indicates that no files were found that matched the pattern.
	 Remember, the programs will only search for files with a ".PIC"
	 extension.

    No room in directory

	 Your disk's directory is full.

    Unable to write

	 This indicates that the target diskette is full and that it was
	 unable to write the complete file.

    Standard DOS messages may also appear to indicate other errors, if
    these messages appear, please refer to your DOS manual.
