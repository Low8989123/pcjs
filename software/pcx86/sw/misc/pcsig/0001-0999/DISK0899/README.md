## Information about "ESL WRITER 1 OF 2 (ALSO 900)"

    ESL WRITER is a word processing program and four help programs
    especially designed for the writing student.
    
    Help files are included for commands, punctuation, grammar, and revision
    and can be accessed from within the program or viewed from the outside.
    
    ESL WRITER has a pull-down menu system for the most common editing
    commands, while other commands are described in detail in the command
    help file.  Use your own printer control characters for print formats
    (e.g., underlining, italics, bold print, etc.), making ESL WRITER
    compatible with any printer.
    
    INVISIBLE WRITER lets the user type without seeing the text, which can
    be brought to the screen with a single command.  This helps writers
    concentrate on their thought processes and content, rather than grammar,
    punctuation, or spelling errors.
    
    LISTER asks simple questions and provides ideas to help develop a topic
    and choose a thesis, and 1001 TOPICS contains 1,358 topics in twenty-one
    categories that are suitable for many different types of composition.
