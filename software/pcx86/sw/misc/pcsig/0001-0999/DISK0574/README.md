## Information about "FREECALC"

    FREECALC is a mature spreadsheet program with numerous features.  While
    it lacks some of the features and power of a product like LOTUS 1-2-3,
    it also lacks LOTUS's high price.  As a better than average spreadsheet,
    it is quite adequate for most applications.  Like LOTUS, FREECALC uses
    all available memory (up to 640k) and is command bar driven.  FREECALC
    also allows for a color monitor.   The disk manual is very complete and
    is 106 pages long.
    
    Features:
    
    ~ 250 rows by 25 columns
    
    ~ Column width of 0 to 70 characters
    
    ~ Text can be entered
    
    ~ Left or right justified
    
    ~ Display 0 to 6 decimal places
    
    ~ Macros
    
    ~ Print spreadsheet by disk
    
    ~ Export spreadsheet to other programs
    
    ~ Load ASCII text files
    
    ~ Support for 8087 and 80287 coprocessors
    
    ~ Up to 15 significant digits
    
    ~ Wordprocessing mode
    
    ~ Move, copy, delete and insert columns/rows

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
FreeCalc is a spreadsheet program with numerous features.  It has been
expanded from Version 1.0 and is a mature product.  While it lacks some of
the features and power of a product like Lotus 1-2-3, it also lacks Lotus'
high price.  It is a nice spreadsheet program that is more than adequate for
most applications.  It uses all of available memory (up to 640K), allows
installation of color if you have a color monitor, and is command bar
driven.
 
The disk manual is very complete, and is 106 pages long.  It's apparent that
a lot of thought has gone into developing FreeCalc, and it's paid off!  This
one is a winner.
