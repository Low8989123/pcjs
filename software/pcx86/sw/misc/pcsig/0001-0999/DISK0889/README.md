## Information about "FAMTRAK AND DOS-PRO"

    FAMTRACK is an effective management tool designed to make the
    unpleasant task of family budgeting -- if not fun -- survivable and
    profitable. It will accommodate every type of financial transaction
    common to modern families.
    
    Produce screen or printed records of monthly and year-to-date
    performance in 40 different budget categories for both husband and wife.
    It can handle as many as 20 separate financial accounts -- checking,
    savings, bank cards or charge accounts -- and will reconcile each
    account at statement time. The payment activity for as many as 21
    payees or income sources can also be tracked.
    
    Menu-driven FAMTRACK can automatically reconcile your checkbook at any
    time during the month or whenever bank statements are issued. A
    database of all financial transactions is maintained and there is an
    automatic year-end closing procedure and data storage.
    
    One of the most useful features of FAMTRACK is its loans calculator. You
    can easily calculate mortgage amortization, future values, present
    values, interest rates, payoff times, effective annual rates, and
    doubling times for any compounding period. These tools are extremely
    valuable in comparing different credit options when purchasing homes,
    automobiles, furniture, or other major items.
    
    Take real financial control and plan your future.
    
    DOS-PRO is a menu-driven utility that lists the most commonly used DOS
    commands and is very helpful to novice users. Select the command you
    want to use with the cursor. If you are unfamiliar with the use of
    that specific DOS command, an on-line help function is ready to
    explain it to you. DOS-PRO's menu occupies only one screen, and is
    divided into directory commands, format commands, and other DOS
    commands.

      * IBM-PC or 100% compatible                    * COLOR or MONOCHROME

      * Works with DOS 2.1 (and                      * 64K RAM
        above)

      * Works best with DOS 3.1 (and
        above) on a hard disk system.

                   -------------------------------------------

                                  INTRODUCTION

DOS-PRO is a menu system that lets you easily and quickly execute DOS commands
without having to be a DOS expert. Although DOS can do many more things than are
covered on your menu screen, these are the capabilities that are most used.













All DOS-PRO files will reside on your system disk (or system directory if your
system uses a hard disk). From your system disk (or system directory), pressing

                                  M  <return>

will load your DOS-PRO menu. Pressing ESC will let you exit the menu.

An extensive help file is available that provides information about each of the
menu items. Pressing F1 will display the help file associated with the
highlighted menu item.

                  -----------------------------------------------

                              DOS-PRO INSTALLATION

Make sure that your system disk (or system directory) does not contain a file
named 'M.BAT' (not very likely). If it does not, then skip the next paragraph.

If it does, then you will first need to change the name of 'M.BAT' on the
DOS-PRO diskette to something else, say 'MU.BAT'. The following commands can be
use to accomplish the name change:

                        A:COPY M.BAT MU.BAT <return>

                        A: DEL M.BAT <return>

FOR FLOPPY SYSTEMS

                1. Copy all files from your product diskette to your system
                   diskette. (Assumes DOS-PRO disk in A and the system disk
                   in B)

                   Example: COPY *.* B:


                2. Put your DOS-PRO product diskette in a safe place.

SPECIAL NOTE:

The four necessary files for DOS-PRO menu to function (MENUMGR.EXE, DPRO.MEN,
PLIC.EXE and M.BAT) will occupy 28672 bytes on your system disk. The help file
DPRO.HLP contains extensive documentation and requires 18432 bytes of disk
space. If you are pressed for space on your system disk, and are experienced
enough not to need the help files, you can delete PDOS.HLP from your system disk
without impacting the operation of the DOS-PRO menu. (Of course, pressing F1
would result in a 'file not found' error!)

FOR HARD DISK SYSTEMS

      If you are using a hard disk, simply copy all DOS-PRO files to your root
      (system) directory. To accomplish this, put your product diskette in
      drive A. From your root directory, enter: A: <return>. At the A: prompt,

                               Enter: COPY *.* C:

            ------------------------------------------------------------










                      LOADING AND RUNNING DOS-PRO PROGRAMS


The following assumes that all of the DOS-PRO files have been transferred to
your system disk if your systems has only floppy drives, or to your root
(system) directory if your system has a hard disk.

                               Enter: M <return>
                                  or  MU <return> if you renamed the file.

This will automatically load and run the necessary files. The 'MENU OF DOS
COMMANDS' should appear. It is ready to use!

To exit the DOS-PRO program (from the menu screen) you may press ESC at any
time.

Use the arrow keys to move around the menu. Notice that each time the highlight
is moved, a one line description appears near the bottom of the screen.

Pressing F1 will call a special help file and display additional information
about the highlighted item on the menu screen.

If you press RETURN, the highlighted menu option will be executed. BE CAREFUL
when selecting any of the 'PREPARE DISKETTE' options. These will cause
formatting of the indicated disk and permanent erasure of any files that are
present on it.
