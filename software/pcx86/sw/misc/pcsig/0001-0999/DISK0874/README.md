## Information about "ZZAP AND OTHER UTILITIES FOR PROGRAMMERS"

    ZZAP is a disk editor that can read, modify and write any sector on the
    disk, as well as any file by filename upon the disk -- along the same
    lines as Norton's Utilities.
    
    A 4,096-byte buffer is used to hold the information to be written to or
    read from the disk.  Editing can be done on a byte-by-byte basis by
    entering the data in hex, decimal, octal or ASCII format.  You can also
    add, copy, or exchange the data of the current buffer.
    
    Programmers -- VECTOR inspects the interrupt vector table of your
    system and displays the vectors in human-readable form with some brief
    comments describing each interrupt.  This is useful because some
    interrupts are not standardized and are difficult to interpret.
    
    Attention, programmers -- 400 inspects the BIOS communications area and
    the DOS communications area and displays them in human-readable form.
    It also displays some brief comments describing each byte of the
    communications areas.
    
    RPN is a Reverse Polish Notation calculator based on a fully-visible
    stack, especially useful to busy programmers and computer specialists.

## DEMO.DOC

{% raw %}
```

     The demo version that you have will show you the capabilities of
     the ZZAP program.  Because it is a demo version, there have been
     some limitations installed.  These limitations are:

     1 - NO WRITE OPERATIONS CAN BE DONE TO THE DISK IN EITHER SECTOR
         OR FILE MODES;

     If your requirements are such that you need the full potential of
     ZZAP, the modest price of $30.00 will give you a full operating
     version for the PC, XT as well as an optimized version just for
     the AT (80286 code) systems!  Please see the ORDER.DOC file for
     additional information.

     Please enjoy your demo version.  I hope you will find it to be of
     use in your present as well as future requirements!

Disk No  874
Program Title:  ZZAP version 4.0, Vector, 400 and RPN
PC-SIG version 1
 
    ZZAP is a disk editor that can read, modify, and write any sector on
the disk, as well as any file by filename upon the disk. A 4096 byte buffer
is used to hold the information to be written onto or read from the disk.
Editing can be done on a byte-by-byte basis by entering the data in HEX,
DECIMAL, OCTAL or ASCII format. You can also copy, exchange, or fill the
data of the current buffer. A window on the left half of the home screen
displays 256 bytes of the buffer at a time in all four input types. A demo
version of the next upgrade of ZZAP is included on this disk.
 
    VECTOR inspects the interrupt vector table and displays the interrupt
vectors in human readable form. VECTOR also displays some brief comments
describing each interrupt. Some interrupts are not standardized and are
difficult to interpret. The program "400" inspects the BIOS communications
area and the DOS communications area and displays these areas in human
readable form. "400" also displays some brief comments describing each byte
of the communications areas. RPN is a Reverse Polish notation calculator
based on a fully-visible stack.
 
Usage: Disk Editor
 
System Requirements: 360K memory and one disk drive.
 
How to Start: Type: ZZAPDEMO (press enter). Type: VECTOR (press enter),
to start VECTOR. Type: 400 (press enter) to start 400. Type: RPN (press
enter) to start RPN.
 
Suggested Registration: $30 for ZZAP, $10 for VECTOR, $5 for 400, $10
for RPN.
