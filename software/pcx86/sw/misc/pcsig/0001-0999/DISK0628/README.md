                          BIBLE-Q DOCUMENTATION

     DESCRIPTION:

          "Bible-Q" is a quiz-type game for the IBM PC and
          compatibles.  It is designed to challenge your factual
          knowledge of the Scriptures and to encourage you to dig in
          them. The shareware version of the game contains 600
          multiple-choice questions drawn from the Scriptures.  More
          questions are available through registration.

     THE SHAREWARE CONCEPT:

          "Bible-Q" is provided as user-supported software.
          User-supported software is a means for the computing
          community to receive quality software and at the same time
          support software authors directly.  It is based on the
          following assumptions:

                 The user can best determine the value and usefulness
                 of software by trying it on his own system.  After
                 trying a program one can tell whether it serves his
                 or her applications, needs, and tastes.

                 The creation of independent personal computer
                 software can and should be supported by the computing
                 community.

                 People should be able to copy programs freely to make
                 the most use of the powerful tools provided by
                 electronic information.

          If you like this program and decide to make use of it,
          please register for $10.  In return, you get the latest
          version of "Bible-Q" with 1200 questions.  I also have
          another program called "Daily Bread" available.  Please see
          below for a description of that program.  Your support helps
          me maintain my hardware and software and in turn support
          you.

          Copyright (C) 1986 - 1989 by Robert S. Smith.  All rights
          reserved. Non-registered users are granted a limited license
          to use this product on a trial basis, and to copy the
          program for trial use by others subject to the following
          limitations: 1) This program is distributed as is.  2) No
          fee, charge, or other consideration is requested or
          accepted.  Shareware distributors who charge for disks must
          have written permission to distribute this program.

     SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

          Beyond an IBM PC or good compatible with one disk drive and
          256 K of memory, no special equipment is necessary.  The
          game runs equally well on monochrome or color systems.

                                       1






    SPECIAL OFFER

          I have another program called "Daily Bread."  This program
          is a calendar which displays the day, date, a Bible passage,
          and a suggested Bible reading.  The readings cover the
          entire Bible over the course of a year.  You can run "Daily
          Bread" in a memory-resident mode and pop up passages over
          your applications.  Verses are available from either the
          King James Version or the New International Version.
          To receive the latest registered copies of both "Daily
          Bread" and "Bible-Q," send $15.

          Also available:  Quizzle, a program which allows you to
          generate your own quizzes in a Bible-Q format.  Quizzle
          allows you to use your word processor to generate quizzes as
          long as it can handle ASCII or DOS text files.  Add $10 to
          registration for this program.

     INSTALLATION:

          First you will probably want to make a backup copy of the
          game. Use the "diskcopy" command or the "copy a:*.* b:"
          command.  Then set aside one of the disks in your archive.
          To start the game, boot your computer with your DOS disk.
          At the A> prompt insert your "Bible-Q" disk in the a: drive,
          type "bq" (no quotes), and hit enter.  The game will load
          automatically.  You may also copy the files to your hard
          drive, if you have one, and run the game from there.  The
          only thing to remember is that the game must be run from the
          default drive and the default subdirectory.  For example, if
          you copy this game to a directory called c:\games you must
          be in that directory when you type "bq" to run the program.
          You can change to that directory with the "cd" change
          directory command. The program must be able to find the data
          files (cat1.dat through cat5.dat).  Note:  "Bible-Q" is also
          available on 3.5" diskettes.

      SOUND

          If you want sound while running the program, use the "s"
          switch when starting the program from the command line.
          Example:  at the A> prompt type "bq s" (no quotes) and hit
          <enter>.  Make sure there is a space between the "bq" and
          the "s. "

      COLOR

          With certain types of monochrome systems, the print may be
          hard to read because some text is bright while the rest is
          dim.  If you have this problem, use the "c" switch at the
          command line.  (At the prompt enter "bq c").

      PLAYING THE GAME:

          "Bible-Q" is meant to be easy to play.  Simply follow the
          onscreen instructions. There are modes of play.  types of
          game.  In the manual game the player(s) can choose the
          category and difficulty level of the question.  In the
          automatic game the program does this automatically.

                                       2






     BIBLE REFERENCES:

          At the request of several users, Bible references were added
          so that users can check the context of the questions.   At
          times no specific reference was applicable, so the program
          refers the user to a map or dictionary, or simply replies
          with the word "general." Here is a list of the abbreviations
          used for Bible books:

     QUESTION CATEGORIES:

          The questions are arranged in five categories--Old Testament

          Testament.  The "Old Testament 1" category contains
          questions drawn from the books of Genesis through Ruth.
          "Old Testament 2" contains questions from 1 Samuel through
          Malachi.  "Geography etc." contains questions on
          geographical facts drawn from the whole Bible.  It also
          contains general questions on the Bible. "Life of Jesus"
          contains questions drawn from the four gospels. "New
          Testament" contains questions drawn in general from the New
          Testament.  Each category has 120 (240 for registered
          version) questions.

     ENDING THE GAME:

          Press the Esc key.

     PRINTING QUIZZES

          You now have the option of printing out quizzes.  This
          option appears on the first menu.  Subsequent menus will
          display the types of quizzes available.  This feature should
          be useful for Bible classes and church groups.

     TANDY USERS (& other compatibles)

          If you have arrow keys separate from your number pad, they may
          not work for the manual mode of the game.  You may need to use
          the 2,4,6, or 8 keys for the arrow keys.

     THE BEREAN AWARD:

          Players scoring more than 30,000 points in the game get the
          Berean award on the scoreboard screen.  What is the significance
          of this award?  I can't tell you--it's related to one of the
          questions!
