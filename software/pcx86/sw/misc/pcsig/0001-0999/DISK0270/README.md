## Q&A.TXT

{% raw %}
```
Here are some answers to questions we are frequently asked.
 
 
Q: What is PC-SIG?
 
A: We were organized in 1983 as a source for Public Domain and user
-supported software for IBM-PC compatible computers.  It came as an
outgrowth of our participation in a local computer club.  We believed
that people in many parts of the country without a strong local computer
club would be interested in acquiring public domain programs.  Also it
seemed pointless for many local clubs to be duplicating the work of each
other putting together disks of public domain programs.  Computer clubs
(especially small ones) would benefit by having a source for the latest
versions of programs.  It also seemed beneficial for authors of public
domain and user-supported programs to have an easy way to get their
programs out to the greatest number of people who could use them.  Such
programs provide alternatives to expensive commercial programs, many of
which are no better than some of the public domain and user-supported
programs already available.  We have been pleased with the positive
response we have received.
 
 
Q: Are you an interest group that I can join, if so is there a membership fee?
 
A: Yes, the fee is $20 per year ($35 foreign).  Members receive many valuable
publications from our organization including a 424-page software directory,
a year's subscription to SHAREWARE magazine, bi-monthly HOTSHEETs about the
latest new software, and the following disk discount on prepaid orders:
 
---10 disks for $44 (In increments of ten disks)---
 
Membership is not required to purchase disks and the price of $6 per
disk is the same for members and nonmembers.  ($7 for 3 1/2" mini disks)
 
Q: What computers are the programs compatible with?
 
A: Most of the programs were written on the IBM PC. If you are running
IBM PC-DOS (such as the Compaq will do) you should have little or no
problems.  Users of MS-DOS may have problems running some programs.
BASIC programs may or may not work depending on how compatible your
system is with the PC and the extent to which programs use hardware
unique features.  We are unable to test every program on every compatible
on the market.
 
 
Q: What kind of DOS (1.1, 2.0, 2.1, 3.1) is required to run the programs?
 
A: Programs should work with all versions of DOS except where noted.  If
you find a program which does not work on a particular version of DOS
which is not listed, please let us know.
 
 
Q: How do I get into the programs?
 
A: Programs with the extension ".BAS" after the filename must be loaded from
BASIC or BASICA. Programs with the extension ".EXE" or ".COM" may be executed
directly by typing their name (without extension) after the DOS prompt "A>".
Many programs have ".DOC" files which provide information on how the use the
program. These files should be printed or read from a word processor before
using them.
 
 
Q: How much memory is required to run the programs?
 
A: Usually 64K of memory is sufficient to run most programs on the
IBM-PC.  Some may require more memory, such as spreadsheets for Lotus
1-2-3.  Initially programs with memory requirements over 64K were noted.
Now only a small fraction of PC owners have 64K systems so we have
stopped checking for compatibility with 64K systems.
 
 
Q: Do I have to have BASICA in order to run these disks?
 
A: BASIC programs require some version of BASIC to run.  On the IBM PC
this is either BASIC or BASICA.  GWBASIC on some systems may work ok.
 
 
Q: Are your disks double-sided or single-sided?
 
A: All our disks are formatted as double-sided. We are also proud to announce
that we are now offering our library on 3.5 inch disks.
 
 
Q: How many total programs are there on each disk or in the library?
 
A: There are now over 800 disks in the library.  Each individual disk may
contain anywhere from 1 to as many as 25 programs with the average of
about 10.  The number of programs on each disk varies with the size of
each program.
 
 
Q: Are these disks MS-DOS or PC-DOS and are they compatible?
 
A: Since most programs were written for the IBM PC they are PC-DOS.
Both MS and PC-DOS share the same disk format standard allowing files
written on one to be read by the other.  MS-DOS users should be able to
read all files on the disks.
 
 
Q: How do I make a submission to the library?
 
A: Send in your program on floppy disk along with a description of each
file (preferably on disk in a format similar to the directory listings)
and a completed copy of the submission form printed on the last page of
the PC-SIG LIBRARY directory or on this disk (file "submit.txt").
Indicate which disk(s) you would like in return.  It is the policy of
PC-SIG to compensate authors/contributors to the library with selections
from the library.
