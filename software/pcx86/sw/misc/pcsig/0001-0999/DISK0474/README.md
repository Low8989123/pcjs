## Information about "TRIVIAL TOWERS 2 OF 2 (ALSO 473)"

    Trivia freaks -- here's a new twist on an old favorite!
    
    TRIVIAL TOWERS, for two to four players, tests your knowledge of trivia
    on a variety of different subjects.  By answering correctly, you build
    ``towers.''  When all four towers have been completed, you win the
    game. There are special spaces on the gameboard, that when landed on,
    let you choose any topic of your choice.
    
    When you tire of the canned questions, enter your own questions and
    answers, and build a custom game.  How about a section on your own
    family?  How many times did Great-Aunt Tillie marry?  What is the one
    thing that Dad will NOT eat?  You get the idea.  Have fun!
