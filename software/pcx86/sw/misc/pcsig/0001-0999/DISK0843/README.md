## Information about "OMEGA-LINK"

    OMEGA-LINK is a communications program for the modem, which can be
    configured to suit your needs.  Configure the communication
    parameters, file names, modem and printer, buffer sizes, windows and
    colors.  Commands are easy-to-use, and can be viewed on a pop-up menu.
    There are 50 user-definable macros for frequently-used command
    sequences.  An on-screen clock will help you keep track of how much
    time you spend on the phone lines.
    
    OMEGA-LINK has extensive file functions to view a file, rename a file,
    change attributes, or delete a file.  Any directory listing will show
    all files on the disk, including hidden files, read-only files, and
    subdirectories.  Create or delete a subdirectory and show the amount of
    disk space available.  Change the path and default drive, and shell to
    DOS.  ANSI graphics can be toggled on or off and sessions can be
    *captured onto disk.
    
    OMEGA-LINK has several built-in file transfer protocols.  These
    protocols include: ASCII, XMODEM and YMODEM.  If these aren't enough,
    there is an external protocol handler that allows you to add
    additional protocols such as ZMODEM, WXMODEM and KERMIT.

         Omega-Link took time and effort to develop.  Like many large pro-
    jects, the credit cannot go to a select handful.  It took suggestions,
    patience, and a great deal of thinking on everyone's part to make this
    program what it is today.  While we cannot list the names of all those
    who helped us, here is a small list of some people to whom we would
    especially like to send our thanks:

                                 INTRODUCTION                                 INTRODUCTION


         Omega-Link is a program that lets you use your modem to communi-
    cate with other computers.  It was written entirely in 8088 assembly
    language, for speed and ease of use.  For the beginning user, Omega-
    Link offers powerful commands with easy-to-remember keystrokes.

         The file-system of Omega-Link can perform functions that rival
    those of MSDOS.  Any directory listing will show ALL files on the dis-
    kette, including hidden files, read-only files, and subdirectories.

         The best way to learn Omega-Link is to use it.  If you are unsure
    of what various functions do, try them.  You cannot harm anything.  If
    you are about to do something that you might regret, such as deleting a
    file, Omega-Link will give you a warning message to confirm the action.

         Good luck and enjoy yourself!



                                GETTING STARTED                                GETTING STARTED


         Welcome to Omega-Link.  These next few paragraphs are designed for
    the novice user.  If you consider yourself an advanced user and are
    familiar with the area of communications, we suggest you skip this por-
    tion and go directly to the reference manual, which begins at the
    section entitled "The Command Directory."

         Telecommunications can be a puzzling and sometimes exasperating
    field, and can require some patience in learning.  We have tried to
    make this as simple a task as possible without sacrificing power.  How-
    ever, it will still require effort on your part to learn because it
    requires not only that you know how to use Omega-Link, but also how to
    use the software of the computer with which you are communicating.

         This start-up document is not intended to teach you everything,
    and we recommend that you consult the reference manual afterwards.
    Also, please note that there is a glossary at the end of the reference
    manual, and a quick help sheet in the beginning.  We suggest that you
    print these out and have them nearby while you are beginning the learn-
    ing process.

         Before we go any further, you need to locate your modem manual(s)
    and find out the baud rate, which com port your modem is connected to,
    and whether it is "Hayes(tm) Compatible" i.e., compatible with a Hayes
    modem.

         Start Omega-Link by typing "OMEGA" at the DOS prompt.  When the
    opening screen appears, read it, and then press any key when you are
    done.  The next screen will point out how to get the main help menu.
    Ignore it for now and hold down the "Alt" key and press "P."  Now
    release them.  The keys that you have just press (Alt & P) held
    together are known as "Alt-P." Likewise, if you would see a mentioning


                                    -3-




                        Omega-Link Reference Manual                        Omega-Link Reference Manual



    in the program for "Alt-Z," simply hold down the "Alt" key and press
    "Z," and then release them.

         Press "C,"  and you will be in the Communications Parameters set
    up screen.  If you need to change the baud rate, make sure the baud
    rate field is highlighted, press F1, type in the new baud rate, and
    press enter.  Now look at the entry for the active port.  If it is dif-
    ferent than the com port that your modem is connected to, move the cur-
    sor to that field and enter the proper number for you com port.  To
    finish, press F10.

         If your modem is Hayes compatible, you may skip the following sec-
    tion, and go to the section entitled "Additional Tips for Beginners."
    If it is not, please read on. 

         Press "M" to display the Modem and Printer commands screen. Using
    your modem manual, find the information needed for: Dialing Prefix,
    Dialing Suffix, Hang-up String, and the Connect Prompt. Erase the modem
    initialization string, and the no connect prompts.  Before entering the
    information you just located you will need to translate your manual's
    direction of pressing return or enter to "{" and were your manual calls
    for a delay use ' ~ ' for a one-half second delay. If you require more
    than one-half second delay, use more than one ' ~ '.  Press F10 when
    you are finished.  You are at the parameters menu once again.

         When you are finished configuring Omega Link to your hardware,
    press Q to save your set up to the disk.

         To use any additional options available in the parameters menu,
    use the help windows and/or the reference manual as a guide.

         You are almost ready to use Omega-Link.  But before you are, we
    have a few brief items for you to keep in mind:


                         Additional Tips for Beginners                         Additional Tips for Beginners

         Know the computer that you are calling:  When you discover a new         Know the computer that you are calling:                         
    computer system to call, make sure to find out the number of data bits,
    the parity that they are using, the number of stop bits, and the baud
    rate.  Most systems use 8 bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit, but not all.
    Most host computers will support 300 baud.  Some systems that you call
    will not support higher baud rates, so you may need to experiment.

         Do not be afraid to experiment:  If you do not know what baud         Do not be afraid to experiment:                              
    rates, data bits, stop bits, or parity they use, try experimentation.
    The first step is to try 300 baud.  Then try changing the number of
    data bits, and the parity.  Once you are on a new system, they will
    probably tell you if they support higher baud rates, so higher baud
    rates while experimenting are usually not necessary.  Your main objec-
    tive is to get a hold of the host system and be able to read what they
    send to you.

    screen will ask you to type the phone number, then you should press


                                    -4-




                        Omega-Link Reference Manual                        Omega-Link Reference Manual



    enter to dial it.  If you wish to change the number of data bits, stop
    bits, parity, or baud rate, do so from the "Communications Parameters"
    menu which is in the "Parameters Menu" (Alt-P).

         If you dial a telephone number frequently, we suggest that you
    store the number inside of the dialing directory.  This way, whenever
    you dial a telephone number, the number of data bits, stop bits, par-
    ity, and baud rate, in addition to other features, are all set for you
    automatically when you dial.


                             THE COMMAND DIRECTORY                             THE COMMAND DIRECTORY


         Omega-Link features four major subsystems: Terminal mode, the
    Dialing Directory, the Files Menu, and the Parameters Menu.  Commands
    to control how the system operates, and its external functions, are
    entered from the subsystem menus.  This would include data items such
    as phone numbers, as well as utility commands to show disk space, get a
    directory, and so forth.  These functions have their own menu.

         We will discuss each of the four subsystems separately; however,
    note that there is some duplication in related functions between menus.



                            Terminal Mode Commands                            Terminal Mode Commands

         Frequently-used commands can be executed directly from terminal
    mode, using some combination of the Alt key, Ctrl key, and the other
    keys of the keyboard.  These terminal mode commands do not execute from
    a menu, but you can display the list by hitting the Home key.


         ASCII Transfer (Alt-A)         ASCII Transfer (Alt-A)

         This feature allows you to upload or download a file using the
    binary protocols, or to capture any incoming text with a text capture
    option.  Here is a description of the ASCII protocols used for upload-
    ing a file that you can access through this command:

         ASCII - This will send the file to the host system exactly as it
    is stored in a disk file.

         Prompted ASCII - Will send a file to the host computer one line at
    a time.  After a line is sent, it will wait to receive a character
    (which you define when you select the Prompted ASCII mode) from the
    host system, and then continue.

         Files can be downloaded by only two methods.  The first method is
    a straight ASCII transfer.  Omega-Link will store every character it
    receives in a disk file until it receives an end-of-file character
    (ASCII value 26).  The second method is a straight text capture.  This
    will store every character that is received from your modem in a disk
    file until you press Alt-A again, which will close the file.

         Print-Screen (Shift-PrtSc)         Print-Screen (Shift-PrtSc)

         Omega-Link intercepts the Print Screen function of MSDOS to pro-
    vide another data capture method, accomplished with the Shift and PrtSc
    keys.  Screen data is saved to a disk file specified in the Parameters
    Menu, usually SCREEN.DMP.  The difference is that the screen dump data
    consists of the data on the screen only.  It is also appended to the
    end of the file.

         Both the session capture data and the screen dump data can be sent
    directly to the printer, by specifying PRN or LPT1 as the capture file
    or screen dump file.  Generally, you will send the session capture data
    to a disk file, and screen dumps to the printer, but your needs may be
    different.


         Send Null (Alt-N)         Send Null (Alt-N)

         Null and sustained-break signals are sometimes useful in communi-
    cating with a mainframe computer.  A Null character has the ASCII value
    of 0.  A sustained-break is not actually a character, but is a line
    condition.  Omega-Link sends a sustained-break signal when you key
    Ctrl-End.

         On a serial line not using a modem, a Break signal pulls the line
    low for a duration of 200 to 600 milliseconds.  When using a modem, the
    Break signal tells the modem to send a constant Space tone, which the
    receiving end interprets as a Break.  When communicating with a main
    frame computer, a Break signal is typically used to get attention for
    the terminal, but it could be programmed to mean anything.


         View an RLE file (Alt-V)         View an RLE file (Alt-V)

         You can view what is known as a RLE file on the screen by using
    this command.  A RLE file is a file that contains special characters
    designed so that you may view a graphics picture on the screen.  They
    were originally used on certain subscription host systems for display-
    ing weather maps, but the computer community has expanded their role so
    that all sorts of pictures can be distributed.  They chief advantage to
    an RLE file is that a graphics picture can be distributed over the
    modems so that they may be viewed by many types of computers, rather

         In order to use this feature, you must have a Color Graphics or
    Enhanced Graphics adapter.


         Shell to DOS (Alt-Z)         Shell to DOS (Alt-Z)

         This is a "terminate and stay resident" command.  Omega-Link
    remains in memory, but reloads the MSDOS command processor to execute
    other programs.  When you wish to return to Omega-Link, type "Exit" at
    the DOS command prompt.  You will re-enter Omega-Link at the same point
    where you left.

         Warning: If you have shelled to DOS, use any other memory-resident
    programs with caution.  These programs also install themselves in mem-
    ory, and may cause problems when returning to Omega-Link!  Furthermore,
    do not shell to a different version number of MSDOS, or the system may
    crash.


                             File System Commands                             File System Commands


         The file-system of Omega-Link lets you handle disk files without
    having to exit to DOS.  The file-system also has several commands not
    directly available from the operating system of the microcomputer.

         The File-System Menu is brought-up with the Alt-F key combination.
    You will see a list of available commands.  You may select these com-
    mands by either pressing the key indicated, or by using the cursor keys
    to move to the entry you want, then pressing the return key.

         While you are learning the commands, work on a scratch (spare)
    diskette.  If you accidentally corrupt or erase some files on your
    disk, you will not destroy some irreplaceable program.

         All commands are thoroughly described in their help screens, with
    one exception: "Changing File Attributes."  This command is described
    below.


         Changing File Attributes (F)         Changing File Attributes (F)

         With this command, you can change the attributes of any file.  The
    file attributes indicate various information about the file.  File
    attributes can be:

         Read-Only - This indicates that the file can only be read, and can         Read-Only                                                         
    not be written to or deleted.  Useful for files that you do not wish to
    change or delete.

         Hidden - A hidden file attribute will prevent the file from show-         Hidden                                                           
    ing in a directory listing, executed with the DIR command in MSDOS.

         System - This attribute indicates that the file is part of DOS.         System                                                         
    This attribute has limited value, since it does not affect usage of the
    file.

         Volume Label - Indicates that this really is not a file, but         Volume Label                                                
    rather the name is to be used as the volume label of the disk. Although
    you are able to change this on screen, DOS will not permit the change
    to actually occur.

         Subdirectory - This attribute indicates that this is a subdirec-         Subdirectory                                                    
    tory, and not a file.  Although you are able to change this on screen,
    DOS will not permit the change to actually occur.

         Archive Bit - Indicates that the file needs to be backed-up with         Archive Bit

         The Parameters Menu is invoked by pressing Alt-P.  It provides
    routines to change screen colors, modem command strings, default file
    names, communications settings, and many other things.  To select an
    item on the Parameters Menu, either press the first letter of the
    selection desired, or use the cursor keys to move to the selection, and
    then press the Enter key.

         Some of the Parameters Menu commands are the same as Terminal Mode
    commands.  Bear in mind that changes made from the Parameters Menu are
    default settings.  That is, they are the settings in place when you
    start the program.  They may still be toggled or changed from one or
    more menus, but the on-line changes are temporary.  When you make a
    change in the Parameters menu and wish for them to become defaults
    every time you execute Omega-Link, press "Q," which stands for "Quit
    and Save."  If you wish to have the changes you have made become
    default on a temporary basis (that is, if you wish for these changes to
    remain in effect during this Omega-Link session), press "Z" for "Quit
    and Don't Save."  Finally, if you have made some changes that you do
    not wish to remain in effect, but would rather have your old settings
    back again, select "A" for "Abort Changes."

         Here are some additional notes about the Parameters Menu that are
    not covered in the Help Screens:


         Communications Parameters         Communications Parameters

         The communications parameters involve several factors.  Here is a
    detailed list of the options available on this menu, and what they do.

         Active Port - The valid com port values for Omega-Link are 1, 2,         Active Port                                                     
    3, and 4.  Com ports 3 and 4 correspond to the I/O addresses 2E8 and
    2E0 (these numbers are in hexadecimal).

         Baud Rate - Valid values are 60, 100, 110, 150, 300, 350, 400,         Baud Rate                                                     
    450, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400.  Use only a number that
    your modem can handle.

         Stop Bits - Accepted values are 1, 1.5, and 2.  Usually only 1         Stop Bits                                                     
    stop bit is used.  Please note that Omega-Link does not allow for 1.5
    stop bits.

         Strip/Convert - Omega-Link can change any character sent to the         Strip/Convert                                                  
    host computer into another character.  Enter the 3-digit ASCII code of
    the character to change as the Strip value, and the character to change
    it to as the Convert value.  See the Omega-Link Function Key and con-
    version table located in Appendix A for the ASCII values.

                             The Dialing Directory                             The Dialing Directory


         The dialing directory contains the telephone numbers you can dial
    by typing the entry number.  This saves you the trouble of having to
    memorize numbers, as well as giving you a means to store brief com-
    ments, automatically set up parity, data bits, stop bits, etc.  for
    each number dialed, and to automatically redial a number.

         Automatic dialing is invoked by pressing Alt-D.  The program will
    ask you for the number of your selection.  Press return to see the
    directory, or type in the number of the entry you wish to dial.  If you
    type in a number from 1 to 100, it will dial that corresponding entry.
    If you type in a number longer than three digits, it will send that to
    the modem "as is".

         Assuming that you have pressed return and are viewing the list of
    entries, here is a list of your options, what they do, and how to use
    them:


         Autodial         Autodial

         Enter the number of the selection, and the computer will automati-
    cally dial the number for you.  It will also set the baud rate, word
    length, parity, stop bits, and strip/convert characters associated with
    the entry.  If it fails to connect, it will redial five times.  If you
    want to keep dialing, press Alt-R.  This brings up the redial function,
    which redials the last number dial up to 50 times before aborting the
    redial process.


         Erase an Entry         Erase an Entry

         This will erase the contents of an entry.  Do this only if you are
    sure you wish to erase the entry.


         Load Another Directory         Load Another Directory

         The dialing directory can store up to 100 entries.  However, for
    some users this is not enough.  Therefore, you can create another
    directory which has the capability for 100 more entries.  In order to
    use these entries, just call up the new directory, and the one cur-
    rently in memory will be replaced.


         Manual Dial         Manual Dial

         This option lets you dial a telephone number without storing it in
    the dialing directory.  You will be asked for the number, baud rate,
    number of data bits, parity, and number of data bits.  If you want any
    strip/convert capabilities, you must set that up also.  Although you
    may enter name and comments if you wish, the information will not be
    stored.

         Page Through Directory Entries         Page Through Directory Entries

         The dialing directory displays only ten items at a time.  In order
    to look at the next ten items or the previous ten items, you can use
    the "+" key to jump to the next page, and the "-" key to look at the
    previous page.


         Quit the Dialing Directory         Quit the Dialing Directory

         This exits the dialing directory and returns you to terminal mode.


         Update an Entry         Update an Entry

         This feature allows you to set up a dialing directory entry, and
    to tell Omega-Link what options and features to enact when dialing the
    entry or after connection.  The entry fields and their functions are
    described below:

                            ga-Link manages to connect with this entry.  If
                            no file name is given, no script file will be
                            loaded, and this feature will be disabled.

                        UPLOADING AND DOWNLOADING FILES                        UPLOADING AND DOWNLOADING FILES


         Uploading is the process of sending a file from your computer to
    another computer.  Downloading is the process of receiving a file from
    another computer.  Before you can upload or download a file, you must
    establish a protocol.  Both your computer and the computer at the other
    end of the connection must be using the same protocol.  Here is a list
    of the protocols Omega-Link has available, their advantages and their
    disadvantages.


         XMODEM         XMODEM

         This is the famous protocol developed for CP/M by Ward Christen-
    sen.  All characters of the ASCII character set can be transmitted and
    received.  This protocol uses error-checking.  Blocks received with
    errors are retransmitted until success is achieved, or until the sender
    or receiver gives up after ten unsuccessful attempts.

         Xmodem has two error-checking methods, or Algorithms, checksum and
    CRC.  Xmodem checksum is guaranteed to be utilized by any computer that
    has the Xmodem protocol, which is not true of Xmodem CRC.  However,
    Xmodem CRC is far better at error detection than Xmodem checksum.  Bet-
    ter than 99.99% of all errors are detected.

         Omega-Link will automatically detect and use CRC transmission, if
    possible.  There are no advantages to utilizing checksum when CRC is
    available.  If the computer you are downloading from gives you a choice
    between checksum and CRC, pick CRC.


         YMODEM         YMODEM

         This protocol evolved from the XMODEM CRC protocol, and has many
    similarities.  The difference is that YMODEM can send data somewhat
    faster and more efficiently than XMODEM because it uses a larger block
    size.  The larger block size reduces overhead by reducing ACK/NAK
    intervals.  This increases net throughput.

                            FUNCTION KEYS (MACROS)                            FUNCTION KEYS (MACROS)

         One of the great strengths of Omega-Link is that you can use the
    function keys to simulate any combination of keystrokes.  In addition
    to being able to utilize the normal function keys, you can use the
    Ctrl, Shift, and Alt with the function keys to simulate forty function
    keys instead of ten.

         Also, the function key Alt-F1 is an "AUTOEXEC" macro.  That is,
    the macro definition for Alt-F1 will be executed as soon as the termi-
    nal mode screen appears when Omega-Link begins.  So you may find defi-
    ning this macro key a great convenience to automate the start-up of
    Omega.

         On top of all this, there are ten additional function (or macro,
    depending on what you wish to call them) keys available by pressing the
    keys "Alt-1" through "Alt-0."  These can be from a disk file any time
    you wish during terminal mode by pressing Alt-J.

         The function key editor is invoked by Alt-K.  This will produce a
    screen showing the current definition for the functions keys.  All 40
    function key combinations cannot be shown on the screen at once.  At
    the top of the screen the inclusion of the Shift, Ctrl, of Alt key will
    be indicated.

         When the editor is invoked, you are given the option of modifying
    a key, erasing a key, or quitting the editor and returning to the ter-
    minal mode.  Pressing the "+" key will bring you to the next page, and
    pressing the "-" key will turn back to the previous page.

         Function keys can be programmed to contain any messages or command
    strings that you wish.  You could define the F1 key as "Welcome to
    Omega-Link", or make it simulate the typing of Alt-D, 12, and the
    return key.  This would call the autodial function, select entry #12
    from the dialing directory, and begin dialing.  Any combination of keys
    on the keyboard can be assigned to any of the 40 available function key
    combinations.

         Suppose that you wish F4 to send two carriage returns.  You cannot
    make the return key part of the key definition by pressing it, because
    the first time that you hit it would complete the entry in the function
    key editor.  For carriage return and linefeed characters, you must use
    the CR/LF replacement characters defined in the Parameters Menu.  Using
    the default values, two carriage returns would be programmed as "{{".
    Of course, you don't include the quotation marks when using the func-
    tion key editor.

         A function key definition may be entered as an ASCII code value by
    flagging it with the "|" character.  For example, "|065" would tell
    Omega-Link to send the ASCII code 65, which is equivalent to the char-
    acter "A." If anything follows the "|" character and is not understood,
    it will be sent literally.  For example, "|732" is beyond the ASCII
    range, and would be sent as "|732" literally.  For a complete listing
    of the special commands and of the available ASCII codes, refer to the
    tables at the end of this manual.

         If you have defined a function key as a long sequence of key-
    strokes, and you wish to interrupt the sequence before completion,
    press Ctrl-Break.  This aborts the function key transmission.


         FUNCTION KEY OPTIONS AND CONVERSION TABLES         FUNCTION KEY OPTIONS AND CONVERSION TABLES

         The following options are available in function key macros:

         |nnn         Use any ASCII code except 000.  Replace the nnn with         |nnn                                                             
                      exactly 3 digits in the range of 001 - 255

         |x           Replace the x with the letter of the Omega-Link         |x                                                          
                      command that you wish to execute.

         |Wnn         Wait nn seconds before continuing with the macro.         |Wnn                                                          

         |!nnn        This option allows you to enter keys that have no         |!nnn                                                         
                      ASCII code.  Replace nnn with the 3 digit code from
                      the table following.

         |:x          This tells Omega-Link to wait until the character         |:x                                                           
                      specified by x is received before proceeding.

         |~           Send the ~ character.         |~                                

         |Innn        Slow macro speed (0 fastest - 999 slowest)         |Innn                                                  

         ~            Delay approximately 1/18th of a second.         ~                                                   

         While Omega-Link is waiting for input, anything that you type will
    be sent exactly as entered.  This can be useful if you for got to put
    something into your macro.   During |W waits, pressing any key termi-
    nates the delay.  Timed waits are very useful for automatic log-ons to
    slow systems.

         At any other time during the execution of a macro, your keyboard
    entries are buffered and executed after the macro is complete.

         If you write a macro that calls itself (i.e.  you define F1 as
    |!059) it could repeat itself forever.  To get out of this situation
    press Ctrl-Break.  This will clear the macro and the keyboard buffer.
    If the macro was sending data out, and you wish to stop the data in the
    send buffer from being sent, then press Alt-(=) twice.

         See Appendix A for a table of ASCII and Extended ASCII character
    codes.

                        Omega-Link Reference Manual                        Omega-Link Reference Manual



                              The Script Language                              The Script Language

         The script language is a powerful feature of Omega-Link that
    allows you to program Omega-Link automate many mundane tasks.

         In order to write a script language program, all you have to do is
    take your favorite text editing program (even the DOS program EDLIN
    will do the job) and store the information in a file.  The file must be
    formatted as an ASCII file, with a carriage return and linefeed at the
    end of each line.  All commands can be entered in uppercase or lower
    case.  Tabs and extra spaces are ignored, so you may feel free to use
    these characters to format your text as you wish.  If the script lan-
    guage processor encounters an end-of-file character (ASCII value 26),
    it will treat act as though it has reached the end of the file.

         Strings can be marked with either single quotes (') or double
    quotes (").  However, please note that you must use the same type of
    quote to end a string as you used to start it.  For example:

         DISPLAY "ABC"      ;Display the string "ABC"
         DISPLAY 'ABC'      ;Display the string "ABC" again
         DISPLAY "ABC'DEF"  ;Display a single quote on the screen
         DISPLAY 'ABC"DEF'  ;Display a double quote on the screen
         DISPLAY "ABC'      ;Omega will flag this as an error
         DISPLAY 'ABC"      ;And will also flag this as an error

         Also, you can use string variables in place of quoted strings for
    all commands except the DIAL command.  A string variable begins with a
    dollar sign ($) and is followed by a single numeric digit ranging from
    0 through 9.  Here are some examples of string variables:

         DISPLAY $0         ;Display string variable #0
         INPUT $1, 0        ;Take a character from the keyboard
                            ; and store it in string variable #1
         DISPLAY $A         ;This is an invalid string variable
         DISPLAY $12        ;This is also an invalid variable

         What follows is a list of the commands available for the script
    language processor.  Anything marked as a <string> can use a string
    similar to the ones discussed previously. Anything marked as <value>
    must be an positive integer value.

Description: Will execute any commands afterwards only if <expression> is
             true until an ENDIF, ELSE, or end of file is encountered.

             <expression> can take many forms.  They are:

        SOUND               True if sound is enabled.        SOUND                                        
        LINEFEEDS           True if linefeeds are enabled.        LINEFEEDS                                         
        GRAPHICS            True if ANSI graphics are enabled.        GRAPHICS                                              
        ECHO                True if echo is enabled.        ECHO

        LINKED              True the script file was executed as a result        LINKED                                                           
                            of dialing directory entry executing the file
                            because of successful connection.
        TIMEOUT             True if a timeout occurred.        TIMEOUT

        CONNECTED           True if Omega-Link successfully connected with        CONNECTED                                                         
                            a host system.  Both CONNECTED and NOTCONNECTED
                            will be false if no number was dialed.
        NOTCONNECTED        True if Omega-Link did not successfully connect        NOTCONNECTED                                                       
                            with a host system.  Both this and CONNECTED
                            will be false if no number was dialed.
        RLE                 True if RLE graphics are enabled.        RLE                                                  
        MUSIC               True if ANSI Music is enabled.        MUSIC                                             

        Also, there are string comparison operators.  Their syntax is:
        $n <operator> <string>.  String can be a quoted string or another
        string variable.  The valid operators are:

        <                   Less-than        <                            
        =                   Equals        =                         
        >                   Greater-than        >                               
        <= or =<            Less-than or Equals        <=    =<                               
        >= or =>            Greater-than or Equals        >=    =>                                  
        <> or ><            Greater-than or Less-than        <>    ><                                     

         Some notes on the IF statement are as follows:

       o "Nested" IFs are not allowed.  For example:
         IF <expression>
         IF <expression>
         ENDIF
         ENDIF

         Will not work as you would expect.  Omega-Link will return an
    error because there are too many ENDIFs.

         o If <expression> is not true, and there is an ELSE statement fol-
    lowing the IF statement, commands following the ELSE will be executed.
    See the ELSE command for further details.
         o An ENDIF command will signal the end of an IF (and any corre-
    sponding ELSE statements).  Anything following an ENDIF will be
    executed regardless of whether <expression> executed regardless of
    whether <expression> in the IF statement was true or not.
         o Reaching the end of a file will act as an ENDIF.  If there is an
    ENDIF at the end of the file, no problems will result.

Example(s):  IF SOUND           ;Example number 1
                DISPLAY "Sound is ON.{}"
             ELSE
                DISPLAY "Sound is OFF.{}"
             ENDIF

             IF $0 = "A"        ;Example number 2
                DISPLAY 'String number 0 equals an "A."'
             ENDIF

INPUTINPUT 
Syntax:      INPUT <string>, <value>

Description: This will take a series of characters from the keyboard for
             <value> number of characters, or until ENTER is pressed, and
             place them in <string>.  Note that if <value> is equal to 0,
             Omega-Link will just take a character from the keyboard as
             soon as one is pressed, without waiting for the ENTER key.

Example(s):  INPUT $2, 10


LINEFEEDSLINEFEEDS
Syntax:      LINEFEEDS ON
          or LINEFEEDS OFF

Description: "LINEFEEDS ON" will tell Omega that it should display a line
             feed with every carriage return received while "LINEFEEDS OFF"
             will tell Omega that it should NOT display a linefeed with
             every carriage return received.

Example(s):  LINEFEEDS OFF    ;Disable linefeeds


LOCATELOCATE
Syntax:      LOCATE <row value>, <column value>
          or LOCATE <row value>
          or LOCATE ,<column value>

Description: "LOCATE" will locate the cursor at the row and/or column num-
             ber.  If the column number is omitted, LOCATE will leave the
             cursor at the current column, and simply re-locate to the spe-
             cified row.  Likewise, if the row value is omitted, the cursor
             will stay in the current row, and be re-located to the speci-
             fied column.

             Valid values for <row value> are 0-23, and valid values for

         Here is a brief list of some problems you may encounter while
    using Omega-Link, and some suggests as to what you should do about
    them:

Problem:     Shift-PrtSc is not printing your RLE picture correctly.Problem:                                                            
Suggestion:  For this command to work, you must have a graphics driverSuggestion:                                                           
             installed before you execute Omega-Link. There is one with
             most versions of DOS.  However, some printers come with their
             own graphics drivers.  You should consult your printer man-
             ual(s) and/or your DOS manual for more information.

Problem:     Every character you type appears twice on the screen.Problem:

             and modem speed are set correctly for the computer with which
             you are connected.  Also, make sure that ANSI graphics are
             enabled if they need to be for the system that you are call-
             ing.

Problem:     Your modem is not recognizing anything that is sent to it. Problem:

             rectly.  Also, make sure that all modem commands are defined
             correctly for the modem that you are using.

Suggestion:  Several things can cause this to occur.  If you do not tellSuggestion:                                                             
             Omega to download quickly enough after being told to do so by
             the host system, the host system may terminate the file trans-
             fer.  Usually you have in the neighborhood of 30-40 seconds to
             enable a download with Omega-Link before most host systems
             will stop trying to transfer a file.

             Another thing that might cause this to occur is if the infor-
             mation is being garbled by the telephone lines or if the host
             system is not recognizing the transfer correctly.

Problem:     On-line RLE pictures are not appearing correctly.Problem:                                                      
Suggestion:  There can be several causes for this problem.  One problem maySuggestion:                                                                
             be that you do not have on-line RLE graphics enabled (make
             sure that ANSI graphics are enabled also for the on-line RLE
             graphics to work).

             Another cause may be if you are using an EGA (or EGA compa-
             tible) display card.  Some EGA cards will lose characters from
             the modem when they change to graphics mode from text mode.
             If you think this is the problem, enable "XON/XOFF" in the
             "Communications Parameters" portion of the Parameters menu,
             and make sure that your host system supports XON/XOFF charac-
             ters.

             Finally, this problem could be due to line noise.

Problem:     ANSI Music will not play. Problem:                               
Suggestion:  Make sure that the ANSI music option (Alt-O) is enabled.  InSuggestion:                                                              
             order for the ANSI music option to be enabled, the ANSI-
             graphics option (Alt-G) should also be enabled.

Problem:     ANSI Graphics are not appearing correctly.Problem:

             cause may be that line noise is garbling text that you are
             being sent.

                         Commands for Editing Strings                         ____________________________

        In many menus displayed by Omega-Link, you will need to be able to
    edit strings (such as the modem initialization string).  Omega-Link has
    an advanced editor designed to make these changes easier.  Here is a
    list of keystrokes that you can press while editing a string, and what
    these keystrokes do:

        Up-Arrow:           This will bring you to the field to edit that        Up-Arrow:                                                        
                            is located above the field you are located at
                            currently.

        Down-Arrow:         Will bring you to the field located below the        Down-Arrow:                                                      
                            one you are located at currently.

        Left-Arrow:         Will move you to the character that left of the        Left-Arrow:                                                        
                            one you are located at currently inside of a
                            field.  If you are located all the way to the
                            left of a field, it will bring you to the pre-
                            vious field.

        Right-Arrow:        Will move you to the character that is        Right-Arrow:

                            inside of a field.  If you are located all the
                            way to the right of a field, it will bring you
                            to the next field.

        Ctrl-Left-Arrow:    Brings you to the field located to the        Ctrl-Left-Arrow:                                          
                            left of the one you are located at currently.

        Ctrl-Right-Arrow:   Will bring you to the field located to the        Ctrl-Right-Arrow:                                             
                            right of the one you are located at presently.

        Ins:                Toggles the insert mode on or off.  If the        Ins:                                                          
                            insert mode is enabled, whatever you type will
                            be displayed, and anything located to the right
                            will be moved over by a character.   If the
                            mode is disabled, anything you type will
                            destroy what is located at the cursor currently
                            and be replaced by the character which you
                            type.

        Del:                This will remove the character underneath of        Del:                                                            
                            your cursor from the screen.

        Backspace:          Will delete the character located to the        Backspace:

                            left by one position.

        F1:                 This will erase the contents of a field.        F1:                                                         

        F2:                 This will restore the field to the way it was        F2:

           Sequence of Steps Performed by Omega-Link When It Begins           ________________________________________________________

         When Omega-Link begins, it performs several things that may be
    beneficial to know.  This is performed as follows:

         First, Omega searches for the defaults file (OMEGADEF.DAT) in the
    default directory of DOS.  If it cannot find the file, it will examine
    the path command inside of the DOS environment, and search down the
    path until it finds the file.  If it does not find the file, or it is
    not a valid defaults file for this version of Omega-Link, it will use
    its own internal defaults.  Note that if you store a new defaults file,
    it will be stored in the path where the old one was found (if any).

         After this, it will attempt to load the function key files and the
    dialing directory if it can find any.

         A main screen will be displayed.  After the main screen is exited
    and you are in the terminal mode, the macro defininition for ALT-F1
    will be executed if it is defined.

     The Omega-Link External protocol handler comes to you preconfigured
     for several popular external protocols.  If you wish to add other
     protocols or modify the existing ones, see the section on installing
     protocols.


     INSTALLING THE EXTERNAL PROTOCOL HANDLER

     You will need to make the files OMEGAEXT.EXE and OMEGAEXT.DAT
     available to Omega-Link.  To do this you must copy them into either
     the current directory or a directory that is listed in the DOS PATH
     command.  The file OMEGAEXT.EXE will usally be placed in the same
     directory as OMEGA.EXE, and OMEGAEXT.DAT will be placed in the
     download sub-directory.

     The external protocol files will also need to be located so that the
     external protocol handler can find them.  This will usally be in the
     same directory as OMEGAEXT.EXE.  You may also edit the protocol
     descriptions to tell the external protocol handler where to find the
     external protocols if they won't be current directory.  A description
     of this process appears in the section on installing additional
     protocols.

     Recommended configurations

     If you have only one floppy diskette drive and no harddisk drive.
     -----------------------------------------------------------------

     PATH=
     COMSPEC=\COMMAND.COM

     When the external protocol handler asks for the protocol to use
     remove the program disk and insert the data disk.  As soon as the
     download or upload is completed reinsert the program disk.  Please
     note that due to the small amount of disk space that Omega-Link
     requires, it may be possible to have everything on one disk and still
     have quite a bit of space for downloads.  This is especially true of
     3-1/2" 720k or 1.44 meg floppy diskette systems.  For this type of
     system you may wish to simply copy all of the files onto program
     diskette.

     This configuration will give you the largest amount of space for
     downloaded files, however, it does require you to copy the file
     OMEGAEXT.DAT to each new diskette that you wish to use for downloads
     or uploads.  Therefore, you may wish to copy all the files onto you
     program diskette and then modify OMEGAEXT.DAT to use drive B:.

     External protocols

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     The following protocols have been preconfigured into the external
     protocol handler: DSZ (Zmodem, Ymodem-batch, and Ymodem-G), MLINK16
     (Megalink), PCKERMIT (Kermit), and CISB (Compuserve "B").  Our thanks
     go to the authors of these programs. Most of these programs may be
     downloaded from almost any BBS that has MS-DOS files.  We have not
     included any of these files to prevent violating there copyrights and
     to prevent you from having to download the same file twice.
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     INSTALLING ADDITIONAL PROTOCOLS
     -------------------------------
     To install a new protocol first copy the protocol into the directory
     that you wish use.  Then type OMEGAEXT at the DOS prompt.

     A menu will be displayed with the currently defined protocols and
     several entries marked "(Not defined)".  Select one the the not
     defined entries by pressing the letter that procedes it.






     At this time a menu will appear.  You may use the up and down arrow
     keys to move from item to item.  First select the very top item and
     press <F1>, this will erase the "(Not defined) message.  Now you may
     type the name that you wish to assign to this protocol.

     Next move down one line and press "N".  If you know that this
     protocol restores the machine to EXACTLY the same state as it was
     before the file transfer, then you may press "Y".  You should allways
     use "N" if you are not sure.  The most that will happen is that the
     first couple for characters that are received after the file transfer
     will be lost.

     Next, you will find a send command and a receive command.  These will
     vary considerably with each protocol, therefore, it is imposible to
     advise you how to configure these lines.  However, the following
     information should allow you to configure almost any external
     protocol.

     The following is a list of commands that you may use to configure
     external protocols.

     %B   Baud rate              One of: 60, 75, 100, 110, 150, 300, 350,
                                 400, 450, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600,
                                 19200, 38400.

     %C   Communications port    Either 1 or 2.

     %D   Data bits              Either 7 or 8

     %F   Filename               (default path = none)

     %f   Filename               (default path = location of OMEGAEXT.DAT)

     %P   Parity (upper case)    One of: O - odd, N - none, E - Even

     %p   Parity (lower case)    One of: o - odd, n - none, e - Even

     %S   Stop Bits              Either 1 or 2

     %X   Download path          Path where OMEGAEXT.DAT was found

     %%   The % character        Provided so that this character may be
                                 passed to the external protocol

     %$   COMSPEC                environment variable value
                                 (Usally x:\COMMAND.COM where x is the
                                 boot drive)

     The following examples assume that your modem is hooked to COM1 and
     is running 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, 2400 baud, and the
     file OMEGAEXT.DAT is found in C:\OMEGA\FILES.





     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     Command: %$/C CISB PORT %C SPEED %B

     This will execute COMMAND.COM and pass it the command line:
        /C CISB PORT 1 SPEED 2400
     It should be noted that command.com will do a path search for the
     file CISB.  This may be useful in some cases.
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     Command: DSZ COM%C RATE %B SETUP %D-%P-%S %X %F

     This will execute the command DSZ.EXE and pass it the command line:
        COM1 RATE 2400 SETUP 8-N-1 C:\OMEGA\FILES\ filename.ext
     where filename.ext is the filename that you enter at the prompt.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     Command: C:\OMEGA\PCKERMIT.EXE /c%C /b%B /p%p /t%f
     and you type SMILE.TXT at the filename prompt.

     This will execute the command C:\OMEGA\PCKERMIT.EXE with the command
     line:
         /c1 /b2400 /pn /tC:\OMEGA\FILES\SMILE.TXT
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     Please note that there are several differences between the sequence
     %X%F and %f.  The first will not allow you to change the default path
     portion, but the second will.  Also, the first will not display the
     default path when you enter the filename, where the second one will
     display the pathname.
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     After both the send and receive commands there are two switches. The
     first of these is the "Global filenames allowed" switch.  This switch
     disables the check of entered filename, allowing global filenames to
     be passed to the external protocol.  The second switch is "Filename
     required" and is reserved for future use.  Set it to "Y."



     USING AN EXTERNAL PROTOCOL
     --------------------------

     To use an external protocol that has been installed, press
     <Ctrl-PgUP> to upload or <Ctrl-PgDn> to download.  Then select
     number 6 (external) from the protocol menu.  The external protocol
     handler will be loaded and you will be presented with a menu of
     protocols.  Select the desired protocol and enter a filename if
     required.  When the file transfer is complete you will be prompted to
     press and key to continue.  As soon as you press a key you will be
     back in Omega-Link.

         Omega-Link took time and effort to develop.  Like many large pro-
    jects, the credit cannot go to a select handful.  It took suggestions,
    patience, and a great deal of thinking on everyone's part to make this
    program what it is today.  While we cannot list the names of all those
    who helped us, here is a small list of some people to whom we would
    especially like to send our thanks:

        Dave Manning        One of our most helpful "Beta-Testers," and        Dave Manning                                                   
                            whose constant "nagging" on various items
                            greatly improved the quality of the program.
        Jim Rhoads          First, we must thank Jim for his patience as        Jim Rhoads                                                      
                            "Sysop" of The Strange Quark [(616) 964-0930]
                            whose patience was probably tried a great deal
                            by our constant "log-ons" to his system to help
                            debug the program.  In addition, we owe him our
                            thanks for permitting us to use his machines at
                            his home and his creative ideas.

                            nications and abilities for relating to people
                            proved to be a constant benefit.

                            software, Omega-Link would be seriously lack-
                            ing.  And so would our enthusiasm.
        Bob Gavrun          We cannot thank this individual enough for the        Bob Gavrun

                            he has little enough as it is) to help us with
                            the program, documentation, and interfaces.
        Bill Bailey         He suggested the name of "Omega," meaning the        Bill Bailey                                                      
                            first and last you will ever need in modem
                            communications, just as Omega is the last
                            character in the Greek alphabet.
        Fione Chase         Her wisdom and ideas have proven invaluable.        Fione Chase

         The members of the various Bulletin Boards of the Battle Creek
    area, and the members of "Personal Computers of Battle Creek."

        And finally, we cannot ignore our family members and close friends.
    Their patience and tolerance in regard to our severe mood swings,
    bizarre hours, and crazy actions should not be ignored.  We owe them
    almost infinite gratitude for all of this, which so few mortals can
    take so well.

    mark is held by Hayes Microcomputer Products, Inc.

                                 INTRODUCTION                                 INTRODUCTION


         Omega-Link is a program that lets you use your modem to communi-
    cate with other computers.  It was written entirely in 8088 assembly
    language, for speed and ease of use.  For the beginning user, Omega-
    Link offers powerful commands with easy-to-remember keystrokes.

         The file-system of Omega-Link can perform functions that rival
    those of MSDOS.  Any directory listing will show ALL files on the dis-
    kette, including hidden files, read-only files, and subdirectories.

         The best way to learn Omega-Link is to use it.  If you are unsure
    of what various functions do, try them.  You cannot harm anything.  If
    you are about to do something that you might regret, such as deleting a
    file, Omega-Link will give you a warning message to confirm the action.

         Good luck and enjoy yourself!



                                GETTING STARTED                                GETTING STARTED


         Welcome to Omega-Link.  These next few paragraphs are designed for
    the novice user.  If you consider yourself an advanced user and are
    familiar with the area of communications, we suggest you skip this por-
    tion and go directly to the reference manual, which begins at the
    section entitled "The Command Directory."

         Telecommunications can be a puzzling and sometimes exasperating
    field, and can require some patience in learning.  We have tried to
    make this as simple a task as possible without sacrificing power.  How-
    ever, it will still require effort on your part to learn because it
    requires not only that you know how to use Omega-Link, but also how to
    use the software of the computer with which you are communicating.

         This start-up document is not intended to teach you everything,
    and we recommend that you consult the reference manual afterwards.
    Also, please note that there is a glossary at the end of the reference
    manual, and a quick help sheet in the beginning.  We suggest that you
    print these out and have them nearby while you are beginning the learn-
    ing process.

         Before we go any further, you need to locate your modem manual(s)
    and find out the baud rate, which com port your modem is connected to,
    and whether it is "Hayes(tm) Compatible" i.e., compatible with a Hayes
    modem.

         Start Omega-Link by typing "OMEGA" at the DOS prompt.  When the
    opening screen appears, read it, and then press any key when you are
    done.  The next screen will point out how to get the main help menu.
    Ignore it for now and hold down the "Alt" key and press "P."  Now
    release them.  The keys that you have just press (Alt & P) held
    together are known as "Alt-P." Likewise, if you would see a mentioning


                                    -3-




                        Omega-Link Reference Manual                        Omega-Link Reference Manual



    in the program for "Alt-Z," simply hold down the "Alt" key and press
    "Z," and then release them.

         Press "C,"  and you will be in the Communications Parameters set
    up screen.  If you need to change the baud rate, make sure the baud
    rate field is highlighted, press F1, type in the new baud rate, and
    press enter.  Now look at the entry for the active port.  If it is dif-
    ferent than the com port that your modem is connected to, move the cur-
    sor to that field and enter the proper number for you com port.  To
    finish, press F10.

         If your modem is Hayes compatible, you may skip the following sec-
    tion, and go to the section entitled "Additional Tips for Beginners."
    If it is not, please read on. 

         Press "M" to display the Modem and Printer commands screen. Using
    your modem manual, find the information needed for: Dialing Prefix,
    Dialing Suffix, Hang-up String, and the Connect Prompt. Erase the modem
    initialization string, and the no connect prompts.  Before entering the
    information you just located you will need to translate your manual's
    direction of pressing return or enter to "{" and were your manual calls
    for a delay use ' ~ ' for a one-half second delay. If you require more
    than one-half second delay, use more than one ' ~ '.  Press F10 when
    you are finished.  You are at the parameters menu once again.

         When you are finished configuring Omega Link to your hardware,
    press Q to save your set up to the disk.

         To use any additional options available in the parameters menu,
    use the help windows and/or the reference manual as a guide.

         You are almost ready to use Omega-Link.  But before you are, we
    have a few brief items for you to keep in mind:


                         Additional Tips for Beginners                         Additional Tips for Beginners

         Know the computer that you are calling:  When you discover a new         Know the computer that you are calling:                         
    computer system to call, make sure to find out the number of data bits,
    the parity that they are using, the number of stop bits, and the baud
    rate.  Most systems use 8 bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit, but not all.
    Most host computers will support 300 baud.  Some systems that you call
    will not support higher baud rates, so you may need to experiment.

         Do not be afraid to experiment:  If you do not know what baud         Do not be afraid to experiment:                              
    rates, data bits, stop bits, or parity they use, try experimentation.
    The first step is to try 300 baud.  Then try changing the number of
    data bits, and the parity.  Once you are on a new system, they will
    probably tell you if they support higher baud rates, so higher baud
    rates while experimenting are usually not necessary.  Your main objec-
    tive is to get a hold of the host system and be able to read what they
    send to you.

    screen will ask you to type the phone number, then you should press

                        Omega-Link Reference Manual                        Omega-Link Reference Manual



    enter to dial it.  If you wish to change the number of data bits, stop
    bits, parity, or baud rate, do so from the "Communications Parameters"
    menu which is in the "Parameters Menu" (Alt-P).

         If you dial a telephone number frequently, we suggest that you
    store the number inside of the dialing directory.  This way, whenever
    you dial a telephone number, the number of data bits, stop bits, par-
    ity, and baud rate, in addition to other features, are all set for you
    automatically when you dial.


                             THE COMMAND DIRECTORY                             THE COMMAND DIRECTORY


         Omega-Link features four major subsystems: Terminal mode, the
    Dialing Directory, the Files Menu, and the Parameters Menu.  Commands
    to control how the system operates, and its external functions, are
    entered from the subsystem menus.  This would include data items such
    as phone numbers, as well as utility commands to show disk space, get a
    directory, and so forth.  These functions have their own menu.

         We will discuss each of the four subsystems separately; however,
    note that there is some duplication in related functions between menus.



                            Terminal Mode Commands                            Terminal Mode Commands

         Frequently-used commands can be executed directly from terminal
    mode, using some combination of the Alt key, Ctrl key, and the other
    keys of the keyboard.  These terminal mode commands do not execute from
    a menu, but you can display the list by hitting the Home key.


         ASCII Transfer (Alt-A)         ASCII Transfer (Alt-A)

         This feature allows you to upload or download a file using the
    binary protocols, or to capture any incoming text with a text capture
    option.  Here is a description of the ASCII protocols used for upload-
    ing a file that you can access through this command:

         ASCII - This will send the file to the host system exactly as it
    is stored in a disk file.

         Prompted ASCII - Will send a file to the host computer one line at
    a time.  After a line is sent, it will wait to receive a character
    (which you define when you select the Prompted ASCII mode) from the
    host system, and then continue.

         Files can be downloaded by only two methods.  The first method is
    a straight ASCII transfer.  Omega-Link will store every character it
    receives in a disk file until it receives an end-of-file character
    (ASCII value 26).  The second method is a straight text capture.  This
    will store every character that is received from your modem in a disk
    file until you press Alt-A again, which will close the file.

                        Omega-Link Reference Manual                        Omega-Link Reference Manual



         Print-Screen (Shift-PrtSc)         Print-Screen (Shift-PrtSc)

         Omega-Link intercepts the Print Screen function of MSDOS to pro-
    vide another data capture method, accomplished with the Shift and PrtSc
    keys.  Screen data is saved to a disk file specified in the Parameters
    Menu, usually SCREEN.DMP.  The difference is that the screen dump data
    consists of the data on the screen only.  It is also appended to the
    end of the file.

         Both the session capture data and the screen dump data can be sent
    directly to the printer, by specifying PRN or LPT1 as the capture file
    or screen dump file.  Generally, you will send the session capture data
    to a disk file, and screen dumps to the printer, but your needs may be
    different.


         Send Null (Alt-N)         Send Null (Alt-N)

         Null and sustained-break signals are sometimes useful in communi-
    cating with a mainframe computer.  A Null character has the ASCII value
    of 0.  A sustained-break is not actually a character, but is a line
    condition.  Omega-Link sends a sustained-break signal when you key
    Ctrl-End.

         On a serial line not using a modem, a Break signal pulls the line
    low for a duration of 200 to 600 milliseconds.  When using a modem, the
    Break signal tells the modem to send a constant Space tone, which the
    receiving end interprets as a Break.  When communicating with a main
    frame computer, a Break signal is typically used to get attention for
    the terminal, but it could be programmed to mean anything.


         View an RLE file (Alt-V)         View an RLE file (Alt-V)

         You can view what is known as a RLE file on the screen by using
    this command.  A RLE file is a file that contains special characters
    designed so that you may view a graphics picture on the screen.  They
    were originally used on certain subscription host systems for display-
    ing weather maps, but the computer community has expanded their role so
    that all sorts of pictures can be distributed.  They chief advantage to
    an RLE file is that a graphics picture can be distributed over the
    modems so that they may be viewed by many types of computers, rather
    than just one specific brand.

         In order to use this feature, you must have a Color Graphics or
    Enhanced Graphics adapter.


         Shell to DOS (Alt-Z)         Shell to DOS (Alt-Z)

         This is a "terminate and stay resident" command.  Omega-Link
    remains in memory, but reloads the MSDOS command processor to execute
    other programs.  When you wish to return to Omega-Link, type "Exit" at
    the DOS command prompt.  You will re-enter Omega-Link at the same point
    where you left.


                                    -6-




                        Omega-Link Reference Manual                        Omega-Link Reference Manual




         Warning: If you have shelled to DOS, use any other memory-resident
    programs with caution.  These programs also install themselves in mem-
    ory, and may cause problems when returning to Omega-Link!  Furthermore,
    do not shell to a different version number of MSDOS, or the system may
    crash.


                             File System Commands                             File System Commands


         The file-system of Omega-Link lets you handle disk files without
    having to exit to DOS.  The file-system also has several commands not
    directly available from the operating system of the microcomputer.

         The File-System Menu is brought-up with the Alt-F key combination.
    You will see a list of available commands.  You may select these com-
    mands by either pressing the key indicated, or by using the cursor keys
    to move to the entry you want, then pressing the return key.

         While you are learning the commands, work on a scratch (spare)
    diskette.  If you accidentally corrupt or erase some files on your
    disk, you will not destroy some irreplaceable program.

         All commands are thoroughly described in their help screens, with
    one exception: "Changing File Attributes."  This command is described
    below.


         Changing File Attributes (F)         Changing File Attributes (F)

         With this command, you can change the attributes of any file.  The
    file attributes indicate various information about the file.  File
    attributes can be:

         Read-Only - This indicates that the file can only be read, and can         Read-Only                                                         
    not be written to or deleted.  Useful for files that you do not wish to
    change or delete.

         Hidden - A hidden file attribute will prevent the file from show-         Hidden                                                           
    ing in a directory listing, executed with the DIR command in MSDOS.

         System - This attribute indicates that the file is part of DOS.         System                                                         
    This attribute has limited value, since it does not affect usage of the
    file.

         Volume Label - Indicates that this really is not a file, but         Volume Label                                                
    rather the name is to be used as the volume label of the disk. Although
    you are able to change this on screen, DOS will not permit the change
    to actually occur.

         Subdirectory - This attribute indicates that this is a subdirec-         Subdirectory                                                    
    tory, and not a file.  Although you are able to change this on screen,
    DOS will not permit the change to actually occur.

                        Omega-Link Reference Manual                        Omega-Link Reference Manual



         Archive Bit - Indicates that the file needs to be backed-up with         Archive Bit                                                     
    the "BACKUP" command of DOS.  This is really only of significance to
    those people with hard disks.


                              The Parameters Menu                              The Parameters Menu

         The Parameters Menu is invoked by pressing Alt-P.  It provides
    routines to change screen colors, modem command strings, default file
    names, communications settings, and many other things.  To select an
    item on the Parameters Menu, either press the first letter of the
    selection desired, or use the cursor keys to move to the selection, and
    then press the Enter key.

         Some of the Parameters Menu commands are the same as Terminal Mode
    commands.  Bear in mind that changes made from the Parameters Menu are
    default settings.  That is, they are the settings in place when you
    start the program.  They may still be toggled or changed from one or
    more menus, but the on-line changes are temporary.  When you make a
    change in the Parameters menu and wish for them to become defaults
    every time you execute Omega-Link, press "Q," which stands for "Quit
    and Save."  If you wish to have the changes you have made become
    default on a temporary basis (that is, if you wish for these changes to
    remain in effect during this Omega-Link session), press "Z" for "Quit
    and Don't Save."  Finally, if you have made some changes that you do
    not wish to remain in effect, but would rather have your old settings
    back again, select "A" for "Abort Changes."

         Here are some additional notes about the Parameters Menu that are
    not covered in the Help Screens:


         Communications Parameters         Communications Parameters

         The communications parameters involve several factors.  Here is a
    detailed list of the options available on this menu, and what they do.

         Active Port - The valid com port values for Omega-Link are 1, 2,         Active Port                                                     
    3, and 4.  Com ports 3 and 4 correspond to the I/O addresses 2E8 and
    2E0 (these numbers are in hexadecimal).

         Baud Rate - Valid values are 60, 100, 110, 150, 300, 350, 400,         Baud Rate                                                     
    450, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400.  Use only a number that
    your modem can handle.

         Stop Bits - Accepted values are 1, 1.5, and 2.  Usually only 1         Stop Bits                                                     
    stop bit is used.  Please note that Omega-Link does not allow for 1.5
    stop bits.

         Strip/Convert - Omega-Link can change any character sent to the         Strip/Convert                                                  
    host computer into another character.  Enter the 3-digit ASCII code of
    the character to change as the Strip value, and the character to change
    it to as the Convert value.  See the Omega-Link Function Key and con-

                             The Dialing Directory                             The Dialing Directory


         The dialing directory contains the telephone numbers you can dial
    by typing the entry number.  This saves you the trouble of having to
    memorize numbers, as well as giving you a means to store brief com-
    ments, automatically set up parity, data bits, stop bits, etc.  for
    each number dialed, and to automatically redial a number.

         Automatic dialing is invoked by pressing Alt-D.  The program will
    ask you for the number of your selection.  Press return to see the
    directory, or type in the number of the entry you wish to dial.  If you
    type in a number from 1 to 100, it will dial that corresponding entry.
    If you type in a number longer than three digits, it will send that to
    the modem "as is".

         Assuming that you have pressed return and are viewing the list of
    entries, here is a list of your options, what they do, and how to use
    them:


         Autodial         Autodial

         Enter the number of the selection, and the computer will automati-
    cally dial the number for you.  It will also set the baud rate, word
    length, parity, stop bits, and strip/convert characters associated with
    the entry.  If it fails to connect, it will redial five times.  If you
    want to keep dialing, press Alt-R.  This brings up the redial function,
    which redials the last number dial up to 50 times before aborting the
    redial process.


         Erase an Entry         Erase an Entry

         This will erase the contents of an entry.  Do this only if you are
    sure you wish to erase the entry.


         Load Another Directory         Load Another Directory

         The dialing directory can store up to 100 entries.  However, for
    some users this is not enough.  Therefore, you can create another
    directory which has the capability for 100 more entries.  In order to
    use these entries, just call up the new directory, and the one cur-
    rently in memory will be replaced.


         Manual Dial         Manual Dial

         This option lets you dial a telephone number without storing it in
    the dialing directory.  You will be asked for the number, baud rate,
    number of data bits, parity, and number of data bits.  If you want any
    strip/convert capabilities, you must set that up also.  Although you
    may enter name and comments if you wish, the information will not be
    stored.

         Page Through Directory Entries         Page Through Directory Entries

         The dialing directory displays only ten items at a time.  In order
    to look at the next ten items or the previous ten items, you can use
    the "+" key to jump to the next page, and the "-" key to look at the
    previous page.


         Quit the Dialing Directory         Quit the Dialing Directory

         This exits the dialing directory and returns you to terminal mode.


         Update an Entry         Update an Entry

         This feature allows you to set up a dialing directory entry, and
    to tell Omega-Link what options and features to enact when dialing the
    entry or after connection.  The entry fields and their functions are
    described below:

                            no file name is given, no script file will be
                            loaded, and this feature will be disabled.

                            entry.
        Baud Rate:          The baud rate of the entry on hand.        Baud Rate:                                             
        Data Bits:          The number of data bits that this entry uses.        Data Bits:                                                       
        Parity:             The type of parity that the entry uses (E, O,        Parity:                                                          
                            or N).
        Stop Bits:          The number of stop bits that the entry uses.        Stop Bits:                                                      
        Ansi Music:         Tells whether Omega should try to play ANSI        Ansi Music:

                            ual), and the value of the replacement charac-

                        UPLOADING AND DOWNLOADING FILES                        UPLOADING AND DOWNLOADING FILES


         Uploading is the process of sending a file from your computer to
    another computer.  Downloading is the process of receiving a file from
    another computer.  Before you can upload or download a file, you must
    establish a protocol.  Both your computer and the computer at the other
    end of the connection must be using the same protocol.  Here is a list
    of the protocols Omega-Link has available, their advantages and their
    disadvantages.


         XMODEM         XMODEM

         This is the famous protocol developed for CP/M by Ward Christen-
    sen.  All characters of the ASCII character set can be transmitted and
    received.  This protocol uses error-checking.  Blocks received with
    errors are retransmitted until success is achieved, or until the sender
    or receiver gives up after ten unsuccessful attempts.

         Xmodem has two error-checking methods, or Algorithms, checksum and
    CRC.  Xmodem checksum is guaranteed to be utilized by any computer that
    has the Xmodem protocol, which is not true of Xmodem CRC.  However,
    Xmodem CRC is far better at error detection than Xmodem checksum.  Bet-
    ter than 99.99% of all errors are detected.

         Omega-Link will automatically detect and use CRC transmission, if
    possible.  There are no advantages to utilizing checksum when CRC is
    available.  If the computer you are downloading from gives you a choice
    between checksum and CRC, pick CRC.


         YMODEM         YMODEM

         This protocol evolved from the XMODEM CRC protocol, and has many
    similarities.  The difference is that YMODEM can send data somewhat
    faster and more efficiently than XMODEM because it uses a larger block
    size.  The larger block size reduces overhead by reducing ACK/NAK
    intervals.  This increases net throughput.

                        Omega-Link Reference Manual                        Omega-Link Reference Manual



                            FUNCTION KEYS (MACROS)                            FUNCTION KEYS (MACROS)

         One of the great strengths of Omega-Link is that you can use the
    function keys to simulate any combination of keystrokes.  In addition
    to being able to utilize the normal function keys, you can use the
    Ctrl, Shift, and Alt with the function keys to simulate forty function
    keys instead of ten.

         Also, the function key Alt-F1 is an "AUTOEXEC" macro.  That is,
    the macro definition for Alt-F1 will be executed as soon as the termi-
    nal mode screen appears when Omega-Link begins.  So you may find defi-
    ning this macro key a great convenience to automate the start-up of
    Omega.

         On top of all this, there are ten additional function (or macro,
    depending on what you wish to call them) keys available by pressing the
    keys "Alt-1" through "Alt-0."  These can be from a disk file any time
    you wish during terminal mode by pressing Alt-J.

         The function key editor is invoked by Alt-K.  This will produce a
    screen showing the current definition for the functions keys.  All 40
    function key combinations cannot be shown on the screen at once.  At
    the top of the screen the inclusion of the Shift, Ctrl, of Alt key will
    be indicated.

         When the editor is invoked, you are given the option of modifying
    a key, erasing a key, or quitting the editor and returning to the ter-
    minal mode.  Pressing the "+" key will bring you to the next page, and
    pressing the "-" key will turn back to the previous page.

         Function keys can be programmed to contain any messages or command
    strings that you wish.  You could define the F1 key as "Welcome to
    Omega-Link", or make it simulate the typing of Alt-D, 12, and the
    return key.  This would call the autodial function, select entry #12
    from the dialing directory, and begin dialing.  Any combination of keys
    on the keyboard can be assigned to any of the 40 available function key
    combinations.

         Suppose that you wish F4 to send two carriage returns.  You cannot
    make the return key part of the key definition by pressing it, because
    the first time that you hit it would complete the entry in the function
    key editor.  For carriage return and linefeed characters, you must use
    the CR/LF replacement characters defined in the Parameters Menu.  Using
    the default values, two carriage returns would be programmed as "{{".
    Of course, you don't include the quotation marks when using the func-
    tion key editor.

         A function key definition may be entered as an ASCII code value by
    flagging it with the "|" character.  For example, "|065" would tell
    Omega-Link to send the ASCII code 65, which is equivalent to the char-
    acter "A." If anything follows the "|" character and is not understood,
    it will be sent literally.  For example, "|732" is beyond the ASCII
    range, and would be sent as "|732" literally.  For a complete listing
    of the special commands and of the available ASCII codes, refer to the
    tables at the end of this manual.

                        Omega-Link Reference Manual                        Omega-Link Reference Manual



         If you have defined a function key as a long sequence of key-
    strokes, and you wish to interrupt the sequence before completion,
    press Ctrl-Break.  This aborts the function key transmission.


         FUNCTION KEY OPTIONS AND CONVERSION TABLES         FUNCTION KEY OPTIONS AND CONVERSION TABLES

         The following options are available in function key macros:

         |nnn         Use any ASCII code except 000.  Replace the nnn with         |nnn                                                             
                      exactly 3 digits in the range of 001 - 255

         |x           Replace the x with the letter of the Omega-Link         |x                                                          
                      command that you wish to execute.

         |Wnn         Wait nn seconds before continuing with the macro.         |Wnn                                                          

         |!nnn        This option allows you to enter keys that have no         |!nnn                                                         
                      ASCII code.  Replace nnn with the 3 digit code from
                      the table following.

         |:x          This tells Omega-Link to wait until the character         |:x                                                           
                      specified by x is received before proceeding.

         |~           Send the ~ character.         |~                                

         |Innn        Slow macro speed (0 fastest - 999 slowest)         |Innn                                                  

         ~            Delay approximately 1/18th of a second.         ~                                                   

         While Omega-Link is waiting for input, anything that you type will
    be sent exactly as entered.  This can be useful if you for got to put
    something into your macro.   During |W waits, pressing any key termi-
    nates the delay.  Timed waits are very useful for automatic log-ons to
    slow systems.

         At any other time during the execution of a macro, your keyboard
    entries are buffered and executed after the macro is complete.

         If you write a macro that calls itself (i.e.  you define F1 as
    |!059) it could repeat itself forever.  To get out of this situation
    press Ctrl-Break.  This will clear the macro and the keyboard buffer.
    If the macro was sending data out, and you wish to stop the data in the
    send buffer from being sent, then press Alt-(=) twice.

         See Appendix A for a table of ASCII and Extended ASCII character
    codes.

                        Omega-Link Reference Manual                        Omega-Link Reference Manual



                              The Script Language                              The Script Language

         The script language is a powerful feature of Omega-Link that
    allows you to program Omega-Link automate many mundane tasks.

         In order to write a script language program, all you have to do is
    take your favorite text editing program (even the DOS program EDLIN
    will do the job) and store the information in a file.  The file must be
    formatted as an ASCII file, with a carriage return and linefeed at the
    end of each line.  All commands can be entered in uppercase or lower
    case.  Tabs and extra spaces are ignored, so you may feel free to use
    these characters to format your text as you wish.  If the script lan-
    guage processor encounters an end-of-file character (ASCII value 26),
    it will treat act as though it has reached the end of the file.

         Strings can be marked with either single quotes (') or double
    quotes (").  However, please note that you must use the same type of
    quote to end a string as you used to start it.  For example:

         DISPLAY "ABC"      ;Display the string "ABC"
         DISPLAY 'ABC'      ;Display the string "ABC" again
         DISPLAY "ABC'DEF"  ;Display a single quote on the screen
         DISPLAY 'ABC"DEF'  ;Display a double quote on the screen
         DISPLAY "ABC'      ;Omega will flag this as an error
         DISPLAY 'ABC"      ;And will also flag this as an error

         Also, you can use string variables in place of quoted strings for
    all commands except the DIAL command.  A string variable begins with a
    dollar sign ($) and is followed by a single numeric digit ranging from
    0 through 9.  Here are some examples of string variables:

         DISPLAY $0         ;Display string variable #0
         INPUT $1, 0        ;Take a character from the keyboard
                            ; and store it in string variable #1
         DISPLAY $A         ;This is an invalid string variable
         DISPLAY $12        ;This is also an invalid variable

         What follows is a list of the commands available for the script

Description: Will execute any commands afterwards only if <expression> is
             true until an ENDIF, ELSE, or end of file is encountered.

             <expression> can take many forms.  They are:

        SOUND               True if sound is enabled.        SOUND                                        
        LINEFEEDS           True if linefeeds are enabled.        LINEFEEDS                                         
        GRAPHICS            True if ANSI graphics are enabled.        GRAPHICS                                              
        ECHO                True if echo is enabled.        ECHO

                        Omega-Link Reference Manual                        Omega-Link Reference Manual



        CONNECTED           True if Omega-Link successfully connected with        CONNECTED                                                         
                            a host system.  Both CONNECTED and NOTCONNECTED
                            will be false if no number was dialed.
        NOTCONNECTED        True if Omega-Link did not successfully connect        NOTCONNECTED                                                       
                            with a host system.  Both this and CONNECTED
                            will be false if no number was dialed.
        RLE                 True if RLE graphics are enabled.        RLE                                                  
        MUSIC               True if ANSI Music is enabled.        MUSIC                                             

        Also, there are string comparison operators.  Their syntax is:
        $n <operator> <string>.  String can be a quoted string or another
        string variable.  The valid operators are:

        <                   Less-than        <                            
        =                   Equals        =                         
        >                   Greater-than        >                               
        <= or =<            Less-than or Equals        <=    =<                               
        >= or =>            Greater-than or Equals        >=    =>                                  
        <> or ><            Greater-than or Less-than        <>    ><                                     

         Some notes on the IF statement are as follows:

       o "Nested" IFs are not allowed.  For example:
         IF <expression>
         IF <expression>
         ENDIF
         ENDIF

         Will not work as you would expect.  Omega-Link will return an
    error because there are too many ENDIFs.

         o If <expression> is not true, and there is an ELSE statement fol-
    lowing the IF statement, commands following the ELSE will be executed.
    See the ELSE command for further details.
         o An ENDIF command will signal the end of an IF (and any corre-
    sponding ELSE statements).  Anything following an ENDIF will be
    executed regardless of whether <expression> executed regardless of
    whether <expression> in the IF statement was true or not.
         o Reaching the end of a file will act as an ENDIF.  If there is an
    ENDIF at the end of the file, no problems will result.

Example(s):  IF SOUND           ;Example number 1
                DISPLAY "Sound is ON.{}"
             ELSE
                DISPLAY "Sound is OFF.{}"
             ENDIF

             IF $0 = "A"        ;Example number 2
                DISPLAY 'String number 0 equals an "A."'
             ENDIF

INPUTINPUT 
Syntax:      INPUT <string>, <value>

Description: This will take a series of characters from the keyboard for
             <value> number of characters, or until ENTER is pressed, and
             place them in <string>.  Note that if <value> is equal to 0,
             Omega-Link will just take a character from the keyboard as
             soon as one is pressed, without waiting for the ENTER key.

Example(s):  INPUT $2, 10


LINEFEEDSLINEFEEDS
Syntax:      LINEFEEDS ON
          or LINEFEEDS OFF

Description: "LINEFEEDS ON" will tell Omega that it should display a line
             feed with every carriage return received while "LINEFEEDS OFF"
             will tell Omega that it should NOT display a linefeed with
             every carriage return received.

Example(s):  LINEFEEDS OFF    ;Disable linefeeds


LOCATELOCATE
Syntax:      LOCATE <row value>, <column value>
          or LOCATE <row value>
          or LOCATE ,<column value>

Description: "LOCATE" will locate the cursor at the row and/or column num-
             ber.  If the column number is omitted, LOCATE will leave the
             cursor at the current column, and simply re-locate to the spe-
             cified row.  Likewise, if the row value is omitted, the cursor
             will stay in the current row, and be re-located to the speci-
             fied column.

             Valid values for <row value> are 0-23, and valid values for
             <column value> are 0-79.

Example(s):  LOCATE 0,0     ;Locate the cursor at the top corner of the
                            ; screen

Description: The ";" is used to indicate that the rest of a line is com
             posed of comments.  Anything following the ";" will be
             ignored.  Therefore, if you have any commands following a ";,"
             they will be ignored.  If a ";" is contained in a string, it
             will be treated as part of the string and will be displayed.

Example(s):  DISPLAY "HELLO" ;This is a comment
             DISPLAY "THERE" ;LOCATE 2,2 <-- "LOCATE" IS ALSO A COMMENT
             DISPLAY ";" | LOCATE 2,2 ;Display a semicolon and locate the

         Here is a brief list of some problems you may encounter while
    using Omega-Link, and some suggests as to what you should do about
    them:

Problem:     Shift-PrtSc is not printing your RLE picture correctly.Problem:                                                            
Suggestion:  For this command to work, you must have a graphics driverSuggestion:                                                           
             installed before you execute Omega-Link. There is one with
             most versions of DOS.  However, some printers come with their
             own graphics drivers.  You should consult your printer man-
             ual(s) and/or your DOS manual for more information.

Problem:     Every character you type appears twice on the screen.Problem:

Problem:     All text is displayed as garbage. Problem:                                       
Suggestion:  Confirm that the number of data bits, stop bits, parity value,Suggestion:                                                                
             and modem speed are set correctly for the computer with which
             you are connected.  Also, make sure that ANSI graphics are
             enabled if they need to be for the system that you are call-
             ing.

Problem:     Your modem is not recognizing anything that is sent to it. Problem:

             rectly.  Also, make sure that all modem commands are defined
             correctly for the modem that you are using.

Problem:     Any uploads or downloads are terminated before they should beProblem:

Suggestion:  Several things can cause this to occur.  If you do not tellSuggestion:                                                             
             Omega to download quickly enough after being told to do so by
             the host system, the host system may terminate the file trans-
             fer.  Usually you have in the neighborhood of 30-40 seconds to
             enable a download with Omega-Link before most host systems
             will stop trying to transfer a file.

             Another thing that might cause this to occur is if the infor-
             mation is being garbled by the telephone lines or if the host
             system is not recognizing the transfer correctly.

Problem:     On-line RLE pictures are not appearing correctly.Problem:                                                      
Suggestion:  There can be several causes for this problem.  One problem maySuggestion:                                                                
             be that you do not have on-line RLE graphics enabled (make
             sure that ANSI graphics are enabled also for the on-line RLE
             graphics to work).

             Another cause may be if you are using an EGA (or EGA compa-
             tible) display card.  Some EGA cards will lose characters from
             the modem when they change to graphics mode from text mode.
             If you think this is the problem, enable "XON/XOFF" in the
             "Communications Parameters" portion of the Parameters menu,
             and make sure that your host system supports XON/XOFF charac-
             ters.

             Finally, this problem could be due to line noise.

Problem:     ANSI Music will not play. Problem:                               
Suggestion:  Make sure that the ANSI music option (Alt-O) is enabled.  InSuggestion:                                                              
             order for the ANSI music option to be enabled, the ANSI-

                                  Appendix D                                  Appendix D

                         Commands for Editing Strings                         ____________________________

        In many menus displayed by Omega-Link, you will need to be able to
    edit strings (such as the modem initialization string).  Omega-Link has
    an advanced editor designed to make these changes easier.  Here is a
    list of keystrokes that you can press while editing a string, and what
    these keystrokes do:

        Up-Arrow:           This will bring you to the field to edit that        Up-Arrow:                                                        
                            is located above the field you are located at
                            currently.

        Down-Arrow:         Will bring you to the field located below the        Down-Arrow:                                                      
                            one you are located at currently.

        Left-Arrow:         Will move you to the character that left of the        Left-Arrow:                                                        
                            one you are located at currently inside of a
                            field.  If you are located all the way to the
                            left of a field, it will bring you to the pre-
                            vious field.

        Right-Arrow:        Will move you to the character that is        Right-Arrow:                                              
                            right of the one you are located at currently
                            inside of a field.  If you are located all the
                            way to the right of a field, it will bring you
                            to the next field.

        Ctrl-Left-Arrow:    Brings you to the field located to the        Ctrl-Left-Arrow:                                          
                            left of the one you are located at currently.

        Ctrl-Right-Arrow:   Will bring you to the field located to the        Ctrl-Right-Arrow:                                             
                            right of the one you are located at presently.

        Ins:                Toggles the insert mode on or off.  If the        Ins:                                                          
                            insert mode is enabled, whatever you type will
                            be displayed, and anything located to the right
                            will be moved over by a character.   If the
                            mode is disabled, anything you type will
                            destroy what is located at the cursor currently
                            and be replaced by the character which you
                            type.

        Del:                This will remove the character underneath of        Del:                                                            
                            your cursor from the screen.

        Backspace:          Will delete the character located to the        Backspace:                                                  
                            left of the cursor and move the cursor to the
                            left by one position.

        F1:                 This will erase the contents of a field.        F1:                                                         

        F2:                 This will restore the field to the way it was        F2:                                                              
                            originally before you began to edit it.

           Sequence of Steps Performed by Omega-Link When It Begins           ________________________________________________________

         When Omega-Link begins, it performs several things that may be
    beneficial to know.  This is performed as follows:

         First, Omega searches for the defaults file (OMEGADEF.DAT) in the
    default directory of DOS.  If it cannot find the file, it will examine
    the path command inside of the DOS environment, and search down the
    path until it finds the file.  If it does not find the file, or it is
    not a valid defaults file for this version of Omega-Link, it will use
    its own internal defaults.  Note that if you store a new defaults file,
    it will be stored in the path where the old one was found (if any).

         After this, it will attempt to load the function key files and the
    dialing directory if it can find any.

         A main screen will be displayed.  After the main screen is exited
    and you are in the terminal mode, the macro defininition for ALT-F1
    will be executed if it is defined.

     The Omega-Link External protocol handler comes to you preconfigured
     for several popular external protocols.  If you wish to add other
     protocols or modify the existing ones, see the section on installing
     protocols.


     INSTALLING THE EXTERNAL PROTOCOL HANDLER

     You will need to make the files OMEGAEXT.EXE and OMEGAEXT.DAT
     available to Omega-Link.  To do this you must copy them into either
     the current directory or a directory that is listed in the DOS PATH
     command.  The file OMEGAEXT.EXE will usally be placed in the same
     directory as OMEGA.EXE, and OMEGAEXT.DAT will be placed in the
     download sub-directory.

     The external protocol files will also need to be located so that the
     external protocol handler can find them.  This will usally be in the
     same directory as OMEGAEXT.EXE.  You may also edit the protocol
     descriptions to tell the external protocol handler where to find the
     external protocols if they won't be current directory.  A description
     of this process appears in the section on installing additional
     protocols.

     Recommended configurations

     If you have only one floppy diskette drive and no harddisk drive.

     When the external protocol handler asks for the protocol to use
     remove the program disk and insert the data disk.  As soon as the
     download or upload is completed reinsert the program disk.  Please
     note that due to the small amount of disk space that Omega-Link
     requires, it may be possible to have everything on one disk and still
     have quite a bit of space for downloads.  This is especially true of
     3-1/2" 720k or 1.44 meg floppy diskette systems.  For this type of
     system you may wish to simply copy all of the files onto program
     diskette.

     This configuration will give you the largest amount of space for
     downloaded files, however, it does require you to copy the file
     OMEGAEXT.DAT to each new diskette that you wish to use for downloads
     or uploads.  Therefore, you may wish to copy all the files onto you
     program diskette and then modify OMEGAEXT.DAT to use drive B:.

     External protocols

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     The following protocols have been preconfigured into the external
     protocol handler: DSZ (Zmodem, Ymodem-batch, and Ymodem-G), MLINK16
     (Megalink), PCKERMIT (Kermit), and CISB (Compuserve "B").  Our thanks
     go to the authors of these programs. Most of these programs may be
     downloaded from almost any BBS that has MS-DOS files.  We have not
     included any of these files to prevent violating there copyrights and
     to prevent you from having to download the same file twice.
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     INSTALLING ADDITIONAL PROTOCOLS
     -------------------------------
     To install a new protocol first copy the protocol into the directory
     that you wish use.  Then type OMEGAEXT at the DOS prompt.

     A menu will be displayed with the currently defined protocols and
     several entries marked "(Not defined)".  Select one the the not
     defined entries by pressing the letter that procedes it.






     At this time a menu will appear.  You may use the up and down arrow
     keys to move from item to item.  First select the very top item and
     press <F1>, this will erase the "(Not defined) message.  Now you may
     type the name that you wish to assign to this protocol.

     Next move down one line and press "N".  If you know that this
     protocol restores the machine to EXACTLY the same state as it was
     before the file transfer, then you may press "Y".  You should allways
     use "N" if you are not sure.  The most that will happen is that the
     first couple for characters that are received after the file transfer
     will be lost.

     Next, you will find a send command and a receive command.  These will
     vary considerably with each protocol, therefore, it is imposible to
     advise you how to configure these lines.  However, the following
     information should allow you to configure almost any external
     protocol.

     The following is a list of commands that you may use to configure
     external protocols.

     %B   Baud rate              One of: 60, 75, 100, 110, 150, 300, 350,
                                 400, 450, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600,
                                 19200, 38400.

     %C   Communications port    Either 1 or 2.

     %D   Data bits              Either 7 or 8

     %F   Filename               (default path = none)

     %f   Filename               (default path = location of OMEGAEXT.DAT)

     %P   Parity (upper case)    One of: O - odd, N - none, E - Even

     %p   Parity (lower case)    One of: o - odd, n - none, e - Even

     %S   Stop Bits              Either 1 or 2

     %X   Download path          Path where OMEGAEXT.DAT was found

     %%   The % character        Provided so that this character may be
                                 passed to the external protocol

     %$   COMSPEC                environment variable value
                                 (Usally x:\COMMAND.COM where x is the
                                 boot drive)

     The following examples assume that your modem is hooked to COM1 and
     is running 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, 2400 baud, and the
     file OMEGAEXT.DAT is found in C:\OMEGA\FILES.





     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     Command: %$/C CISB PORT %C SPEED %B

     This will execute COMMAND.COM and pass it the command line:
        /C CISB PORT 1 SPEED 2400
     It should be noted that command.com will do a path search for the
     file CISB.  This may be useful in some cases.
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     Command: DSZ COM%C RATE %B SETUP %D-%P-%S %X %F

     This will execute the command DSZ.EXE and pass it the command line:
        COM1 RATE 2400 SETUP 8-N-1 C:\OMEGA\FILES\ filename.ext
     where filename.ext is the filename that you enter at the prompt.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     Command: C:\OMEGA\PCKERMIT.EXE /c%C /b%B /p%p /t%f
     and you type SMILE.TXT at the filename prompt.

     This will execute the command C:\OMEGA\PCKERMIT.EXE with the command
     line:
         /c1 /b2400 /pn /tC:\OMEGA\FILES\SMILE.TXT
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     Please note that there are several differences between the sequence
     %X%F and %f.  The first will not allow you to change the default path
     portion, but the second will.  Also, the first will not display the
     default path when you enter the filename, where the second one will
     display the pathname.
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     After both the send and receive commands there are two switches. The
     first of these is the "Global filenames allowed" switch.  This switch
     disables the check of entered filename, allowing global filenames to
     be passed to the external protocol.  The second switch is "Filename
     required" and is reserved for future use.  Set it to "Y."



     USING AN EXTERNAL PROTOCOL
     --------------------------

     To use an external protocol that has been installed, press
     <Ctrl-PgUP> to upload or <Ctrl-PgDn> to download.  Then select
     number 6 (external) from the protocol menu.  The external protocol
     handler will be loaded and you will be presented with a menu of
     protocols.  Select the desired protocol and enter a filename if
     required.  When the file transfer is complete you will be prompted to
     press and key to continue.  As soon as you press a key you will be
     back in Omega-Link.
