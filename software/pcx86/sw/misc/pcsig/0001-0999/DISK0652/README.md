software alternative to the EGA card. For a fraction of the cost you can have
four colors and other patterns that border on true colors.

partial list of the features include Connecting lines, Ray, Zoom, Erase, Draw
(two modes), Spray, Lines, Brush, Box, Fill, Circle, Arc lines, Connecting arcs,

Apart from that, well organizes pull down menus give you additional features.
The Page window gives you Directories (regular and icon dir), Load and Save (two
types), Text window which gives you various fonts and templates, Edit window
which has Copy, Move, Smear (all have two options, merge & replace), Screen opt
which some show-off features like rainbow which scrolls a rainbow of color in
the background. Beside this we also have screen swap (you have more then two
screens to work in).
 
Printing options is supported as well as screens with different fonts and sizes.
Other unique features will be ICON directories which when invoked will show an
actual scale down replication of the full screen painting or brush (smaller
paintings). Related products such as animation package and 3D drawing package
(look at cube option) can be developed to work together as a system.
