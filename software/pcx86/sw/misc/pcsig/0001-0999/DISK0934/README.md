## Information about "TICKLEX - TICKLER PROGRAM"

    TICKLEX is the ultimate scheduler/calendar.  There is no more powerful
    or feature-laden program available.  Equally at home on single PC's or
    LAN's, TICKLEX may be invoked as either a stand-alone program or as a
    pop-up.  The program sports a multitude of screen displays, reports, and
    features, and it's capable of handling the scheduling needs of one
    person or a whole office.
    
    TICKLEX handles appointments, deadlines, expectations, reminders and
    timetables, with each item having up to four reminders linked to it.
    Linking reminders to appointment deadlines or expectations is helpful
    when you need to change the original date.  When a change is made, all
    the linked reminders are automatically changed.  Among the handy
    features -- find the day of the week for any date in the next half
    century, set up to 20 alarms for any day, and drag unmet deadlines (to-
    do's) forward from one day to the next.

TICKLEX is an integrated tickler, scheduler, and To-Do list that can    
handle simple project management tasks.
