## Information about "PURCHASE ORDER SYSTEM"

    PURCHASE ORDER SYSTEM is great for almost any kind of business. It
    makes it easy to enter and print purchase orders, and keep a record of
    all vendors. You can enter a list of vendors with addresses and phone
    numbers, which you can later browse, edit, or delete. And you can print
    a vendor master list.
    
    When entering a purchase order, the screen is divided into several
    columns for the account number, quantity, unit, item description, and
    price. Outstanding purchase transactions can be printed by account,
    vendor, or purchase order. Purchases received can be cleared
    immediately, and if a purchase transaction is accidentally cleared it
    can be uncleared for recall.

          Product Setup
          -----------------------------------------------------------------
           F1  = Help Screen

           F10 = Menu

             . Change Display Order (Product No., Product Name)

               Gives the user the ability to  change the primary sort value
               to one of the three option below.

             . Print Product Descriptions

             . Print Inventory ReOrder Report

               Prints  all product  descriptions along  with the  inventory
               values  for  all  products that  fall  below  the designated
               inventory level.

             . Adjust Inventory Totals from External File

               This allows the user to build  an external file for updating
               the products in the product  inventory file.  The file  is a
               plain DOS Text file with two values in it and must be called
               ADJUST.INV.  The first  is the product number followed  by a
               comma, then  the quantity  to add  to or  subtract from  the
               inventory file.  If the quantity  is negative the value will
               be added to the product file, if the qauntity is positive it
               will be subtracted  from the file.   (** Please notice  that
               the values are  reversed.  This is done because  most of the
               time you will be subtracting values  from the inventory file
               and I  didn't want to  force you to enter  a negative number
               each time).

               Example:   34R5T,567    Subtracts 567 from inventory count

               Example:   34R5T,-10    Adds 10 to inventory count

               that you can change the inventory values from this screen.

             .  Del

               Allows the user to delete a product description.

             .  Find

               Allows the user  to find  a particular product  description.
               Please  note that the KEY  value is based  on the sort order
               selected.

             .  +/- Adjust

               Allows the user to adjust the inventory count up or down  by
               using the + or - key on the numeric key pad.  Enter a  + and

               be updated.
