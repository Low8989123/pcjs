## Information about "PROMENU AND PATCH AND OTHER UTILITIES"

    A memory-resident printer-control menu for Epson and compatible
    printers.
    
    PMENU3 gives you control codes, such as condensed, double strike, or
    underline, on command.  Once loaded, you can access PMENU3 while running
    your program and enter codes one at a time, or combinations of codes
    such as ``bold and italics''.
    
    Smarter than your average printing program, PMENU3 does not display or
    send conflicting codes to the printer, and can also be removed from
    memory.
    
    PATCH lets you view and modify disk files in memory or peruse and change
    the computer's memory as if it were a disk file.
    
    Display the contents of a file in memory, 256 bytes at a time.  Move
    around in the file, modify its contents, cancel modifications and search
    for specified strings.  Move immediately to the beginning or end of a
    file or jump to a portion of the file that is a certain offset, in
    bytes, from the beginning of the file.
    
    The file contents are displayed in both ASCII and hexadecimal.  You can
    do searches and modifications in either format.  Both formats of the
    file are viewed at the same time, with the hexadecimal on the left and
    the ASCII on the right.
    
    "Welcome Home" for the new baby, the traveller or the convalescent,
    "Sale Today" to boost your daily cash-flow, or "Hi Mom" from the
    football game. You can have them all and more with PC-BANNER.
    
    Here is a simple, menu-driven banner program that lets you change the
    style of print from light to dark. And it uses the IBM graphics
    character sets for high-quality banners.
    
    Here are a pair of protective utilities.
    
    SCRNOFF3 blanks your screen after three minutes of keyboard inactivity.
    This avoids etching your monitor.  Pressing any key brings the screen
    back into view.
    
    KYLOCK blanks your screen and locks the keyboard from others.  When the
    keyboard is locked, not even a Ctrl-Alt-Del routine reboots the
    computer.

Program Title: PROMENU, PATCH & Other Utilities
PC-SIG version: 1.6

PMENU3 is a memory-resident printer-control menu for Epson and
compatible printers.  It allows access to control codes such as
condensed, double strike, or underline on command.  By simply typing
PMENU332 at the DOS prompt, the program is loaded into memory, and you
are back at DOS.  Then load your other program as usual.  To pop up
PMENU3 while running your program, hit Alt-Tab.  You can enter codes one
at a time, or combinations of codes such as bold and italics.

What sets PMENU3 apart is that it has built-in "intelligence."  Unlike
generic programs, PMENU3 does not display or send codes to the printer
that do not work together.  PMENU3 is also unloadable from memory by
pressing Function-10 twice.

PMENU3 was developed under Turbo Pascal version 4.0 and DOS 3.1, but it
runs on DOS 2.0--3.3.  PMENU3 is compatible with most software for the
IBM PC, but this version expects the display to be in text mode.  Many
users have reported using it on various compatibles.

PATCH lets you view and modify disk files in memory.  The program
displays the contents of a file, 256 bytes at a time, and allows you to
move around in the file, modify its contents, cancel modifications, and
search through the file for specified strings.  You can immediately move
to the beginning or end of a file, or jump to a portion of the file that
is a certain offset, in bytes, from the beginning of the file.  The
contents of the file are displayed in both ASCII and hexadecimal, and
searches and modifications can be made in either format.  The
hexadecimal and ASCII formats of the file are viewed at the same time,
with the hexadecimal format on the left and the ASCII format on the
right.

PATCH asks for a file name if none is specified on the DOS command line,
then attempts to open the specified file.  The file name "memory" is
special to PATCH.  Entering this name allows you to peruse and change
the computer's memory as if it were a disk file.

PC-BANNER is a simple, easy-to-use banner program.  It is menu-driven,
letting you change the style of print from light to dark.  This program
makes use of the IBM graphics character sets which create high-quality
banners.  SCRNOFF3 is designed to blank your screen after three minutes
of keyboard inactivity.  Depressing any key brings the screen back into
view.

KYLOCK blanks your screen and locks the keyboard from others.  When the
keyboard is locked, not even a ctrl-alt-del routine will reboot the
computer.

Please note, SCRNOFF3 and KYLOCK are meant to be run together, not as
separate programs.

Usage:  Utilities.

Special Requirements:  A printer for PMENU3 and PC-BANNER.

How to Start:  Type GO (press enter).

Suggested Registration:  $10.00 for PMENU, $20.00 for PATCH, $2.00 for
PC-BANNER, and $1.50 SCRNOFF3.

                           NEWLIFE Software Programs
                             written by Bob Nance

The latest versions of all of these programs are available on the NEWLIFE
CHRISTIAN BBS @ 601-627-5582, 300-9600 Baud (Courier HST) Bob Nance, SYSOP.
(24 Hours)

                               SYSOP Utilities:

BBFILE and REGGIE - Bulletin Board registration programs - REGGIE runs on-
  line; BBFILE is the companion database application that produces labels,
  reports, and mailmerge files.  Has ability to read in 4 questions from
  external text file, and produce nice reports from the answers for use as
  bulletins.  Note: REGGIE runs on-line as a door under DOORWAY, by Marshall
  Dudley, available at Data World BBS (615)966-3574... this allows it to
  be run under any BBS system that can support doors.
BBNEWS - Bulletin Board NEWS file maker - builds NEWS files by reading
  configuration files which contain a list of files the NEWS is to be composed
  of.  Multiple "quotes" type files are supported and can be anywhere in the
  resulting NEWS files, along with full text files, such as disclaimers,
  notices, download/upload reports, etc.
BBMAST - Bulletin Board MASTER file list maker - simply reads a number of text
  files (such as BBS directories) and outputs them to one master list of files
  totals file sizes in each directory and gives grand total at the end
DTPDIR - DOS Dir output file to PCBoard Directory conversion program
LABQUO - LABBS quotes file conversion program - supports multiple quotes files
  that are converted to LABBS format
LCALLS - LABBS "Last Calls" Callers Log reader
LTPDIR - LABBS to PCBoard File Directory conversion program
PTLDIR - PCBoard to LABBS File Directory conversion program
PCBpop - Memory resident Utility program for the PCBoard SYSOP - Users file
  maintenance (name, sec code, conferences, address, password, delete,
  undelete, user comments, and sysop comments) PLUS reads Callers file
  backwards, reads Messages files, and 20 other text files assignable to
  function/Alt-function keys.
RBBpop - Memory resident Utility program similar to PCBpop for the RBBS SYSOP
PCB LABELS - Labels program with direct import into the Labels database from 
  the PCBoard Users file - also has program and version fields for software 
  authors 

User comments about PCBpop:

  "**GREAT**"
  "Thanks for writing PCBpop... use it all the time!"
  "Man, you have outdone yourself with the new version!"


                      Memory Resident Printer Utilities:

PMENU3 - Memory resident printer control menu for the EPSON - nice design,
  has nice BabyFace mode, lots of other codes, and built-in intelligence
  Was probably the first program of this type... released in August of 85.
  Can be unloaded from memory.
PROMENU - Memory resident printer control menu for the IBM Proprinter -
  similar to PMENU3, can be unloaded from memory.

User comments about PMENU3:

  "I do not know how to thank you enough for creating PMENU3."
  "Thanks to shareware and people like you putting programs into the concept,
people like us who do not want to be programmers reap the benefits and make
computing more livable."
  "Just thought you would like to know that I think the program is just GREAT!
  "I'm impressed with your program.  I started writing one myself but didn't
know how to make it memory resident.  Now I've found yours."
  "I really like your PMENU3.  I use it a lot."
  "Great, Great, GREAT idea and program!!!"


                                   Database:

MAILME - Fast Mailing Labels Database Application - has mailmerge and export-
  ability to save settings in a "setup" file for rerunning later.  (e.g.
  Labels for Filecode AA, Mailmerge File for Filecode ZZ, etc.) - for handling
  mailing lists
STIKME - Custom Labels - allows you to print 6-line labels and control
  whether each line is Normal, Wide, Condensed, or Babyface.  Automatically
  centers each line as printed if desired.  Great for Return address labels,
  or any special purpose, such as diskette labeling, "DO NOT XRAY" labels,
  etc., etc.  Also has the ability to produce a series of labels which have
  a serial number (such as for software).
BBFILE - see above description.
PCB LABELS - see above description.


                                Miscellaneous:

MRHELP - Memory resident help file reader for use with any program that
  doesn't have help files... 20 different text files can be assigned to F1-F10
  and Alt F1 - Alt F10.
VERSE - Displays a different verse of scripture each day from a text file of
  scripture verses (included)

                                    Games:

CTA-1 - Christian Text Adventure #1 - This is a text adventure written to run
under the Generic Adventure Game System (GAGS).  The adventurer, in this case,
finds himself in a Biblical allegory, as a Crusader doing battle against the
forces of evil (such as the Wolf of Unbelief), with the weapons of spiritual
warfare (the sword of the spirit, the shield of faith, etc.).

User comments about CTA-1:

     "We all love it very much."
     "Thank you very much for giving us a pastime that is worthwhile."
     "I wish I had a shotgun to blow that computer up."
     "I think this game was invented by the Russians to fry our brains."
     "I'm running your game on-line, the users are asking me for hints."
     "I liked the symbolism in your game."

                File and memory patching utility for the IBM PC

               Copyright (C) 1987, Imaginative Software Concepts












































     1.0 Introduction

        PATCH allows viewing and modification of disk files and memory. The 
        program displays the contents of a file, 256 bytes at a time, and 
        allows you to move around in the file, modify its contents, cancel 
        modifications, and search through the file for specified strings. The 
        contents of the file are displayed in both ASCII and hexadecimal, and 
        searches and modifications may be made in either format. 

     2.0 A Word From Our Sponsor

        Imaginative Software Concepts distributes all its products as user-
        supported software. You may freely copy and distribute unmodified 
        versions of PATCH, as long as no fee is charged for such copying or 
        distribution. Users' Groups may charge a small fee, not to exceed $10, 
        to recoup their own costs.

     3.0 Getting Started

        To run PATCH, type "PATCH", optionally followed by a file name, at the 
        DOS command prompt. The program displays a brief registration message, 
        asks for a file name if none was specified on the DOS command line, 
        then attempts to open the specified file. If PATCH cannot find the 
        file, the program informs you and asks for a new name. You may leave 
        the program by pressing the enter key without entering a file name. 
        The file name "memory" is special to PATCH; entering this name will 
        allow you to peruse and change the computer's memory as if it were a 
        disk file. (If you need to run PATCH on a file named "memory", enter 
        "memory." as the file's name.) 





























     4.0 The Display

        After PATCH opens a file, the program displays the first 256 bytes of 
        the file in the following format. Labels in the display are highlighted
        to make reading easier. The numbers in parentheses are not part of the 
        display, but refer to the descriptions below.

        (1) The top line of the display identifies the file and shows the 
        offset, in bytes, of the first byte in the current buffer. This offset 
        is a hexadecimal number. 

        (2) Hexadecimal labels give the relative offset of each byte in the 
        buffer display. The bytes are numbered first by row, then by column; 
        for example, the leftmost byte in the bottom row of the display is 
        byte F0 (240 decimal). This number may be added to the offset 
        displayed on the first line to obtain the offset from the beginning of 
        the file of any byte in the current buffer. 

        (3) The contents of the current buffer are shown in hexadecimal and 
        ASCII. Any hexadecimal values which do not correspond to printable 
        characters are displayed in the ASCII section as periods. 

        Note: if the file is less than 256 bytes long, PATCH pads the display 
        with null characters (hex 00).

        (4) Two help lines briefly describe the commands available. 









     5.0 Function Keys

        5.1 Move to beginning of file - F1

            Pressing the F1 key saves any changes to the current buffer, 
            displays the first buffer in the file, and moves the cursor to the 
            first byte of the buffer display. If the current buffer is the 
            first one in the file, pressing this key has no effect. 

        5.2 Move to end of file - F2

            Pressing the F2 key saves any changes to the current buffer, 
            displays the last buffer in the file, and moves the cursor to the 
            first byte of the buffer display. If the current buffer is the 
            last one in the file, pressing this key has no effect. 

        5.3 Search - F3

            When you press the F3 key, PATCH asks you for a string to locate. 
            You may cancel the search request by pressing the enter key 
            without entering a search string. If the cursor presently appears 
            in the hexadecimal section of the buffer display (see 5.6), you 
            may enter up to ten hexadecimal digits; if the cursor appears in 
            the ASCII section, you may enter up to thirty ASCII characters. 
            Searching begins at the byte immediately following the cursor. If 
            the search string is not wholly contained within the current 
            buffer, the program saves any changes and searches the remainder 
            of the file. If PATCH cannot locate the string, the program 
            informs you and returns the cursor to its previous position; 
            otherwise, the program displays the buffer in which the string was 
            found and places the cursor at the first byte of the string. 

        5.4 Search for next occurrence - F4

            Pressing the F4 key causes the program to search the file for the 
            next occurrence of the search string you last entered. Searching 
            begins at the byte immediately following the cursor. If the string 
            is not wholly contained within the current buffer, the program 
            saves any changes and searches the remainder of the file. If PATCH 
            cannot locate the string, the program informs you and returns the 
            cursor to its previous position; otherwise, the program displays 
            the buffer in which the string was found and places the cursor at 
            the first byte of the string. Note that changing the section in 
            which the cursor appears (see 5.6) does not change the search 
            string; if you entered "ABC" as the search string while in the 
            ASCII section, switched to the hexadecimal section, then pressed 
            F4, PATCH will search for the hexadecimal equivalent to "ABC",
            that is, "414243". 

        5.5 Jump to offset in file - F5

            When you press the F5 key, PATCH asks you for an offset. You may 
            cancel the jump command by pressing the enter key without entering 
            an offset, or may enter up to ten hexadecimal digits, representing 
            an offset, in bytes, from the beginning of the file. The program 
            moves the cursor to this position. If the new position is not in 
            the current buffer, PATCH saves any changes and displays the new 
            buffer. If the offset indicates a position past the end of the 
            file, the cursor is placed at the last byte of the last buffer of 
            the file. 







        5.6 Switch between hex and ASCII sections of the display - F6

            Pressing the F6 key switches from the hexadecimal to the ASCII 
            section of the buffer display and vice versa. Switching sections 
            affects which characters may be entered when specifying a search 
            string (see 5.3) or changing the contents of the file (see 6.0). 

        5.7 Exit - F10

            Pressing the F10 key saves any changes to the current buffer and  
            terminates the program. 

        5.8 Move to first byte of display - HOME

            Pressing the HOME key moves the cursor to the first byte of the 
            buffer display, located in the top left corner.

        5.9 Move to previous line of display - up arrow

            Pressing the up arrow key moves the cursor to the previous line of 
            the buffer display (i.e., back 16 bytes). If the cursor is already 
            in the first line of the display, pressing this key has no effect. 

        5.10 Move to previous buffer - PG UP

            Pressing the PG UP key saves any changes to the current buffer, 
            displays the previous buffer, and moves the cursor to the first 
            byte of the buffer display. If the current buffer is the first one 
            in the file, pressing this key has no effect. 

        5.11 Move to previous byte of display - left arrow

            Pressing the left arrow key moves the cursor to the previous byte 
            of the buffer display. If the cursor is already at the first byte 
            of the display, pressing this key has no effect. 

        5.12 Move to next byte of display - right arrow

            Pressing the right arrow key moves the cursor to the next byte of 
            the buffer display. If the cursor is already at the last byte of 
            the display, pressing this key has no effect. 

        5.13 Move to last byte of display - END

            Pressing the END key moves the cursor to the last byte of the 
            buffer display, located in the bottom right corner.

        5.14 Move to next line of display - down arrow

            Pressing the down arrow key moves the cursor to the next line in 
            the buffer display (i.e., forward 16 bytes). If the cursor is 
            already in the last line of the display, pressing this key has no 
            effect. 

        5.15 Move to next buffer - PG DN

            Pressing the PG DN key saves any changes to the current buffer, 
            displays the next buffer, and moves the cursor to the first byte 
            of the buffer display. If the current buffer is the last one in 






            the file, pressing this key has no effect. 

        5.16 Restore entire buffer to previous contents - INS

            Pressing the INS key cancels any changes made to the current 
            buffer. This only affects changes made since the present buffer 
            was last displayed; once the program moves to another buffer,
            changes become permanent and cannot be canceled. 

        5.17 Restore current byte to previous contents - DEL

            Pressing the DEL cancels any changes made to the current byte of 
            the buffer display and moves the cursor to the next byte of the 
            display. This only affects changes made since the present buffer 
            was last displayed; once the program moves to another buffer, 
            changes become permanent and cannot be canceled. 


















































     6.0 Changing the File

        The contents of the buffer display, beginning at the current cursor 
        position, may be changed by typing new values. If the cursor is in the 
        ASCII section of the display, the new values may be any ASCII 
        characters; in the hexadecimal section, PATCH will accept only pairs 
        of hexadecimal digits. The program highlights bytes which have been 
        changed. Changes may be canceled by using either INS or DEL (see 5.16 
        and 5.17) to restore the entire buffer display or a single byte to its 
        original value. Changes become permanent as soon as the program moves 
        to a different buffer; commands which may cause this are: move to 
        beginning of file (F1); move to end of file (F2); search (F3); search 
        for next occurrence (F4); jump to offset in file (F5); move to 
        previous buffer (PG UP); and move to next buffer (PG DN). The program 
        also saves changes to the current buffer before exiting (F10). 

        Note: Since PATCH writes changed sections in 128-byte chunks, the 
        program may cause a file to become slightly (up to 127 bytes) larger 
        if you modify the last buffer in the file. For the same reason, 
        changes made to the last 128 bytes of the display buffer are discarded 
        when the file is less than 129 bytes long.

                  The Intelligent Epson Printer Control Menu
                      Version 3.2 released March 21, 1988

                             Written by Bob Nance


The latest release of this and other NEWLIFE Software programs is available to 
registered users 24 hours a day at NEWLIFE Christian BBS, 601-627-5582, 300-
9600 Courier HST.  

               ----------- Changes with version 3.2 -----------

1.  Now unloadable.  Hit F10 twice.

2.  Now checks to see if it is already resident and aborts if it is.  Of 
course, YOU wouldn't try to load it twice would you? 

3.  Now checks to make sure that SideKick is not already loaded.  You can load 
PMENU3 before loading SideKick, but not after.

4.  Now uses the ALT-TAB hotkey instead of ALT-RETURN to allow use with Word 
Perfect, which has an ALT-RETURN command.  Notify me if this new hotkey 
conflicts with anything, and I'll go to a three key combination hot-key, such 
as ALT-LEFT SHIFT-P, or something about that ridiculous. 

5.  Now has EGA support.  It should properly pop-up over a 43 line EGA screen.  
(Older versions would only save and restore a 25 line screen).  I don't have 
an EGA, so let me know if this doesn't work. 

6.  Now an .EXE file instead of a .COM file.  This is because it was converted 
to Turbo Pascal 4.0 with this release.  

 ---------- Extremely long and boring description of the Program ------------

PMENU3 is a memory resident Printer Control Menu for Epson and 100% compatible 
printers and the IBM PC.  It allows you to send control codes to your printer 
such as condensed, double strike, or underline WHEN YOU NEED TO.  By simply 
typing PMENU332 at the DOS prompt, the program will be loaded into memory, and 
you will be returned to DOS.  Then load your other program as usual.  To pop 
up PMENU3 while running your program, hit Alt Tab.  You can enter codes one at 
a time, or combinations of codes such as bold and italics.  PMENU3 version 3.2 
is different from other memory resident printer setup programs because it will 
ONLY send and display those codes that work together.  Unlike generic or user-
definable printer setup programs, it does not lie to you, saying it sent codes 
to the printer that will not work together.  

The program was developed under Turbo Pascal Version 4.0 and DOS 3.1, but it
runs on DOS 2.0 - 3.1.  PMENU3 will be compatible with most software for the
IBM PC, but this version expects the display to be in text mode.  It works
with all the other memory resident programs I had access to.  Many users have
reported using it on various IBM PC compatibles under MS-DOS.

Note: Some of the older Epson printers do not support all codes that this 
program does such as Near Letter Quality.  In fact, I use a Thinkjet so don't 
feel bad, mine doesn't support them either.  Here are the actual codes I use.

   .........................................................................

NOTE TO PROPRINTER USERS! - Do not use PMENU3 with the Proprinter, since some 
of the Epson codes in PMENU3 are not supported by the Proprinter, such as the 
one for Reset to normal.  I have created a special program for you, PROMENU, 
and will be happy to send it to you.  It is very similar to PMENU3 in design, 
except that the codes section had to be totally rewritten because of different 
codes for certain functions and different incompatibilities between the codes.

Description of PMENU3, Version 3.2, the intelligent memory resident printer 
control menu for EPSON or 100% compatible printers, released March 21, 1988.

At right is the current PMENU3 Version 3.2 Menu. +=======[ PMENU3 3.2 ]======+
There are some good changes with this release.   |  [R]  Reset to Normal     |
PMENU3 is unloadable!  Hit F10 twice.  It now    |  [A]  Babyface            |
checks to see if it is already loaded, and will  |  [B]  Bold                |

compiled under Turbo Pascal 4.0, so it is now    |  [D]  Double Strike       |
an .EXE file instead of a .COM file. PMENU3 uses |  [E]  Elite               |
36K of memory and is compatible with other       |  [F]  Form Feed           |
resident programs.  It operates under PC-DOS     |  [I]  Italics             |

                The Intelligent Proprinter Printer Control Menu
                      Version 3.2 released March 21, 1988
                    (C) Copyright 1987,1988 NEWLIFE Software
                             Written by Bob Nance


The latest release of this and other NEWLIFE Software programs is available to 
registered users 24 hours a day at NEWLIFE Christian BBS, 601-627-5582, 300-
9600 Courier HST.  

               ----------- Changes with version 3.2 -----------

1.  Now unloadable.  Hit F10 twice.

2.  Now checks to see if it is already resident and aborts if it is.  Of 
course, YOU wouldn't try to load it twice would you? 

3.  Now checks to make sure that SideKick is not already loaded.  You can load 
PROMENU before loading SideKick, but not after.

4.  Now uses the ALT-TAB hotkey instead of ALT-RETURN to allow use with Word 
Perfect, which has an ALT-RETURN command.  Notify me if this new hotkey 
conflicts with anything, and I'll go to a three key combination hot-key, such 
as ALT-LEFT SHIFT-P, or something about that ridiculous. 

5.  Now has EGA support.  It should properly pop-up over a 43 line EGA screen.  
(Older versions would only save and restore a 25 line screen).  I don't have 
an EGA, so let me know if this doesn't work. 

6.  Now an .EXE file instead of a .COM file.  This is because it was converted 
to Turbo Pascal 4.0 with this release.  

------------- Extremely long and boring description of PROMENU ---------------

PROMENU is a memory resident Printer Control Menu for the IBM proprinter and
compatible printers and the IBM PC.  It allows access to control codes such as
condensed, double strike, or underline WHEN YOU NEED THEM.  By simply typing
PROMNU32 at the DOS prompt, the program will be loaded into memory, and you
will be returned to DOS.  Then load your other program as usual.  To pop up
PROMENU while running your program, hit Alt-Tab.  You can enter codes one
at a time, or combinations of codes such as near letter quality and skip page
break.  Each code sent to the printer is highlighted and will still be high-
lighted the next time you pop-up PROMENU so you can remember how your printer
is set.  PROMENU is an "intelligent" printer control menu, unlike those that
are "user-definable".  It does not lie to you, telling you that it has sent
codes to the printer which will not work together.  Therefore only those codes 
which are actually sent are highlighted. 

Some codes are "dominant" while other codes are "recessive".  For example, Bold 
is dominant over Condensed.  If bold has been sent, you cannot send condensed.  
If Condensed has been sent first and then you send Bold, condensed will be 
turned off and bold will be highlighted and bold will be in effect.  In some 
cases, the last code sent is the one that is in effect.  For example, in the 
case of vertical line spacing, you can only have one option selected at a time. 
Therefore, selecting 8 lines per inch turns off 7/72 lines per inch and 6 lines 
per inch.  In some cases, you will have to [R]eset to normal if you have 
selected a "dominant" code and you now want to sent one that is "recessive", 
such as in the case of selecting bold, and then wanting to select condensed.

Check the following chart for questions on compatabilities between
codes:

If you send:                          you will get:
condensed, bold                       bold
condensed, twelve c.p.i.              twelve c.p.i.
condensed, near letter quality        condensed
superscript, subscript                last mode selected
6 l.p.i., 8 l.p.i., 7/72 l.p.i.       last mode selected

You can send anything else together, with the following exception.

Babyface is a combination of 6/72 lines per inch, subscript, and condensed, so
keep that in mind when sending other codes with Babyface.  For example, if
you send Babyface and then twelve c.p.i., twelve c.p.i. will override the
condensed code and you will get 6/72 lines per inch, subscript, and twelve
c.p.i.  Since bold also overrides condensed, if you send Bold after
Babyface, you will get 6/72 lines per inch(vertical), subscript, and bold.
It will NOT be condensed, since bold turns off condensed.

The program was developed under Turbo Pascal Version 4.0 and DOS 3.1, but it
runs on DOS 2.0 - 3.1.  PROMENU will be compatible with most software for the
IBM PC, but this version expects the display to be in text mode.  It works
with all the other memory resident programs I had access to.  Many users have
reported using it on various compatibles under MS-DOS.

               KEYBOARD LOCK WITH AUTO 3 MINUTE SCREEN BLANKER


These utilities, SCRNOFF3.ASM & KYLOCK.ASM, comprise a 2 part utilities set.
Each must be assembled, linked and converted from exe to executable com files
separately.  The com files are provided on this disk for the convenience of
those without an assembler.  These utilities were developed to work with POPUP
DESKSET (TM) and work together to automatically blank the screen after 3
minutes of keyboard inactivity.  Pressing any key unblanks the screen and
pressing ALT-O toggles the auto screen blanker on & off.  In addition, the
operator has the option of using a "hotkey" (ALT-K) to freeze the keyboard &
blank the screen whenever desired.  After the "hotkey" is used to activate the
second part of this set, the operator must then enter a password.  The keyboard
remains locked and the screen blanked until the password is reentered.  The
password may be changed each time the operator invokes the utility to freeze
the keyboard.  Once a password is chosen, of course, it must be reentered
exactly as entered to unlock the keyboard and unblank the screen.  All keys and
their combinations enterable from the keyboard may be used not to exceed 64.
The routine may be aborted before the password is entered by pressing the
escape key.  Since the ctrl-alt-del warm start function is disabled by trapping
that key combination, once entered, nothing but a power off/on cold start will
unlock the keyboard for anyone without the password.  The password is not
displayed on the screen.  The backspace key may be used as an editing key on
entering and reentering the password.  Pressing enter/return enters the
password.  Reentering the password to unlock the keyboard and unblank the
screen may be attempted repeatedly simply by pressing the enter/return key and
starting over.  In addition, the "hotkeys" used to invoke the various modules
of POPUP DESKSET(TM) have been trapped and may not be included in a password.
These are:  ALT-W, ALT-U,ALT-A, ALT-D, ALT-X, ALT-V, ALT-C, & ALT-F10.  When
used with POPUP DESKSET(TM), SCRNOFF3.COM should be loaded after pop alarm &
pop date.  Then, load KYLOCK.COM just before pop any. When used with other
"terminate but stay resident" programs, experiment with the order of loading.
If not used with POPUP DESKSET(TM) or any other "TSR", simply load both, one
after the other.


COMMAND SUMMARY:
                  ALT-O --------- TOGGLES AUTO 3 MINUTE SCREEN BLANKER ON/OFF.

                  ALT-K --------- INVOKES MAIN PROGRAM WHICH IMMEDIATELY BLANKS                                  
                                  THE SCREEN AND ALLOWS THE USER TO ENTER A
                                  PASSWORD THAT LOCKS THE KEYBOARD UNTIL
                                  REENTERED.

                  BACKSPACE ----- EDIT PASSWORD ENTRY.
                
                  ESC   --------- ABORT!  (After ALT-K & prior to hitting
                                   enter/return.)

                  ENTER --------- ENTERS PASSWORD.  ALSO ABORTS IF NO KEYS HAVE
                                  BEEN PRESSED TO ENTER A PASSWORD.


 ***********************  ---      WARNING!     ---    ***********************

When the screen is blanked by this program, it is still possible to read the
screen, due to its persistence, with the naked eye or photographic film.
Darken your room or office and you can see this for yourself.  To increase
security, overlay a resident calendar ,help menu/table, or some other type of
routine that you have in memory before invoking this keyboard lock routine.
