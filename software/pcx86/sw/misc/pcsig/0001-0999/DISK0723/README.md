## Information about "SUPER PINBALL"

    SUPER PINBALL is a collection of five great pinball games, each with a
    unique layout. You control the flippers with your left- and right-shift
    keys for realistic pinball action. The disk is menu-driven, letting you
    jump between games without exiting to DOS.  No documentation is provided
    with this disk and none is needed -- simply type GO and choose your
    game.
