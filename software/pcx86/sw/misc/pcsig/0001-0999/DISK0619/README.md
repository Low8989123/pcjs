## Information about "HOTBOOT AND INSULTS"

    A couple of practical jokes that are fun for the PC user and, possibly,
    the PC victim.
    
    HOTBOOT is a public domain version of a classic.  If you like this one,
    get the original from Left-Handed Software.  Load HOTBOOT into the
    system of your victim.  From here on out, it's a flirtation of sorts
    between the PC and the user.  As the user attempts to work with the
    computer, the computer issues increasingly more personal remarks.  How
    real is this to the victim?  You'll have to watch and see if you can
    figure it out.
    
    INSULTS can randomly generate 22 million insults on the unsuspecting PC
    user -- some of them even make sense.  Not for the weak-stomached.
