## Information about "THE BIBLE 7-7 (766,767,768,769,770,771)"

    This disk is part of a seven-disk set with the entire King James version
    of the Bible.  It is in text file format, making it easy to locate
    verses, add passages into documents, or prepare manuscript studies.
    
    Since it is all ASCII text files, each book is a separate file.  When
    you get the disks, the files are archived, or ``squeezed'', so you must
    first unsqueeze them onto either 19 other 360K floppies or onto your
    hard drive.  Be advised that some books of the Bible are too long to fit
    into some wordprocessors that limit the size of documents to the amount
    of available RAM.
    
    To view or search these files, you need to use a wordprocessor or some
    kind of viewing shell.  No such program is provided on this disk.

COL 1:1  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our
 brother,

COL 1:2  To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse:
 Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

COL 1:3  We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying
 always for you,

COL 1:4  Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye
 have to all the saints,

COL 1:5  For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard
 before in the word of the truth of the gospel;

COL 1:6  Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth
 fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the
 grace of God in truth:

COL 1:7  As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you
 a faithful minister of Christ;

COL 1:8  Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.

COL 1:9  For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to
 pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his
 will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;

COL 1:10  That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
 fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;

COL 1:11  Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto
 all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;

COL 1:12  Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be
 partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:

COL 1:13  Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated
 us into the kingdom of his dear Son:

COL 1:14  In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of
 sins:

COL 1:15  Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every
 creature:

COL 1:16  For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are
 in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or
 principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:

COL 1:17  And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.

COL 1:18  And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the
 firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.

COL 1:19  For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;

COL 1:20  And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to
 reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in
 earth, or things in heaven.

COL 1:21  And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by
 wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled

COL 1:22  In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and
 unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:

COL 1:23  If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved
 away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached
 to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;

COL 1:24  Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is
 behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is
 the church:

COL 1:25  Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God
 which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;

COL 1:26  Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations,
 but now is made manifest to his saints:

COL 1:27  To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this
 mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:

COL 1:28  Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all
 wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:

COL 1:29  Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which
 worketh in me mightily.

COL 2:1  For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for
 them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;

COL 2:2  That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and
 unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the
 acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;

COL 2:3  In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

COL 2:4  And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.

COL 2:5  For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit,
 joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in
 Christ.

COL 2:6  As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in
 him:

COL 2:7  Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have
 been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.

COL 2:8  Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit,
 after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after
 Christ.

COL 2:9  For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.

COL 2:10  And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and
 power:

COL 2:11  In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without
 hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision
 of Christ:

COL 2:12  Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him
 through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.

COL 2:13  And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your
 flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all
 trespasses;

COL 2:14  Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which
 was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;

COL 2:15  And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them
 openly, triumphing over them in it.

COL 2:16  Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of
 an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:

COL 2:17  Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.

COL 2:18  Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and
 worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen,
 vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,

COL 2:19  And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands
 having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the
 increase of God.

COL 2:20  Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world,
 why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,

COL 2:21  (Touch not; taste not; handle not;

COL 2:22  Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and
 doctrines of men?

COL 2:23  Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and
 humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the satisfying
 of the flesh.

COL 3:1  If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above,
 where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.

COL 3:2  Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.

COL 3:3  For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.

COL 3:4  When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear
 with him in glory.

COL 3:5  Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication,
 uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness,
 which is idolatry:

COL 3:6  For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of
 disobedience:

COL 3:7  In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.

COL 3:8  But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy,
 filthy communication out of your mouth.

COL 3:9  Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with
 his deeds;

COL 3:10  And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the
 image of him that created him:

COL 3:11  Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor
 uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in
 all.

COL 3:12  Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of
 mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;

COL 3:13  Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a
 quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.

COL 3:14  And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of
 perfectness.

COL 3:15  And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye
 are called in one body; and be ye thankful.

COL 3:16  Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching
 and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing
 with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

COL 3:17  And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord
 Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.

COL 3:18  Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the
 Lord.

COL 3:19  Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.

COL 3:20  Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing
 unto the Lord.

COL 3:21  Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be
 discouraged.

COL 3:22  Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not
 with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;

COL 3:23  And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto
 men;

COL 3:24  Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the
 inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.

COL 3:25  But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath
 done: and there is no respect of persons.

COL 4:1  Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing
 that ye also have a Master in heaven.

COL 4:2  Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;

COL 4:3  Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of
 utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:

COL 4:4  That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.

COL 4:5  Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.

COL 4:6  Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may
 know how ye ought to answer every man.

COL 4:7  All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved
 brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:

COL 4:8  Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know
 your estate, and comfort your hearts;

COL 4:9  With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They
 shall make known unto you all things which are done here.

COL 4:10  Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son
 to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you,
 receive him;)

COL 4:11  And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These
 only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort
 unto me.

COL 4:12  Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you,
 always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and
 complete in all the will of God.

COL 4:13  For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them
 that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.

COL 4:14  Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.

COL 4:15  Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the
 church which is in his house.

COL 4:16  And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also
 in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from
 Laodicea.

COL 4:17  And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast
 received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.

COL 4:18  The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be
 with you. Amen.

EPH 1:1  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints
 which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:

EPH 1:2  Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord
 Jesus Christ.

EPH 1:3  Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath
 blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:

EPH 1:4  According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the
 world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:

EPH 1:5  Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
 to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,

EPH 1:6  To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us
 accepted in the beloved.

EPH 1:7  In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins,
 according to the riches of his grace;

EPH 1:8  Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;

EPH 1:9  Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his
 good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:

EPH 1:10  That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather
 together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are
 on earth; even in him:

EPH 1:11  In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated
 according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of
 his own will:

EPH 1:12  That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in
 Christ.

EPH 1:13  In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the
 gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed
 with that holy Spirit of promise,

EPH 1:14  Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the
 purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.

EPH 1:15  Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and
 love unto all the saints,

EPH 1:16  Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my
 prayers;

EPH 1:17  That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give
 unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:

EPH 1:18  The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know
 what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his
 inheritance in the saints,

EPH 1:19  And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who
 believe, according to the working of his mighty power,

EPH 1:20  Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set
 him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,

EPH 1:21  Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and
 every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is
 to come:

EPH 1:22  And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head
 over all things to the church,

EPH 1:23  Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.

EPH 2:1  And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;

EPH 2:2  Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world,
 according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh
 in the children of disobedience:

EPH 2:3  Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts
 of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were
 by nature the children of wrath, even as others.

EPH 2:4  But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved
 us,

EPH 2:5  Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with
 Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)

EPH 2:6  And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly
 places in Christ Jesus:

EPH 2:7  That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his
 grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.

EPH 2:8  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves:
 it is the gift of God:

EPH 2:9  Not of works, lest any man should boast.

EPH 2:10  For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
 which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.

EPH 2:11  Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh,
 who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the
 flesh made by hands;

EPH 2:12  That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the
 commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having
 no hope, and without God in the world:

EPH 2:13  But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh
 by the blood of Christ.

EPH 2:14  For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the
 middle wall of partition between us;

EPH 2:15  Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of
 commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new
 man, so making peace;

EPH 2:16  And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross,
 having slain the enmity thereby:

EPH 2:17  And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them
 that were nigh.

EPH 2:18  For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.

EPH 2:19  Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
 fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;

EPH 2:20  And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus
 Christ himself being the chief corner stone;

EPH 2:21  In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy
 temple in the Lord:

EPH 2:22  In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through
 the Spirit.

EPH 3:1  For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,

EPH 3:2  If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is
 given me to you-ward:

EPH 3:3  How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote
 afore in few words,

EPH 3:4  Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery
 of Christ)

EPH 3:5  Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is
 now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;

EPH 3:6  That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and
 partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:

EPH 3:7  Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of
 God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.

EPH 3:8  Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace
 given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of
 Christ;

EPH 3:9  And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which
 from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things
 by Jesus Christ:

EPH 3:10  To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly
 places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,

EPH 3:11  According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus
 our Lord:

EPH 3:12  In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of
 him.

EPH 3:13  Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you,
 which is your glory.

EPH 3:14  For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus
 Christ,

EPH 3:15  Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,

EPH 3:16  That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be
 strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;

EPH 3:17  That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted
 and grounded in love,

EPH 3:18  May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and
 length, and depth, and height;

EPH 3:19  And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye
 might be filled with all the fulness of God.

EPH 3:20  Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that
 we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,

EPH 3:21  Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages,
 world without end. Amen.

EPH 4:1  I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy
 of the vocation wherewith ye are called,

EPH 4:2  With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one
 another in love;

EPH 4:3  Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

EPH 4:4  There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope
 of your calling;

EPH 4:5  One Lord, one faith, one baptism,

EPH 4:6  One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in
 you all.

EPH 4:7  But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure
 of the gift of Christ.

EPH 4:8  Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity
 captive, and gave gifts unto men.

EPH 4:9  (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first
 into the lower parts of the earth?

EPH 4:10  He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all
 heavens, that he might fill all things.)

EPH 4:11  And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,
 evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;

EPH 4:12  For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for
 the edifying of the body of Christ:

EPH 4:13  Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge
 of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the
 fulness of Christ:

EPH 4:14  That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and
 carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning
 craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;

EPH 4:15  But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things,
 which is the head, even Christ:

EPH 4:16  From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that
 which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the
 measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of
 itself in love.

EPH 4:17  This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth
 walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,

EPH 4:18  Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of
 God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their
 heart:

EPH 4:19  Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto
 lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.

EPH 4:20  But ye have not so learned Christ;

EPH 4:21  If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the
 truth is in Jesus:

EPH 4:22  That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which
 is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;

EPH 4:23  And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;

EPH 4:24  And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in
 righteousness and true holiness.

EPH 4:25  Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his
 neighbour: for we are members one of another.

EPH 4:26  Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:

EPH 4:27  Neither give place to the devil.

EPH 4:28  Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working
 with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that
 needeth.

EPH 4:29  Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that
 which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the
 hearers.

EPH 4:30  And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the
 day of redemption.

EPH 4:31  Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil
 speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:

EPH 4:32  And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another,
 even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.

EPH 5:1  Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;

EPH 5:2  And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself
 for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.

EPH 5:3  But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be
 once named among you, as becometh saints;

EPH 5:4  Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not
 convenient: but rather giving of thanks.

EPH 5:5  For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor
 covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of
 Christ and of God.

EPH 5:6  Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things
 cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.

EPH 5:7  Be not ye therefore partakers with them.

EPH 5:8  For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk
 as children of light:

EPH 5:9  (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and
 truth;)

EPH 5:10  Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

EPH 5:11  And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but
 rather reprove them.

EPH 5:12  For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done
 of them in secret.

EPH 5:13  But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for
 whatsoever doth make manifest is light.

EPH 5:14  Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the
 dead, and Christ shall give thee light.

EPH 5:15  See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,

EPH 5:16  Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

EPH 5:17  Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the
 Lord is.

EPH 5:18  And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the
 Spirit;

EPH 5:19  Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
 singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;

EPH 5:20  Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the
 name of our Lord Jesus Christ;

EPH 5:21  Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.

EPH 5:22  Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.

EPH 5:23  For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head
 of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.

EPH 5:24  Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be
 to their own husbands in every thing.

EPH 5:25  Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and
 gave himself for it;

EPH 5:26  That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by
 the word,

EPH 5:27  That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having
 spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without
 blemish.

EPH 5:28  So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth
 his wife loveth himself.

EPH 5:29  For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and
 cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:

EPH 5:30  For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.

EPH 5:31  For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be
 joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.

EPH 5:32  This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the
 church.

EPH 5:33  Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even
 as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.

EPH 6:1  Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.

EPH 6:2  Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with
 promise;

EPH 6:3  That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.

EPH 6:4  And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up
 in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.

EPH 6:5  Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the
 flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;

EPH 6:6  Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ,
 doing the will of God from the heart;

EPH 6:7  With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:

EPH 6:8  Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he
 receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.

EPH 6:9  And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening:
 knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of
 persons with him.

EPH 6:10  Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his
 might.

EPH 6:11  Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against
 the wiles of the devil.

EPH 6:12  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
 principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this
 world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

EPH 6:13  Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able
 to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.

EPH 6:14  Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having
 on the breastplate of righteousness;

EPH 6:15  And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;

EPH 6:16  Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to
 quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.

EPH 6:17  And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which
 is the word of God:

EPH 6:18  Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and
 watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;

EPH 6:19  And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my
 mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,

EPH 6:20  For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak
 boldly, as I ought to speak.

EPH 6:21  But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a
 beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you
 all things:

EPH 6:22  Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know
 our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.

EPH 6:23  Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father
 and the Lord Jesus Christ.

EPH 6:24  Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.
 Amen.

GAL 1:1  Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus
 Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)

GAL 1:2  And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:

GAL 1:3  Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus
 Christ,

GAL 1:4  Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this
 present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:

GAL 1:5  To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

GAL 1:6  I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the
 grace of Christ unto another gospel:

GAL 1:7  Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would
 pervert the gospel of Christ.

GAL 1:8  But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto
 you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.

GAL 1:9  As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other
 gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.

GAL 1:10  For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if
 I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.

GAL 1:11  But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me
 is not after man.

GAL 1:12  For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the
 revelation of Jesus Christ.

GAL 1:13  For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews'
 religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted
 it:

GAL 1:14  And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own
 nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.

GAL 1:15  But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and
 called me by his grace,

GAL 1:16  To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen;
 immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:

GAL 1:17  Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me;
 but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.

GAL 1:18  Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode
 with him fifteen days.

GAL 1:19  But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.

GAL 1:20  Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.

GAL 1:21  Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;

GAL 1:22  And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in
 Christ:

GAL 1:23  But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past
 now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.

GAL 1:24  And they glorified God in me.

GAL 2:1  Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with
 Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.

GAL 2:2  And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel
 which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of
 reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.

GAL 2:3  But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be
 circumcised:

GAL 2:4  And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in
 privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might
 bring us into bondage:

GAL 2:5  To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the
 truth of the gospel might continue with you.

GAL 2:6  But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it
 maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed
 to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:

GAL 2:7  But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision
 was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;

GAL 2:8  (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the
 circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)

GAL 2:9  And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived
 the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right
 hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the
 circumcision.

GAL 2:10  Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I
 also was forward to do.

GAL 2:11  But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face,
 because he was to be blamed.

GAL 2:12  For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the
 Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing
 them which were of the circumcision.

GAL 2:13  And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that
 Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.

GAL 2:14  But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth
 of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew,
 livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest
 thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?

GAL 2:15  We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,

GAL 2:16  Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by
 the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we
 might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law:
 for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.

GAL 2:17  But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also
 are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.

GAL 2:18  For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a
 transgressor.

GAL 2:19  For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.

GAL 2:20  I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not I, but Christ
 liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith
 of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.

GAL 2:21  I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the
 law, then Christ is dead in vain.

GAL 3:1  O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey
 the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth,
 crucified among you?

GAL 3:2  This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works
 of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

GAL 3:3  Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect
 by the flesh?

GAL 3:4  Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.

GAL 3:5  He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles
 among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?

GAL 3:6  Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for
 righteousness.

GAL 3:7  Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the
 children of Abraham.

GAL 3:8  And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen
 through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall
 all nations be blessed.

GAL 3:9  So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.

GAL 3:10  For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for
 it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which
 are written in the book of the law to do them.

GAL 3:11  But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is
 evident: for, The just shall live by faith.

GAL 3:12  And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live
 in them.

GAL 3:13  Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse
 for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:

GAL 3:14  That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus
 Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

GAL 3:15  Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's
 covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.

GAL 3:16  Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And
 to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.

GAL 3:17  And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God
 in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot
 disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.

GAL 3:18  For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but
 God gave it to Abraham by promise.

GAL 3:19  Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of
 transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and
 it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.

GAL 3:20  Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.

GAL 3:21  Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there
 had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should
 have been by the law.

GAL 3:22  But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by
 faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.

GAL 3:23  But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the
 faith which should afterwards be revealed.

GAL 3:24  Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that
 we might be justified by faith.

GAL 3:25  But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.

GAL 3:26  For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.

GAL 3:27  For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on
 Christ.

GAL 3:28  There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there
 is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.

GAL 3:29  And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs
 according to the promise.

GAL 4:1  Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing
 from a servant, though he be lord of all;

GAL 4:2  But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the
 father.

GAL 4:3  Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements
 of the world:

GAL 4:4  But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son,
 made of a woman, made under the law,

GAL 4:5  To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the
 adoption of sons.

GAL 4:6  And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son
 into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

GAL 4:7  Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an
 heir of God through Christ.

GAL 4:8  Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by
 nature are no gods.

GAL 4:9  But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how
 turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to
 be in bondage?

GAL 4:10  Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.

GAL 4:11  I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.

GAL 4:12  Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not
 injured me at all.

GAL 4:13  Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto
 you at the first.

GAL 4:14  And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor
 rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.

GAL 4:15  Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record,
 that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and
 have given them to me.

GAL 4:16  Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?

GAL 4:17  They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you,
 that ye might affect them.

GAL 4:18  But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and
 not only when I am present with you.

GAL 4:19  My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be
 formed in you,

GAL 4:20  I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I
 stand in doubt of you.

GAL 4:21  Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?

GAL 4:22  For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a
 bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.

GAL 4:23  But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he
 of the freewoman was by promise.

GAL 4:24  Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the
 one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.

GAL 4:25  For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem
 which now is, and is in bondage with her children.

GAL 4:26  But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.

GAL 4:27  For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth
 and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children
 than she which hath an husband.

GAL 4:28  Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.

GAL 4:29  But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was
 born after the Spirit, even so it is now.

GAL 4:30  Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her
 son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the
 freewoman.

GAL 4:31  So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the
 free.

GAL 5:1  Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us
 free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.

GAL 5:2  Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall
 profit you nothing.

GAL 5:3  For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a
 debtor to do the whole law.

GAL 5:4  Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified
 by the law; ye are fallen from grace.

GAL 5:5  For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.

GAL 5:6  For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
 uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.

GAL 5:7  Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?

GAL 5:8  This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.

GAL 5:9  A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.

GAL 5:10  I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none
 otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment,
 whosoever he be.

GAL 5:11  And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer
 persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.

GAL 5:12  I would they were even cut off which trouble you.

GAL 5:13  For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty
 for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.

GAL 5:14  For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt
 love thy neighbour as thyself.

GAL 5:15  But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not
 consumed one of another.

GAL 5:16  This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust
 of the flesh.

GAL 5:17  For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the
 flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the
 things that ye would.

GAL 5:18  But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.

GAL 5:19  Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery,
 fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,

GAL 5:20  Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife,
 seditions, heresies,

GAL 5:21  Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the
 which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they
 which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.

GAL 5:22  But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
 gentleness, goodness, faith,

GAL 5:23  Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.

GAL 5:24  And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the
 affections and lusts.

GAL 5:25  If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.

GAL 5:26  Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying
 one another.

GAL 6:1  Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual,
 restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou
 also be tempted.

GAL 6:2  Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.

GAL 6:3  For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he
 deceiveth himself.

GAL 6:4  But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing
 in himself alone, and not in another.

GAL 6:5  For every man shall bear his own burden.

GAL 6:6  Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth
 in all good things.

GAL 6:7  Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that
 shall he also reap.

GAL 6:8  For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption;
 but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.

GAL 6:9  And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall
 reap, if we faint not.

GAL 6:10  As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men,
 especially unto them who are of the household of faith.

GAL 6:11  Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.

GAL 6:12  As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain
 you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross
 of Christ.

GAL 6:13  For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but
 desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.

GAL 6:14  But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord
 Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.

GAL 6:15  For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
 uncircumcision, but a new creature.

GAL 6:16  And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and
 mercy, and upon the Israel of God.

GAL 6:17  From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the
 marks of the Lord Jesus.

GAL 6:18  Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
 Amen.

HEB 1:1  God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto
 the fathers by the prophets,

HEB 1:2  Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath
 appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;

HEB 1:3  Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his
 person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by
 himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:

HEB 1:4  Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance
 obtained a more excellent name than they.

HEB 1:5  For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son,
 this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he
 shall be to me a Son?

HEB 1:6  And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he
 saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.

HEB 1:7  And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his
 ministers a flame of fire.

HEB 1:8  But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a
 sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.

HEB 1:9  Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even
 thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.

HEB 1:10  And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the
 earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:

HEB 1:11  They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as
 doth a garment;

HEB 1:12  And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed:
 but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.

HEB 1:13  But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand,
 until I make thine enemies thy footstool?

HEB 1:14  Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them
 who shall be heirs of salvation?

HEB 2:1  Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which
 we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.

HEB 2:2  For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression
 and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;

HEB 2:3  How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the
 first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that
 heard him;

HEB 2:4  God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with
 divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?

HEB 2:5  For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come,
 whereof we speak.

HEB 2:6  But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou
 art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him?

HEB 2:7  Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him
 with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:

HEB 2:8  Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he
 put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him.
 But now we see not yet all things put under him.

HEB 2:9  But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the
 suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of
 God should taste death for every man.

HEB 2:10  For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all
 things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their
 salvation perfect through sufferings.

HEB 2:11  For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of
 one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,

HEB 2:12  Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the
 church will I sing praise unto thee.

HEB 2:13  And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the
 children which God hath given me.

HEB 2:14  Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he
 also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might
 destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;

HEB 2:15  And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime
 subject to bondage.

HEB 2:16  For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on
 him the seed of Abraham.

HEB 2:17  Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his
 brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things
 pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.

HEB 2:18  For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to
 succour them that are tempted.

HEB 3:1  Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider
 the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;

HEB 3:2  Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful
 in all his house.

HEB 3:3  For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as
 he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.

HEB 3:4  For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things
 is God.

HEB 3:5  And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a
 testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;

HEB 3:6  But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold
 fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.

HEB 3:7  Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,

HEB 3:8  Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of
 temptation in the wilderness:

HEB 3:9  When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.

HEB 3:10  Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway
 err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.

HEB 3:11  So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)

HEB 3:12  Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of
 unbelief, in departing from the living God.

HEB 3:13  But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of
 you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.

HEB 3:14  For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our
 confidence stedfast unto the end;

HEB 3:15  While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your
 hearts, as in the provocation.

HEB 3:16  For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came
 out of Egypt by Moses.

HEB 3:17  But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that
 had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?

HEB 3:18  And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but
 to them that believed not?

HEB 3:19  So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.

HEB 4:1  Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into
 his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.

HEB 4:2  For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the
 word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that
 heard it.

HEB 4:3  For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have
 sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were
 finished from the foundation of the world.

HEB 4:4  For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And
 God did rest the seventh day from all his works.

HEB 4:5  And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.

HEB 4:6  Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they
 to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:

HEB 4:7  Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so
 long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your
 hearts.

HEB 4:8  For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have
 spoken of another day.

HEB 4:9  There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.

HEB 4:10  For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his
 own works, as God did from his.

HEB 4:11  Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall
 after the same example of unbelief.

HEB 4:12  For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any
 twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and
 of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents
 of the heart.

HEB 4:13  Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but
 all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.

HEB 4:14  Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the
 heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.

HEB 4:15  For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the
 feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet
 without sin.

HEB 4:16  Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may
 obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.

HEB 5:1  For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in
 things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for
 sins:

HEB 5:2  Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out
 of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.

HEB 5:3  And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself,
 to offer for sins.

HEB 5:4  And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of
 God, as was Aaron.

HEB 5:5  So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he
 that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.

HEB 5:6  As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after
 the order of Melchisedec.

HEB 5:7  Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and
 supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him
 from death, and was heard in that he feared;

HEB 5:8  Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he
 suffered;

HEB 5:9  And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto
 all them that obey him;

HEB 5:10  Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.

HEB 5:11  Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye
 are dull of hearing.

HEB 5:12  For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one
 teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are
 become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.

HEB 5:13  For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of
 righteousness: for he is a babe.

HEB 5:14  But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those
 who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and
 evil.

HEB 6:1  Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go
 on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead
 works, and of faith toward God,

HEB 6:2  Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of
 resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.

HEB 6:3  And this will we do, if God permit.

HEB 6:4  For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have
 tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,

HEB 6:5  And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to
 come,

HEB 6:6  If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing
 they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open
 shame.

HEB 6:7  For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and
 bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing
 from God:

HEB 6:8  But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto
 cursing; whose end is to be burned.

HEB 6:9  But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that
 accompany salvation, though we thus speak.

HEB 6:10  For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love,
 which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the
 saints, and do minister.

HEB 6:11  And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the
 full assurance of hope unto the end:

HEB 6:12  That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and
 patience inherit the promises.

HEB 6:13  For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no
 greater, he sware by himself,

HEB 6:14  Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will
 multiply thee.

HEB 6:15  And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.

HEB 6:16  For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is
 to them an end of all strife.

HEB 6:17  Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of
 promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:

HEB 6:18  That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to
 lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold
 upon the hope set before us:

HEB 6:19  Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and
 stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;

HEB 6:20  Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high
 priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.

HEB 7:1  For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who
 met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;

HEB 7:2  To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by
 interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem,
 which is, King of peace;

HEB 7:3  Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither
 beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God;
 abideth a priest continually.

HEB 7:4  Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch
 Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.

HEB 7:5  And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office
 of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according
 to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of
 Abraham:

HEB 7:6  But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of
 Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.

HEB 7:7  And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.

HEB 7:8  And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of
 whom it is witnessed that he liveth.

HEB 7:9  And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in
 Abraham.

HEB 7:10  For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.

HEB 7:11  If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under
 it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another
 priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after
 the order of Aaron?

HEB 7:12  For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change
 also of the law.

HEB 7:13  For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe,
 of which no man gave attendance at the altar.

HEB 7:14  For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe
 Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.

HEB 7:15  And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of
 Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,

HEB 7:16  Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the
 power of an endless life.

HEB 7:17  For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
 Melchisedec.

HEB 7:18  For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before
 for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.

HEB 7:19  For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better
 hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.

HEB 7:20  And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:

HEB 7:21  (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath
 by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a
 priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)

HEB 7:22  By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.

HEB 7:23  And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to
 continue by reason of death:

HEB 7:24  But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable
 priesthood.

HEB 7:25  Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come
 unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.

HEB 7:26  For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled,
 separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;

HEB 7:27  Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice,
 first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when
 he offered up himself.

HEB 7:28  For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the
 word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated
 for evermore.

HEB 8:1  Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such
 an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty
 in the heavens;

HEB 8:2  A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the
 Lord pitched, and not man.

HEB 8:3  For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices:
 wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.

HEB 8:4  For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there
 are priests that offer gifts according to the law:

HEB 8:5  Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was
 admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith
 he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the
 mount.

HEB 8:6  But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also
 he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better
 promises.

HEB 8:7  For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place
 have been sought for the second.

HEB 8:8  For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith
 the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with
 the house of Judah:

HEB 8:9  Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the
 day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt;
 because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the
 Lord.

HEB 8:10  For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel
 after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and
 write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to
 me a people:

HEB 8:11  And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his
 brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the
 greatest.

HEB 8:12  For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and
 their iniquities will I remember no more.

HEB 8:13  In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now
 that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.

HEB 9:1  Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine
 service, and a worldly sanctuary.

HEB 9:2  For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the
 candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.

HEB 9:3  And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest
 of all;

HEB 9:4  Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid
 round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's
 rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;

HEB 9:5  And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which
 we cannot now speak particularly.

HEB 9:6  Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into
 the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.

HEB 9:7  But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not
 without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the
 people:

HEB 9:8  The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all
 was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:

HEB 9:9  Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered
 both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service
 perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;

HEB 9:10  Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal
 ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.

HEB 9:11  But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a
 greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not
 of this building;

HEB 9:12  Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he
 entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for
 us.

HEB 9:13  For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer
 sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:

HEB 9:14  How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal
 Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead
 works to serve the living God?

HEB 9:15  And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by
 means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the
 first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal
 inheritance.

HEB 9:16  For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death
 of the testator.

HEB 9:17  For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no
 strength at all while the testator liveth.

HEB 9:18  Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.

HEB 9:19  For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according
 to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet
 wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,

HEB 9:20  Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined
 unto you.

HEB 9:21  Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the
 vessels of the ministry.

HEB 9:22  And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without
 shedding of blood is no remission.

HEB 9:23  It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens
 should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better
 sacrifices than these.

HEB 9:24  For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which
 are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the
 presence of God for us:

HEB 9:25  Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest
 entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;

HEB 9:26  For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the
 world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin
 by the sacrifice of himself.

HEB 9:27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the
 judgment:

HEB 9:28  So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them
 that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.

HEB 10:1  For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very
 image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year
 by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.

HEB 10:2  For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the
 worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.

HEB 10:3  But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins
 every year.

HEB 10:4  For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should
 take away sins.

HEB 10:5  Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and
 offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:

HEB 10:6  In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.

HEB 10:7  Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of
 me,) to do thy will, O God.

HEB 10:8  Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and
 offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are
 offered by the law;

HEB 10:9  Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the
 first, that he may establish the second.

HEB 10:10  By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body
 of Jesus Christ once for all.

HEB 10:11  And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes
 the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:

HEB 10:12  But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever,
 sat down on the right hand of God;

HEB 10:13  From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.

HEB 10:14  For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
 sanctified.

HEB 10:15  Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he
 had said before,

HEB 10:16  This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days,
 saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will
 I write them;

HEB 10:17  And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.

HEB 10:18  Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.

HEB 10:19  Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by
 the blood of Jesus,

HEB 10:20  By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through
 the veil, that is to say, his flesh;

HEB 10:21  And having an high priest over the house of God;

HEB 10:22  Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith,
 having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed
 with pure water.

HEB 10:23  Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for
 he is faithful that promised;)

HEB 10:24  And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good
 works:

HEB 10:25  Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of
 some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day
 approaching.

HEB 10:26  For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge
 of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,

HEB 10:27  But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation,
 which shall devour the adversaries.

HEB 10:28  He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three
 witnesses:

HEB 10:29  Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought
 worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the
 blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath
 done despite unto the Spirit of grace?

HEB 10:30  For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will
 recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.

HEB 10:31  It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

HEB 10:32  But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were
 illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;

HEB 10:33  Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and
 afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so
 used.

HEB 10:34  For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the
 spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better
 and an enduring substance.

HEB 10:35  Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence
 of reward.

HEB 10:36  For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of
 God, ye might receive the promise.

HEB 10:37  For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will
 not tarry.

HEB 10:38  Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul
 shall have no pleasure in him.

HEB 10:39  But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them
 that believe to the saving of the soul.

HEB 11:1  Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of
 things not seen.

HEB 11:2  For by it the elders obtained a good report.

HEB 11:3  Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word
 of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do
 appear.

HEB 11:4  By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain,
 by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his
 gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.

HEB 11:5  By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was
 not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had
 this testimony, that he pleased God.

HEB 11:6  But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh
 to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
 diligently seek him.

HEB 11:7  By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved
 with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he
 condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.

HEB 11:8  By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he
 should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing
 whither he went.

HEB 11:9  By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange
 country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him
 of the same promise:

HEB 11:10  For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and
 maker is God.

HEB 11:11  Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive
 seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged
 him faithful who had promised.

HEB 11:12  Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many
 as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea
 shore innumerable.

HEB 11:13  These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but
 having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and
 confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.

HEB 11:14  For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a
 country.

HEB 11:15  And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they
 came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.

HEB 11:16  But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly:
 wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for
 them a city.

HEB 11:17  By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that
 had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,

HEB 11:18  Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:

HEB 11:19  Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead;
 from whence also he received him in a figure.

HEB 11:20  By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.

HEB 11:21  By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of
 Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.

HEB 11:22  By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the
 children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.

HEB 11:23  By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his
 parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid
 of the king's commandment.

HEB 11:24  By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the
 son of Pharaoh's daughter;

HEB 11:25  Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to
 enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;

HEB 11:26  Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures
 in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.

HEB 11:27  By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he
 endured, as seeing him who is invisible.

HEB 11:28  Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood,
 lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.

HEB 11:29  By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the
 Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.

HEB 11:30  By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed
 about seven days.

HEB 11:31  By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not,
 when she had received the spies with peace.

HEB 11:32  And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of
 Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and
 Samuel, and of the prophets:

HEB 11:33  Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained
 promises, stopped the mouths of lions.

HEB 11:34  Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of
 weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the
 armies of the aliens.

HEB 11:35  Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were
 tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better
 resurrection:

HEB 11:36  And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover
 of bonds and imprisonment:

HEB 11:37  They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain
 with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being
 destitute, afflicted, tormented;

HEB 11:38  (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in
 mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.

HEB 11:39  And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received
 not the promise:

HEB 11:40  God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us
 should not be made perfect.

HEB 12:1  Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of
 witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily
 beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,

HEB 12:2  Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the
 joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is
 set down at the right hand of the throne of God.

HEB 12:3  For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against
 himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.

HEB 12:4  Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.

HEB 12:5  And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto
 children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when
 thou art rebuked of him:

HEB 12:6  For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom
 he receiveth.

HEB 12:7  If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what
 son is he whom the father chasteneth not?

HEB 12:8  But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then
 are ye bastards, and not sons.

HEB 12:9  Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and
 we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the
 Father of spirits, and live?

HEB 12:10  For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own
 pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.

HEB 12:11  Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but
 grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
 righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.

HEB 12:12  Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;

HEB 12:13  And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be
 turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.

HEB 12:14  Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall
 see the Lord:

HEB 12:15  Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any
 root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;

HEB 12:16  Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for
 one morsel of meat sold his birthright.

HEB 12:17  For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the
 blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he
 sought it carefully with tears.

HEB 12:18  For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that
 burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,

HEB 12:19  And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they
 that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:

HEB 12:20  (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much
 as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a
 dart:

HEB 12:21  And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear
 and quake:)

HEB 12:22  But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living
 God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,

HEB 12:23  To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are
 written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just
 men made perfect,

HEB 12:24  And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of
 sprinkling, that speaketh better things that that of Abel.

HEB 12:25  See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not
 who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we
 turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:

HEB 12:26  Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying,
 Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.

HEB 12:27  And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those
 things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which
 cannot be shaken may remain.

HEB 12:28  Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have
 grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:

HEB 12:29  For our God is a consuming fire.

HEB 13:1  Let brotherly love continue.

HEB 13:2  Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have
 entertained angels unawares.

HEB 13:3  Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which
 suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.

HEB 13:4  Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but
 whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.

HEB 13:5  Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with
 such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor
 forsake thee.

HEB 13:6  So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear
 what man shall do unto me.

HEB 13:7  Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you
 the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their
 conversation.

HEB 13:8  Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.

HEB 13:9  Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a
 good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which
 have not profited them that have been occupied therein.

HEB 13:10  We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the
 tabernacle.

HEB 13:11  For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the
 sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.

HEB 13:12  Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own
 blood, suffered without the gate.

HEB 13:13  Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his
 reproach.

HEB 13:14  For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.

HEB 13:15  By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
 continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.

HEB 13:16  But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such
 sacrifices God is well pleased.

HEB 13:17  Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for
 they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do
 it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.

HEB 13:18  Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things
 willing to live honestly.

HEB 13:19  But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to
 you the sooner.

HEB 13:20  Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord
 Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting
 covenant,

HEB 13:21  Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you
 that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be
 glory for ever and ever. Amen.

HEB 13:22  And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I
 have written a letter unto you in few words.

HEB 13:23  Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he
 come shortly, I will see you.

HEB 13:24  Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints.
 They of Italy salute you.

HEB 13:25  Grace be with you all. Amen.

JAM 1:1  James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve
 tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.

JAM 1:2  My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;

JAM 1:3  Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.

JAM 1:4  But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and
 entire, wanting nothing.

JAM 1:5  If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men
 liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.

JAM 1:6  But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is
 like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.

JAM 1:7  For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the
 Lord.

JAM 1:8  A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.

JAM 1:9  Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:

JAM 1:10  But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the
 grass he shall pass away.

JAM 1:11  For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth
 the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it
 perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.

JAM 1:12  Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he
 shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that
 love him.

JAM 1:13  Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God
 cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:

JAM 1:14  But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and
 enticed.

JAM 1:15  Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when
 it is finished, bringeth forth death.

JAM 1:16  Do not err, my beloved brethren.

JAM 1:17  Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down
 from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of
 turning.

JAM 1:18  Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be
 a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.

JAM 1:19  Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow
 to speak, slow to wrath:

JAM 1:20  For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.

JAM 1:21  Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of
 naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to
 save your souls.

JAM 1:22  But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own
 selves.

JAM 1:23  For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a
 man beholding his natural face in a glass:

JAM 1:24  For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway
 forgetteth what manner of man he was.

JAM 1:25  But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
 therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man
 shall be blessed in his deed.

JAM 1:26  If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his
 tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.

JAM 1:27  Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To
 visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself
 unspotted from the world.

JAM 2:1  My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of
 glory, with respect of persons.

JAM 2:2  For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly
 apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;

JAM 2:3  And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto
 him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or
 sit here under my footstool:

JAM 2:4  Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil
 thoughts?

JAM 2:5  Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this
 world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them
 that love him?

JAM 2:6  But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw
 you before the judgment seats?

JAM 2:7  Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?

JAM 2:8  If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love
 thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:

JAM 2:9  But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced
 of the law as transgressors.

JAM 2:10  For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point,
 he is guilty of all.

JAM 2:11  For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now
 if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor
 of the law.

JAM 2:12  So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of
 liberty.

JAM 2:13  For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy;
 and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.

JAM 2:14  What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and
 have not works? can faith save him?

JAM 2:15  If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,

JAM 2:16  And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and
 filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful
 to the body; what doth it profit?

JAM 2:17  Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.

JAM 2:18  Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy
 faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.

JAM 2:19  Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils
 also believe, and tremble.

JAM 2:20  But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?

JAM 2:21  Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered
 Isaac his son upon the altar?

JAM 2:22  Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith
 made perfect?

JAM 2:23  And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed
 God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the
 Friend of God.

JAM 2:24  Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith
 only.

JAM 2:25  Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she
 had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?

JAM 2:26  For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is
 dead also.

JAM 3:1  My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the
 greater condemnation.

JAM 3:2  For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the
 same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.

JAM 3:3  Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and
 we turn about their whole body.

JAM 3:4  Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven
 of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm,
 whithersoever the governor listeth.

JAM 3:5  Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things.
 Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!

JAM 3:6  And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among
 our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course
 of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.

JAM 3:7  For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things
 in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:

JAM 3:8  But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly
 poison.

JAM 3:9  Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men,
 which are made after the similitude of God.

JAM 3:10  Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My
 brethren, these things ought not so to be.

JAM 3:11  Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?

JAM 3:12  Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine,
 figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.

JAM 3:13  Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew
 out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.

JAM 3:14  But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory
 not, and lie not against the truth.

JAM 3:15  This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual,
 devilish.

JAM 3:16  For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil
 work.

JAM 3:17  But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable,
 gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without
 partiality, and without hypocrisy.

JAM 3:18  And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make
 peace.

JAM 4:1  From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence,
 even of your lusts that war in your members?

JAM 4:2  Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain:
 ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.

JAM 4:3  Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it
 upon your lusts.

JAM 4:4  Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the
 world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world
 is the enemy of God.

JAM 4:5  Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth
 in us lusteth to envy?

JAM 4:6  But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud,
 but giveth grace unto the humble.

JAM 4:7  Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee
 from you.

JAM 4:8  Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye
 sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.

JAM 4:9  Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to
 mourning, and your joy to heaviness.

JAM 4:10  Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.

JAM 4:11  Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his
 brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the
 law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.

JAM 4:12  There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art
 thou that judgest another?

JAM 4:13  Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a
 city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:

JAM 4:14  Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your
 life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then
 vanisheth away.

JAM 4:15  For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do
 this, or that.

JAM 4:16  But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.

JAM 4:17  Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it
 is sin.

JAM 5:1  Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall
 come upon you.

JAM 5:2  Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.

JAM 5:3  Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a
 witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped
 treasure together for the last days.

JAM 5:4  Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields,
 which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have
 reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.

JAM 5:5  Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have
 nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.

JAM 5:6  Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.

JAM 5:7  Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.
 Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath
 long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.

JAM 5:8  Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord
 draweth nigh.

JAM 5:9  Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned:
 behold, the judge standeth before the door.

JAM 5:10  Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the
 Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.

JAM 5:11  Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the
 patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very
 pitiful, and of tender mercy.

JAM 5:12  But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven,
 neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and
 your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.

JAM 5:13  Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing
 psalms.

JAM 5:14  Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and
 let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:

JAM 5:15  And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise
 him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.

JAM 5:16  Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye
 may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

JAM 5:17  Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed
 earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space
 of three years and six months.

JAM 5:18  And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought
 forth her fruit.

JAM 5:19  Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;

JAM 5:20  Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of
 his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.

JO1 1:1  That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have
 seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled,
 of the Word of life;

JO1 1:2  (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear
 witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and
 was manifested unto us;)

JO1 1:3  That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also
 may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and
 with his Son Jesus Christ.

JO1 1:4  And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.

JO1 1:5  This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto
 you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.

JO1 1:6  If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we
 lie, and do not the truth:

JO1 1:7  But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship
 one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all
 sin.

JO1 1:8  If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is
 not in us.

JO1 1:9  If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
 sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

JO1 1:10  If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word
 is not in us.

JO1 2:1  My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not.
 And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
 righteous:

JO1 2:2  And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but
 also for the sins of the whole world.

JO1 2:3  And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.

JO1 2:4  He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a
 liar, and the truth is not in him.

JO1 2:5  But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God
 perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.

JO1 2:6  He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as
 he walked.

JO1 2:7  Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment
 which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye
 have heard from the beginning.

JO1 2:8  Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him
 and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.

JO1 2:9  He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in
 darkness even until now.

JO1 2:10  He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none
 occasion of stumbling in him.

JO1 2:11  But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in
 darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath
 blinded his eyes.

JO1 2:12  I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you
 for his name's sake.

JO1 2:13  I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the
 beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked
 one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.

JO1 2:14  I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is
 from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are
 strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked
 one.

JO1 2:15  Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any
 man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.

JO1 2:16  For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust
 of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the
 world.

JO1 2:17  And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth
 the will of God abideth for ever.

JO1 2:18  Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that
 antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know
 that it is the last time.

JO1 2:19  They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been
 of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that
 they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.

JO1 2:20  But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.

JO1 2:21  I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but
 because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.

JO1 2:22  Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is
 antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.

JO1 2:23  Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that
 acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.

JO1 2:24  Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the
 beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in
 you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.

JO1 2:25  And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.

JO1 2:26  These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.

JO1 2:27  But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and
 ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of
 all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye
 shall abide in him.

JO1 2:28  And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear,
 we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.

JO1 2:29  If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth
 righteousness is born of him.

JO1 3:1  Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we
 should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because
 it knew him not.

JO1 3:2  Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what
 we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him;
 for we shall see him as he is.

JO1 3:3  And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he
 is pure.

JO1 3:4  Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the
 transgression of the law.

JO1 3:5  And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him
 is no sin.

JO1 3:6  Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen
 him, neither known him.

JO1 3:7  Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness
 is righteous, even as he is righteous.

JO1 3:8  He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the
 beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might
 destroy the works of the devil.

JO1 3:9  Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth
 in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.

JO1 3:10  In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the
 devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that
 loveth not his brother.

JO1 3:11  For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we
 should love one another.

JO1 3:12  Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And
 wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's
 righteous.

JO1 3:13  Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.

JO1 3:14  We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the
 brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.

JO1 3:15  Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no
 murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.

JO1 3:16  Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for
 us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.

JO1 3:17  But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have
 need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the
 love of God in him?

JO1 3:18  My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but
 in deed and in truth.

JO1 3:19  And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our
 hearts before him.

JO1 3:20  For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and
 knoweth all things.

JO1 3:21  Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward
 God.

JO1 3:22  And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his
 commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.

JO1 3:23  And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of
 his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.

JO1 3:24  And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him.
 And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given
 us.

JO1 4:1  Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they
 are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.

JO1 4:2  Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that
 Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:

JO1 4:3  And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the
 flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have
 heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.

JO1 4:4  Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because
 greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.

JO1 4:5  They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the
 world heareth them.

JO1 4:6  We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God
 heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.

JO1 4:7  Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one
 that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.

JO1 4:8  He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.

JO1 4:9  In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God
 sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.

JO1 4:10  Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent
 his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

JO1 4:11  Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.

JO1 4:12  No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God
 dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.

JO1 4:13  Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath
 given us of his Spirit.

JO1 4:14  And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be
 the Saviour of the world.

JO1 4:15  Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in
 him, and he in God.

JO1 4:16  And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is
 love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.

JO1 4:17  Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day
 of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.

JO1 4:18  There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because
 fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.

JO1 4:19  We love him, because he first loved us.

JO1 4:20  If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for
 he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he
 hath not seen?

JO1 4:21  And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love
 his brother also.

JO1 5:1  Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every
 one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.

JO1 5:2  By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love
 God, and keep his commandments.

JO1 5:3  For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his
 commandments are not grievous.

JO1 5:4  For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the
 victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.

JO1 5:5  Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus
 is the Son of God?

JO1 5:6  This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by
 water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth
 witness, because the Spirit is truth.

JO1 5:7  For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the
 Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.

JO1 5:8  And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the
 water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.

JO1 5:9  If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for
 this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.

JO1 5:10  He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he
 that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the
 record that God gave of his Son.

JO1 5:11  And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and
 this life is in his Son.

JO1 5:12  He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God
 hath not life.

JO1 5:13  These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the
 Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may
 believe on the name of the Son of God.

JO1 5:14  And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any
 thing according to his will, he heareth us:

JO1 5:15  And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we
 have the petitions that we desired of him.

JO1 5:16  If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he
 shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There
 is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.

JO1 5:17  All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.

JO1 5:18  We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is
 begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.

JO1 5:19  And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in
 wickedness.

JO1 5:20  And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an
 understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is
 true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.

JO1 5:21  Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.

JO2 1:1  The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the
 truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;

JO2 1:2  For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for
 ever.

JO2 1:3  Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the
 Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.

JO2 1:4  I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as
 we have received a commandment from the Father.

JO2 1:5  And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment
 unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one
 another.

JO2 1:6  And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the
 commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.

JO2 1:7  For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that
 Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.

JO2 1:8  Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have
 wrought, but that we receive a full reward.

JO2 1:9  Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ,
 hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the
 Father and the Son.

JO2 1:10  If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him
 not into your house, neither bid him God speed:

JO2 1:11  For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.

JO2 1:12  Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper
 and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy
 may be full.

JO2 1:13  The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.

JO3 1:1  The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.

JO3 1:2  Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in
 health, even as thy soul prospereth.

JO3 1:3  For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the
 truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.

JO3 1:4  I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.

JO3 1:5  Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the
 brethren, and to strangers;

JO3 1:6  Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if
 thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:

JO3 1:7  Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing
 of the Gentiles.

JO3 1:8  We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers
 to the truth.

JO3 1:9  I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the
 preeminence among them, receiveth us not.

JO3 1:10  Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth,
 prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither
 doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and
 casteth them out of the church.

JO3 1:11  Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He
 that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.

JO3 1:12  Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself:
 yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.

JO3 1:13  I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write
 unto thee:

JO3 1:14  But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to

JUD 1:1  Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that
 are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:

JUD 1:2  Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.

JUD 1:3  Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common
 salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye
 should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the
 saints.

JUD 1:4  For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old
 ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into
 lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.

JUD 1:5  I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how
 that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward
 destroyed them that believed not.

JUD 1:6  And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own
 habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the
 judgment of the great day.

JUD 1:7  Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner,
 giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set
 forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.

JUD 1:8  Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise
 dominion, and speak evil of dignities.

JUD 1:9  Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed
 about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation,
 but said, The Lord rebuke thee.

JUD 1:10  But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what
 they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt
 themselves.

JUD 1:11  Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran
 greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying
 of Core.

JUD 1:12  These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you,
 feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about
 of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up
 by the roots;

JUD 1:13  Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering
 stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.

JUD 1:14  And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying,
 Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,

JUD 1:15  To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly
 among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and
 of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.

JUD 1:16  These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and
 their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration
 because of advantage.

JUD 1:17  But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the
 apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;

JUD 1:18  How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who
 should walk after their own ungodly lusts.

JUD 1:19  These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the
 Spirit.

JUD 1:20  But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith,
 praying in the Holy Ghost,

JUD 1:21  Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord
 Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

JUD 1:22  And of some have compassion, making a difference:

JUD 1:23  And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even
 the garment spotted by the flesh.

JUD 1:24  Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present
 you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,

JUD 1:25  To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and
 power, both now and ever. Amen.

PE1 1:1  Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered
 throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,

PE1 1:2  Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through
 sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of
 Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.

PE1 1:3  Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
 according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by
 the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,

PE1 1:4  To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not
 away, reserved in heaven for you,

PE1 1:5  Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to
 be revealed in the last time.

PE1 1:6  Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye
 are in heaviness through manifold temptations:

PE1 1:7  That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold
 that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and
 honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:

PE1 1:8  Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet
 believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:

PE1 1:9  Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.

PE1 1:10  Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched
 diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you:

PE1 1:11  Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was
 in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of
 Christ, and the glory that should follow.

PE1 1:12  Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they
 did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have
 preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which
 things the angels desire to look into.

PE1 1:13  Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the
 end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus
 Christ;

PE1 1:14  As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the
 former lusts in your ignorance:

PE1 1:15  But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner
 of conversation;

PE1 1:16  Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.

PE1 1:17  And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth
 according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:

PE1 1:18  Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible
 things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition
 from your fathers;

PE1 1:19  But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish
 and without spot:

PE1 1:20  Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but
 was manifest in these last times for you,

PE1 1:21  Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and
 gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.

PE1 1:22  Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the
 Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with
 a pure heart fervently:

PE1 1:23  Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by
 the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.

PE1 1:24  For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of
 grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:

PE1 1:25  But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word
 which by the gospel is preached unto you.

PE1 2:1  Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and
 envies, all evil speakings,

PE1 2:2  As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may
 grow thereby:

PE1 2:3  If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.

PE1 2:4  To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but
 chosen of God, and precious,

PE1 2:5  Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy
 priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus
 Christ.

PE1 2:6  Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion
 a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not
 be confounded.

PE1 2:7  Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which
 be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the
 head of the corner,

PE1 2:8  And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which
 stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.

PE1 2:9  But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a
 peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called
 you out of darkness into his marvellous light;

PE1 2:10  Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God:
 which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.

PE1 2:11  Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from
 fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;

PE1 2:12  Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas
 they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they
 shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.

PE1 2:13  Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake:
 whether it be to the king, as supreme;

PE1 2:14  Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the
 punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.

PE1 2:15  For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence
 the ignorance of foolish men:

PE1 2:16  As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but
 as the servants of God.

PE1 2:17  Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.

PE1 2:18  Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the
 good and gentle, but also to the froward.

PE1 2:19  For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure
 grief, suffering wrongfully.

PE1 2:20  For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye
 shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take
 it patiently, this is acceptable with God.

PE1 2:21  For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for
 us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:

PE1 2:22  Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:

PE1 2:23  Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he
 threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:

PE1 2:24  Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we,
 being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were
 healed.

PE1 2:25  For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the
 Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

PE1 3:1  Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if
 any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the
 conversation of the wives;

PE1 3:2  While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.

PE1 3:3  Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the
 hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;

PE1 3:4  But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not
 corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the
 sight of God of great price.

PE1 3:5  For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted
 in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:

PE1 3:6  Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are,
 as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.

PE1 3:7  Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving
 honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together
 of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.

PE1 3:8  Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love
 as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:

PE1 3:9  Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise
 blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a
 blessing.

PE1 3:10  For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his
 tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:

PE1 3:11  Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.

PE1 3:12  For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are
 open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do
 evil.

PE1 3:13  And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is
 good?

PE1 3:14  But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye: and be
 not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;

PE1 3:15  But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give
 an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you
 with meekness and fear:

PE1 3:16  Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of
 evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in
 Christ.

PE1 3:17  For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well
 doing, than for evil doing.

PE1 3:18  For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust,
 that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened
 by the Spirit:

PE1 3:19  By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;

PE1 3:20  Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God
 waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that
 is, eight souls were saved by water.

PE1 3:21  The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the
 putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience
 toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:

PE1 3:22  Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and
 authorities and powers being made subject unto him.

PE1 4:1  Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm
 yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the
 flesh hath ceased from sin;

PE1 4:2  That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the
 lusts of men, but to the will of God.

PE1 4:3  For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will
 of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine,
 revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:

PE1 4:4  Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same
 excess of riot, speaking evil of you:

PE1 4:5  Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the
 dead.

PE1 4:6  For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead,
 that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according
 to God in the spirit.

PE1 4:7  But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch
 unto prayer.

PE1 4:8  And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for
 charity shall cover the multitude of sins.

PE1 4:9  Use hospitality one to another without grudging.

PE1 4:10  As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to
 another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

PE1 4:11  If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man
 minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all
 things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion
 for ever and ever. Amen.

PE1 4:12  Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to
 try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:

PE1 4:13  But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings;
 that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding
 joy.

PE1 4:14  If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the
 spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken
 of, but on your part he is glorified.

PE1 4:15  But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an
 evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.

PE1 4:16  Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let
 him glorify God on this behalf.

PE1 4:17  For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God:
 and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the
 gospel of God?

PE1 4:18  And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and
 the sinner appear?

PE1 4:19  Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit
 the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.

PE1 5:1  The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a
 witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that
 shall be revealed:

PE1 5:2  Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight
 thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a
 ready mind;

PE1 5:3  Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the
 flock.

PE1 5:4  And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of
 glory that fadeth not away.

PE1 5:5  Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of
 you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God
 resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.

PE1 5:6  Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may
 exalt you in due time:

PE1 5:7  Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.

PE1 5:8  Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring
 lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:

PE1 5:9  Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions
 are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.

PE1 5:10  But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory
 by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect,
 stablish, strengthen, settle you.

PE1 5:11  To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

PE1 5:12  By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have
 written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God
 wherein ye stand.

PE1 5:13  The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth
 you; and so doth Marcus my son.

PE1 5:14  Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all
 that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.

PE2 1:1  Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that
 have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God
 and our Saviour Jesus Christ:

PE2 1:2  Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of
 God, and of Jesus our Lord,

PE2 1:3  According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that
 pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath
 called us to glory and virtue:

PE2 1:4  Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that
 by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the
 corruption that is in the world through lust.

PE2 1:5  And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and
 to virtue knowledge;

PE2 1:6  And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to
 patience godliness;

PE2 1:7  And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness
 charity.

PE2 1:8  For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall
 neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

PE2 1:9  But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar
 off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.

PE2 1:10  Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling
 and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:

PE2 1:11  For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the
 everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

PE2 1:12  Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance
 of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present
 truth.

PE2 1:13  Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you
 up by putting you in remembrance;

PE2 1:14  Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our
 Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.

PE2 1:15  Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to
 have these things always in remembrance.

PE2 1:16  For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known
 unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses
 of his majesty.

PE2 1:17  For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came
 such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom
 I am well pleased.

PE2 1:18  And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him
 in the holy mount.

PE2 1:19  We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that
 ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day
 dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:

PE2 1:20  Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any
 private interpretation.

PE2 1:21  For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy
 men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

PE2 2:1  But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there
 shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable
 heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves
 swift destruction.

PE2 2:2  And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way
 of truth shall be evil spoken of.

PE2 2:3  And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make
 merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and
 their damnation slumbereth not.

PE2 2:4  For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to
 hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto
 judgment;

PE2 2:5  And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a
 preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the
 ungodly;

PE2 2:6  And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them
 with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live
 ungodly;

PE2 2:7  And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the
 wicked:

PE2 2:8  (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing,
 vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)

PE2 2:9  The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to
 reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:

PE2 2:10  But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of
 uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they
 are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.

PE2 2:11  Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not
 railing accusation against them before the Lord.

PE2 2:12  But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed,
 speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish
 in their own corruption;

PE2 2:13  And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count
 it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting
 themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;

PE2 2:14  Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin;
 beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous
 practices; cursed children:

PE2 2:15  Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the
 way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;

PE2 2:16  But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's
 voice forbad the madness of the prophet.

PE2 2:17  These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a
 tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.

PE2 2:18  For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure
 through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were
 clean escaped from them who live in error.

PE2 2:19  While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of
 corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in
 bondage.

PE2 2:20  For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through
 the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled
 therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.

PE2 2:21  For it had been better for them not to have known the way of
 righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy
 commandment delivered unto them.

PE2 2:22  But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog
 is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her
 wallowing in the mire.

PE2 3:1  This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I
 stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:

PE2 3:2  That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the
 holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and
 Saviour:

PE2 3:3  Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers,
 walking after their own lusts,

PE2 3:4  And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers
 fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the
 creation.

PE2 3:5  For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the
 heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the
 water:

PE2 3:6  Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water,
 perished:

PE2 3:7  But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are
 kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition
 of ungodly men.

PE2 3:8  But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with
 the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.

PE2 3:9  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count
 slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should
 perish, but that all should come to repentance.

PE2 3:10  But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the
 which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall
 melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall
 be burned up.

PE2 3:11  Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of
 persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,

PE2 3:12  Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein
 the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt
 with fervent heat?

PE2 3:13  Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a
 new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.

PE2 3:14  Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent
 that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.

PE2 3:15  And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as
 our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath
 written unto you;

PE2 3:16  As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in
 which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned
 and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own
 destruction.

PE2 3:17  Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware
 lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own
 stedfastness.

PE2 3:18  But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
 Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.

PHI 1:1  Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in
 Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:

PHI 1:2  Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord
 Jesus Christ.

PHI 1:3  I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,

PHI 1:4  Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,

PHI 1:5  For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;

PHI 1:6  Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good
 work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:

PHI 1:7  Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you
 in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and
 confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.

PHI 1:8  For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels
 of Jesus Christ.

PHI 1:9  And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in
 knowledge and in all judgment;

PHI 1:10  That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere
 and without offence till the day of Christ.

PHI 1:11  Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus
 Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.

PHI 1:12  But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which
 happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;

PHI 1:13  So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all
 other places;

PHI 1:14  And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds,
 are much more bold to speak the word without fear.

PHI 1:15  Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of
 good will:

PHI 1:16  The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add
 affliction to my bonds:

PHI 1:17  But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the
 gospel.

PHI 1:18  What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in
 truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.

PHI 1:19  For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your
 prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

PHI 1:20  According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I
 shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ
 shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.

PHI 1:21  For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

PHI 1:22  But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what
 I shall choose I wot not.

PHI 1:23  For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to
 be with Christ; which is far better:

PHI 1:24  Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.

PHI 1:25  And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue
 with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;

PHI 1:26  That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my
 coming to you again.

PHI 1:27  Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ:
 that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your
 affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together
 for the faith of the gospel;

PHI 1:28  And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an
 evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.

PHI 1:29  For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe
 on him, but also to suffer for his sake;

PHI 1:30  Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in
 me.

PHI 2:1  If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of
 love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,

PHI 2:2  Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being
 of one accord, of one mind.

PHI 2:3  Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of
 mind let each esteem other better than themselves.

PHI 2:4  Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things
 of others.

PHI 2:5  Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:

PHI 2:6  Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with
 God:

PHI 2:7  But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a
 servant, and was made in the likeness of men:

PHI 2:8  And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became
 obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

PHI 2:9  Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which
 is above every name:

PHI 2:10  That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in
 heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;

PHI 2:11  And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
 to the glory of God the Father.

PHI 2:12  Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my
 presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation
 with fear and trembling.

PHI 2:13  For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good
 pleasure.

PHI 2:14  Do all things without murmurings and disputings:

PHI 2:15  That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without
 rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as
 lights in the world;

PHI 2:16  Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of
 Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.

PHI 2:17  Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your
 faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.

PHI 2:18  For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.

PHI 2:19  But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you,
 that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.

PHI 2:20  For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.

PHI 2:21  For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.

PHI 2:22  But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath
 served with me in the gospel.

PHI 2:23  Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it
 will go with me.

PHI 2:24  But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.

PHI 2:25  Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my
 brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and
 he that ministered to my wants.

PHI 2:26  For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that
 ye had heard that he had been sick.

PHI 2:27  For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and
 not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.

PHI 2:28  I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again,
 ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.

PHI 2:29  Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in
 reputation:

PHI 2:30  Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding
 his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.

PHI 3:1  Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to
 you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.

PHI 3:2  Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.

PHI 3:3  For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and
 rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.

PHI 3:4  Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man
 thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:

PHI 3:5  Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of
 Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;

PHI 3:6  Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness
 which is in the law, blameless.

PHI 3:7  But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.

PHI 3:8  Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency
 of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss
 of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,

PHI 3:9  And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is
 of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness
 which is of God by faith:

PHI 3:10  That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the
 fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;

PHI 3:11  If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.

PHI 3:12  Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect:
 but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am
 apprehended of Christ Jesus.

PHI 3:13  Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing
 I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those
 things which are before,

PHI 3:14  I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in
 Christ Jesus.

PHI 3:15  Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in
 any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.

PHI 3:16  Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the
 same rule, let us mind the same thing.

PHI 3:17  Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as
 ye have us for an ensample.

PHI 3:18  (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even
 weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:

PHI 3:19  Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory
 is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)

PHI 3:20  For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the
 Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:

PHI 3:21  Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto
 his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue
 all things unto himself.

PHI 4:1  Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and
 crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.

PHI 4:2  I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind
 in the Lord.

PHI 4:3  And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which
 laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my
 fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.

PHI 4:4  Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.

PHI 4:5  Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.

PHI 4:6  Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication
 with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.

PHI 4:7  And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your
 hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

PHI 4:8  Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are
 honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever
 things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any
 virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.

PHI 4:9  Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and
 seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.

PHI 4:10  But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of
 me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked
 opportunity.

PHI 4:11  Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in
 whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.

PHI 4:12  I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where
 and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to
 abound and to suffer need.

PHI 4:13  I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.

PHI 4:14  Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my
 affliction.

PHI 4:15  Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel,
 when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning
 giving and receiving, but ye only.

PHI 4:16  For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.

PHI 4:17  Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to
 your account.

PHI 4:18  But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of
 Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell,
 a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.

PHI 4:19  But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in
 glory by Christ Jesus.

PHI 4:20  Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

PHI 4:21  Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me
 greet you.

PHI 4:22  All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's
 household.

PHI 4:23  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

PHM 1:1  Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto
 Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,

PHM 1:2  And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the
 church in thy house:

PHM 1:3  Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
 Christ.

PHM 1:4  I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,

PHM 1:5  Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord
 Jesus, and toward all saints;

PHM 1:6  That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the
 acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.

PHM 1:7  For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels
 of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.

PHM 1:8  Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that
 which is convenient,

PHM 1:9  Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul
 the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

PHM 1:10  I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:

PHM 1:11  Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable
 to thee and to me:

PHM 1:12  Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own
 bowels:

PHM 1:13  Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have
 ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:

PHM 1:14  But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not
 be as it were of necessity, but willingly.

PHM 1:15  For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest
 receive him for ever;

PHM 1:16  Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved,
 specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the
 Lord?

PHM 1:17  If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.

PHM 1:18  If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine
 account;

PHM 1:19  I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I
 do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.

PHM 1:20  Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels
 in the Lord.

PHM 1:21  Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that
 thou wilt also do more than I say.

PHM 1:22  But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your
 prayers I shall be given unto you.

PHM 1:23  There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;

PHM 1:24  Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.

PHM 1:25  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

REV 1:1  The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto
 his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and
 signified it by his angel unto his servant John:

REV 1:2  Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus
 Christ, and of all things that he saw.

REV 1:3  Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this
 prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at
 hand.

REV 1:4  John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and
 peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the
 seven Spirits which are before his throne;

REV 1:5  And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first
 begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that
 loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,

REV 1:6  And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be
 glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

REV 1:7  Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they
 also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of
 him. Even so, Amen.

REV 1:8  I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord,
 which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.

REV 1:9  I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and
 in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called
 Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.

REV 1:10  I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great
 voice, as of a trumpet,

REV 1:11  Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou
 seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in
 Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto
 Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.

REV 1:12  And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I
 saw seven golden candlesticks;

REV 1:13  And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of
 man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a
 golden girdle.

REV 1:14  His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and
 his eyes were as a flame of fire;

REV 1:15  And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace;
 and his voice as the sound of many waters.

REV 1:16  And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a
 sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his
 strength.

REV 1:17  And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right
 hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:

REV 1:18  I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for
 evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.

REV 1:19  Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and
 the things which shall be hereafter;

REV 1:20  The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right
 hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels
 of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the
 seven churches.

REV 2:1  Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he
 that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst
 of the seven golden candlesticks;

REV 2:2  I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst
 not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are
 apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:

REV 2:3  And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast
 laboured, and hast not fainted.

REV 2:4  Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy
 first love.

REV 2:5  Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the
 first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy
 candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.

REV 2:6  But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes,
 which I also hate.

REV 2:7  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
 churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life,
 which is in the midst of the paradise of God.

REV 2:8  And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith
 the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;

REV 2:9  I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich)
 and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but
 are the synagogue of Satan.

REV 2:10  Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil
 shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have
 tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a
 crown of life.

REV 2:11  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
 churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.

REV 2:12  And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith
 he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;

REV 2:13  I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat
 is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in
 those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you,
 where Satan dwelleth.

REV 2:14  But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them
 that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock
 before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to
 commit fornication.

REV 2:15  So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes,
 which thing I hate.

REV 2:16  Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against
 them with the sword of my mouth.

REV 2:17  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
 churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and
 will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no
 man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.

REV 2:18  And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things
 saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his
 feet are like fine brass;

REV 2:19  I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy
 patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.

REV 2:20  Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou
 sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach
 and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed
 unto idols.

REV 2:21  And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented
 not.

REV 2:22  Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery
 with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.

REV 2:23  And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall
 know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto
 every one of you according to your works.

REV 2:24  But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have
 not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they
 speak; I will put upon you none other burden.

REV 2:25  But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.

REV 2:26  And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him
 will I give power over the nations:

REV 2:27  And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter
 shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.

REV 2:28  And I will give him the morning star.

REV 2:29  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
 churches.

REV 3:1  And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith
 he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works,
 that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.

REV 3:2  Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to
 die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.

REV 3:3  Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold
 fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a
 thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.

REV 3:4  Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their
 garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.

REV 3:5  He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I
 will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his
 name before my Father, and before his angels.

REV 3:6  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
 churches.

REV 3:7  And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things
 saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he
 that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;

REV 3:8  I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no
 man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and
 hast not denied my name.

REV 3:9  Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are
 Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship
 before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.

REV 3:10  Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee
 from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them
 that dwell upon the earth.

REV 3:11  Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man
 take thy crown.

REV 3:12  Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and
 he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and
 the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out
 of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name.

REV 3:13  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
 churches.

REV 3:14  And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These
 things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the
 creation of God;

REV 3:15  I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou
 wert cold or hot.

REV 3:16  So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will
 spue thee out of my mouth.

REV 3:17  Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have
 need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and
 poor, and blind, and naked:

REV 3:18  I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest
 be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame
 of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that
 thou mayest see.

REV 3:19  As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and
 repent.

REV 3:20  Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and
 open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.

REV 3:21  To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even
 as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.

REV 3:22  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
 churches.

REV 4:1  After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the
 first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which
 said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.

REV 4:2  And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in
 heaven, and one sat on the throne.

REV 4:3  And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone:
 and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an
 emerald.

REV 4:4  And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the
 seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and
 they had on their heads crowns of gold.

REV 4:5  And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices:
 and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the
 seven Spirits of God.

REV 4:6  And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and
 in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full
 of eyes before and behind.

REV 4:7  And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a
 calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like
 a flying eagle.

REV 4:8  And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they
 were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy,
 holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.

REV 4:9  And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat
 on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,

REV 4:10  The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the
 throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns
 before the throne, saying,

REV 4:11  Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for
 thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.

REV 5:1  And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book
 written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.

REV 5:2  And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy
 to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?

REV 5:3  And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able
 to open the book, neither to look thereon.

REV 5:4  And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read
 the book, neither to look thereon.

REV 5:5  And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the
 tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to
 loose the seven seals thereof.

REV 5:6  And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four
 beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain,
 having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent
 forth into all the earth.

REV 5:7  And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat
 upon the throne.

REV 5:8  And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty
 elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden
 vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.

REV 5:9  And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the
 book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed
 us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and
 nation;

REV 5:10  And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign
 on the earth.

REV 5:11  And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the
 throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand
 times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;

REV 5:12  Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to
 receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and
 glory, and blessing.

REV 5:13  And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under
 the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I
 saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth
 upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.

REV 5:14  And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell
 down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.

REV 6:1  And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it
 were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.

REV 6:2  And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow;
 and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.

REV 6:3  And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say,
 Come and see.

REV 6:4  And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to
 him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill
 one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.

REV 6:5  And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say,
 Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had
 a pair of balances in his hand.

REV 6:6  And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of
 wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou
 hurt not the oil and the wine.

REV 6:7  And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the
 fourth beast say, Come and see.

REV 6:8  And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him
 was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the
 fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with
 death, and with the beasts of the earth.

REV 6:9  And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls
 of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they
 held:

REV 6:10  And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and
 true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the
 earth?

REV 6:11  And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said
 unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their
 fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were,
 should be fulfilled.

REV 6:12  And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a
 great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon
 became as blood;

REV 6:13  And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree
 casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.

REV 6:14  And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and
 every mountain and island were moved out of their places.

REV 6:15  And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and
 the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free
 man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;

REV 6:16  And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the
 face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:

REV 6:17  For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to
 stand?

REV 7:1  And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners
 of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not
 blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.

REV 7:2  And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal
 of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom
 it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,

REV 7:3  Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we
 have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.

REV 7:4  And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were
 sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the
 children of Israel.

REV 7:5  Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
 Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve
 thousand.

REV 7:6  Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
 Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed
 twelve thousand.

REV 7:7  Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
 Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve
 thousand.

REV 7:8  Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
 Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed
 twelve thousand.

REV 7:9  After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could
 number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before
 the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their
 hands;

REV 7:10  And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which
 sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.

REV 7:11  And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the elders
 and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and
 worshipped God,

REV 7:12  Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and
 honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.

REV 7:13  And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which
 are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?

REV 7:14  And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are
 they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and
 made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

REV 7:15  Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and
 night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among
 them.

REV 7:16  They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the
 sun light on them, nor any heat.

REV 7:17  For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and
 shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all
 tears from their eyes.

REV 8:1  And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven
 about the space of half an hour.

REV 8:2  And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were
 given seven trumpets.

REV 8:3  And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer;
 and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the
 prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.

REV 8:4  And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the
 saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.

REV 8:5  And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the
 altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings,
 and lightnings, and an earthquake.

REV 8:6  And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves
 to sound.

REV 8:7  The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with
 blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was
 burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.

REV 8:8  And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning
 with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood;

REV 8:9  And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had
 life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.

REV 8:10  And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven,
 burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and
 upon the fountains of waters;

REV 8:11  And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part
 of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they
 were made bitter.

REV 8:12  And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was
 smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so
 as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third
 part of it, and the night likewise.

REV 8:13  And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven,
 saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by
 reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet
 to sound!

REV 9:1  And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto
 the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.

REV 9:2  And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the
 pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened
 by reason of the smoke of the pit.

REV 9:3  And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them
 was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.

REV 9:4  And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the
 earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which
 have not the seal of God in their foreheads.

REV 9:5  And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they
 should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a
 scorpion, when he striketh a man.

REV 9:6  And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and
 shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.

REV 9:7  And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto
 battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces
 were as the faces of men.

REV 9:8  And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the
 teeth of lions.

REV 9:9  And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the
 sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to
 battle.

REV 9:10  And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings
 in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.

REV 9:11  And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless
 pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath
 his name Apollyon.

REV 9:12  One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter.

REV 9:13  And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns
 of the golden altar which is before God,

REV 9:14  Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four
 angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.

REV 9:15  And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and
 a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.

REV 9:16  And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand
 thousand: and I heard the number of them.

REV 9:17  And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them,
 having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads
 of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire
 and smoke and brimstone.

REV 9:18  By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by
 the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.

REV 9:19  For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their
 tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.

REV 9:20  And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet
 repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship
 devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood:
 which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:

REV 9:21  Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor
 of their fornication, nor of their thefts.

REV 10:1  And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a
 cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the
 sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:

REV 10:2  And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot
 upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,

REV 10:3  And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had
 cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.

REV 10:4  And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to
 write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things
 which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.

REV 10:5  And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth
 lifted up his hand to heaven,

REV 10:6  And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created
 heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that
 therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should
 be time no longer:

REV 10:7  But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall
 begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to
 his servants the prophets.

REV 10:8  And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and
 said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel
 which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.

REV 10:9  And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little
 book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy
 belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.

REV 10:10  And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up;
 and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my
 belly was bitter.

REV 10:11  And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples,
 and nations, and tongues, and kings.

REV 11:1  And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood,
 saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that
 worship therein.

REV 11:2  But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it
 not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread
 under foot forty and two months.

REV 11:3  And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy
 a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.

REV 11:4  These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing
 before the God of the earth.

REV 11:5  And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their
 mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in
 this manner be killed.

REV 11:6  These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days
 of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to
 smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.

REV 11:7  And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that
 ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall
 overcome them, and kill them.

REV 11:8  And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city,
 which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was
 crucified.

REV 11:9  And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see
 their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead
 bodies to be put in graves.

REV 11:10  And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make
 merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets
 tormented them that dwelt on the earth.

REV 11:11  And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God entered
 into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them
 which saw them.

REV 11:12  And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up
 hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld
 them.

REV 11:13  And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part
 of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and
 the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.

REV 11:14  The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly.

REV 11:15  And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in
 heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our
 Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.

REV 11:16  And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats,
 fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,

REV 11:17  Saying, We give thee thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which art, and
 wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and
 hast reigned.

REV 11:18  And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time
 of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward
 unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy
 name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.

REV 11:19  And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in
 his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices,
 and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.

REV 12:1  And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the
 sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:

REV 12:2  And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be
 delivered.

REV 12:3  And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red
 dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.

REV 12:4  And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast
 them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to
 be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.

REV 12:5  And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a
 rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.

REV 12:6  And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place
 prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and
 threescore days.

REV 12:7  And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against
 the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,

REV 12:8  And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.

REV 12:9  And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the
 Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the
 earth, and his angels were cast out with him.

REV 12:10  And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come
 salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his
 Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them
 before our God day and night.

REV 12:11  And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word
 of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.

REV 12:12  Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the
 inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you,
 having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.

REV 12:13  And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he
 persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.

REV 12:14  And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she
 might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a
 time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.

REV 12:15  And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the
 woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.

REV 12:16  And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and
 swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.

REV 12:17  And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with
 the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the
 testimony of Jesus Christ.

REV 13:1  And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out
 of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns,
 and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.

REV 13:2  And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were
 as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon
 gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.

REV 13:3  And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his
 deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.

REV 13:4  And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and
 they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to
 make war with him?

REV 13:5  And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and
 blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.

REV 13:6  And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his
 name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.

REV 13:7  And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to
 overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and
 nations.

REV 13:8  And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are
 not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the
 world.

REV 13:9  If any man have an ear, let him hear.

REV 13:10  He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that
 killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience
 and the faith of the saints.

REV 13:11  And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had
 two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.

REV 13:12  And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and
 causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast,
 whose deadly wound was healed.

REV 13:13  And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from
 heaven on the earth in the sight of men,

REV 13:14  And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those
 miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them
 that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which
 had the wound by a sword, and did live.

REV 13:15  And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the
 image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not
 worship the image of the beast should be killed.

REV 13:16  And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and
 bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:

REV 13:17  And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the
 name of the beast, or the number of his name.

REV 13:18  Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number
 of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred
 threescore and six.

REV 14:1  And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him
 an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their
 foreheads.

REV 14:2  And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as
 the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with
 their harps:

REV 14:3  And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the
 four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred
 and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.

REV 14:4  These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are
 virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These
 were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.

REV 14:5  And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault
 before the throne of God.

REV 14:6  And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the
 everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every
 nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,

REV 14:7  Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the
 hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and
 earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.

REV 14:8  And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is
 fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine
 of the wrath of her fornication.

REV 14:9  And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any
 man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or
 in his hand,

REV 14:10  The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is
 poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be
 tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and
 in the presence of the Lamb:

REV 14:11  And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and
 they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and
 whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

REV 14:12  Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the
 commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

REV 14:13  And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are
 the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that
 they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.

REV 14:14  And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat
 like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand
 a sharp sickle.

REV 14:15  And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice
 to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is
 come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.

REV 14:16  And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and
 the earth was reaped.

REV 14:17  And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also
 having a sharp sickle.

REV 14:18  And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over
 fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying,
 Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth;
 for her grapes are fully ripe.

REV 14:19  And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the
 vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.

REV 14:20  And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out
 of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and
 six hundred furlongs.

REV 15:1  And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels
 having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.

REV 15:2  And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that
 had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his
 mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the
 harps of God.

REV 15:3  And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song
 of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty;
 just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.

REV 15:4  Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only
 art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy
 judgments are made manifest.

REV 15:5  And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle
 of the testimony in heaven was opened:

REV 15:6  And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven
 plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded
 with golden girdles.

REV 15:7  And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden
 vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.

REV 15:8  And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from
 his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven
 plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.

REV 16:1  And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven
 angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the
 earth.

REV 16:2  And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there
 fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the
 beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.

REV 16:3  And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became
 as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.

REV 16:4  And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains
 of waters; and they became blood.

REV 16:5  And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord,
 which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.

REV 16:6  For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast
 given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.

REV 16:7  And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty,
 true and righteous are thy judgments.

REV 16:8  And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was
 given unto him to scorch men with fire.

REV 16:9  And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of
 God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him
 glory.

REV 16:10  And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast;
 and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,

REV 16:11  And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their
 sores, and repented not of their deeds.

REV 16:12  And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river
 Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings
 of the east might be prepared.

REV 16:13  And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth
 of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the
 false prophet.

REV 16:14  For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth
 unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the
 battle of that great day of God Almighty.

REV 16:15  Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth
 his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.

REV 16:16  And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew
 tongue Armageddon.

REV 16:17  And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there
 came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It
 is done.

REV 16:18  And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a
 great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an
 earthquake, and so great.

REV 16:19  And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities
 of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to
 give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.

REV 16:20  And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.

REV 16:21  And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone
 about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague
 of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.

REV 17:1  And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and
 talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the
 judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:

REV 17:2  With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the
 inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her
 fornication.

REV 17:3  So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a
 woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having
 seven heads and ten horns.

REV 17:4  And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked
 with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand
 full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:

REV 17:5  And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT,
 THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.

REV 17:6  And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with
 the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great
 admiration.

REV 17:7  And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell
 thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath
 the seven heads and ten horns.

REV 17:8  The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out
 of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the
 earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the
 foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and
 yet is.

REV 17:9  And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven
 mountains, on which the woman sitteth.

REV 17:10  And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the
 other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.

REV 17:11  And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is
 of the seven, and goeth into perdition.

REV 17:12  And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have
 received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the
 beast.

REV 17:13  These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto
 the beast.

REV 17:14  These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome
 them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him
 are called, and chosen, and faithful.

REV 17:15  And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore
 sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.

REV 17:16  And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate
 the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her
 flesh, and burn her with fire.

REV 17:17  For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to
 agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be
 fulfilled.

REV 17:18  And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth
 over the kings of the earth.

REV 18:1  And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven,
 having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.

REV 18:2  And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great
 is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of
 every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.

REV 18:3  For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
 fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with
 her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of
 her delicacies.

REV 18:4  And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my
 people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her
 plagues.

REV 18:5  For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her
 iniquities.

REV 18:6  Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double
 according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.

REV 18:7  How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much
 torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and
 am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.

REV 18:8  Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and
 famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God
 who judgeth her.

REV 18:9  And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived
 deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall
 see the smoke of her burning,

REV 18:10  Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas
 that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment
 come.

REV 18:11  And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no
 man buyeth their merchandise any more:

REV 18:12  The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of
 pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine
 wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most
 precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,

REV 18:13  And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and
 wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses,
 and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.

REV 18:14  And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from
 thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and
 thou shalt find them no more at all.

REV 18:15  The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall
 stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,

REV 18:16  And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine
 linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious
 stones, and pearls!

REV 18:17  For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every
 shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade
 by sea, stood afar off,

REV 18:18  And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city
 is like unto this great city!

REV 18:19  And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing,
 saying, Alas, alas that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships
 in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.

REV 18:20  Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets;
 for God hath avenged you on her.

REV 18:21  And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast
 it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be
 thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.

REV 18:22  And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and
 trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of
 whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a
 millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;

REV 18:23  And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and
 the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all
 in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy
 sorceries were all nations deceived.

REV 18:24  And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of
 all that were slain upon the earth.

REV 19:1  And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in
 heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto
 the Lord our God:

REV 19:2  For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the
 great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath
 avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.

REV 19:3  And again they said, Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever and
 ever.

REV 19:4  And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and
 worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.

REV 19:5  And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye
 his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.

REV 19:6  And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the
 voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying,
 Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.

REV 19:7  Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage
 of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.

REV 19:8  And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen,
 clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.

REV 19:9  And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto
 the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true
 sayings of God.

REV 19:10  And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou
 do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the
 testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
 prophecy.

REV 19:11  And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat
 upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and
 make war.

REV 19:12  His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns;
 and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.

REV 19:13  And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is
 called The Word of God.

REV 19:14  And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses,
 clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

REV 19:15  And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should
 smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth
 the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.

REV 19:16  And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF
 KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.

REV 19:17  And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud
 voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and
 gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;

REV 19:18  That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and
 the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on
 them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.

REV 19:19  And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies,
 gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against
 his army.

REV 19:20  And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought
 miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark
 of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive
 into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.

REV 19:21  And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the
 horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled
 with their flesh.

REV 20:1  And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the
 bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.

REV 20:2  And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the
 Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,

REV 20:3  And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal
 upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years
 should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.

REV 20:4  And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given
 unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of
 Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast,
 neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or
 in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.

REV 20:5  But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years
 were finished. This is the first resurrection.

REV 20:6  Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on
 such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of
 Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.

REV 20:7  And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of
 his prison,

REV 20:8  And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four
 quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the
 number of whom is as the sand of the sea.

REV 20:9  And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp
 of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of
 heaven, and devoured them.

REV 20:10  And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and
 brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented
 day and night for ever and ever.

REV 20:11  And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose
 face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for
 them.

REV 20:12  And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books
 were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the
 dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books,
 according to their works.

REV 20:13  And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell
 delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man
 according to their works.

REV 20:14  And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the
 second death.

REV 20:15  And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast
 into the lake of fire.

REV 21:1  And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the
 first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.

REV 21:2  And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out
 of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.

REV 21:3  And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the
 tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be
 his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.

REV 21:4  And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be
 no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more
 pain: for the former things are passed away.

REV 21:5  And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.
 And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.

REV 21:6  And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning
 and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the
 water of life freely.

REV 21:7  He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his
 God, and he shall be my son.

REV 21:8  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers,
 and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have
 their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the
 second death.

REV 21:9  And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven
 vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come
 hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.

REV 21:10  And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high
 mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out
 of heaven from God,

REV 21:11  Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most
 precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;

REV 21:12  And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the
 gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the
 twelve tribes of the children of Israel:

REV 21:13  On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south
 three gates; and on the west three gates.

REV 21:14  And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the
 names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

REV 21:15  And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the
 city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.

REV 21:16  And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the
 breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs.
 The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.

REV 21:17  And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four
 cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.

REV 21:18  And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was
 pure gold, like unto clear glass.

REV 21:19  And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all
 manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second,
 sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;

REV 21:20  The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte;
 the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the
 eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.

REV 21:21  And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was of
 one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent
 glass.

REV 21:22  And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb
 are the temple of it.

REV 21:23  And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine
 in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light
 thereof.

REV 21:24  And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of
 it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.

REV 21:25  And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall
 be no night there.

REV 21:26  And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.

REV 21:27  And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth,
 neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are
 written in the Lamb's book of life.

REV 22:1  And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal,
 proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.

REV 22:2  In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river,
 was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded
 her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the
 nations.

REV 22:3  And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the
 Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:

REV 22:4  And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their
 foreheads.

REV 22:5  And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither
 light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign
 for ever and ever.

REV 22:6  And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the
 Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the
 things which must shortly be done.

REV 22:7  Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the
 prophecy of this book.

REV 22:8  And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and
 seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me
 these things.

REV 22:9  Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy
 fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the
 sayings of this book: worship God.

REV 22:10  And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this
 book: for the time is at hand.

REV 22:11  He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy,
 let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous
 still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.

REV 22:12  And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every
 man according as his work shall be.

REV 22:13  I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the
 last.

REV 22:14  Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right
 to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.

REV 22:15  For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and
 murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.

REV 22:16  I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the
 churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and
 morning star.

REV 22:17  And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth
 say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take
 the water of life freely.

REV 22:18  For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy
 of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him
 the plagues that are written in this book:

REV 22:19  And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this
 prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out
 of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.

REV 22:20  He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen.
 Even so, come, Lord Jesus.

REV 22:21  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

TH1 1:1  Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
 Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace
 be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

TH1 1:2  We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our
 prayers;

TH1 1:3  Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of
 love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and
 our Father;

TH1 1:4  Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.

TH1 1:5  For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and
 in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we
 were among you for your sake.

TH1 1:6  And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the
 word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.

TH1 1:7  So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.

TH1 1:8  For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia
 and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad;
 so that we need not to speak any thing.

TH1 1:9  For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto
 you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;

TH1 1:10  And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead,
 even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.

TH1 2:1  For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was
 not in vain:

TH1 2:2  But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully
 entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you
 the gospel of God with much contention.

TH1 2:3  For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in
 guile:

TH1 2:4  But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even
 so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.

TH1 2:5  For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a
 cloke of covetousness; God is witness:

TH1 2:6  Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we
 might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.

TH1 2:7  But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:

TH1 2:8  So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have
 imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls,
 because ye were dear unto us.

TH1 2:9  For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night
 and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto
 you the gospel of God.

TH1 2:10  Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably
 we behaved ourselves among you that believe:

TH1 2:11  As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of
 you, as a father doth his children,

TH1 2:12  That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his
 kingdom and glory.

TH1 2:13  For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye
 received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word
 of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh
 also in you that believe.

TH1 2:14  For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in
 Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own
 countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:

TH1 2:15  Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have
 persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:

TH1 2:16  Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to
 fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.

TH1 2:17  But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence,
 not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great
 desire.

TH1 2:18  Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again;
 but Satan hindered us.

TH1 2:19  For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye
 in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?

TH1 2:20  For ye are our glory and joy.

TH1 3:1  Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be
 left at Athens alone;

TH1 3:2  And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our
 fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you
 concerning your faith:

TH1 3:3  That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know
 that we are appointed thereunto.

TH1 3:4  For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should
 suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.

TH1 3:5  For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your
 faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in
 vain.

TH1 3:6  But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good
 tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us
 always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:

TH1 3:7  Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction
 and distress by your faith:

TH1 3:8  For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.

TH1 3:9  For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy
 wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;

TH1 3:10  Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and
 might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?

TH1 3:11  Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our
 way unto you.

TH1 3:12  And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward
 another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:

TH1 3:13  To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before
 God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his
 saints.

TH1 4:1  Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord
 Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God,
 so ye would abound more and more.

TH1 4:2  For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.

TH1 4:3  For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should
 abstain from fornication:

TH1 4:4  That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in
 sanctification and honour;

TH1 4:5  Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not
 God:

TH1 4:6  That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because
 that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and
 testified.

TH1 4:7  For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.

TH1 4:8  He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also
 given unto us his holy Spirit.

TH1 4:9  But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for
 ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.

TH1 4:10  And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all
 Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;

TH1 4:11  And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to
 work with your own hands, as we commanded you;

TH1 4:12  That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye
 may have lack of nothing.

TH1 4:13  But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them
 which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.

TH1 4:14  For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also
 which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.

TH1 4:15  For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are
 alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are
 asleep.

TH1 4:16  For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the
 voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ
 shall rise first:

TH1 4:17  Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with
 them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with
 the Lord.

TH1 4:18  Wherefore comfort one another with these words.

TH1 5:1  But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I
 write unto you.

TH1 5:2  For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a
 thief in the night.

TH1 5:3  For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction
 cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not
 escape.

TH1 5:4  But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake
 you as a thief.

TH1 5:5  Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are
 not of the night, nor of darkness.

TH1 5:6  Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be
 sober.

TH1 5:7  For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are
 drunken in the night.

TH1 5:8  But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate
 of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.

TH1 5:9  For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our
 Lord Jesus Christ,

TH1 5:10  Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live
 together with him.

TH1 5:11  Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as
 also ye do.

TH1 5:12  And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among
 you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;

TH1 5:13  And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be
 at peace among yourselves.

TH1 5:14  Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the
 feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.

TH1 5:15  See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that
 which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.

TH1 5:16  Rejoice evermore.

TH1 5:17  Pray without ceasing.

TH1 5:18  In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ
 Jesus concerning you.

TH1 5:19  Quench not the Spirit.

TH1 5:20  Despise not prophesyings.

TH1 5:21  Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.

TH1 5:22  Abstain from all appearance of evil.

TH1 5:23  And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your
 whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our
 Lord Jesus Christ.

TH1 5:24  Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.

TH1 5:25  Brethren, pray for us.

TH1 5:26  Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.

TH1 5:27  I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy
 brethren.

TH1 5:28  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

TH2 1:1  Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
 Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:

TH2 1:2  Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
 Christ.

TH2 1:3  We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet,
 because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of
 you all toward each other aboundeth;

TH2 1:4  So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your
 patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:

TH2 1:5  Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye
 may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:

TH2 1:6  Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation
 to them that trouble you;

TH2 1:7  And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be
 revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,

TH2 1:8  In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that
 obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:

TH2 1:9  Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence
 of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;

TH2 1:10  When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired
 in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in
 that day.

TH2 1:11  Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you
 worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and
 the work of faith with power:

TH2 1:12  That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and
 ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

TH2 2:1  Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus
 Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,

TH2 2:2  That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit,
 nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.

TH2 2:3  Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come,
 except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the
 son of perdition;

TH2 2:4  Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or
 that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing
 himself that he is God.

TH2 2:5  Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these
 things?

TH2 2:6  And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his
 time.

TH2 2:7  For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth
 will let, until he be taken out of the way.

TH2 2:8  And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume
 with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his
 coming:

TH2 2:9  Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power
 and signs and lying wonders,

TH2 2:10  And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish;
 because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.

TH2 2:11  And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they
 should believe a lie:

TH2 2:12  That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had
 pleasure in unrighteousness.

TH2 2:13  But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren
 beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to
 salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:

TH2 2:14  Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory
 of our Lord Jesus Christ.

TH2 2:15  Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye
 have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.

TH2 2:16  Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which
 hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope
 through grace,

TH2 2:17  Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.

TH2 3:1  Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have
 free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:

TH2 3:2  And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all
 men have not faith.

TH2 3:3  But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from
 evil.

TH2 3:4  And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and
 will do the things which we command you.

TH2 3:5  And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the
 patient waiting for Christ.

TH2 3:6  Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
 that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and
 not after the tradition which he received of us.

TH2 3:7  For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not
 ourselves disorderly among you;

TH2 3:8  Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with labour
 and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:

TH2 3:9  Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto
 you to follow us.

TH2 3:10  For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any
 would not work, neither should he eat.

TH2 3:11  For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly,
 working not at all, but are busybodies.

TH2 3:12  Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus
 Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.

TH2 3:13  But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.

TH2 3:14  And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and
 have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.

TH2 3:15  Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.

TH2 3:16  Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The
 Lord be with you all.

TH2 3:17  The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in
 every epistle: so I write.

TH2 3:18  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

TI1 1:1  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our
 Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;

TI1 1:2  Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from
 God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.

TI1 1:3  As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into
 Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,

TI1 1:4  Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister
 questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.

TI1 1:5  Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of
 a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:

TI1 1:6  From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;

TI1 1:7  Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they
 say, nor whereof they affirm.

TI1 1:8  But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;

TI1 1:9  Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for
 the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and
 profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,

TI1 1:10  For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for
 menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing
 that is contrary to sound doctrine;

TI1 1:11  According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was
 committed to my trust.

TI1 1:12  And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he
 counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;

TI1 1:13  Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I
 obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.

TI1 1:14  And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love
 which is in Christ Jesus.

TI1 1:15  This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ
 Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.

TI1 1:16  Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus
 Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should
 hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.

TI1 1:17  Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be
 honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

TI1 1:18  This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the
 prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good
 warfare;

TI1 1:19  Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away
 concerning faith have made shipwreck:

TI1 1:20  Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan,
 that they may learn not to blaspheme.

TI1 2:1  I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers,
 intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;

TI1 2:2  For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet
 and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.

TI1 2:3  For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;

TI1 2:4  Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge
 of the truth.

TI1 2:5  For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man
 Christ Jesus;

TI1 2:6  Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.

TI1 2:7  Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth
 in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.

TI1 2:8  I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands,
 without wrath and doubting.

TI1 2:9  In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel,
 with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls,
 or costly array;

TI1 2:10  But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.

TI1 2:11  Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.

TI1 2:12  But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the
 man, but to be in silence.

TI1 2:13  For Adam was first formed, then Eve.

TI1 2:14  And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the
 transgression.

TI1 2:15  Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue
 in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.

TI1 3:1  This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he
 desireth a good work.

TI1 3:2  A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant,
 sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;

TI1 3:3  Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but
 patient, not a brawler, not covetous;

TI1 3:4  One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection
 with all gravity;

TI1 3:5  (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take
 care of the church of God?)

TI1 3:6  Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the
 condemnation of the devil.

TI1 3:7  Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he
 fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.

TI1 3:8  Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to
 much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;

TI1 3:9  Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.

TI1 3:10  And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a
 deacon, being found blameless.

TI1 3:11  Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in
 all things.

TI1 3:12  Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children
 and their own houses well.

TI1 3:13  For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase
 to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in
 Christ Jesus.

TI1 3:14  These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:

TI1 3:15  But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to
 behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living
 God, the pillar and ground of the truth.

TI1 3:16  And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was
 manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto
 the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.

TI1 4:1  Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall
 depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of
 devils;

TI1 4:2  Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot
 iron;

TI1 4:3  Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God
 hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know
 the truth.

TI1 4:4  For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be
 received with thanksgiving:

TI1 4:5  For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.

TI1 4:6  If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be
 a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of
 good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.

TI1 4:7  But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather
 unto godliness.

TI1 4:8  For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto
 all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to
 come.

TI1 4:9  This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.

TI1 4:10  For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust
 in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that
 believe.

TI1 4:11  These things command and teach.

TI1 4:12  Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the
 believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in
 purity.

TI1 4:13  Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.

TI1 4:14  Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by
 prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.

TI1 4:15  Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy
 profiting may appear to all.

TI1 4:16  Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for
 in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.

TI1 5:1  Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men
 as brethren;

TI1 5:2  The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.

TI1 5:3  Honour widows that are widows indeed.

TI1 5:4  But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to
 shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and
 acceptable before God.

TI1 5:5  Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and
 continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.

TI1 5:6  But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.

TI1 5:7  And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.

TI1 5:8  But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own
 house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.

TI1 5:9  Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old,
 having been the wife of one man.

TI1 5:10  Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if
 she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have
 relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.

TI1 5:11  But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton
 against Christ, they will marry;

TI1 5:12  Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.

TI1 5:13  And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to
 house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things
 which they ought not.

TI1 5:14  I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide
 the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.

TI1 5:15  For some are already turned aside after Satan.

TI1 5:16  If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve
 them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are
 widows indeed.

TI1 5:17  Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour,
 especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.

TI1 5:18  For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth
 out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.

TI1 5:19  Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three
 witnesses.

TI1 5:20  Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.

TI1 5:21  I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect
 angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another,
 doing nothing by partiality.

TI1 5:22  Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's
 sins: keep thyself pure.

TI1 5:23  Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake
 and thine often infirmities.

TI1 5:24  Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and
 some men they follow after.

TI1 5:25  Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and
 they that are otherwise cannot be hid.

TI1 6:1  Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters
 worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not
 blasphemed.

TI1 6:2  And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them,
 because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are
 faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and
 exhort.

TI1 6:3  If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even
 the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to
 godliness;

TI1 6:4  He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes
 of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,

TI1 6:5  Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the
 truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.

TI1 6:6  But godliness with contentment is great gain.

TI1 6:7  For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry
 nothing out.

TI1 6:8  And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.

TI1 6:9  But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into
 many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.

TI1 6:10  For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some
 coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through
 with many sorrows.

TI1 6:11  But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after
 righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.

TI1 6:12  Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto
 thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many
 witnesses.

TI1 6:13  I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things,
 and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good
 confession;

TI1 6:14  That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the
 appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:

TI1 6:15  Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only
 Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;

TI1 6:16  Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can
 approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and
 power everlasting. Amen.

TI1 6:17  Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded,
 nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly
 all things to enjoy;

TI1 6:18  That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to
 distribute, willing to communicate;

TI1 6:19  Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time
 to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.

TI1 6:20  O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding
 profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:

TI1 6:21  Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with
 thee. Amen.

TI2 1:1  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the
 promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,

TI2 1:2  To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God
 the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

TI2 1:3  I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience,
 that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;

TI2 1:4  Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may
 be filled with joy;

TI2 1:5  When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which
 dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am
 persuaded that in thee also.

TI2 1:6  Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God,
 which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.

TI2 1:7  For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of
 love, and of a sound mind.

TI2 1:8  Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me
 his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according
 to the power of God;

TI2 1:9  Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according
 to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us
 in Christ Jesus before the world began,

TI2 1:10  But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus
 Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to
 light through the gospel:

TI2 1:11  Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher
 of the Gentiles.

TI2 1:12  For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not
 ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to
 keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.

TI2 1:13  Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in
 faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

TI2 1:14  That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost
 which dwelleth in us.

TI2 1:15  This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away
 from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.

TI2 1:16  The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft
 refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:

TI2 1:17  But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found
 me.

TI2 1:18  The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that
 day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest
 very well.

TI2 2:1  Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ
 Jesus.

TI2 2:2  And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the
 same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.

TI2 2:3  Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

TI2 2:4  No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life;
 that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.

TI2 2:5  And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except
 he strive lawfully.

TI2 2:6  The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.

TI2 2:7  Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all
 things.

TI2 2:8  Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the
 dead according to my gospel:

TI2 2:9  Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the
 word of God is not bound.

TI2 2:10  Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may
 also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

TI2 2:11  It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also
 live with him:

TI2 2:12  If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also
 will deny us:

TI2 2:13  If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.

TI2 2:14  Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the
 Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting
 of the hearers.

TI2 2:15  Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not
 to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.

TI2 2:16  But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more
 ungodliness.

TI2 2:17  And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and
 Philetus;

TI2 2:18  Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is
 past already; and overthrow the faith of some.

TI2 2:19  Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal,
 The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name
 of Christ depart from iniquity.

TI2 2:20  But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of
 silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to
 dishonour.

TI2 2:21  If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel
 unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto
 every good work.

TI2 2:22  Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity,
 peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

TI2 2:23  But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do
 gender strifes.

TI2 2:24  And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all
 men, apt to teach, patient,

TI2 2:25  In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God
 peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;

TI2 2:26  And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil,
 who are taken captive by him at his will.

TI2 3:1  This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.

TI2 3:2  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters,
 proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,

TI2 3:3  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent,
 fierce, despisers of those that are good,

TI2 3:4  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
 God;

TI2 3:5  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such
 turn away.

TI2 3:6  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive
 silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,

TI2 3:7  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

TI2 3:8  Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the
 truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.

TI2 3:9  But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest
 unto all men, as their's also was.

TI2 3:10  But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose,
 faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,

TI2 3:11  Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium,
 at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord
 delivered me.

TI2 3:12  Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
 persecution.

TI2 3:13  But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and
 being deceived.

TI2 3:14  But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been
 assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;

TI2 3:15  And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are
 able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

TI2 3:16  All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
 doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:

TI2 3:17  That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good
 works.

TI2 4:1  I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who
 shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;

TI2 4:2  Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke,
 exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.

TI2 4:3  For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but
 after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching
 ears;

TI2 4:4  And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be
 turned unto fables.

TI2 4:5  But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an
 evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.

TI2 4:6  For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at
 hand.

TI2 4:7  I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the
 faith:

TI2 4:8  Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the
 Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but
 unto all them also that love his appearing.

TI2 4:9  Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:

TI2 4:10  For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is
 departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.

TI2 4:11  Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is
 profitable to me for the ministry.

TI2 4:12  And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.

TI2 4:13  The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring
 with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.

TI2 4:14  Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him
 according to his works:

TI2 4:15  Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.

TI2 4:16  At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I
 pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.

TI2 4:17  Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by
 me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear:
 and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

TI2 4:18  And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve
 me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

TI2 4:19  Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.

TI2 4:20  Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.

TI2 4:21  Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and
 Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.

TI2 4:22  The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.

TIT 1:1  Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according
 to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is
 after godliness;

TIT 1:2  In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before
 the world began;

TIT 1:3  But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is
 committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;

TIT 1:4  To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and
 peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.

TIT 1:5  For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order
 the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had
 appointed thee:

TIT 1:6  If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children
 not accused of riot or unruly.

TIT 1:7  For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled,
 not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;

TIT 1:8  But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy,
 temperate;

TIT 1:9  Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be
 able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.

TIT 1:10  For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially
 they of the circumcision:

TIT 1:11  Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching
 things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.

TIT 1:12  One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians
 are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.

TIT 1:13  This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be
 sound in the faith;

TIT 1:14  Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn
 from the truth.

TIT 1:15  Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and
 unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.

TIT 1:16  They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being
 abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.

TIT 2:1  But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:

TIT 2:2  That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in
 charity, in patience.

TIT 2:3  The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh
 holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good
 things;

TIT 2:4  That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their
 husbands, to love their children,

TIT 2:5  To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own
 husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.

TIT 2:6  Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.

TIT 2:7  In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine
 shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,

TIT 2:8  Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the
 contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.

TIT 2:9  Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please
 them well in all things; not answering again;

TIT 2:10  Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn
 the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.

TIT 2:11  For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
 men,

TIT 2:12  Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should
 live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;

TIT 2:13  Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the
 great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;

TIT 2:14  Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
 iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.

TIT 2:15  These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no
 man despise thee.

TIT 3:1  Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey
 magistrates, to be ready to every good work,

TIT 3:2  To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all
 meekness unto all men.

TIT 3:3  For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived,
 serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and
 hating one another.

TIT 3:4  But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man
 appeared,

TIT 3:5  Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his
 mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy
 Ghost;

TIT 3:6  Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;

TIT 3:7  That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according
 to the hope of eternal life.

TIT 3:8  This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm
 constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain
 good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.

TIT 3:9  But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and
 strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.

TIT 3:10  A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition
 reject;

TIT 3:11  Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being
 condemned of himself.

TIT 3:12  When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come
 unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.

TIT 3:13  Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that
 nothing be wanting unto them.

TIT 3:14  And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses,
 that they be not unfruitful.

TIT 3:15  All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the
 faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
