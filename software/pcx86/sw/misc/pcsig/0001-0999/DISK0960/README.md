## Information about "FINANCIAL COLLECTION"

    THE MENU is a memory-resident program organizer that lets you access
    your programs with a single keystroke from a system of menus.
    
    You can easily update and revise the menus with the editor provided.
    You can tailer the main menu, submenus, and keystrokes can be tailored
    to fit your needs.  The editor can also edit batch files used for
    calling software programs while viewing the menu that uses them.
    
    Included is an audible and visual appointment reminder which can be set
    for daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly intervals.
    File Descriptions:
    
    THE-MENU EXE  Program containing all files in compressed format.
    
    MONTHLY LOAN AMORTIZATION calculates and prints a monthly loan
    schedule.
    
    It prompts you for essential information such as loan amount,
    percentage
    rate and length of loan.  Then the program prints a report of the
    monthly loan payments showing the amount of the payment, the amount left
    due on the loan, and how much is going toward the principle of the loan.
    
    CONVERT is a metric-English/English-metric conversion calculator.
    
    Thirty-six conversions relating to length, weight, area, volume, and
    pressure are available.  Select the type of conversion from the menu in
    the program or from the command-line.
    
    A user-oriented loan and mortgage calculator with a variety of options.
    Compute interest paid for any given year and output a complete or
    partial amortization table on a screen or printer.  Calculate the
    balance payment at any given date.

## CONVERT.TXT

{% raw %}
```
The program CONVERT is an all-purpose Metric - English 
conversion utility.  This file contains some general 
information on its use.

The program is written in Borland Turbo-C.  It is slightly
smaller than 40-K bytes in size and should require only 
128-K bytes of RAM.  

Normally, the program writes its display information directly
to the video memory of the PC.  This of course provides the
fastest display performance possible at the expense of broad
compatability with those PC's which are not fully compatible
with the IBM PC.  For this reason, the program is capable of 
using BIOS calls to write to the screen instead.

The program does this by checking the DOS environment for a
variable named UPDATEMODE.  If it finds this variable set to
BIOS, it uses the bios mode.  If it is set to DIRECT, or not 
set at all, the direct mode is used.  If UPDATEMODE is set 
equal to anything other than bios or direct, an error message
is shown and program execution terminates.

To make the program use the BIOS mode, the user need only 
type "set updatemode=bios" at the DOS prompt, or add this
line to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

There are thirty six conversions available.  To select a
specific conversion automatically, enter its number on the
command line when starting the program.  For example, enter
"CONVERT 27" to put you directly into the cubic centimetres
to cubic inches conversion.

    THE MENU is a program organizer that lets you access your programs with
a single keystroke from a system of menus. The menus can be easily updated
and revised with the program editor provided on the program. With the
editor, the main menu, submenus, and keystrokes can be tailored to fit your
needs. The editor can also edit batch files used for calling software
programs while viewing the menu that uses them. THE MENU is memory-resident
and can be unloaded before executing a program. Otherwise you are
automatically returned to the menu after exiting a program. Also included
is an audible and visual appointment reminder, which can be set for daily,
weekly, monthly, and yearly reminders. A step-by-step introduction and
on-line help is included.

    MONTHLY LOAN AMORTIZATION calculates and prints a monthly loan
schedule. After prompting you for essential information, such as loan
amount, percentage rate, and length of loan, the program prints a report of
monthly loan payments. This is a very simple program which lacks any
sophisticated financial features or applications.

    CONVERT is a metric-English conversion utility. Conversions can be from
metric to English or vice versa. 36 conversions are available relating to
length, weight, area, volume, and pressure. The type of conversion can be
selected from the menu in the program or from the command-line.

    LOANCALC is a user-oriented loan and mortgage calculator. The program
has a variety of options: it can compute interest paid for any given year,
and output a complete or partial amortization table on a screen or printer.
It also computes the balance payment at any given date.

Usage: Financial

System Requirements: 128K memory and one disk drive.

How to Start: Type: THE_MENU (press enter) for the menu, or MONAMORT
(press enter) to start MONTHLY LOAN AMORTIZATION, CONVERT (press enter) to
