                             REFLEX POINT
 
          This game was originally patterned from the TV show
        ROBOTECH. It follows the same basic storyline as the
        show with the Freedom Fighters trying to reach the Reflex
        Point so they can destroy the evil Invid Prince. REFLEX with
        its good graphics and sound is a game that seems like its been
        compiled but in fact is written in basic. The only problem
        that I encountered was that the key buffer can easily be
        filled while in Battle Armor mode causing a lapse in response.
        If you have have any questions or suggestions get in touch with
        the author:
