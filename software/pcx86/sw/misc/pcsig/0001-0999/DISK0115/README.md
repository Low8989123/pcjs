## Information about "DOS UTILITIES NO 6"

    The programs on this disk include a very handy file-compression utility,
    another to suppress the color signal when using a mono monitor, a very
    interesting wave-form drawing utility (requires an 8087 chip),
    and other useful programs.
    
    System Requirements: Some programs require color graphics & BASIC.
    
    How to Start: To run a COM or EXE program simply type its name and
    press <ENTER>.  For instructions on running BASIC programs, please
    refer to the GETTING STARTED section in this catalog.  To read DOC
    files simply enter TYPE filename.ext and press <ENTER>.

          PROKEY SUBSET FOR 1-2-3        [123KEY.DOC]
          -----------------------
In order for Prokey to work with a 123 spreadsheet, certain
setups are required.  First, the 123 system disk must contain
the files PROKEY.EXE (the main PROKEY tm. program) as well as
the file 123KEY.PRO which is the file that contains all the
custom key assignments to be used while in 1-2-3.

An additional third file may be included 123KEY.BAT (may be
re-named Autoexec.bat).  This file installs prokey and the keys
before it calls in the main 1-2-3 program.
     [123KEY.BAT]=  PROKEY/R 123KEY.PRO
                    123
                    ^Z
Upon boot-up the PROKEYS for 1-2-3 will be loaded into high
memory and will be invisible to the user until called.

One additional set-up is required on each new spreadsheet that
is started.  Because of the way 1-2-3 defines certain of the
function keys, it is necessary to inbed the definitions some
where in a group of isolated spreadsheet cells.  In doing so
you will cause PROKEY to interact with the 1-2-3 typing alternative.

The result is to move the functions STEP NAME ABS QUERY TABLE CALC GRAPH
from their respective keys F3 F4 F7 F8 F9 F10 to their new assignments
respectively altF3 altF4 altF7 altF8 altF9 altF10.

The move is to allow the re-assignment of those function keys as follows:
         F3   becomes HOME
         F4   becomes END
         F7   becomes the UP arrow
         F8   becomes the DOWN arrow
         F9   becomes the LEFT arrow
        F10   becomes the RIGHT arrow

You may now leave your NumLock key on and use the keypad as a
numeric keypad.  As stated above this requires a ONE-TIME-ONLY
setup on EACH NEW spreadsheet.  The setup is an automatic feature
built into the Prokey set loaded by the first step.  To use the
setup feature do this:

****  AFTER YOU HAVE CALLED IN A NEW SHEET OR CLEARDED THE       ****
****  OLD SHEET TO BUILD A NEW ONE, PRESS altF2  .               ****

      AltF2 moves the cursor to Cell position BA1 and writes
      cells that 1-2-3 's typing alternative will use in
      re-defining the keypad.  If this group of cells at
      BA1 is going to interfere with the spreadsheet, you
      may change their location by useing the 1-2-3 MOVE
      command to move the group to another section of the sheet.
      Or if you can change the prokey 123PRO.KEY file to have
      another beginning cell in place of BA1 (To do this pull
      up 123PRO.KEY with an editor and find BA1, change it!).

      Each cell in this special group has a range name and they
      remain the same in a 1-2-3 move. It is these names that
      the typing alternative uses in looking for those cells.

               |      |      |

               |  alt |alt   |                  Now tape this to your 1-2-3

               |______|______|


To use this you need to own PROKEY and download three files to put on your
1-2-3 system disk.  They are as follows : [123KEY.DOC]=this explanation
[123KEY.PRO]=the prokey definition file   [123KEY.BAT]=the new 123 autoexec.bat

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS...:  "1-RINGYDINGY" REQUIRES A 64K OR
  LARGER IBM PC (WITH PC-DOS 1.0 OR 1.1), A 96K OR LARGER IBM
  PC (WITH PC-DOS 2.0 OR LATER), ONE DISK DRIVE, AND A SERIAL
  I/O PORT WITH A MODEM.  YOU MUST ALSO HAVE A VIDEO MONITOR
  CAPABLE OF DISPLAYING 80 CHARACTERS PER LINE.

DESCRIPTION:
  "1-RINGYDINGY" IS A GENERAL PURPOSE ASYNCHRONOUS
  COMMUNICATIONS PROGRAM.  IT WAS DESIGNED WITH THE "KISS"
  ("KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID") PRINCIPLE IN MIND.  ALTHOUGH IT
  EMPLOYS A SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD APPROACH TO
  COMMUNICATIONS, ITS CAPABILITIES SURPASS THOSE OF SOME OF
  THE MORE EXPENSIVE COMMUNICATIONS PROGRAMS ON THE MARKET
  TODAY.

  WITH "1-RINGYDINGY" YOU WILL BE ABLE TO:

  -   COMMUNICATE AT SPEEDS UP TO 9600 BAUD (LIMITED BY THE SPEED OF
      YOUR SERIAL PORT AND MODEM.)

  -   EXCHANGE (SEND OR RECEIVE) TEXT FILES WITH OTHER COMPUTERS.
      WHILE SENDING TEXT FILES, YOU MAY DYNAMICALLY SEND SELECTED
      RECORDS FROM THE FILE AND SKIP PAST OTHER RECORDS NOT TO BE
      SENT.

  -   EXCHANGE (SEND OR RECEIVE) NON-TEXT (EXE OR COM) FILES WITH
      OTHER COMPUTERS WHICH SUPPORT THE "X-MODEM" PROTOCOL.

  -   USE MODEMS WHICH DON'T SUPPORT AUTO-DIAL.

  -   USE MODEMS WHICH DO SUPPORT AUTO-DIAL. THIS INCLUDES NOT ONLY
      THE HAYES SMARTMODEM, BUT ALSO A VARIETY OF OTHER MODEMS WHICH
      USE OTHER COMMANDS TO AUTODIAL A PHONE NUMBER.

  -   CAPTURE INCOMING DATA IN A DISK FILE.

  -   SETUP YOUR OWN "FILTERS" TO REMOVE OR CHANGE UNDESIRABLE
      CHARACTERS IN THE INCOMING DATA.

  -   DYNAMICALLY SLOW DOWN THE SPEED AT WHICH YOU TRANSMIT, SO AS
      NOT TO OVERRUN THE COMPUTER AT THE OTHER END.

  -   DYNAMICALLY ALTER YOUR COMMUNICATIONS PARAMETERS, SUCH AS
      PARITY, SPEED, AND NUMBER OF DATA BITS.

  -   BUILD AUTOMATIC LOGON SEQUENCES OF ANY LENGTH, TO ENABLE YOU TO
      LOG ON TO A VARIETY OF REMOTE COMPUTERS WITHOUT HAVING TO
      REMEMBER PHONE NUMBERS, PASSWORDS AND ACCESS COMMANDS.

  -   CHANGE THE COLORS ON YOUR DISPLAY (IF YOU HAVE A COLOR DISPLAY)
      TO SUIT YOUR PERSONAL TASTE.

  -   MOVE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN DIFFERENT DIRECTORIES ON YOUR HARD
      DISK (IF YOU HAVE DOS 2.0) FOR RETRIEVING AND SENDING DATA.

  -   COMMUNICATE PROPERLY WITH COMPUTERS WHICH USE "XON/XOFF"
      CHARACTERS.

  IN SHORT, "1-RINGYDINGY" IS EASY TO USE, EASY TO UNDERSTAND,
  POWERFUL, AND SMALL IN SIZE.

DESCRIPTION:  PC-FILE IS A GENERAL PURPOSE "DATA BASE MANAGER"
  PROGRAM.  IT WAS WRITTEN WITH ONE OVERRIDING GOAL IN MIND:  EASE OF
  USE.  WITH PC-FILE, IT'S VERY EASY FOR THE CASUAL OR PROFESSIONAL USER
  TO CREATE AND MAINTAIN DATA FILES ON THE COMPUTER, AND TO CREATE
  SIMPLE PRINTED REPORTS BASED ON THAT DATA.

    YOU CAN USE PC-FILE FOR ALL KINDS OF TASKS:
    -    MAINTAIN MAILING LISTS AND PRINT LABELS,
    -    MAINTAIN PRICE LISTS,
    -    MAINTAIN TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,
    -    KEEP VARIOUS TYPES OF INVENTORY RECORDS,
    -    BUILD PERSONNEL FILES,
    -    KEEP CUSTOMER LISTS,
    -    BUILD AND MAINTAIN FILES TO BE USED BY OTHER PROGRAMS,
            LIKE VISICALC AND MAILMERGE,
    -    AND MANY OTHER TASKS WHICH ONLY YOU CAN DREAM UP.

  PC-FILE WILL ALLOW YOU TO SORT YOUR DATA INTO ALMOST ANY SEQUENCE.  IT
  ALLOWS RAPID ACCESS TO ANY RECORD IN THE FILE, WITH A SOPHISTICATED
  SEARCH TECHNIQUE ALLOWING COMPARISON SEARCHES ON ANY FIELD IN THE
  RECORD.  FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN DISPLAY ALL EMPLOYEES OVER A CERTAIN
  AGE, OR ALL CLIENTS IN A CERTAIN STATE, OR ALL ITEMS THAT ARE NOT IN A
  CERTAIN CATEGORY.  YOU CAN PRINT OUT REPORTS FROM YOUR DATABASE,
  LISTING ALL OR SOME OF THE FIELDS, FROM ALL OR SOME OF THE RECORDS, IN
  MANY DIFFERENT SEQUENCES, WITH TOTALS ON THE NUMERIC FIELDS.  REPORTS
  CAN BE SENT DIRECTLY TO YOUR VIDEO SCREEN, OR TO ANY ONE OF MANY
  DIFFERENT TYPES OF PRINTERS.  THEY CAN ALSO BE SENT TO DISK, FOR LATER
  USE WITH YOUR WORD PROCESSING PROGRAMS.

  YOU CAN CREATE ENTIRE NEW DATABASES FROM EXISTING DATABASES.  THE NEW
  DATABASES CAN BE IN A DIFFERENT FORMAT, AND CAN BE A SUBSET OF THE
  DATABASE FROM WHICH THEY WERE "CLONED".

  YOU CAN EXPORT YOUR DATABASE FILES FOR USE WITH VISICALC AND OTHER
  "CALC" TYPE PROGRAMS, OR TO "MAILMERGE" FILES.

  BUT ABOVE ALL ELSE, PC-FILE IS EASY!  MOST PEOPLE CAN USE IT WITH NO
  TRAINING OR INSTRUCTIONS.

DESCRIPTION:
  FRED IS A FULL SCREEN EDITOR FOR THE IBM PC.   IT  DISPLAYS FILES
  UP TO 1500 LINES LONG AND WITH LINES UP TO 254 CHARACTERS LONG ON
  A MONOCHROME DISPLAY  OR  80 COLUMN GRAPHICS DISPLAY.  THE SCREEN
  IS A WINDOW ONTO THE  FILE.   THE  WINDOW CAN MOVE UP, DOWN, LEFT
  AND RIGHT.  LINES  WHICH  ARE  LONGER  THAN THE SCREEN ARE PARTLY
  DISPLAYED.  IF YOU INSERT DATA, CHARACTERS SEEM TO BE LOST OFF OF
  THE  END OF THE LINE; THEY ARE NOT LOST BUT ARE  JUST  NO  LONGER
  DISPLAYED.   MOVE  THE CURSOR OFF OF THE SCREEN TO THE RIGHT  AND
  THEY WILL REAPPEAR AS THE WINDOW MOVES.

  IF A FILE IS TOO BIG TO FIT INTO MEMORY,  IT  COMPLAINS POLITELY;
  IF  MEMORY NEARS THE LIMIT WHILE YOU ARE EDITING, FRED TELLS  YOU
  AND LETS YOU CONTINUE EDITING  BUT  WON'T LET YOU ADD MORE LINES.
  IN GENERAL, IT IS FORGIVING; YOU CAN EVEN REMOVE THE  DISKETTE IT
  IS READING FROM OR WRITING TO WITHOUT BOMBING IT OR LOOSING  DATA
  IN MEMORY BUT I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT (NOR GUARANTEE IT).

  IT  UPDATES  THE  DISPLAY BUFFER DIRECTLY SO THAT SCREEN  UPDATES
  APPEAR  INSTANTANEOUS;  IT  IS FULLY POSSIBLE TO SCROLL THROUGH A
  FILE AT TYPAMATIC SPEEDS.

  FRED IS WRITTEN IN ABOUT 590 LINES OF COMPILED BASIC AND ABOUT 30
  LINES OF ASSEMBLER.  SINCE  ITS PERFORMANCE IS HORRID EXCEPT WHEN
  COMPILED, SOURCE IS NOT DISTRIBUTED.

  FRED IS SIMILAR TO THE IBM PERSONAL EDITOR; MOST OF IT'S KEYS ARE
  THE  SAME  AND  ITS  APPROACH TO HANDLING THE SCREEN IS ABOUT THE
  SAME.   I  USE  THE PERSONAL EDITOR;  FRED WAS AN EXPERIMENT FROM
  SOME TIME AGO WHICH I HAD  LAID ASIDE.  SEVERAL MONTHS OF READING
  THE DIALOGS  ON  THE  IBM PC SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP ON COMPUSERVE
  CONVINCED  ME  THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO STILL USE
  EDLIN AND WHO WILL NEVER PAY $100 FOR AN EDITOR.  THEREFORE I GOT
  FRED OUT AND POLISHED  IT  UP  A BIT  TO  GIVE AWAY.  I HOPE THAT
  PEOPLE FIND IT USEFUL.

  THE DOCUMENTATION IS SOMEWHAT SPARSE; THERE IS  NO  TUTORIAL  AND
  LITTLE  ELSE  BUT A LIST OF KEYS.  I SUSPECT THAT MOST  PC  USERS
  WON'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE USING  IT  SINCE  MOST  OF THE KEYS DO THE
  "RIGHT" THING.

DESCRIPTION:  PC-WRITE IS A WORD PROCESSOR AND TEXT EDITOR FOR THE IBM
  PERSONAL COMPUTER.  IT HELPS YOU WRITE AND FORMAT BOOKS, REPORTS, LETTERS,
  PROGRAMS, MANUALS, OR OTHER TEXT.

  PC-WRITE WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE IBM PERSONAL COMPUTER.  IT MAY NOT RUN ON
  OTHER COMPUTERS, EVEN THOSE WHICH CLAIM TO BE "COMPATIBLE" WITH THE IBM PC.
  IF YOU ARE TRYING TO USE PC-WRITE ON ANOTHER MACHINE, YOU MAY BE OUT OF
  LUCK.  SOME, SUCH AS THE COMPAQ, MAY BE COMPATIBLE ENOUGH.

  THE PC-WRITE DISKETTE CONTAINS TWO PROGRAMS:  THE EDITOR AND PAGE PRINTER.
  YOU USE THE EDITOR TO CREATE YOUR TEXT, AND THE PAGE PRINTER TO DIVIDE IT
  INTO PAGES FOR PRINTING.

  IF YOU HAVE NEVER USED A COMPUTER OR AN EDITING PROGRAM, WELCOME TO WORD
  PROCESSING!  THE MANUAL INCLUDES A TUTORIAL SECTION TO HELP YOU GET
  STARTED.  IT ALSO AVOIDS THE USE OF TECHNICAL JARGON AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

  IF YOU HAVE USED OTHER EDITING PROGRAMS, ESPECIALLY FULL SCREEN EDITORS,
  YOU WILL FIND PC-WRITE EASY TO PICK UP.  YOU WILL ALSO FIND IT SMALL, FAST,
  AND RESPONSIVE.

  PC-WRITE INCLUDES MANY FEATURES:

  -  INSERT, REPLACE, AND DELETE TEXT ANYWHERE YOU WANT.
  -  SEARCH FOR A PIECE TEXT AND REPLACE IT WITH OTHER TEXT.
  -  MOVE AND COPY BLOCKS OF TEXT FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER.
  -  SET MARGINS AND TABS, REFORMAT AND JUSTIFY PARAGRAPHS.
  -  PRINT YOUR TEXT IN PAGES WITH HEADERS AND FOOTERS.
  -  SPLIT SCREEN MODE LETS YOU EDIT TWO FILES AT ONCE.
  -  SEARCH AND REPLACE USE "WILD CARD" MATCH CHARACTERS.
  -  VERY FAST OPERATION LETS YOU EDIT EFFICIENTLY.
  -  CONVENIENT TRANSPOSE, CHANGE CASE, AND BOOKMARK KEYS.
  -  YOU CAN SET ANY CONTROL KEY TO BE ANY OTHER KEY.

DESCRIPTION:  EXTENDED BATCH LANGUAGE IS A COMMAND PROGRAMMING
  LANGUAGE.  IT IS A HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE THAT CAN BE USED AS A DIRECT
  REPLACEMENT OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH DOS BATCH FILES.  IT CAN OPERATE
  WITH IBM DOS VERSIONS 1.0, 1.1, OR 2.X.  COMPARED WITH STANDARD DOS
  BATCH FILES, BAT HAS SUPERIOR CONTROL STRUCTURES, STRING HANDLING, AND
  USER INTERFACES.  IT ALSO HAS TRACING FACILITIES, AND IS EASY TO LEARN
  AND USE.  MANY ASPECTS OF THE LANGUAGE ARE LIKE BASIC.  USERS OF
  VM/370 WILL ALSO FIND IT SIMILAR TO EXECS.  THE EFFECT OF USING BAT IS
  TO PUT "COVERS" ON THE PROGRAMS AND SYSTEM THAT IT CONTROLS.  A
  FRIENDLY, EASY TO USE INTERFACE IS EASILY CREATED.

  EXTENDED BATCH LANGUAGE HAS MORE POWER AND ENHANCED CAPABILITIES THAN
  EITHER DOS 1.1 OR DOS 2.0.  THIS PROGRAM USES THESE CAPABILITIES TO
  SOLVE COMMON PROBLEMS FOR......

  THE SYSTEM PROGRAMMER - WHO NEEDS TO DO LONG SEQUENCES OF TASKS
  BETWEEN LINKER, COMPILERS, DEBUGGERS, AND EDITORS.  HE CAN NOW CREATE
  AN INTELLIGENT LINK BETWEEN THESE PROGRAMS.  FOR INSTANCE, HE MAY WISH
  TO DO A LINK DEPENDING ON IF THE PREVIOUS COMPILE WAS SUCCESSFUL.  HE
  CAN ALSO RESPOND AUTOMATICALLY FROM A KEYBOARD "STACK" INTO VARIOUS
  UTILITIES.

  THE SECRETARY - WHO HAS SEVERAL TYPES OF TASKS TO PERFORM (WORD
  PROCESSING, ACCOUNTING PACKAGES, ETC) AND REQUIRES A SIMPLE WAY OF
  CHANGING FROM ONE TYPE OF TASK TO ANOTHER, PERHAPS WITH OPTIONAL HELP
  TEXT.

  THE STUDENT - WHO WISHES TO GO FROM ONE GAME TO ANOTHER WITHOUT HAVING
  TO LEARN THE SYSTEM COMMANDS REQUIRED TO MAKE EACH AVAILABLE.

  TESTERS - WHO WISH TO AUTOMATE LONG, BORING TESTS AND PROCEDURES ON
  THE PERSONAL COMPUTER.  AN EXCELLENT TOOL FOR A MANUFACTURING LINE.

    WITH EXTENDED BATCH LANGUAGE, YOU CAN HAVE:
    -    BETTER CONTROL OF MESSAGES TO THE SCREEN
    -    ACCEPT RESPONSES FROM THE USER AND CREATE RESPONSES TO PROGRAMS
    -    STRING HANDLING OPERATIONS (SUBSTRING, LENGTH, ETC.)
    -    ARITHMETIC EXPRESSIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS
    -    COMPARISONS AND PROGRAM RETURN CODES
    -    SEARCH FOR FILES OR TELL IF THEY EXIST
    -    COMPLETE FREEDOM TO MIX DOS AND BAT COMMANDS WITHIN THE SAME
                  CONTROL FILE

DESCRIPTION:  EPISTAT IS A COLLECTION OF PROGRAMS WRITTEN IN BASICA
  FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED DATA SAMPLES ( <
  1000 OBSERVATIONS PER SAMPLE AND < 28 DATA SAMPLES PER FILE).  IT
  INCLUDES PROGRAMS TO ENTER, APPEND, AND EDIT DATA, AS WELL AS PERFORM
  SEVERAL KINDS OF DATA TRANSFORMATIONS.  THE DATAFILES CAN BE PRINTED,
  GRAPHED, OR SAVED TO DISK.  THE 21 PROGRAMS IN EPISTAT CAN ALSO
  PERFORM 34 COMMON STATISTICAL TESTS OR FUNCTIONS.

  THE PROGRAMS ARE INTENDED TO BE AS SELF-EXPLANATORY AND USER-FRIENDLY
  AS POSSIBLE.  ALL QUESTIONS CAN BE ANSWERED WITH A NUMBER, A "Y" FOR
  YES, OR AN "N" FOR NO.  A THOROUGH STUDY OF THIS GUIDE IS NOT
  NECESSARY BEFORE USING THE PROGRAMS.  ON THE OTHER HAND, NEITHER THE
  PROGRAMS NOR THIS MANUAL PURPORT TO TEACH THE PROPER USE OR
  INTERPRETATION OF STATISTICS.  RATHER, SOME FAMILIARITY WITH THE KINDS
  OF DATA REQUIRED AND THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS APPROPRIATE TO EACH
  STATISTICAL TEST IS ASSUMED.

  ONE WILL NOTE THAT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS EMPHASIZE EPIDEMIOLOGIC AND
  MEDICAL APPLICATIONS.  DESPITE THE WORDING OF VARIOUS PROGRAM
  QUESTIONS OR STATEMENTS, THESE TEST ALSO APPLY TO MANY OTHER TYPES OF
  DATA.  FOR FURTHER EXPLANATIONS OF TESTS, REFER TO:

Those PC owners using a COLOR/GRAPHICS card with a monochrome monitor
may find this program useful.  Many programs assume that if you have
a C/G card, you have a color display, and proceed to produce color-
encoded video output, which makes indecipherable garbarge on a
monochrome screen.
Use this program to switch your Color/Graphics card to B/W mode from
within such a program.
Run NOCOLOR at the DOS prompt.  From then on, hitting Alt-Tab will
switch the C/G card to B/W mode.

               SQUEEZE AND UNSQUEEZ DOCUMENTATION

These two programs compress and decompress files.  Compression
(using SQUEEZE) allows files take less storage on disk, to be
transmitted faster, etc.  Additionally, compressed files provide
some information security, since they are encoded and are not
intelligible until decompressed (using UNSQUEEZ).  These programs
are compatible with the CP/M squeeze and unsqueeze programs
(information on CP/M bulletin boards is often squeezed).  In
fact, these versions were obtained in source format from the
Compuserve CP/M SIG (from the C database).  The only changes made
were those required to compile on the IBM PC using the C86
compiler.

Credit should be given to Richard Greenlaw who wrote this version
of SQUEEZE and UNSQUEEZ and to those who enhanced it.


                           SQUEEZE.EXE

Typical compression factors are:

      .COM    6%      (Don't bother)

      .ASM    33%     (using full ASCII set)

      .HEX    46%     (using only uppercase and a few others)

       Squeezing a really big file takes a few minutes.


Usage:     SQUEEZE filename

The squeezed file name is formed by changing the middle
letter of the file type to Q. If there is no file type,
the squeezed file type is QQQ. If the name exists it is
overwritten!


The transformations compress strings of identical bytes and
then encode each resulting byte value and EOF as bit strings
having lengths in inverse proportion to their frequency of
occurrence in the intermediate input stream. The latter uses
the Huffman algorithm. Decoding information is included in
the squeezed file, so squeezing short files or files with
uniformly distributed byte values will actually increase size.


                          UNSQUEEZ.EXE

UNSQUEEZ converts the information compressed with SQUEEZE or
compatible compression programs back to their original data.

Usage:     UNSQUEEZ filename

Note:  The file will be UNSQUEEZED to a file with the original
unsqueezed name.  For example if the file CVTHEX.BAS was
squeezed, it would create a file called CVTHEX.BQS.  UNSQUEEZ
CVTHEX.BQS will create a file called CVTHEX.BAS


                  RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS

1.   These versions do not support the DOS 2. hierarchical direct-
     ories.  Thus the file to be squeezed or unsqueezed must be
     in the current directory of the specified disk.

2.   If the disk is full, these programs do not detect it.  They
     terminate normally, with a directory entry that shows the
     actual size of the file and a file that has been truncated
     to fit on the disk.  No damage is done to the disk or
     directory.  If this happens, delete the truncated file, make
     some room on the disk (either by deleting unnecessary infor-
     mation or rerunning the program on a disk with sufficient
     space.

3.    The output file is always placed on the same disk drive as
     the input file.

I may fix these later, but for now, I am so happy to be able to
squeeze files for archive so am using the programs as is.

*********************************************************************
**                            SURFACE87                            **
*********************************************************************

    This program developed from an article in 80-Micro, May 1983, page
236.  The article is written by Delmer D. Hinrichs.  I got tired of
running benchmarks on the 8087 in my IBM-PC and remembered this
program, which draws elaborate, drop of water type waveforms on dot
matrix printers, such as the EPSON MX series.  Elaborate yes, but even
in compiled BASIC a moderately complex picture can take an hour or two
while the program computes hundreds of thousands of sine functions.

    SURFACE87 is written entirely in 8088/87 assembler, taking advan-
tage of the number crunching power of the 8087.  If you don't have an
8087 installed in your PC or compatible computer, this program will
not produce anything worthwhile.  If you do, some very intriguing
waveforms can be cranked out on your printer in an average of
fifteen minutes.

    You are invited to experiment with values outside those suggested
by the program.  A negative height multiplier, for instance, will make
a negative peak.  Different size waves make the peaks fatter or skinnier.
A good set of values to start out with are 1 peak, circular wave forms,
left margin 300, X position 250, Y position 250, wave lengths 71,
height multiplier 530.  This creates the classic three dimensional
drop of water in the pond image you have probably seen a hundred times
in magazines--in less than ten minutes.

    Output is intended for printer, but can optionally be sent to the
screen or disk. The screen image is compressed by a factor of four in
order to represent the 720,000 possible dots.  A disk file can be speci-
fied but make sure you have 91,200 bytes free on the disk. SURFACE87
can also print the files it writes.  A good way to experiment, once
you have a feel for the screen verses printer images, is to send the
picture to the screen and electric disk.  This saves a lot of paper
and if you create a really wonderful design you can save it to real
disk and print it out anytime at maximum speed.

    This file is one of three or four. SURF87.EXE is the main
program.  SURF87.HEX must be run through a hex-converter program to
produce SURF87.EXE.  SURFPR.BAS is a PC-BASIC program to install
alternate printers on SURF87.  The program comes ready to go for all
EPSON GRAFTRAX printers, including the IBM Graphics Printer.  If your
printer has a bit-plot mode, it can most likely be installed.

    Technical details:

    For IBM compatibles--if your computer understands the IBM video
BIOS routines in Interrupt 10H, the printer call Interrupt 17H and
standard MS-DOS function calls (version 1.10 and later) you should
have no problems with this program.

    For IBM-PC--in order to allow as many people as possible to use
the program the disk files only use the DOS 1.10 function calls, so
sorry about no PATH names.

    SURFACE87 disk files are standard random files with a block size
of 960.  In BASIC, a program to print these files can be written by
going to BASIC with the /S:960 option, and then doing an
       OPEN "filename" AS #1 LEN=960.
Printers other than the EPSON sometimes have more and less than 960
dot widths, and this is one way to get at the actual data produced.
Alternatively, SURFPR has sixteen bytes of space for each printer
set-up sequence, and can be used to move the image around the page.

    There is error detection built in to cope with out of disk space
or printer problems.  If you have specified output to disk and printer,
for instance, and run out of space on the disk file, the program will
close the disk file and continue sending to the printer.  If the
printer then runs out of paper, the program will find that it doesn't
have anything to do and will return to 'Program possibilities'.  So if
you are printing a picture and it looks crummy, just turn off the
printer for a second and you will be back at the main menu.
