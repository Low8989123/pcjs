## Information about "BATCH FILE UTILITIES"

    Batch files are tireless worker files. Once written and tested to insure
    that they are doing what you want them to do, they go on and on doing it
    with no slip-ups, complaints, or fatigue.
    
    The utilities on this disk are designed to as a batch file tutorial and
    also to enhance the batch file capabilities of your DOS operating
    system. Source code is included thoughout, making it possible to read or
    print out any of the files included. A lot of the material here would be
    pertinent to programmmers or advanced users who wanted to soup-up their
    systems with hard-working batch files.

        This program is a utility that can be used with DOS 2.0 to
        find the disk drive number that contains a certain file.

        A common use of FINDFILE is to help a batch file "orient"
        itself by discovering on which drive the Batch File itself is
        running, and on what drives other files (such as useful system
        utilities) can be found.  A lot of this orientation can be done
        without bothering or confusing the user with a lot of questions
        or constraints in locating disks in certain drives.

        A key feature of this search (and where this method of orien-
        tation differs from the use of PATH or IF EXIST ) is that
        searching on the disk drives is done "benignly".  By this we mean
        that FINDFILE doesn't come to a grinding halt if an empty
        disk drive is searched.  Instead, it continues the search on
        the rest of the drives.  This further relieves the user from
        having to locate certain disks on certain drives.  The target
        file may be on the B: or C: drive with the A: drive empty, and
        FINDFILE will find it without the annoying "ignore, abort, retry"
        message.  If the file is not found, then you may gently prod the
        user to place the required disk "in any drive" and try again.

        The syntax of the command line is the following:

                findfile  fname

        where fname is a standard DOS path, filename, and extention.
        If you include a drive specification (like "a:" for example),
        the drive spec will be ignored by FINDFILE.

        FINDFILE benignly searches all disk drives that  are claimed
        to present by the system board switches, in order A:, B:, C:, and
        D:.  If the file is found, the disk number of the first disk on
        which it was found is returned in errorlevel and may be tested
        by a Batch File IF Subcommand.


                If fname found:         errorlev = 0 if fname on A:
                                        errorlev = 1 if fname on B:
                                        errorlev = 2 if fname on C:
                                        errorlev = 3 if fname on D:

                If fname not found:     errorlev = 255

                If fname is missing:    errorlev = 255 , and a CNTRL BREAK
                                                   halts the Batch File

;
;       This handler will be called by DOS functions when any critical
;       error (disk or non-disk) occurs during DOS INT 21H calls that
;       are made during execution of this process.
;
;       We only want to ignore disk errors, so we first test if the disk
;       is the cause of error.
;
;       If not a disk error, we jump to the parent's critical error handler
;       (we JMP so that stack looks as if we were never there).
;
;       If it is a disk error, we return an IGNORE code to the calling
;       DOS function.  The effect of all this is that when a DOS function
;       tries to access a disk drive that has a door open, or no disk, or
;       disk is unformatted, or disk is garbled, etc, the DOS function will
;       simply give up and return to the function's caller "empty handed".

        This program is a utility that can be used with DOS 2.0
        to allow an n-way branch (typically a menu selection) during
        execution of a batch file.  The program does this by
        testing the user's one key response and returning to DOS an
        "errorlevel" code corresponding to the EXTENDED keycode.
        This errorlevel code can then be tested by the
        batch file program using the IF ERRORLEVEL n  statement.

        When FUNKY is run in a batch file, an appropriate menu
        has been displayed for the user via REM or ECHO statements.
        The user answers with any key that generates an EXTENDED keycode.
        Examples of such keys are the following:

                the function keys F1 - F10

                the shifted function keys

                the Alt-function keys

                the cursor control keys

                most Alt-alphanumeric keys

        If a key that does not generate an EXTENDED code is struck, then this
        program tests for the ESC key, and returns one of two codes:

                if the non-extended key is ESC,  errorlevel = 0

                for any other non-extended key,  errorlevel = 255

        No other error-checking is done by FUNKY.  The subsequent Batch
        File IF tests must determine whether the keystroke response is
        within the extended keycode range, or is an ESC key or other
        "regular" key.  Some examples of extended keycodes are as follows:

                F1 ... F10              59 ... 68

                Shifted F1 ... F10      84 ... 93

                Control F1 ... F10      94 ... 103

                Alt     F1 ... F10      104 ... 113



        A complete list of extended codes and the keys that generate them can
        be found in the IBM Tech Reference, Revised 1982, Table 26, P. 3-14

        Remember that the subsequent IF clauses are "greater than or equal
        to"  and  "less than", so the order of the IF tests is important.

                IF ERRORLEVEL N         means   if errorlevel >= n

                IF NOT ERRORLEVEL N     means   if errorlevel < n

        This program is a utility that can be used with DOS 2.0
        to allow a yes/no interaction by the user during
        execution of a batch file.  The program does this by
        testing the user's one key response and returning to DOS an
        "errorlevel" code corresponding to that keycode response.
        This errorlevel code can then be tested by the
        batch file program using the IF ERRORLEVEL n  statement.

        When QUERY is run in a batch file, an appropriate question
        has been posed to the user via a REM or ECHO statement, or
        the QUERY statment itself.  A reverse video box then prompts.
        The user may answer with a single keystroke denoting
        a yes, no , or escape response.  The errorlevel code is set
        as follows:

                errorlevel = 2          if user typed ESC key

                errorlevel = 1          if user typed Y or y

                errorlevel = 0          if user typed N or n

        If any other key is typed, the console is beeped,a message is
        displayed, and this program waits for another keystroke.

        Remember that the subsequent IF clauses are "greater than or equal
        to"  and  "less than", so the order of the IF tests is important.

                IF ERRORLEVEL N         means   if errorlevel >= n

                IF NOT ERRORLEVEL N     means   if errorlevel < n

        This program is a utility that can be used with DOS 2.0 to
        find the disk drive number that contains a certain file.

        SETDISK is similar to FINDFILE, with one additional feature.
        When SETDISK finds the file, it sets the DOS default
        drive designator to the drive on which the file was found.

        A common use of SETDISK is to help a batch file "orient"
        itself by discovering on which drive the Batch File itself is
        running, and on what drives other files (such as useful system
        utilities) can be found.  A lot of this orientation can be done
        without bothering or confusing the user with a lot of questions
        or constraints in locating disks in certain drives.

        A key feature of this search (and where this method of orien-
        tation differs from the use of PATH or IF EXIST ) is that
        searching on the disk drives is done "benignly".  By this we mean
        that SETDISK doesn't come to a grinding halt if an empty
        disk drive is searched.  Instead, it continues the search on
        the rest of the drives.  This further relieves the user from
        having to locate certain disks on certain drives.  The target
        file may be on the B: or C: drive with the A: drive empty, and
        SETDISK will find it without the annoying "ignore, abort, retry"
        message.  If the file is not found, then you may gently prod the
        user to place the required disk "in any drive" and try again.

        The syntax of the command line is the following:

                findfile  fname

        where fname is a standard DOS path, filename, and extention.
        If you include a drive specification (like "a:" for example),
        the drive spec will be ignored by SETDISK.

        SETDISK benignly searches all disk drives that  are claimed
        to be present by the system board switches, in order A:, B:, C:, and
        D:.  If the file is found, the disk number of the first disk on
        which it was found is returned in errorlevel and may be tested
        by a Batch File IF Subcommand. SETDISK also changes the DOS default
        drive designator to the disk on which the file was found.


                If fname found:         errorlev = 0 if fname on A:
                                        errorlev = 1 if fname on B:
                                        errorlev = 2 if fname on C:
                                        errorlev = 3 if fname on D:
                                        (in all of above cases, the default
                                         drive designator is changed to the
                                         drive on which fname was found )

                If fname not found:     errorlev = 255

                If fname is missing:    errorlev = 255 , and a CNTRL BREAK
                                                   halts the Batch File

        parsing the command line entered with SLASH.  The syntax
        of the command line is shown below.  Brackets [] denote optional
        fields of the command line (the brackets themselves should not
        appear in the command line characters):

                SLASH [ / [ cmd1 [ cmd2 ...]] / ] [ <string>

        cmdi are one-letter commands listed below.

        If the first slash is present, then all one-letter commands
        recognized between first and second slash are executed in the
        order inwhich they occure left to right.

        If slashes are not present, the string is displayed with leading
        tabs and blanks removed.

        If slashes are present, all characters after the second slash are
        displayed, including all leading tabs and blanks.

        A carriage return - line feed is sent to the display at the end of
        a NON-null <string>.  If however the <string> is null, or if slashes
        are absent and string is all blanks and tabs, then no CR LF is displayed
               ( i.e. to skip a line, use SLASH/L and not SLASH )


        The one-letter commands include:

                L or l          skip one line

                B or b          sound buzzer

                D or d          print border across screen, double line

        This program is a utility that can be used with DOS 2.0 to
        obtain equipment configuration information.  This information
        is passed back from WHAT in the form of a returning
        "errorlevel", and may therefore be tested by appropriate
        IF subcommands in subsequent Batch File lines.

        The configuration information is obtained from BIOS from the
        system board switch settings  and from system parameters that
        DOS manages.


        WHAT is called with one parameter naming the equipment
        to be reported.  Only the first letter of the parameter
        need be entered on the WHAT command line.  The parameters
        are as follows:

        D  or   DRIVES          returns the number of valid disk drive letters
                                of floppy drives and fixed disks. This is the
                                parameter that is usually patched by virtual
                                disk enhancement programs.  DOS considers a
                                one physical drive system to have two valid
                                virtual drives, so you will get a 2 with this
                                parameter on such a system.

        F  or  FLOPPIES         returns the number of physical diskette drives
                                that is set on the System Board Switches
                                With a one physical drive system, you will get
                                a 1 with this parameter.

        V  or   VIDEO           returns:        0  no monitor
                                                1  40x25, color adaptor
                                                2  80x25, color adaptor
                                                3  80x25, either color
                                                   adaptor or monochrome
                                                   adaptor

        J  or   JOY adaptor     returns         0  no adaptor present
                                                1  adaptor present
                                                (NOT the number of joy STICKS)

        P  or   PARALLEL ports  returns number of parallel ports: 0,1,2, ...

        S  or   SERIAL ports    returns number of serial ports: 0,1,2, ...

        K  or   K blocks        returns number of 4 K memory blocks set on
                                switches


        R  or  RELEASE          returns the major release number of the
                                DOS you are running (e.g. 2 = DOS 2.0)
                                (returns zero for versions less than 2.0)

        M  or  MINOR            returns the minor release number of the
                                DOS you are running (e.g. 0 = DOS 2.0)
                                (returns zero for versions less than 2.0)

        C  or  CURRENT          returns the current default drive number.
                                (0 = A:, 1 = B:, etc)


        If the command line is empty or if the parameter does not begin with
        one of the above letters, an error message is printed and this
        utility halts execution of a Batch File in progress by executing
        a CONTROL-BREAK.
