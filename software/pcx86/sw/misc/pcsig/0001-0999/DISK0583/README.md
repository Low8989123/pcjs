## Information about "LOTUS WHITEROCK"

    The WHITEROCK ALTERNATIVE is a macro-driven worksheet shell
    (AUTO123.WKS) for Lotus 1-2-3 worksheets with four very useful
    applications: a checkbook manager, mailing list, loan amortizer and a
    jobcosting/time management worksheet.
    
    AUTO123.WKS is a worksheet manager that allows access to other 1-2-3
    worksheets.  Supported by clever screen graphics, the WHITEROCK
    ALTERNATIVE applications are a pleasure to use.  A library of 1-2-3
    macros is also included.

Program name: LOTUS 123 - THE WHITEROCK ALTERNATIVE
 
Author name:  Whiterock Alternative
Address:      P.O. Box 45458
              Seattle WA, 98145

Suggested Donation: $15.00 for the shell.  Other applications driven by the 
shell have separate compensation structures.
 
Program Description:
 
The Whiterock alternative is a Macro-based, menu-driven front end for LOTUS 123
designed to make 123 easier to use, and to provide worksheets derived for this
environment with a common user interface.  It is designed to boot up automa-
tically when the Whiterock Alternative is placed in the drive after LOTUS 123
is powered up.  The Whiterock shell takes over, and the user runs his appli-
cations under the new environment.

This disk also contains several worksheets designed to run under the Whiterock
environment, including a library of useful macros that can be exported to use 
in new worksheets, an installment loan analyzer, a menu-driven mailing list 
database, a checkbook ledger with on-line budget cross-auditing, and a file to
in job-costing by keeping track of hours spent on particular tasks.

System requirements are an IBM PC or compatible with at least 256K (some appli-
cations will require more memory that) and LOTUS 123.  A printer is optional,
but recommended, as is a second disk drive.
