## Information about "STATMATE/PLUS 2 OF 3 (ALSO 861, 863)"

    A statistical analysis package for handling numerical data, operated by
    entering one-line commands and subcommands.  Command ``batch'' files can
    be created for automatic execution, along with explanatory screen
    remarks.
    
    STATMATE operates on information contained in a database, generated by
    the program.  A user ID is required before entering a database, and for
    every new user ID, an empty database is created.  This feature permits
    multiple users to work with STATMATE while keeping the data files
    separated.
    
    Extract data from an ASCII text file and load it into the database for
    operation.  Data is stored in columns and rows, and you can extract
    portions of the data according to your specifications.  As you
    manipulate the data, the results can be displayed on the screen,
    printed, or saved on a disk file.
    
    The main analytic features are elementary statistics, scatter plots,
    cross tabulations, histograms, data comparison using the T-Test,
    correlation, arithmetic operations, distribution functions, curvilinear
    regression, multiple regression, nonlinear regression, data recoding,
    and data transformation and manipulation.  An on-line help facility is
    included to give you a detailed description of all the STATMATE
    commands.

Disk No  862
Program Title:  STATMATE/PLUS version 1.3 (Disk 2 of 3)
PC-SIG version 1
 
    STATMATE is a three-disk statistical analysis package for handling
numerical data, and is operated by entering one-line commands and
subcommands. Command "batch" files can be created for automatic execution,
along with screen remarks to explain the data manipulation on the terminal.
The data on which STATMATE operates is contained in a database, which is
generated by the program. A user ID is required before entering a database,
and for every new user ID an empty database is created. This feature
permits multiple users to work with STATMATE while keeping the data files
separated. The size of each database can be changed with the installation
program. STATMATE allows you to extract data from an ASCII text file and
load it into the database for operation. Data is stored in columns and
rows, and you can extract portions of the data according to your
specifications. As you manipulate the data, you can have the output on
results displayed on the screen, printed on the printer, or saved on a disk
file. The main analytic features available with the STATMATE package are
elementary statistics, scatter plots, cross tabulations, histograms, data
comparison using the T-Test, correlation, arithmetic operations,
distribution functions, curvilinear regression, multiple regression,
nonlinear regression, data recoding, and data tranformation and
manipulation. An on-line help facility is included to give you a detailed
description of all the STATMATE commands. This is the second disk of the
STATMATE package, and contains more overlay files for necessary operation.
