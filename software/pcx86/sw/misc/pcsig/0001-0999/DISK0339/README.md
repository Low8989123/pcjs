## Information about "CREATOR"

    Creator, Reporter and Cheapsort comprise this database management
    system.  Creator provides the principle database functions (record,
    add, delete etc.); Reporter writes report programs; Cheapsort sorts
    Creator files as well as files created under other database systems.
    
    System Requirements: Two disk drives
    
    How to Start:  From DOS, enter TYPE CSORT.DOC for documentation.
    To run the BASIC programs consult the GETTING STARTED for
    your configuration.  The Cheapsort programs run from DOS.

1 'THE CREATOR WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN ON 1/16/80 BY BRUCE W. TONKIN
2 'AND WAS ADAPTED FOR CP/M AND MICROSOFT BASIC 5.01 ON 5/11/80
3 'IT WAS ADAPTED AGAIN FOR MBASIC 4.51 ON 3/18/81 AND FOR THE TRS-80 MODEL III
4 'ON 2/20/83, AND FOR MBASIC 5.2 ON 3/23/83. THE PC VERSION WAS FIRST RUN ON
5 '4/03/83 AND HAS BEEN ENHANCED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE; THE LAST ON 4/05/83
6 'THE CREATOR HAS BEEN TESTED EXTENSIVELY UNDER DOS 1.1. USE UNDER OTHER
7 'DOS VERSIONS SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT, BUT CANNOT BE GUARANTEED.
8 '
9 'THE IBM PC VERSION WILL REQUIRE ENOUGH MEMORY SO THAT BASIC WILL LOAD AND
10 'SHOW AT LEAST 25000 BYTES FREE; THIS SHOULD BE A 32K MACHINE. AT LEAST
11 'ONE DISK DRIVE IS REQUIRED (160K), BUT TWO WOULD BE NICE. NO PRINTER IS
12 'REQUIRED, THOUGH ONE IS SUPPORTED.

                   CHEAPSORT (level I AND II) DOCUMENTATION

                          CAPABILITIES OF CHEAPSORT
     CHEAPSORT  is a disk-based sort/merge program.  It will sort  data  files 
which  have fixed-length records and fixed-length fields.  The data file being 
sorted may be of any size,  but may not contain more than 32,767 records. This 
should be sufficient for most uses.
     CHEAPSORT  will  not sort sequential data files,  such as  those  written 
using a word processor;  nor will it sort data files written under the UCSD or 
CP/M-86 operating systems, unless the data is somehow transferred to PC DOS.
     CHEAPSORT appears to work correctly under PC DOS 1.1 and 2.0, and on hard 
disk,  floppy disk,  and RAM (or memory) disk. CHEAPSORT is not copy protected 
in  any  way,  and  may  be backed up or transferred freely  to  other  media. 
CHEAPSORT  is copyrighted and trademarked,  and should not be sold  except  as 
noted in this documentation.
     You may sort data of any type commonly used in BASIC. Valid types include 
ASCII data (numbers or letters,  in alphabetic order),  byte,  packed integer, 
packed single precision,  packed double precision,  and any user-defined  data 
type  adhering  to Microsoft's floating point format.  Many other  sorts  have 
difficulty with other than ASCII data types.
     CHEAPSORT is compatible with THE CREATOR,  REPORTOR,  PROGEN, REPGEN, and 
other software sold or distributed by T.N.T. SOFTWARE, INC.
     CHEAPSORT is totally compatible with Microsoft BASIC random-access files. 
Other  sorts  may have some difficulties with  Microsoft  random  files,  even 
appending unwanted control characters to the file output. CHEAPSORT will not.
     You  may sort unpacked numbers in numeric (rather than alphabetic)  order 
by  choosing to sort that field as NUMERIC,  rather than CHARACTER.  CHEAPSORT 
will   convert  any  such  numbers  into  a  packed  double-precision   format 
internally; the sort will be accurate to 16 significant digits.
     CHEAPSORT  will  only output an INDEX to the file in sorted  order.  This 
index will consist of a list of record numbers.  By reading the sorted file in 
the order specified by the index,  you will be reading the file in the  sorted 
order you specified. If you need a whole file output, you may use the index to 
create  one.  See  the end of these notes for a sample program which  you  may 
modify for your use.  The sample program,  incidentally, also shows how to use 
the index to read a data file.
     For  your added convenience,  the sort index file can be read as a random 
file  of  record length 8.  This will allow you to use the index  file  to  do 
binary searches of the data,  if you wish. To help you further, CHEAPSORT will 
always  tell  you exactly how many records were sorted when the sort has  been 
completed. A null record is always appended to the end of the file to help you 
locate  the end,  if you want to do binary searches.  Each record in the  data 
file  to  be sorted can not contain more than 256 characters;  if you  have  a 
requirement which exceeds that,  consider buying CHEAPSORT, level II. The cost 
is $25.00,  postpaid,  from TNT SOFTWARE INC.,  34069 Hainesville Road,  Round 
Lake  IL 60073.  Level II CHEAPSORT will sort input files with lengths  up  to 
32767 bytes and combined key lengths of up to 32765 bytes (limited by memory).
     If  you  have  more  complex sort  requirements,  or  need  to  customize 
CHEAPSORT (any level), the source code is separately available. Level I source 
code costs an additional $11.00;  level II,  an additional $25.00. Examples of 
customizing  CHEAPSORT to do select/exclude on fields or  field  relationships 
are included with the source code.











                                     1


                             HOW TO RUN CHEAPSORT
     Simple:  while at the DOS prompt (A>,  B>,  etc.) just type in CSORT.  If 
CHEAPSORT  is not on your current default drive,  preface CSORT with the drive 
letter and a colon. For example:
A>B:CSORT
B>A:CSORT
     CHEAPSORT will ask you for the name of the file to be sorted,  the record 
length,  the name of the output index file,  and the beginning position, type, 
and length of each of the sort keys.
     The  beginning  position of each key must  be  carefully  specified.  The 
easiest  way to understand how this should be done is by means of an  example. 
Suppose you want to sort a data file whose record length is 85;  the fields in 
each record are of lengths 15,20,5,20,10,10,  and 5.  Suppose you want to sort 
each record by field 4, then 3, then 6, then 1.
     In  that case,  the starting position of the first key (field 4) would be 
15+20+5+20=60,  plus  1 (skip the first 60 characters,  start the sort at  the 
61st character). The key length would be 20, if you want to sort by all of the 
fourth field.  Likewise,  the second key begins at 15+20+1=36,  the third  key 
begins at 15+20+5+20+10+1=71, and the last key begins at position 1.
     You need not use all of a key field as a sort key.  If your key field  is 
very  long (a name field,  with 80 characters allowed,  for example),  you may 
wish to use only the first few characters of the field as the key.  Just enter 
whatever length you decide to use.
     CHEAPSORT will remind you of the permissible data types;  please read the 
possibilities  carefully.  Many of the possible data types (the packed numeric 
ones, especially) are called "Other".
     You  may use up to 50 keys,  but the total length of all of the keys  may 
not exceed 253 bytes. CHEAPSORT will inform you of the remaining key space and 
the number of remaining keys after each key is entered.
     When you are done entering the keys,  you may go on to the next step  (as 
CHEAPSORT  will inform you) by entering the number 0 for the starting position 
for the next key.
     CHEAPSORT will then ask for the drive letter of the drive to use for work 
files.  Many  times,  a  work file will not be  necessary;  if  one  is,  this 
temporary file will be placed on the drive you specify.
     You  may  use any drive for your work files.  If you're sorting a  small-
enough data file (under 1000 records) and you have a small enough  total   key 
length (depends on memory available), you may not actually need any work file. 
     In  any event,  the work file space necessary will not exceed your  total 
key lengths plus two bytes,  times the number of records in the data file. For 
example,  if  your  total of key lengths is 50 bytes and you are sorting  2000 
records,  the space required for your work file will be 52*2000=104000  bytes. 
Be  sure  you have enough space available on the drive you designate for  your 
work files. It is disheartening to run the sort almost to completion and get a 
'disk full' error message.
     It  is  interesting to note,  in this  connection,  that  CHEAPSORT  uses 
generally  less work file space than other sorts.  You will probably find that 
CHEAPSORT will be capable of sorting data files other sorts cannot touch.
     CHEAPSORT is quite quick,  but is probably not the fastest possible  sort 
for the IBM PC. It is, however, probably the least expensive good sort package 
you will ever buy.  Here are some comparative sort times for the IBM PC, where 
the  sort file and work files were on separate (floppy) disks.  The file being 
sorted consisted of 3000 records, each of 25 bytes in length. There were three 
fields:  a  15-character alphabetic name,  an 8-byte  packed  double-precision 
amount, and a two-byte packed integer field. Print level 4 was used. The times 
quoted  are  from  the last operator entry to CHEAPSORT until the  DOS  prompt 
reappeared.  All data was generated by using BASICs RND function, so no fields 
were in any particular sorted order.
     The  times quoted are from the time of the last operator input until  the 
system prompt returns, and include all disk read and write times.



                                     2


               SORT TIMES, 3000 RANDOM RECORDS (25 BYTES EACH)
                   ALL TIMES QUOTED ARE MINUTES AND SECONDS
ASCENDING      DESCENDING     KEY(S)
2:47           2:51           Packed integer.
3:10           3:56           15 character alphabetic.
3:20           3:45           Packed double precision.
3:26                          15 character alphabetic + packed integer.
3:37                          Packed double precision + packed integer.
4:04                          15 character alphabetic + packed double prec.
4:22           5:39           15 char. alpha + packed double + packed int.

     Each  run  required  a merge of 3000 records;  this merge  took  about  a 
minute.  If you were to sort fewer than a thousand records, a merge may not be 
required; generally, sort times for such small data files will be well under a 
minute.  The merge function has been highly optimized, and will take advantage 
of  memory buffering as much as possible.  Disk reads of the merge  work  file 
have been reduced to the minimum.
     Sorts in descending order generally take about 2-3% longer than ascending 
sorts for each byte in the descending key field. Merge times are not affected. 
Sorts  of packed single or double precision data take about 10% longer than  a 
sort  on  an  alphabetic key of the same size.  Again,  merge  times  are  not 
affected. Merges will take somewhat longer if the key lengths are longer.
     CHEAPSORT  will  run  more slowly if the disk data is  in  reverse  order 
compared  to  the sort order requested.  I have done no checking on times  for 
this,  but it should be possible to double the sort times if the data were  in 
exactly reverse order.  On the other hand, if the data were in close to sorted 
order  to  begin with,  CHEAPSORT could run appreciably faster than  indicated 
here. Sort times in that instance would probably be primarily limited by disk 
transfer times.
     On  some machines,  it is possible to appreciably speed up  CHEAPSORT  by 
specifying print level 1.  On the IBM PC, it makes a difference of only two or 
three  seconds on the above sort.  Therefore,  there is no real penalty if you 
like to watch how the sort is progressing.
     You  may find it hard to believe (especially considering the  speed  with 
which  CHEAPSORT  operates),  but CHEAPSORT was written entirely in  Microsoft 
BASIC.   This  was  done  quite  deliberately,  so  that  CHEAPSORT  would  be 
transportable to as many new machines as possible,  and would be adaptable  to 
any  new operating system releases from either Microsoft or IBM.  If there  is 
sufficient demand,  I may produce a version of CHEAPSORT for CP/M-86. However, 
I consider this rather unlikely; most CP/M-86 software tends to get written in 
and for the Digital Research languages, for which I have no love whatsoever. 
     System  builders and developers might want to incorporate CHEAPSORT  into 
their software; or, a user may obtain a copy of either version of CHEAPSORT in 
order to 'test' its capabilities.  In any case,  if you wish to sell CHEAPSORT 
or  'buy' a copy in order to make your sale or possession legal,  you need  do 
the following:
     (1) Remit $5 for CHEAPSORT level I, or $10 for CHEAPSORT level II;
     (2)  Send the name and full address of the ultimate user of the  software 
to T.N.T. SOFTWARE, INC. at 34069 Hainesville Road, Round Lake IL 60073.
     Others  using  or  selling CHEAPSORT do so  without  any  possibility  of 
support and with the possibility of legal action against them for such illegal 
use or sale.
     T.N.T.  SOFTWARE  has a very easy distribution policy,  and very low cost 
software. It is our belief that software prices are entirely too high; but, if 
our software is pirated and we obtain little gain from our policies,  we  will 
have  only  two choices:  increase prices or leave the  market.  Neither  will 
result  in any long-term advantage to the software buyer.  Please help us keep 
prices low, and obey our requests for sale and distribution of our software.

## CSORT3.DOC

{% raw %}
```
             EXPLANATION OF CHANGES FOR CSORT3 OVER CSORT2

    The big difference is that CSORT3 reads all the requested inputs 
from the file called CSORT.DAT, which is assumed to be on the current 
drive and in the current directory.
    All inputs should be on their own lines, since most of the input is 
handled as LINE INPUT statements.  Multiple inputs on the same line 
should not generally be attempted, and will usually cause errors of 
various types.
    If an error is encountered while reading the CSORT.DAT file, 
CHEAPSORT LEVEL III will print a short descriptive error message 'BAD 
PRINT LEVEL'; 'BAD INPUT FILE', 'BAD OUTPUT FILE', etc.  Those error 
messages should enable you to find and fix the error fairly easily.
    All questions have been removed from the sort, and the only things 
the user will generally see on the screen are the sort copyright 
message, whatever messages are appropriate for the print level chosen, 
and the sort termination message.
    To make it easier, the questions are asked in the following order:
    1. Name of the file to sort;
    2. Record length for sort file;
    3. Name of index file;
    4. Starting position for key (if zero go to step 9);
    5. Length of key;
    6. Data type for key (C=character or packed half-precision, 
N=numeric, I=packed integer, O=other packed field type);
    7. Ascending or descending order (A/D);
    8. Go back and repeat steps 4-7 until starting position is 0;
    9. Work drive (A-Z is allowed, rather than just A-D);
    10. Print level to use (1-4).

    Probably the best way to integrate CSORT3 into your applications 
program is via a batch file which will copy the appropriate parameter 
file from some other file to the file CSORT.DAT.  For example:
COPY BYNAME.PAR CSORT.DAT
will copy the parameter file BYNAME.PAR to the CSORT.DAT file used by 
CSORT level 3.  In this way, CSORT3 can be repeatedly invoked by a batch 
file, doing different sorts one after the other, producing any number of 
index files, and ending in any application desired.
    If you have any questions or problems with CSORT3, please call or 
write.

Sincerely,
