## Information about "PINBALL RALLY"

    Here is a disk for the pinball addict.  It has three games
    created using the program ``Pinball Construction Set,'' by Bill
    Budge.  The games vary in the level of difficulty but they are all
    interesting.  They include PINBALL, which is the standard pinball game;
    RAIN, is a more complicated game as it uses five pinballs at the same
    time; and TWILZON2, is perhaps the most difficult -- something for the
    Rod Serling fans.
    File Descriptions:
    
    RAIN     EXE  Pinball program with 5 balls!
    PINBALL  EXE  Program to execute a standard pinball game
    TWILZON2 COM  TWILIGHT ZONE pinball, a must for the pinball player
