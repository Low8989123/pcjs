## Information about "BUDGETRAK 2 OF 2 (ALSO 519)"

    BUDGETRAK is an accounting package for anyone who needs to track their
    budget and expenses more closely than is possible with an ordinary
    accounting system.  Encumbrance accounting (the method used here) tracks
    obligations and planned expenses rather than actual expenses.
    
    The system will handle up to budget records.  For simplicity, each
    month's transactions are stored on an individual file that can contain
    1200 transactions.  During the month you can look up account balances at
    any time instantly. You may print a report of the transactions entered
    to that point for the month or for any previous month.  The report is
    sorted and summarized by company, department and grand total.
    
    When the actual expense is known, it is entered and the encumbrance
    amount and budget are updated.  This gives a more accurate picture, for
    budgeting purposes, than waiting to record an actual expense.
    BUDGETRAK handles single and double-entry bookkeeping and has a built-in
    password system.

Disk No  519  BUDGETRAK  Version 1.21   (DISK 1 of 2)                v3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUDGETRAK is an excellent Encumbrance accounting package that would be of
interest to people working in the department of a large company who have a
desire to track their own budget and expenses more closely than possible
using the general information generally contained in a central accounting
system.  Encumbrance accounting tracks obligations and planned expenses
rather than actual expenses.  This is the first of a two disk set.
 
This package differs from a more standard accounting system in that when an
expense is anticipated, the estimated amount or encumbrance is entered.  The
entry is reflected in the remaining budget.  When the actual expense is known,
it is entered and the encumbrance amount and budget are updated.  This gives a
more accurate picture, for budgeting purposes, than waiting to record an
actual expense.
 
The system will handle both single and double entry systems and also produce
a 12 month spreadsheet.  Five balances are maintained: Budget, Variance,
Encumbrance, YTD Variance and Actual.  The coding reflects the program's intelligent design: 2 digit company code, 7 digit sub department and a 6
digit account code.  It can handle up to 999 master records and up to 12000
transactions per month.  The package has a password system and comes with a
set of utility programs and good documentation.  A high capacity floppy drive
or a hard disk is recommended for this package.

Program Description:
 
BUDGETRAK is an excellent Encumberance Accounting package of interest to
those people working in departments of larger organizations and interested
in tracking their own budgets and expenses more closely than possible with
the central accounting system.
 
Briefly how this differs from a regular accounting system is that when an
expense is anticipated, the estimated amount or encumberance is entered.
This is reflected in the budget remaining. When the actual expense is known
later then that is entered and the encumberance amount and budget are
updated. This gives a much more accurate picture than waiting for the
actual expense before recording it.
 
The system will handle both single and double entry systems and also
produce a 12 month spreadsheet.Five balances are maintained: Budget,
Variance, Encumberance, YTD Variance, Actual
 
The coding reflects the good design: 2 digit company code, 7 digit sub
department and a 6 digit account code. It can handle upto 999 master
records and upto 12000 transactions per month !
 
The package has a password system and comes with a set of utility programs
and good documentation.
 
You would most probably need a high capacity floppy drive or a hard disk to
effectively use this package.
