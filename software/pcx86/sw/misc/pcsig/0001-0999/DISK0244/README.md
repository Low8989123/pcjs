Program Title: sLide version 1.0
PC-SIG version 1.1
 
sLide is a computer program which can produce high quality slides and
overhead transparencies (both referred to as sLides). A sLide can be
created, edited, saved, displayed, and printed using the sLide
program. Overhead transparencies can be produced by copying the
printed output onto transparent material. Photographic sLides can be
produced by photographing the printed output.
 
Each sLide may contain up to 18 lines of up to 40 characters each. For
photographic slides, the number of lines should be limited to 15 in
order to fit a standard 35 mm slide. Experience shows that sLides can
be read easily by an audience when the amount of material on a sLide
is kept within these limits.
 
Usage: Business application
 
System Requirements: IBM PC or close compatible with Color graphics
                     adapter, 1 disk drive, Dos 2.0 or later.
 
How to Start: type SLIDE (return)

The purpose of this program is the production of medium quality
slides and overhead transparancies (both refered to as sLides). A
sLide is created, edited, saved, displayed, and printed using
this program.  Overhead transparancies are produced by copying
the printed output onto transparent material.  Photographic
slides are produced by photographing the printed output.


A single disk containing the sLide program, data files, and
documentation is available directly from the Author at a cost of
$7 to cover the disk, mailer, and mailing.
