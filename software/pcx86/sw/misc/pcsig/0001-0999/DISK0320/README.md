     PC-FASTYPE(Tm)                   Copyright 1990 Trendtech Corporation

                     Welcome to PC-FASTYPE/CGA Version 4.1
                     =====================================

          PC-FASTYPE/CGA is a typing tutorial program SPECIFICALLY designed
     for IBM-PC and PS/2 styled keyboards on computers running under
     MS-DOS.  The quick-start instructions below will get you going right
     away.

          PC-FASTYPE/CGA also requires COLOR.  You MUST have a
     Color/Graphics Adapter Card (CGA) or equivalent (EGA/VGA) on your
     computer or PC-FASTYPE/CGA won't work.

          If your PC is not equipped for color graphics display, then you
     should be using PC-FASTYPE/MONO which can be run on any PC without
     regard to the type of monitor attached.  It uses character-based line-
     graphics to simulate the screen keyboard display.  Contact us for more
     information about PC-FASTYPE/MONO.


     HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
          PC-FASTYPE/CGA is distributed on one 360KB 5.25" floppy, or one
     720KB 3.50" mini-floppy and requires the following minimum equipment
     to run properly:

          o  IBM PC, XT, PS/2, 286, 386, or IBM Compatible
          o  MS-DOS - All versions from 2.0 and up
          o  256KB Memory
          o  Color Graphics capability (CGA/EGA/VGA)
          o  1 Floppy disk drive; 3.5" or 5.25"
          o  Keyboard: either the 101-Key Enhanced with the bar-shaped
             enter key, or the AT-Style with the large L-shaped enter key.


     TO LOAD:
     From Floppy Disk Drive: Place the disk in drive A: and type:

            ENFT to start PC-FASTYPE/CGA with the 101-Key Enhanced keyboard
            ATFT to start PC-FASTYPE/CGA with the AT-Style keyboard

          followed by the ENTER key.  For example, the command:

                         A:> enft <enter>

          will start PC-FASTYPE/CGA from the A: floppy drive for the 101-
     Key Enhanced keyboard.


     Fixed Disk Drive: First create a sub-directory then copy the entire
     contents of the disk to the new directory. Change to the new directory
     and type ENFT or ATFT followed by the ENTER key.


     TO RUN:
          PRESS ANY KEY TO GET PAST THE TITLE SCREEN AND SHAREWARE
     INFORMATION SCREEN.  After these screens are displayed and the tables
     loaded, the Main Menu will be displayed.  The menu selector bar will
     be resting on the 'Begin Typing' selection.  Just press the Enter key
     or function key F10 to start a typing drill of the HOME keys.  To
     return to the Main Menu during typing,  press the Escape key.


     WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO:
          For DRILLS:  Place the fingers of each hand on the home keys
     (ASDF JKL;) and type each letter as you are prompted for it.  The
     program selects the letters randomly.  The number of characters you
     have to successfully type is displayed before you start.  When the
     drill is finished your WPM and other statistics will be displayed in
     the text panel.

          For EXERCISES:  lines of text will be displayed above the screen
     keyboard; type each character pointed to by the house-shaped cursor
     (⌂) and when you reach the  symbol or end of the line, press the
     enter key (for "carriage-return"), or the space bar.  When you finish
     typing the exercise your WPM and other statistics will be displayed in
     the text panel.


     SELECTING MENU ITEMS:
          Use the arrow keys (cursor keys) to move the menu selector bar up
     and down the menu.  Select the drill, exercise, or option by pressing
     the enter key when the item you want is highlighted by the menu
     selector bar.  You can use the function keys as a short-cut.


     WHILE RUNNING:
          MENUS:
            There are 5 drill, exercise, and feature selection menus and 3
            sub-menus for selecting additional keys to learn.  The primary
            menus can be displayed by pressing function keys F1 to F5
            anytime while the screen keyboard is displayed.

          <Esc>ape key:
            Pressing the Escape key anytime during a drill or exercise will
            cause the drill or exercise to terminate and your current WPM
            to be displayed; pressing the Escape key again will display the
            menu where you started the exercise.

          QuickHELP:
            ALL menus have the QuickHELP Facility available.  For all
            menus, the function key F1 is always the HELP key.  When you
            select HELP, a QuickHELP Facility  Menu will be displayed; the
            selector bar will rest on the item matching your help request.
            Follow the instructions given on the bottom of the menu.


     EVALUATION PERIOD:
          You are licensed to operate PC-FASTYPE/CGA on your PC for testing
     and evaluation as to its usefulness to you, on a trial basis for 30
     days.  We believe this to be a fair and equitable time period for
     evaluation and we trust your good judgement and sense of fair play in
     making a decision regarding registration.


     HERCULES:
          PC-FASTYPE/CGA will work on a PC equipped with a Hercules
     Monochrome Graphics Adaptor card IF you also use a Color Graphics
     (CGA) emulator program for the Hercules called "HGCIBM".   This CGA
     emulator program can be purchased from most disk vendors.  You can
     also purchase it from Trendtech Corporation for $10.00.  Just let us
     know when you register, and include the additional cost with your
     registration fee.


     OLD-STYLE PC KEYBOARD:
          If your PC is equipped with the older "classic" style PC
     keyboard, the one with the vertical ENTER key and the too-far-spaced
     shift keys, we have a keyboard display you can use with this version
     of PC-FASTYPE/CGA.  Let us know if you want this keyboard display, and
     include an additional $5.00 when you register.


     DOCUMENTATION:
          The PC-FASTYPE/CGA User Guide is included on this disk as a self-
     extracting 'ZIP' file.  This means the User Guide text has been
     'compressed' to save space on the disk.


     How To 'UN-COMPRESS' The User Guide:
          ZIP'd files can be 'un-compressed', or reconstructed without the
     need for special programs.   A self-extracting ZIP file is an
     executable file with a .EXE extension.  By simply typing in the name
     of the self-extracting ZIP file, the User Guide reconstruction process
     will be performed.  To view or print the PC-FASTYPE/CGA User Guide
     perform the following simple steps:


          1. Copy the file named FTDOC.EXE to your hard disk or
             to another floppy.  (If you try to uncompress the
             file on THIS disk you will run out of space.)
          2. Make that drive the default drive, and at the prompt
             type in the following command:

                         ftdoc <enter key>

             and the User Guide will extract itself into a
             printable, plain text document.
          3. You will now have a file called FASTYPE.DOC on your
             disk. Verify this by typing 'DIR FASTYPE.DOC' at the
             prompt.

          4. To print the User Guide on your printer, first make
             sure you have enough paper - the User Guide is about
             50 pages long.  Be sure your printer is turned ON,
             and the first page is positioned at top-of-form.
             Then type the following command at the prompt:

                    copy fastype.doc prn  <enter key>

          5. Your printer will print the PC-FASTYPE/CGA User
             Guide on about fifty pages of paper.


     INQUIRIES:
          Inquiries can be telephoned to (201) 694-8622; if there's no
     answer, please leave a message on the answering machine along with
     your name, address and daytime phone number, the version number of
     PC-FASTYPE/CGA you are using, and a short message.  You will be
     contacted with a reply.


     DATED SOFTWARE:
          If today's date is a year or more later than the file dates on
     this distribution disk than please contact Trendtech Corporation for
     information about the current version of PC-FASTYPE/CGA.  Shareware
     tends to "acquire a life of its own" once it's distributed; not all
     vendors will bother to acquire the latest version from the author.
     That is why you should buy Shareware from a disk vendor who is an
     authorized "Associate Member of the A.S.P."


     VIRUSES:
          You can only be sure of getting a top-quality virus-free version
     of any ASP Shareware product by obtaining your copy directly from the
     author, or from a disk vendor who is an Associate Member of the
     Association of Shareware Professionals, or from a reputable BBS
     service.  Be suspicious of any program you download from a BBS whose
     file dates or copyright notices are more than two years old; if it's a
     Shareware product, contact the author directly for information about
     current versions.


     TO PRINT THIS FILE:
          You can print this readme file to your printer by simply issuing
     the following MS-DOS command at the prompt:

          1. First insert the PC-FASTYPE/CGA disk in drive A.
          2. Then make sure your printer is turned on and the paper
             is set at top-of-form.
          3. Type:
                         COPY  A:README.TXT  PRN: <cr>

     This file provides information for bulletin board Sysops who wish
     to distribute PC-FASTYPE/CGA via their BBS systems.

     We explicitly permit uploads of the Shareware version of
     PC-FASTYPE/CGA to BBS systems.  Uploading the registered version is
     not permitted.  If you have any question as to whether the version
     which has been uploaded to your BBS is Shareware, simply run
     PC-FASTYPE/CGA and observe the title screen.  If the text to the
     right of the title screen says "Unregistered Evaluation Copy", and
     the next screen is the SHAREWARE INFORMATION screen, then it is the
     Shareware version. Anything else should be considered a registered
     version and discarded.

     Please note, if your BBS is associated with a commercial or user-
     group Shareware library which distributes disks for a fee, you must
     obtain permission in writing from Trendtech Corporation BEFORE
     placing PC-FASTYPE/CGA in the library.  See the file VENDOR.DOC for
     distribution details.  This restriction does not affect your
     permission to place PC-FASTYPE/CGA on your BBS as long as you are
     not charging a fee for its distribution. (other than normal user
     fees for general use of your board).

     ARCHIVING

          You can use any good quality archiving software to compress
     the PC-FASTYPE/CGA product.  We strongly recommend PKZIP from
     PKware,  especially since PC-FASTYPE's documentation file was
     compressed using PKSFX, which creates a self-extracting executable.

          Vendor standards expected of distributors will be forwarded for
     your  examination and agreement.  These standards are summarized in
     this  file.  The vendor standards are based on those established for
     vendor associate members of the Association of Shareware
     Professionals.  ASP vendor members will be granted permission to
     distribute PC-FASTYPE; if you are already a member of ASP, please
     mention it in your request for distribution.

          Vendors may only distribute the "Shareware Version" disks.  These
     disks are created specifically for disk vendors, BBS distribution,
     clubs, and resellers.  They can usually be identified by the words
     "Shareware Version" on the initial opening screen, and/or a Shareware
     message on the last screen.  Please note, these are NOT crippled
     versions of the program.  The ONLY difference between the "Shareware
     Version" disks and the fully registered version are the Shareware
     information screens and messages.





     You may distribute PC-FASTYPE products on the following terms:

     - PC-FASTYPE products,  when listed in vendors' catalogs,
       advertisements, brochures, mailers, etc. must be named "PC-FASTYPE"
       and not some other pseudonym like "Typing Tutor", "Touchtype",
       "Typing Teacher", or just "Fastype".  Use of any other name than
       "PC-FASTYPE" will constitute cause for revocation of vendor's
       distribution rights.

               Suggested names:
                    PC-FASTYPE/CGA - Typing Tutorial
                    PC-FASTYPE/MONO - Typing Tutorial

     - PC-FASTYPE/CGA, when listed in vendor's catalogs, advertisements,
       brochures, mailers, etc. must include the requirement for color
       graphics, usually expressed as "requires CGA".

     - PC-FASTYPE/MONO, when listed in vendor's catalogs, advertisements,
       brochures, mailers, etc. may optionally state it is the MONOCHROME
       version of PC-FASTYPE/CGA and will run on a PC equipped with ANY
       kind of monitor.

     - PC-FASTYPE products may NOT be sold as part of some other more
       inclusive package without the express written permission of
       Trendtech Corporation.

     - PC-FASTYPE products must not be distributed with other Shareware or
       public domain programs on the same floppy disk without permission
       from Trendtech Corp.  However, PC-FASTYPE may be included in
       libraries sold on CD-ROM disks.

     - Under no conditions will PC-FASTYPE products be "rented" or leased
       to others.

     - Printed copies of the exercise files and User Guide may not be
       distributed in any form without a license from Trendtech
       Corporation.

     - Any distribution of PC-FASTYPE products over bulletin boards and/or
       national  telecommunication services will be limited to distributing
       a single archived file containing the contents of the entire
       distribution disk and NO charge above the standard charge for
       connect time will be allowed.





     REGISTRATION:
          The SINGLE-USER Registration Fee for PC-FASTYPE is $25.00 in U.S.
     Funds.  Shipping and Handling is an additional $3.00 for domestic
     customers, $5.00 for Canada customers, and $10.00 for overseas

     VENDOR STANDARDS:

     The following is a summary of ASP vendor standards.  This summary is
     just that, a summary, and is not to be taken as a statement of the
     entire set of ASP standards.


     Advertising:

       All vendor advertisements and brochures must state that "Shareware
     programs require separate payment to authors if found useful."  This
     statement must immediately follow the price or be tied to the price
     via an asterisk.


     Catalogs:

       Vendors will attempt to educate users on the nature of Shareware.
     The  following points must be covered in any catalog of disks:

       -  The fee paid to the vendor is a copying and distribution charge
          and does not cover the cost of the program itself.

       -  If the user finds a Shareware program to be of use, he/she is
          expected to send the registration fee to the author.

       -  Registration entitles the user to various rights and benefits
          (depending on the author).  These range from the legal right to
          continue using the software, to printed documentation and/or
          higher levels of service.





     Distribution:

       -  Vendors will respect the copyright and all distribution
          restrictions made by individual authors, usually found in the
          file VENDOR.DOC [this file] on the disk.

       -  Vendors will provide a written notice covering the three concepts
          above with all Shareware programs shipped.  If disks are pre-
          packaged, the notice must be on a visible part of the package.

       -  Vendors will not change or delete ANY files supplied with the
          program unless authorized by the author.  Small additions
          designed to assist the user may be added if the author does not
          specifically prohibit such action.

       -  Vendors agree to stop distributing a program, including earlier
          versions, if requested by the author.

          Again, the above is a SUMMARY of the ASP vendor standards.  In
     order to distribute PC-FASTYPE products you must agree to abide by
     these standards whether you are an ASP member or not.  If you are
     interested in becoming an ASP-approved vendor, please contact:

                  Association of Shareware Professionals
                  Vendor Certification Committee
                  P.O. Box 5786
                  Bellevue, WA 98006


          We strongly recommend you consider becoming an ASP approved
     vendor if you have not already done so.  The ASP vendor member program
     reduces the workload for both authors and vendors alike, and helps
     give customers confidence that reasonable standards are met in the
     distribution of Shareware products.

                              =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

          To those organizations given permission to distribute PC-FASTYPE
     products, Trendtech Corporation will forward a Vendor Master
     Distribution disk.  Automatic updates will be provided to
     organizations when registrations can be traced to that organization.
     Updates will be offered to other approved organizations on a case-by-
     case basis.

          PC-FASTYPE/CGA and PC-FASTYPE/MONO are produced by Trendtech
     Corporation, a member of the Association of Shareware Professionals
     (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure the Shareware principle works for you.
     If you are unable to resolve a Shareware-related problem with an ASP
     member by contacting the member directly, ASP may be able to help.
     The ASP Ombudsman can help you resolve a dispute or problem with an
     ASP member, but does not provide technical support for members'
     products.  Please write to the ASP Ombudsman at P.O. Box 5786,
     Bellevue, WA 98006 or send a CompuServe message via Easyplex to ASP
     Ombudsman 70007,3536.
