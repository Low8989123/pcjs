## Information about "RBBS-PC 4 OF 5 (212,334,621,2092)"

    The RBBS is the bulletin board system of choice for many IBM PC
    bulletin boards. It's a large system on four disks and supports the
    PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD ROM.
    
    RBBS-PC's internal structure is modularized and structured. The
    program includes a File Management System for directories, additional
    file exchange protocols, support for managing subscriptions,
    configurable command letters, multiple uploads on a single command
    line, new A)nswer and V)erbose ARC list commands, and
    context-sensitive help. It also can run as a local application on a
    network, use any field or define a new field to identify callers, and
    individualize callers having the same ID. The source code is included.

Summary of Changes in RBBS 17.3
by Ken Goosens and Doug Azzarito
11 February 1990

Because of the MAJOR changes to the code, you MUST download the entire
source - no .MRG files will be made available.

Upgrading:

Persons running 17.2 need only

(1)    replace RBBS-PC.EXE and CONFIG.EXE

(2)    If you want file a)ll to list multiple physical directory
       files (as opposed to say just the FMS master file), then
       you must set up RBBS differently (see LISTALL.DOC for
       details).

(3)    Macros and SmartText have been significantly improved in 17.3.
       You no longer need to include a "{ST" at the end of macros and
       will probably want to omit it.   You may want to enhance your
       menus as well.   See SMARTTXT.DOC and MACROS.DOC.

(4)    You may want to make file searches faster and reduce the
       wear on your hard disk by installing the fast file search
       system.   See FFS.DOC.   To install this fast file search
       you will need to get a new utility program provided in
       RBBS-UTL.ZIP.

(5)    WARNING: you may find that your uploads and download are no
       longer being counted!!    This can occur if you turned on
       restricting downloads but exempted a security level.   Some
       sysops do this to get RBBS to track bytes up and down loaded,
       rather than to restict downloading.   To get RBBS to operate
       equivalently, you MUST CHANGE the PASSWRDS file.   If your
       RATIO, which is the 3rd parameter from the RIGHT, is 0 or
       nothing (",0," or ",,"), then you must change it to -1 in
       order for the code to work equivalently.   A ratio of 0 will not
       count any downloads.   This allows "free" periods of
       downloading to be specified, such as between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m.

(6)    Help has been restructured and you should replace the help files
       with those in the new RBBS-TXT.ZIP.   There are also new menus
       which you may want to consider using.   However, be careful NOT
       to replace your customized UPCAT.HLP.

Summary of Major Changes

(1)    ALL VARIABLES in RBBS-PC source has been changed.  This is
       the first step in an effort to make the RBBS-PC code more
       programmer friendly and to exploit the growing power of
       MicroSoft BASIC.  The file RBBS.REN gives a cross listing
       of old and new names.

(2)    Over 60 bugs/problems have been fixed.  The most
       significant are:

       (a) RBBS-PC can finally handle the midnight rollover.
           New functions are available that effortlessly handle
           any time calculation.

       (b) User record in memory was sometimes "lost"

       (c) Restricting session time for an external net mail
           event was lost after a door

       (d) Board would sometimes hang when message quoted had
           to be reformatted to fit the margins

       (e) Archive view function no longer hangs under QB 4.5.

(3)    Code was rewritten to be faster and generally smaller

(4)    Over 20 enhancements were added, of which the most significant
       are:

       (a) Search for a file's exitence on upload and download has
           been vastly speeded up.  Based on an indexed binary search
           of a sorted list of file names.   New utilities for
           installing this are included in RBBS-UTL.ZIP.

       (b) Data base function to forward search (jump to a line
           containing a particular string and continue from there)
           was added for all file and text displays

       (c) NEWS facility that automatically displays news since
           last on to callers

       (d) callers can now stack commands to virtually any depth, and
           stacking is consistently supported everywhere.

       (e) modem commands can be selected based on modem model.

       (f) Users may now FORWARD their mail to another user.  Sysops
           or users having sufficient security to edit a message
           can forward it to anyone as well as change anything in the
           message header.   See FWDMAIL.DOC for details.

       (g) The MSG header Security change now allows the sysop to change
           ANY field in the header.

       (h) When reading mail, the SYSOP can instantly edit the USER
           record of the message sender, then return to reading.

      request.

(2)   Timelock message now shows minutes & seconds left in time lock.

(3)   Command stacking now supported consistently and to virtually
      any depth

(4)   Autopage message less stiff and formal when caller notified that
      sysop wanted to know caller logged on.

(5)   Chat time given back when sysop initiates chat and no longer counts
      against session time

(6)   Conference name added to message header

(7)   Support for new ZIP imploded compression

(8)   NEWS facility added.  Special bulletin displayed automatically
      on logon when updated since user last on.

(9)   Message quoting first gives the edit command prompt but
      tells how to continue adding to a reply.

(10)  Default extension automatically added to uploads and downloads
      when no extension is specified

(11)  Forward search added to all directory displays and text file
      displays

(12)  Delays and embedded returns can be put into modem control
      strings.

(13)  Caller shown on welcome line if connection is reliable

(16)  Caller is informed when session time is shortened because of
      an external net mail event.

(17)  Can use "s" for since last listed on file N)ew command (e.g.
      "n s u" for list new files since last on in upload directory).

(18)  When replying to a message, will automatically continue if
      person sending mail to is not in the user's file, rather than
      asking the user whether wants to reenter name or continue.

(19)  Macro questions can have edits forcing answer to be one of a
      list or between two values.

(20)  Protocols to be used to download and upload can be specified
      anywhere in stacked command line rather than just on end.

(21)  File searches on up and downloads have been vastly speeded up.
      Makes a huge different on slow devices like CD-ROMs.  Also,
      have ability to trigger OFF LINE processing for files elsewhere.
      See UPDOWN.DOC.

(22)  Config gives option to set modem commands based on modem
      model.   Uses external file MODEMS.SET in default drive/path.
      Makes RBBS much easier to set up.

(23)  Sysops can now track UL/DL's and have a "free download" period.

(24)  Sysops can now explain exactly what a REGISTRATION EXPIRES
      means.  The HELP file RGXPIRE.HLP is seen when a user is warned,
      and RGXPIRD.HLP is seen when RBBS-PC reduces a caller's access.

(25)  Support for 38,400 baud, only thru Fossil driver.

(26)  Can have multiple extensions searched when trying to detect
      duplicate on upload (new config parm 169).

Supplemental Documenation for RBBS 17.3
Fast File Search
by Ken Goosens, 10-22-89

RBBS 17.3 has a signficant enhancement to the way searches for a requested
file are done in and upload and download.   This enhancement has two
big improvements:

(a)  File searches are much faster.  In the case of very slow devices like
     a CD-ROM, this can be the difference between sub-second response and
     a 45 second response.   File searches are now virtually instantaneous.

(b)  File not stored on this system can trigger macros.   This allows
     requests for files stored elsewhere, either off line on backups,
     or on other cooperating systems, to trigger later processing.


Fast File Searching

For directories DOS uses chained "buckets" in multiple locations, 
searched sequentially.   This results in very slow performance when
the number of files to search gets into the thousands.   RBBS now
supports a fast file search than more than compensates for the
inefficent operation in DOS.

The basis for the fast file search is a file, configuration
parameter 267, which is a sorted list of file names available for
downloading.    The default name is FIDX.DEF.

The format of this file is:

columns 1-12:  file name
columns 13-16: location index (1, 2, 3, ...)
columns 17-18: carriage return line feed.

All data is stored as character data and the file is editable.   The file
names must be stored with no internal spaces and a period separating the
prefix from the extension.   The list of file names MUST BE SORTED BY
FILE NAME in order for the fast file search to work.

The location index is the record number (line number) of the locator file,
whose default name is LIDX.DEF, and has the following layout:

columns 1-63:  location of file
column  64:    any character.  MAKEFIDX puts in a period.
columns 65-66: carriage return line feed.

This file is all character data and is editable.   Essentially, the location
index points to a record in the location file.   E.g. if FIDX.DEF has

RBBS-BAS.ZIP   2
HARPIE.ARC     3

and LIDX.DEF has

C:\DOWN1\
C:\DOWN2\
C:\UP\

Then RBBS-BAS.ZIP is located in directory C:\DOWN2 (2nd record) and 
HARPIE.ARC is located in C:\UP (3rd record).

The location field should be a drive/path terminating with a "\" if
any path is given, and file must be filled with blanks through column
63 if the path is shorter.  You must put some character in column 64.
Many editors delete trailing blanks, so you should probably put in
a non-blank.  A period is a suitable choice.

RBBS will use a binary search on the first 12 characters in FIDX.DEF.
This binary search can be significantly speeded by provided "tabs" for
this file, indicating the record at which the first file is that begins
with the symbols "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".   This is like
the "tabs" you see on dictionaries, so you can directly turn to the B's,
for example.   A tab file has the same prefix as the file name file,
except that it adds a "T".  For "FIDX.DEF", the tab file would be
"FIDXT.DEF".   RBBS will automatically detect and use a tab file if
available.   The tab has 72 characters in it.   Each 2 bytes represents
a binary integer whose value is the record number in FIDX.DEF where the
first file occurs that begins with the respective symbols above.  Thus
bytes 3-4 show where files begin with "1" and bytes 69-70 where files
begin with "Y".

Two utilities with source code are provided for setting up the fast file
searches.   The source, for compiling under QB 4.5, is included.

MAKEFIDX will create both the file name list (FIDX.DEF) and the
location file (LIDX.DEF), from a list of directories (see MAKEFIDX.CFG)
or a list of file names, or both.

You must next sort FIDX.DEF by file name.  A good shareware utility for
this is QSORT (QSORT FIDX.DEF /1:12).

MAKETABS will create a tab file (FIDXT.DEF) from the sorted file list
FIDX.DEF.

The batch file I use for recreating my fast file system is MAKEFFS.BAT.
It uses MAKEFIDX.EXE, QSORT.EXE, MAKETABS.EXE, and configuration file
MAKEFIDX.KG.   You need only edit MAKEFIDX.KG to change the filespecs
(/FileSpec=) to match where your files are, and where to write the
index files.


Reconfiguring to Take Maximal Advantage of Fast File Searches

The fast file search is virtually instantaneous on an 8088 with a tab
file for 5000 file entries.   The savings on wear and tear on the hard
disk can be very significant as well.   And the time it takes to set up
the fast file search is only a few minutes.  Most sysops, therefore, will
want to implment fast file searching, whether or not they have a slow
device like a CD-ROM.

RBBS will first search through the drive/paths specified in config
to be available for downloading, as it always did.   Files not found
there will then be searched using the fast file search system.
The way the fast file search works is that a file found in its list is
looked for only in the designated location.  Nothing else is searched.

The optimal way to implement fast file searching is to reconfigure the
drive/pathes available for downloading down to at most the upload
directory, and let the fast file search handle everything else.   That
way, files will be searched first in the upload area, and those not found
at first will then be searched using the fast file search system.
Note that every file in the fast file search list is considered
to be available for downloading whether or not its drive/path
is listed in the configuration program as a downloadable area.   Note
that you can have separate fast file search systems available for each
subboard, if desired.   You can also use the fast file search for common
files and have a separate download area for the subboards.

Note:  whenever you relocate files, you must re-create the fast file
search system.   This is not hard since it takes little time and can be
automated.

                        Help with Message Forwarding
                        ----------------------------

Have you ever received a message which you KNOW was intended for someone
else or would be better addressed to another person?   Have you ever
wished that you could edit that message and send it on to the correct 
person?  With Message Forwarding, you can!

If you are reading a message addressed to you, or if you are reading a message
which you have left, you will see a new option on the "message read" prompt.
It will now show:

    More [Y]es,N)o,C)ont,A)bort,R)eply,T)hread,=)again,+,-,F)wd,K)ill?

Notice the "F" command next to Kill?  When you select "F", RBBS will prompt
you with the standard "message to" prompt (e.g. "To [A]ll, (S)ysop, or name").
Indicate who you wish to forward this message to.  If you enter the name of a
user not currently registered in the conference you are logged into, RBBS will
warn you, but allow you to post the message anyway, if you wish.

Let's suppose your name is JOHN DOE and that you want to forward a message
sent to you by TOM THUMB about Turbo C to your friend SALLY BORLAND.  You
would read the message from Tom and select the "F" command.   When prompted
for a user name, you'd enter "SALLY BORLAND".  RBBS verifies that
she is a user in the current conference and asks you what protection you'd
like to assign the message (the standard "public, private, or password"
prompt).  Once you answer these two questions, RBBS copies the text of the
message left to YOU into the message editor and saves the message after you
confirm you want it forwarded.

You will also notice that at the TOP of the message, RBBS has thoughtfully
provided a tag line of:

    Msg was to JOHN DOE, forwarded to you by JOHN DOE

This will avoid confusing Sally by making it clear to her that it was
forwarded, who it was to, and who referred the message to her.
This line CANNOT be edited or removed.   The forwarded is given the
opporunity to edit the forward message.   Good edits would be to reduce it
to the parts needed, or to add an additional comment.  Poor edits would
be to change the meaning or content of the message -- but remember, the
tag line at top says who forwarded the message, so alternation of the
forwarded message is traceable back to the person doing the forwarding.

If the msg being forwarded was from you, you can not only address it
to another person but fully edit the message as well.   Simply
edit the message as normal, and save it as you usually would save a message.
RBBS then re-displays the original message header, which allows you to do
whatever you wish with it (perhaps deleting the original message makes the
most sense).

SysOp's Note:  If you have sufficent security to change the mininum security
to read the message, you can forward ANY and ALL messages.

## JUMP.DOC

New JUMP Feature of RBBS
by Ken Goosens

17.3 has a new "jump" feature in its display of text files (e.g.
bulletins) and file directories.   A "jump" into a file means basically
to skip forward to a point, then resume displaying as before.
A jump is basically a search based on a substring.   Whereas
the file search command reports all and only the lines containing
the search string, and jump stops as soon as it hits a line with
the substring and resumes whatever listing was in place from
that point on.   For example, if the file being searched contains

this is line 1
this is line 2
and this is line 3
but this is the next to last
and the very last

and you are positioned just above these lines, then a jump to
"and" will put you on the third line.   Whereas in a file directory,
a "search" for "this" would display only the 3rd and 4th lines.

The user is offered the option to "J)ump" whenever it is operative.
Once a jump is defined, the user also has the option to "R)ejump
based on the same text (which is displayed).

The jump feature is very valuable in bulletins.  For example, if
you list each bbs's sorted by state, the caller by jump to the top
of the listing of any state.   Or jobs, or items for sale, whatever.

The jump within file directories is most valuable when the directories
are not sorted by date.  E.g. alphabetically, or by subject.  Often
we remember the context we saw a file in, but not the name.  Jump
lets you go to any remembered context.   After a jump, the directory
listing resumes as it was before, whether just a listing, or substring
search, or new file search.   The jump applies to both FMS directories
and non-FMS.   FMS searches have the advantage that the found string
is highlighted if the user preference has highlighting on.

Listing A)ll File Directories
by Ken Goosens
12 October 1989

RBBS 17.3 changes how a request for A)ll directories is handled in
the F)ile N)ew, L)ist, and S)earch commands.   The setup for 17.3
must be changed if it is to run equivalently to earlier versions.
Prior to 17.3, 

o   the directory specified in config parm 218 would be searched,
    if specified

o   otherwise, the directory of directories (DIR.DIR) would be parsed
    for directory names.

17.3 changes the "otherwise" condition.   Now, by beginning config
parm 218 with "@", it will be interpreted as a list of directory names
to use, containing each name on a separate line.

Note:  if you want the "all" to go thru a list of directories, rather
than one specifically, i.e. you are NOT limiting direcrtory searches
to the FMS master directory, then you must

o   change directory parm 218 to a new file, e.g. "ALLDIR.LST", that
    has in it the directory names to use.  E.g. if you want 
    all to include directories GAMES, UTILS, and GRAPHICS, then
    the parameter value would be "@ALLDIR.LST" and file ALLDIR.LST 
    would contain the 3 lines

                         GAMES
                         UTILS
                         GRAPHICS

    Note:  directories will be listed in the order specified.

## MACROS.DOC

{% raw %}
```
Documentation for Macros
by Ken Goosens 17 OCTOBER 1989

Macros in 17.3 have 3 major enhancements that now let them assign
a value to a work variable, edit answers to questions, and
contrain the context in which a macro operates.


                  Macro Assignment

Work variables can be assigned a value inside a macro.  The command
to do this is ":=".  E.g. "{:= 5 OK" assigns string "OK" to work
variable 5.

                   Macro Edits

Questions in macros can now have edits on the answers:  the edits
can constrain the answer to

o    one of a list

o    a numeric value between two values

o    a character value between two values

An editing constraint must be put in front of the actual macro
question it applies to, and a contraint applies only to the next
question and does not remain operative.

The commands for these are respectively "LV" (List Verify), "NV"
(Numeric Verify), and "CV" (Character Verify).  The list verify uses
the first character after the command as a delimitor between valid
responses.  E.g. "{LV;R;A;E;" means that only "R", "A", and "E" will
be accepted as answers ("{LV/R/A/E/" would have the same effect).
Semi-colon is the best delimitor in general because it cannot be
entered as a value.

Between checks are always inclusive.  Thus "{NV 9 11" will accept only
9, 10, or 11.  The numeric value must be an integer between -32,768 and
32,767.   To accept answers B-E, the macro edit command is
"{CV B E".

Whenever an answer fails an edit, the message "Invalid answer <...>"
is given with the answer recieved between brackets, and the question
is asked again.  An example of a macro with edits is:

4
{*1 Verification macro
{*1 now checking list...
{LV;A;F;W;
{01 Enter A, F, or W
{*1 now testing numeric range...
{NV 5 15
{01 Enter a number between 5 and 15
{*1 now testing character range...
{CV D J
{01 Enter a character between D and J


                   Constraining a Macro

Macros have been revised in RBBS 17.3 to allow the macro
to be constrained where it is operative, including

o   anywhere inside a section

o   anywhere inside a command

o   only at a section and not inside.

The constraint is governed by an extra parameter to the 1st line
in a macro file.   The new format is:

              <SecLevel>/<constraint>

where <SecLevel> is the minimum security required to run the
macro, and <constraint> is the section (M for main, F for
file, U for utility, or @ for library) and command letter the
macro is confined to (use original command letter, not the
reassigned ones).   For example

                4/M

means that security level 4 is required, and the macro runs only
at or inside the main section prompt.

                5/MB

means that security level 5 is required and the macro runs only at
or inside the main section bulletin command.  Thus the macro file 1.mcr

                2/MJ
                {EN
                PCB

means that when inside the main J)oin, the macro "PCB" will be
substituted for "1".  (So "J 1" does the work of "J PCB".)  The
"{EN" means not to echo what the macro substitutes (user does
not see "PCB").

To make a macro be operative only at a section prompt and not inside,
add a " /" to the end of the section constraint.  For example,

                 4/M /

means that the macro applies only at the main section prompt.  For
example, the macro SP.MCR

                 4/M /
                 {EN
                 J SEMIPRV

will substitute "J SEMIPRV" for "SP" when at the main prompt, but NOT
for "SP" inside the message read command ("R SP L").
                 
Note:  a macro will be ignored if it's name is the same as a command
symbol.  Hence to use 1, 2, 3, etc. for macro commands, you must
disable or substitute other symbols for the sysop commands.

## MODEM.DOC

{% raw %}
```
Documentation on New Modem Controls
by Ken Goosens, 22 Sept 89

RBBS 17.3 gives the sysop greater control over modem strings.
The modem strings can now have two special characters:

{  for an embedded carriage return
~  for a one second delay

E.g.  "~ATZ{" will wait one second, send "A", then "T", then "Z",
then carriage return, followed by a final carriage return (all modem
commands have a final carriage return added by RBBS).

The new control strings allow the sysop to finely tune the modem
controls.   Two new types of applications are possible:

o   Speed modem processing.

RBBS has a config parameter, time to delay between modem commands,
which is an inserted delay before every modem modem command.   This
can now be set to 0, and the tilde be used to individually control
any delays.   This generally allows the delays to be reduced to
speed up recylcing.

WARNING:  modems are very sensitive to timing.  Experiment carefully
with only change at a time if you want to optimize your modem processing.

o   Prevent modem problems.

Some modems, especially US Robotics modems, including the Courier and
HST, will get into a confused state where they refuse to respond to
further modem commands, when a ring occurs right in the middle of
a modem command.   Ever so often you will find them never answering
with the wrong lights on, and you have to turn the power off and back
on to get the modem working right again.  This problem can be eliminated
by adding an extra carriage return on the end of every modem string.

WARNING:  other modems, such as some Everex modems, will not answer
the phone properly if modem strings are followed by an extra carriage
return.

(1)  Callers are now informed when their time is shortened for
     a net mail event.   Before, caller received less time than
     normal with no explanation.

(2)  Shortened session time for net mail event now remains in
     effect even when come back from a door.   Before, caller
     back from a door received a normal allotment of time,
     sometimes causing netmail events to be missed.

(3)  Config is clearer about net mail installation.   Before,
     implied that RBBS invoked net mail.   Now, clear than net mail
     is front end that invokes RBBS.

(4)  No longer prompted to re-enter or continue when replying to a
     message and person receiving mail not found.   Automatically
     continues.   Still informs sender that caller not here and
     still prompts when entering new message.

## NEWS.DOC

{% raw %}
```
Supplemental Documentation for NEWS
by Ken Goosens, 5 Sept 89

NEWS is a new feature in RBBS 17.3, based on work done by Lee Pollard.

Every conference can have a news file, which is displayed
automatically on logon if the news file has been updated since
the caller was last on.   On turbo logon, the caller
is only told that news has been updated but the news is not
displayed.   News can be viewed anytime using the N)ews option in
B)ulletins.  To read all new bulletins, the command is no longer
N but instead *.   Special note:  the news bulletin will NOT be
automatically included in the scan of all new bulletins.   You can
control exactly what files are included using * by putting in a file
called BULLET.FCK, which simply lists, one to a line, what files are
checked.  The control file expects to have the bulletins named
as the caller would type them, so, for example, "1" for bulletin 1,
or "N" for the new files check.

The news file is then like a special, named bulletin, but the
name of the file is based not on the bulletin prefix but instead on
the conference name.   Where XYZ is the name of the conference,
the news file for it is XYZ.NWS.   The news file should be placed in
the same drive/path as the conference welcome file, and will be
displayed after the welcome.  If the main message base is called
MESSAGES, the news file is MAIN.NWS.   The news file supports
graphics versions (XYZC for color graphics, XYZG for ascii graphics,
and XYZ for text).

There are sysop utilities which help considerably to manage such a
news files.   A shareware product that does this very well is the
shareware product FLASH.  It will

o   let you create, store, and edit news items by conference

o   rebuild both a color graphics and text version anytime, putting
    the news items in date order.

o   formats the message very nicely, with date, header, body, and,
    if desired, emulates a "news printer" spewing out the latest
    copy on tractor fed paper.

Unfortunately, FLASH will not automatically create an ASCII version
based on the IBM display characters, only a color graphics (C) and
text version (no extension to prefix).

The news file is best used for a series of dated, short news items
about the board (on logon) or the conference.   The items should be
ordered from newest to oldest, since the file is displayed from top
to bottom.    A sample format, with date, headline, and body, is:

---[ 09-05-89    NEWS FEATURE ADDED ]---

RBBS 17.3 now supports NEWS.  The news file is displayed on logon
if the news file has been updated since the caller was last one.
To view the news anytime, go into B)ulletins, and ask for N)ews.
To view all bulletins that have changed, use the "*)all new"
command.


---[ 09-01-89    MORE POWERFUL STACKING ]---


RBBS now lets you stack virtually any command to any depth.  For example,
"J GAMES R S" will join the GAMES conference and read all new mail since
last on.   Expert users who know what prompts are coming can thus
"preanswer" the question by stacking answers on the same line and avoid
even seeing the question.  Try it!

## SMARTTXT.DOC

{% raw %}
```
Documentation for SmartText for 17.3
by Doug Azzarito
19 November 1989

The following Smart Text codes have been added to RBBS-PC 17.3

BN  - Returns the BBS name as specified in CONFIG.
FS  - Returns the SYSOP FIRST NAME in Proper Case.
LS  - Returns the SYSOP LAST NAME in Proper Case.
ND  - Returns the NODE NUMBER of the current node (1-36)
TY  - Turns TRIM ON
TN  - Turns TRIM ON
VY  - Turns oVerlay ON
VN  - Turns oVerlay OFF

TRIM:
       This option controlls the trim of leading AND trailing
       spaces from Smart Text variables.  If Trim is NOT on, and you
       use the Smart Text "Is {CT far away?", RBBS-PC would return:
          Is Yourtown, State                far away?
       If TRIM was on, it would become: Is Yourtown, State far away?
       All NAME fields (SYSOP and USER) are ALWAYS trimmed.  Remember,
       if you turn TRIM ON, it will stay on until you either recylcle the
       node, or you send a TRIM OFF command.

OVERLAY:
       This option controls if Smart Text variables should OVERLAY the
       text, or be inserted into the text.  When designing ANSI screens,
       you will usually want Smart Text to OVERLAY.  This example illustrates:
       THE TIME IS {TM   (EST)             <- original text
       THE TIME IS 11:47   (EST)           <- overlay OFF
       THE TIME IS 11:47 (EST)             <- overlay ON

       When you leave enough space for the Smart Text substitution, you
       should turn overlay ON.  Remember, with TRIM ON, you may not be able
       to determine how much space to allocate.  Turn TRIM OFF when using
       OVERLAY to be sure.  As with TRIM, The status of OVERLAY is not
       reset until you do so.  The default setting for OVERLAY is OFF.

Examples of RBBS menus that use TRIM and OVERLAY are the files MENU2
and MENU2C.  An alternative set of graphical menus with "shading" and
a status line is included as MENU2C.CS, MENU3C.CS, and MENU4C.CS.  The
code and the alternative menus were contributed by Carl Slaughter.

Note:  overlay controls whether the trim and overlay variables are
blanked out (overlay) or removed from a line of text.  The line

123{TR45

would be "123   45" if overlay is on, and "12345" if overlay were off.

RBBS & ZIP
by Ken Goosens
24 May 1989

RBBS 17.3 supports any file library and compression technique just as
well as ARC, provided you have enough memory to support shelling.

If you want to set up RBBS to support ZIP, do the following:

(1)  set the default extension to ZIP in config.

(2)  where you say in config to look for command.com, put in
     TZIP.BAT.  Be sure to put PKUNZIP.EXE in the path as well.
     This will verify the integrity of uploads at the time of
     upload.   The file TARC.BAT is provided as well, to verify
     that ARCed uploads are fine too.  It assumes that you
     are using PKUNPAK.EXE.

(3)  RBBS will disallow an upload not having the default extension
     if a file exists with the same prefix and the default extension.
     This should eliminate duplicates.   E.g. SORT232.ARC would be
     rejected because we have a ZIP version if ZIP is default and
     there is a file called SORT232.ZIP.

(4)  You cause uploads with extension <u-ext> to be converted to
     default extension <d-ext> by including where command.com a
     file named C<u-ext><d-ext>.BAT, which RBBS will shell to.
     The upload will be converted immediately at the time of
     upload and will be added to the directory under the converted
     name and file size.

     Included in the utilities is are 3 BAT files for converting:

     CARCZIP.BAT - convert ARC to ZIP.  Put in drive/path of
        command.com specified in Config.   Change the 4th parameter
        to the drive/path where your uploads go.  Make sure
        PKUNPAK.EXE is in your search path.

     CPAKZIP.BAT - convert PAK to ZIP.  Same directions as
        for CARCZIP.BAT.  Make sure PAK.EXE is in your drive
        path.

     CALLZ.BAT - bat file other 2 invoke.  Makes work directory
        using node name off of upload directory, extracts files
        into it, zip's all files from there into your upload
        directory, deletes old file, deletes work directory.
        Uses KDY.EXE which deletes files and directory without
        requiring confirmation.  Resets errorlevel to 0 at
        end.

The bat files take under 100K.

The BAT files assume that you have a directory C:\RBBS that it
can use as a work area.   In CPAKZIP.BAT and CARCZIP.BAT you can
edit this to whatever you wish.

(5)  RBBS will work properly with Smith's ZIPTV.EXE, which supports
     viewing not only a list of the files in a ZIP, but viewing text
     files inside the zip as well.   The new VZIP.BAT distributed
     works with ZIPTV.

Extended Protocol Configuration
-------------------------------

  Protocol Name

     This entry is the "name" for the protocol.  It is displayed in  the
     protocol menu, and before any transfer in the protocol.

  Menu Code

     This is the menu letter used to identify the protocol.

  Trans / Recv

     Enter a "T" here if the protocol "transmits" data to the user  (i.e.
     download protocols).  Enter a "R" if the protocol  "receives" data
     from the user (i.e. upload protocols).

  File Specs

     This entry controls the number of filespecs that are allowed  with
     the protocol.  There are a few special cases to consider:

         File specs          Meaning
             1       The protocol is "non batch".  A full filename is
                     passed to the driver program.

             0       The protocol is "automatic batch".  Use this  only
                     with batch "receive" protocols that get the
                     filenames from the caller's end of the transfer.

             2..9    These numbers allow the user to specify a  variable
                     number of "filespecs".  A filespec may  contain
                     wildcards, resulting in up to 100 files in a given
                     batch.   If the protocol must have  the filenames on
                     the command-line, a value of 2  or 3 is generally the
                     limit.  Protocols that  don't specify every name may
                     use values up to 9.   See the Command Line section
                     for more  information on this.

  Estimated Efficiency

     This entry is used to estimate how efficient a given protocol is  at
     sending or receiving data.  Legal values range from 0 to  0.99.  The
     value 0.0 is a special case.  When you specify 0.0,  the door will
     allow any size transfer to START, but will hang up  on the caller
     when his time runs out.  Use this for "Zmodem  Resume", or other
     protocols where you cannot predict how long it  will take to finish a
     transfer.

  Command Line

     This entry is the "command line" used to call up the protocol
     driver.  It must be entered exactly as if you were calling up  the
     driver from a DOS prompt.   There are a few special cases on  the
     command line:

            Entry               Meaning

             $B$     This is replaced with the caller's connect  speed, or
                     baud rate.
  
             $N$     This is replaced with the COM port number in  use.
  
             $@$     This is replaced with '@c:\pcb\$door.nam', which
                     refers to a file that will list the names of the
                     individual files to be transmitted.  This  feature is
                     only valid for DSZ versions 880423 or  later.  Use
                     this to allow more than 3 filespecs  per transfer.
  
             *.*     This causes ProDoor to copy all of the selected
                     files into the "playpen" directory prior to  starting
                     the transfer.  The door then instructs  the protocol
                     driver to send "all" files from the  playpen.  Use
                     this to allow more than 3  filespecs on any
                     batch-compatible protocol.   Because of all the disk
                     activity involved in  copying the files, I recommend
                     you use this  option only if you have a RAM DISK for
                     your  playpen.

Extract from RBBS-PC v17.1A  Documentation Dealing with External Protocols

21.  RBBS-PC's STANDARD INTERFACE FOR PROTOCOL DRIVERS
------------------------------------------------------

Before calling "external" protocol drivers, RBBS-PC will do the following:

    1. verify that the file exists if the file is to be downloaded.
    2. for uploads, verify that the file name requested is  valid.
    3. pass  the  communications  port  to  the  vendor's  protocol-
       handling routine with the file opened and carrier detect on.

RBBS-PC  will  call  the  external protocol drivers either  via  the  SHELL
command in BASIC or via a .BAT file.

21.1  Parameters passed to a protocol driver.
----------------------------------------------
RBBS-PC detects the installation of external file transfer protocols via an
optional  RBBS-PC system file whose default name is PROTO.DEF.  If no  such
file  exists,  all and only internal protocols will  be  available -- Ascii,
Xmodem, XmodemCRC, Ymodem.  This file may be used to rename or delete  some
or all of RBBS-PC's internal protocols.  If a PROTO.DEF file exists, all of
RBBS-PC's  internal  protocols must be specified in it as  well.   Internal
protocols are NOT automatically included when a PROTO.DEF file exists!

The  protocol definition file has thirteen (13) parameters passed for  each
external  protocols  defined  for  RBBS-PC.  Each parameter  can  be  on  a
separate  line  of  its own or all parameters can be on  a  single  line  (
separated  by commas).  The parameters passed for each  protocol  specified
are:

          Parameter       Description
          1      Protocol Name
          2      Security Level required to use protocol
          3      Method to invoke protocol
          4      Whether 8 bit connection required
          5      Whether "reliable" connection required
          6      Whether "batch" mode supported
          7      Number of bytes in a block transferred
          8      Indicate transfer always successful
          9      Factor to estimate file transfer time
         10      RBBS-PC "macro" to invoke before protocol
         11      Method for checking transfer's success
         12      Template to use for downloading
         13      Template to use for uploading

* 1      Protocol Name
Protocol  Name   --  The FIRST CHARACTER is the letter by  which  a  caller
    selects  the  protocol.     The prompt for the  selection  of  protocol
    includes  the  protocol  name.   It  is  recommended  that  the  second
    character  be ")" to resemble the rest of the prompts in RBBS-PC,  e.g.
    "Z)modem".  RBBS-PC defaults to putting each protocol on the same line,
    separated  by  a comma, until the line gets too long.  Each  SYSOP  can
    control  the  placement of the line by putting a carriage  return  line
    feed  at  the end of the protocol name.  If this is  done,  the  entire
    protocol  name  must be in parentheses.  For example,  instead  of  the
    prompt

A)scii,X)modem,C)rcXmodem,Y)modem,N)one

a SYSOP may want the prompt to be

A)scii (text files only)
X)modem checksum
C)rc Xmodem
Y)modem (1K Xmodem)
N - None (cancel)

    Then  the protocol definition file , PROTO.DEF, should  be  constructed
    using  quotes  (to include the carriage return/line feed in  the  first
    parameter) as follows:

"A)scii (text files only)
",...
"X)modem checksum
",...
"C)rc Xmodem
",...
"Y)modem (1K Xmodem)
",...
"N - None (cancel)
",...

    with the remaining 12 parameters put where "..." occurs.

* 2      Security Level required to use protocol
Security  Level  --  This is the minimum security to be  able  to  use  the
    protocol being described.

* 3      Method to invoke protocol
Method  to  Invoke Protocol -- A protocol can be invoked by  one  of  three
    methods:
             shell,
             door, or
             internal (S, D, or I).
    If  "I"  is  specified, it must be immediately  followed  by  a  letter
    specifying  what internal protocol to use, where the choices are A,  X,
    C, Y, or N respectively for Ascii, Xmodem, Xmodem CRC, Ymodem, or  None
    (cancel  transfer).  "IC" would mean to use RBBS-PC's  internal  Xmodem
    CRC.   If no protocol is specified equivalent to the  internal  "None",
    RBBS-PC will add it.  If the letter N is used for a transfer  protocol,
    another protocol must be specified that is equivalent to "None".

* 4      Whether 8 bit connection required
Whether to Require 8 Bit -- By putting "8" in this parameter, the SYSOP  is
    specifying that the protocol requires the caller to be able to send  or
    receive 8 data bits.  If 8 data bits is required and the caller is  not
    at 8 bit, RBBS-PC will prompt the caller to change to 8 bit in order to
    use the protocol.

* 5      Whether "reliable" connection required
Whether  A  Reliable  Connections Is Required -- By  putting  "R"  in  this
    parameter, the SYSOP is specifying that the protocol will not be  shown
    or  made  available to the caller unless the  connections  is  reliable
    (i.e. such as Microcom's MNP protocol that is built into many modems).

* 6      Whether "batch" mode supported
Whether  Support  Batch -- By putting "B" in this parameter, the  SYSOP  is
    indicating  that "batch" file transfers are allowed with the  protocol.
    "Batch" means a multi-file download request will be processed together.
    The  receive function in Qmodem's "batch" Ymodem attempts to write  the
    file  being  received to the same letter drive and path name as  it  is
    stored  on the sending PC.  Because it is unlikely that the PC  running
    RBBS-PC will have the same disk letters and path names as the  callers,
    it  is  recommended  that  QMODEM's "batch"  Ymodem  not  be  used  for
    receiving files via "batch" Ymodem (use DSZ's instead).  RBBS-PC enters
    an external protocol only once to do multiple file downloads.   RBBS-PC
    has been tested with such "batch" protocols as Zmodem's DSZ,  Megalink,
    and Sealink.

* 7      Number of bytes in a block transferred
Blocksize  --  This parameter indicates the number of bytes in  each  block
    transferred.   This  is only used to inform the caller  the  number  of
    blocks  to  expect when downloading.  A zero in  this  parameters  will
    cause RBBS-PC to report only the number of bytes to expect.  For Xmodem
    or  XmodemCRC this value would be 128.  For Ymodem this value would  be
    1024.

* 8      Indicate transfer always successful
Indicate Transfers Always Successful -- If there is no way for the protocol
    to  inform  RBBS-PC  if a transfer was successful, put a  "F"  in  this
    parameter.   This  means  that  all  transfers  will  be  regarded   as
    successful.

    Zmodem (DSZ) used in a multi-tasking DOS environment (i.e. where  there
    can only be a single environment) and CLINK are examples of a protocols
    that require this to be set.

* 9      Factor to estimate file transfer time
Factor to Estimate File Transfer Time -- This is the decimal number used by
    RBBS-PC to estimate the elapse time to download a file. The higher  the
    number,  the  faster  the protocol and the  lower  the  time  estimate.
    Standard equivalents in RBBS-PC are:

     Ascii .........  0.92
     Xmodem ........  0.78
     XmodemCRC .....  0.78
     Kermit ........  0.78
     Ymodem ........  0.87
     Imodem ........  0.90
     YmodemG .......  0.95
     Windowed xmodem  0.78

    If no value is specified, a default of 0.87 will be used.

* 10      RBBS-PC "macro" to invoke before protocol
RBBS-PC  "Macro" to Invoke Before Protocol -- This is the  RBBS-PC  "macro"
    (i.e. a series of standard RBBS-PC commands) to invoke before  invoking
    the protocol.  It can be used to display special messages, to delay the
    start  of the protocol, or to prompt for special information passed  to
    the protocol.

* 11      Method for checking transfer's success
Method  for  Checking  Transfer's  Success -- This  is  required  only  for
    external protocols.  This parameter indicates how RBBS-PC is to  detect
    a file transfer's failure.  The format is "x=y=z" where:

           x is which parameter tells whether the transfer was successful,
           y is the string which indicates failure, and
           z is an optional parameter telling RBBS-PC whether to write out
             information needed when DOORing to a protocol in advance of
             the file exchange.

    For  QMXFER.EXE from John Friel and the Forbin Project, this  would  be
    "4=F"  - meaning the 4th parameter indicates failure if it begins  with
    "F".

    For  Zmodem  as  implemented in DSZ from  Omen  Technologies,  the
    proper  choice  depends on whether SHELLing or  DOORing  is  used.
    For  SHELLing, put in "1=E"  to indicate that the first  parameter
    uses  "E" to indicate an error has occurred.  For DOORing, put  in
    "4=E=A"  to indicate that the fourth parameter uses "E"  an  error
    has  occured.   The "=A" means that RBBS-PC is to  do  an  advance
    write  of  the filename and protocol used.  DSZ then  appends  its
    error  report to the log file.   To the file "XFER-" plus  node  #
    plus   ".DEF"   RBBS-PC   will  write  out   a   line   containing
    "<filename>,,<protocol letter>".  Omitting an "=" causes a default
    to  "4=F".  The file checked is "XFER-" plus the node number  plus
    the extension "DEF".   On node 1 the file checked is "XFER-1.DEF".

* 12      Template to use for downloading
Template  to  Use  for Downloading -- This is required  only  for  external
    protocols.   It  tells  RBBS-PC  how to invoke  a  download.   See  the
    following section on discussion of "templates".

* 13      Template to use for uploading
Template  to  Use  for  Uploading -- This is  required  only  for  external
    protocols.  It tells RBBS-PC how to invoke an upload.

21.2  Calling external protocols using "templates"
--------------------------------------------------
A "template" is used to inform RBBS-PC how to invoke an external  protocol.
The  first  word  of the template must be the  file  name  (including  file
extension) of the program to invoke.  RBBS-PC will check to make sure  that
the file exists.  If the file does not exits, the protocol will not be made
available  to  the caller.  If the file does exists, the protocol  will  be
shown to the caller.

RBBS-PC will dynamically substitute values for pre-defined strings inside a
"template".   Each  supported string is enclosed in square  brackets.   The
strings supported include:

[n]       where  n is a positive integer.  Substitutes value in  the  array
          A$,  which can best be viewed as a work array.  Macros can  store
          prompted values in specific elements in the array.

[FILE].   Name of the file (FILE.NAME$) to be transferred.

[BAUD].   Baud rate.  Speed at which the caller dialed RBBS-PC.

[PARITY]. Parity used by the caller.

[PORT].   DOS  device name for the communications port to be used  for  the
          file transfer (COM1,COM2, etc.).

[PORT#]   Number  of  the  communications  port to be  used  for  the  file
          transfer (1,2,3, etc.).

[NODE].   Number  of  the RBBS-PC node invoking the file  transfer  (1,2,3,
          etc.).

[PROTO].  Letter of the protocol for the file transfer.

Everything else in a template will be passed intact.  If the external  file
transfer is to be invoked via a SHELL, it is recommended that the  external
file  transfer  program  be  SHELLed to directly.   If  the  external  file
transfer is to be invoked via a DOOR, it can be either

     1.)  DOORed to directly using the same template as for SHELLing, or

     2.)  DOORed to indirectly via a .BAT file with the command  parameters
          passed to it by RBBS-PC.  For example, a "door" for QMXFER  might
          have a download template of:

          "RBBSQM.BAT [FILE] [PORT] [BAUD] [PROTO]"

          and the file RBBSQM.BAT have the following in it:

          C:QMXFER.COM -s -f %1 -l %2 -c -b %3 -p %4

          DOS substitutes the passed parameters for the variables beginning
          with  the percent sign.  .BAT files are needed in doors if  there
          are  additional programs to run before or after the  actual  file
          transfer.

The  following  examples should provide some help in understanding  how  to
invoke external protocols:

Example #1:

Z)ippy,5,S,8,,,,,0.98,,,"c:\proto\zippy -s [FILE]","c:\proto\zippy -r [FILE]"

Can be interpreted to be:
     used "Z" as invoking letter,
     put "Z)ippy" in the prompt,
     the minimum security to use this protocol is 5,
     the protocol will be invoked via a SHELL command,
     an 8-bit connection is required,
     estimate the download time as 0.98 times as fast as normal,
     use normal RBBS-PC type of report to check for a successful transfer,
     invoke the protocol for downloads using the following string:
          "c:\proto\zippy -s [FILE]"
     and invoke the protocol for uploads using the following string:
          "c:\proto\zmodem -r [FILE]"
     where the file name is substituted for "[FILE]" in either case.

Example #2:

X)modem,5,IX,8,,,128,,0.8,,,,

Can be interpreted to be:
     used "X" as invoking letter,
     put "X)modem" in the prompt,
     the minimum security to use this protocol is 5,
     the protocol is an internal RBBS-PC protocol,
     an 8-bit connection is required, and
     estimate the download time as 0.8 times as fast as normal.

21.3  Parameters Returned by a Protocol Driver
----------------------------------------------
All  protocol  drivers are expected to return information  about  the  file
transfer in a file named XFER-xx.DEF where the value for xx is the node  ID
(1 to 36).  If the protocol cannot accommodate this minimal requirement, it
can still be used by telling RBBS-PC to indicate file transfers are  always
successful -- section 21.1, parameter 9.

The  one  item  of  information RBBS-PC requires to  be  returned  from  an
external protocol drive is whether or not the file transfer was successful.
The failure indicator MUST BE:

   a.)  the first character of
   b.)  any parameter

in the file XFER-xx.DEF.  To show that file transfer failures are indicated
by  the  first  parameter  and the letter  "E"  in  the  file  XFER-xx.DEF,
parameter 11 (as described in section 21.1) would be written as "1=E".   To
show that file transfer failures are indicated by the fourth parameter  and
the  letter  "F",  parameter 11 (as described in  section  21.1)  would  be
written as "4=F".

No  other information is required when SHELLing to external  file  transfer
protocols.   However, when DOORing to external file transfer protocols  the
log file for the transfer MUST HAVE the file name as the first parameter.

Protocol drivers that do not have the file name as the first parameter  can
still be used by telling RBBS-PC to write out three parameters (file  name,
an  empty parameter, and the letter of the file transfer  protocol)  before
invoking  the external file protocol.  This is done by using  parameter  11
(as described in section 21.1).  As an example, to DOOR to an external file
transfer  protocol  that  indicates a file transfer failure  by  using  the
letter "F" in the fourth parameter, but which does not return the file name
used,  parameter  11  (as described in section 21.1) would  be  written  as
"4=F=A".   The external protocol would then append its own  information  to
the log file.

21.4  The Protocol Drivers Tested With RBBS-PC
----------------------------------------------
RBBS-PC has been tested with the following protocol drivers:

CLINK -- From System Enhancement Associates.  Supports batch file transfers
    but requires that transfers always be assumed successful.

DSZ -- From Omen Technologies.  Supports Ymodem, Ymodem Batch, YmodemG, and
    Zmodem.   YmodemG  requires  a "reliable"  connection.   DSZ  logs  the
    results  of the file transfers to a file specified in  the  environment
    variable DSZLOG.  Therefore, the AUTOEXEC.BAT file for an RBBS-PC  that
    uses DSZ should specify

     "SET DSZLOG=XFER-x.DEF"

    where  x  is the node number.   DSZ seems unable to create a  log  file
    whenever a drive or path is specified.  If invoking ZMODEM via the DOOR
    mechanism,  use the "=A" option at the end of the success method  check
    so that RBBS-PC will append the information to the DSZ log it needs and
    DSZ  will then append the success report.  In a multi-user  environment
    where  a  different  environment  variable for each  node  can  not  be
    specified  (i.e. all nodes must share the same DSZ log  file),  specify
    that  a all transfers are always successful for protocols  handled  via
    DSZ.   See the discussion of parameter 11 in section 21.1  for  further
    considerations when using DSZ.

MLINK -- MEGALINK protocol supports batch file transfers but requires  that
    transfers always be assumed successful.

PC-KERMIT  --  from Columbia University.  PCKERMIT.EXE is supplied  by  The
    Source  as  a  public service and consists  of  sliding  window  KERMIT
    protocol. The development of "windowing" within the KERMIT architecture
    (i.e.  Super KERMIT) was funded by The Source and implemented by  Larry
    Jordan and Jan van der Eijk.

    Columbia  University  holds  the copyright  and  maintains  the  Kermit
    protocol. Like RBBS-PC, Columbia University allows KERMIT to be  passed
    along  to others and "ask only that profit not be your goal, credit  be
    given where it is due, and that new material be sent back to us so that
    we   can  maintain  a  definitive  and  comprehensive  set  of   KERMIT
    implementations".

    PCKERMIT.EXE  is  not  a terminal program.  It  simply  implements  the
    Kermit protocol, including the sliding window extension.  It will  work
    with  older  "Kermit Classic" implementations as  well,  via  automatic
    negotiation  between the two Kermit programs.  PCKERMIT.EXE runs  as  a
    "one-shot"  execution  then  returns to  RBBS-PC.   PCKERMIT  does  not
    establish   a  carrier  with  a  remote  system.   The  connection   is
    established  by  RBBS-PC.   File  transfers  must  always  be   assumed
    successful.

QMXFER  --  is  supplied  by The Forbin Project as  a  public  service  and
    supports   five  different  protocols  --  XMODEM  (checksum),   XMODEM
    (cyclical  redundancy check), YMODEM, YMODEMG, and IMODEM.  QMXFER  was
    implemented by John Friel III, author of QMODEM. YMODEM and YMODEMG are
    protocols designed by Chuck Frosberg.  IMODEM is a protocol designed by
    John  Friel.  The later two are designed to work when the link  between
    the two modems is "error free" (i.e. both modems have the MNP  protocol
    built  in)>  QMXFER.COM runs as a "one-shot" execution then returns  to
    RBBS-PC.   QMXFER  does not establish a carrier with a  remote  system.
    The  connection is established by RBBS-PC.  File transfer failures  are
    indicated by an "F" in the fourth parameter of the log file returned to
    RBBS-PC.

WXMODEM  --  is  supplied by The Forbin Project as  a  public  service  and
    supports the window XMODEM protocol designed by Pete Boswell.  Like all
    of  RBBS-PC's  protocol  drivers,  WXMODEM.COM  runs  as  a  "one-shot"
    execution  then  returns  to RBBS-PC.  WXMODEM  does  not  establish  a
    carrier  with a remote system.  The connection is established by  RBBS-
    PC.   File  transfer  failures are indicated by an "F"  in  the  fourth
    parameter of the log file returned to RBBS-PC.

  MiniNet BBS Software
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Be advised that the Franchise is a separate package (from the MiniNet 
   software) and is quite expensive as it includes ongoing support, full 
   MiniNet(s)  access,  unlimited  free  MiniNet  software/support files 
   updates,  a full image copy (600+ megs/1200 diskettes,  all  0  bytes 
   free  and all ARC'ed) of this system's files data base,  and a number 
   of  other  desireable  features.

   The MiniNet Software package by itself,  includes the  software,  all 
   Sysop utilities, display screens and support files (152 in all)   and
   24 hour a day online support in setup,  maintenance and operation via
   Underdog's MiniNet Headquarters Seattle, Wa.
 
   At  one  time,  MiniNet  was  fully comapatible to Fido NetMail but I 
   decided to break that connection after experiencing several  attempts 
   to  crash  the  system via NetMail.  There is a DOS Access built into 
   MiniNet...  and,  it is possible to bring up a copy  of  Fido  to  do 
   FidoNet in the alloted mail time slot..  on the same token, you could 
   configure RBBS Doorware and PCBoard Doorware to operate via  the  DOS 
   Access.  In  most  cases,  all  that  is  required is the RBBS and/or 
   PCBoard configuration files. 
 
   As I prefer to release customized versions of  MiniNet,  I  would  be 
   open  to  making  (minor)  modifications to the software to suit your 
   needs...  there are several desireable features to MiniNet that  make 
   it  worth  consideration...  Here  are only a few of the many MiniNet 
   features: 
 
   It only requires 150K to run including the DOS shell for the external 
   transfer protocols!  This allows you full access to your system  (via 
   TaskView  multitasker)  to run personal applications while the system 
   operates in the background! 
 
   Built in file locking  so  that  you  can  operate  multiple  MiniNet 
   systems under TaskView multitasker (and still have enough memory left 
   over for your personal system access!) 
 
   Extensive user security/access/accounting processes with  full  SysOp 
   intervention while user is online. 
 
   Separate  conference  areas  each  with  a separate,  private,  files 
   section (capable of 6 files sub-sections within that one section). 
 
   TOTAL System Security with extensive user monitoring  via  log  files 
   and  automatic  daily  statistics  tabulations  made at Midnight each 
   night. 
 
   24 hour DogNet Mail capabilities handled from  within  the  main  BBS 
   system (no front-end processor or Net Mail time slot required). 
 
   4  different  menu/display  modes with FULL MutilColor support at ALL 
   system prompts and displays using ANSI control "goto"  statements  to 
   speed up displays. 
 
   14 files transfer protocols - all of which are accessed from the main 
   BBS code (do not require the use of a protocol DOOR). 
 
   Automatic  Multi-File  transfer  capabilities - by keyboard input for 
   non K9X users and K9X.LST input for K9X users. 
 
   Command ganging of 7 or more commands at one system prompt  supplying 
   total efficiency for experienced users. 
 
   Sophisticated  FULL  function files data base (not simple text files) 
   that facilitates super fast searches and retievals.  With  1,000,000+ 
   entry capacity. 
 
   Sophisticated FULL function User Record Data Base that maintains both 
   ACTIVE and INACTIVE user indeces for super fast user ID retrieval and 
   unlimited User data base size. 
 
   Built  in  ARC  list member and view member features - with full user 
   account debiting. 
 
   A full set of Sysop Utilities that automate almost all of the  normal 
   SysOp functions... keeping system maintenance to a minimum. 
 
   Full  DOS directory support with super-fast filefinding capabilities.  
   Hard disk support for the DOS limit (C..Z) with  no  megabyte  limits 
   (this  MiniNet  system  operates  with 11 hard disks / 800+ megabytes 
   total). 
 
MiniNet Version 18.00 is in BETA test now...
 
Here's a breakdown of what's new:
 
   Added  9600/19200 bps support - with "Lock Init Baud" flag.  (USR HST 
   allows port init at 19200 bps and locking the port at the init  speed 
   with the modem adjusting to user connect baud rate). 
 
   Added  dialy download K limit - (so 9600 baud users don't eat you out 
   of house and home)! 
 
   Added Offline Test mode (no comm port access)  for  background  Sysop 
   maintenance under Multitasker. 
 
   Added  command  line parameter support to define operation varaibles. 
   (Comm Port, Node, Daily K, Lock Baud, Null Modem, Test Mode, etc.) 
 
   Added Null Modem Support for inter  machine  access  via  null  modem 
   cable. 
 
   Added DSZ Batch Upload/Download of upto 24 files. 
 
   Added DSZ True Ymodem Batch (same 24 files limit)
 
   Added  a new Xmodem/Ymodem/WXmodem/K9Xmodem driver which handles both 
   single file and Batch up/downloads - bringing protocol support to  14 
   (plus the K9X autodownload feature)! 
 
   Added  files  list  editor  during  Batch uploads - allows for manual 
   input or Ascii Upload of a files list.  User may use a  standard  BBS 
   type  list...  in  which  case,  MiniNet  will  extract  the name and 
   description from each line. 
 
   Added full  type-ahead  buffering  when  user  input  is  expected... 
   reverting back to C=Abort/S=Pause during system display scrolling. 
 
   Added  H)ang  Up option at all system prompts.  This gives the user a 
   quick disconnect option from anywhere on the system. 
 
   Changed the new user logon to display the APPLY text  file  and  then 
   prompt user if he/she wishes to register of hangup. 
 
   Expanded number of conferences to 9 - made number sysop defineable
 
   Optimized the code (again!) - the system only requires 140K including 
   the external protocols! 
 
   Added  special  message header formatting for color/fancy color users 
   which uses ANSI Cursor positioning rather than streaming out spaces. 
 
   Added special stationary files listings for color/fancy  color  users 
   which  uses  ANSI Cursor positioning to display file listings without 
   scrolling. 
 
   Modified the ARC list/view function so that the user may list an  ARC 
   and  view  text  files continuously without having to recall the main 
   files listing.  Additionally,  MiniNet  monitors  the  user  security 
   versus  the  file  security.  Users may view text files within an ARC 
   only if his/her security is equal to or higher than that of the file. 
 
   Changed format for Quick Scan messages so  displaying  about  12  msg 
   headers per screen as opposed to the old 3 headers per screen 
    
   Correceted a problem in the node mail feature

   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
   MiniNet is perhaps the most sophisticated BBS  package  available  to 
   date.  If you haven't seen the MiniNet system in action,  I cordially
   invite you to give the Dog a call and check it out for yourself!
   
   The MiniNet Software package by itself,  includes the  software,  all 
   Sysop utilities, display screens and support files (152 in all)   and
   24 hour a day online support in setup,  maintenance and operation via
   Underdog's MiniNet Headquarters Seattle, Wa.

PATSTACK - Stack Value Patching utility for SUPERK.COM

    There have been reports of strange things happening with SUPERK  when 
installed in various PC environments.  In order to keep the SuperK memory 
requirements  to  a  minimum,  I  have  set the Minimum and Maximum stack 
values at a bare minumum.  Testing has proven that this may very well  be 
the  cause  of the stange transfer results experienced by some users.  By 
providing a real time patching utility - as opposed to simply  increasing 
the  stack  values  -  you can experiment with different stack values and 
(hopefully) come up with the optimum compromise between  proper  transfer 
performance and memory requirements.  To this end, PATSTACK is being made 
available so that the user may patch the Minimum and Maximum stack values 
directly within SUPERK.COM. 

   You may also startup PATSTACK with two command line parameters:

                PATSTACK x y

       where x = the new Minimum Stack value 
             y = the new Maximum Stack value


    If  no  command line parameters are specified,  PATSTACK will display 
how the stack values are figured and what the current values are.  Simply 
enter the  new  values  and  PATSTACK  will  make  the  modifications  to 
SUPERK.COM.

    IN ALL CASES,  The Mimimum Stack value should be less than or equal to 
the Maximum Stack value. 

   It should be noted that SuperK memory requirements  will  increase  as 
the  values of the stack(s) increase and that the range of 512 to 2048 is 
checked prior to patching SUPERK.COM 

   PATSTACK will work on any version of SUPERK.COM

SuperK External Protocol Driver - Revision Log

V2.50  - Dated 08/22/88  Initial Release

V3.10  - Dated 11/05/88
V3.12  - Dated 12/04/88
V3.13  - Dated 12/06/88
V3.14  - Dated 12/27/88

V3.16  - Dated 01/26/89
V4.00  - Dated 02/20/89
V4.10  - Dated 03/29/89  Changes

   Modem Buffer size has been increased from 4K to 8K

   Sending  files  using  Super8K will now recognize the receipt of an XOFF 
   from the modem.  Upon receipt,  SuperK will cycle for  about  5  seconds 
   waiting for an XON from the modem or a user abort via the Esc or ^X key. 
   Please  Note  that the XOFF/XON support is ONLY for use with MNP modems.  
   The Super8K receiver software does not send the XOFF/XON. 

   It has been brought to my attention that the latest MS  Basic  compilers 
   drop the RTS line when performing a DOS shell. SuperK now checks the RTS 
   line upon startup and will raise it if it has been dropped. 

   There have also been some reports of memory errors when using SuperK  in 
   EEMS memory...  I suspect that this may have been caused by a Stack/Heap 
   collision  within SuperK.  To this end,  I have increased both the Stack 
   and Heap.  Please check the new memory requirements to be sure that  you 
   have ample memory available for SuperK to do its thing! If you are still
   experiencing problems with corrupted files, etc. unpack the SK&JPATS.ZIP
   file included in the main SK&J  package, read the  PATSTACK.DOC  and run
   the PATSTACK.COM  utility against SuperK. If the problem still persists,
   please let me know!

   The  addition  of a Work Path so that SuperK can easily access Read Only 
   files in a networking envirnment (see W - Work Path below). 

   Corrected a bug in the Overwrite check.  Under certain circumstances, an 
   I/O error would occur if too many files were rejected by the receiver.


V4.11  - Dated 04/05/89  Corrected a minor bug in the ReadOnly copy routine


V4.12  - Dated 05/04/89  Changes

   In an effort to make Super8K a little more "bullet  proof",  I  reworked
   then Super8K Error Recovery routines.

   There have been a number of users having problems with SuperK  reporting
   a run time error of F0=xxxx.  This is due to the fact that SuperK cannot
   find its overlay file, SUPERK.000. Seems there are some (antiquated) BBS
   packages  that change directories before transferring a file!  When this
   happens,  SuperK is unable to find its overalay (or the  SKA.COM  jmodem
   module for that matter).  If this is happening to you,  be sure to start
   up SuperK as   SUPERK @   and define  OVL Path  parameter  to  the  FULL
   drive:\path\  where SUPERK resides.

   There are also reports that some BBS software is unable  to  "read"  the 
   SuperK errorlevel returned upon exit. This is a problem with the calling 
   program  NOT  with SuperK as the errorlevel returned is fully recognized 
   by DOS via a batch file. 


V4.20  - Dated 06/25/89  Changes - see documentation below

   Added support for Com ports 3 and 4.
   Added support for 38400, 57600 and 115200 bps.
   Added L command line parameter to let SuperK know that the port is locked
   Added C command line parameter to enable CTS checking for locked ports
   Added U command line parameter to allow the passage of actual modem speed
           when port is locked
   Added Quick Escape from the SuperK help screen(s). Simply press the [Esc]
           key and you will be returned to DOS with an errorlevel of 1.


V4.30  - Dated 06/28/89  Changes - see documentation below

   Added a new protocol! MNP Super8K-G in single or batch mode!


V4.31  - Dated 07/04/89  Changes

   Modified the Patching of SKA.COM so that you do not have to exit  SuperK
   when  patching multiple copies of SKA.COM.  The new format requires that
   the  original  SKA.COM  be  present.  After  verification  that  SKA.COM
   exists,  SUPERK will read in the entire SKA.COM,  make its modifications
   and create a new SKA.COM with the specified node  character  substituted
   for  the A in SKA.  At no time will SUPERK make any modifications to the
   original SKA.COM file... Just be sure you are using the original SKA.COM
   as the "master"!

   Changed the way in which the transfer times are calculated...  This  has 
   no effect on the cps calculations, just the estimated transfer time. 

   Changed  the  Main  transfer log file format to conform with the DSZ log
   file in that, if the transfer fails, the first character of the log file
   line will be an  E  rather than an  R  or  S.


Memory requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   
   Jmodem  transfers require a minimum of 125K (128,000 bytes).  All of the 
   other protocols only require about 70K (71,680 bytes). If you don't know 
   how much memory you have available, it can be checked easily as follows: 

   1)  Copy  DOS' CHKDSK.COM  to your comm directory.

   2)  Start up your comm program and execute the comm program's DOS  shell 
       option. 

   3)  Type  CHKDSK  at the DOS prompt

   4)  CHKDSK  will display its results along with the "bytes free" figure. 
       In order to perform Jmodem transfers,  the "bytes free" must  be  at 
       least 128,000 (if you intend on using SuperK's Jmodem).

   5)  Enter "EXIT" at the DOS prompt.

   6)  Exit your comm program...


Command Line Syntax:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  SuperK Px Sbaud [Ubaud] [Nx] [C] [L] [M] [R] [E] Dprotocol{by} F fspec fspec

Command line parameters :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Px  - Comm Port to use.

       Where x = 1, 2, 3 or 4

       The port addresses and IRQ's are standard IBM/MSDOS values:

                         Address     IRQ
                         -------     ---
               Com 1 =   03F8 hex     4
               Com 2 =   02F8 hex     3
               Com 3 =   03E8 hex     4
               Com 4 =   02E8 hex     3

       Please  note:

          Com3 and Com4 may not work on your system.  Be sure to check your 
          Async Card manual to be sure that your port addresses  and  IRQ's 
          are the same... 


   Sbaud - Port Speed.

       Where baud = 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200

                          S300     =     300 bps
                          S1200    =    1200 bps
                          S2400    =    2400 bps
                          S4800    =    4800 bps
                          S9600    =    9600 bps
                          S19200   =   19200 bps
                          S38400   =   38400 bps
                          S57600   =   57600 bps
                          S115200  =  115200 bps

       This  is  the  speed  at  which  the  comm  port  is  set at and not 
       necessarily the speed of the modem (if the port is locked that is). 

       Please  note:

         The 57600bps and 115200bps speeds,  although feasible,  require  a 
         high  speed  Async  Card  with  an  NS16550 UART and have not been 
         tested (mine is one of those non-workable systems)... 


   Ubaud - Modem Speed.

       Where baud = 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200

       This is the actual speed (according to the connection) of the modem.

       The inclusion of the U parameter is purely optional and if  present, 
       will  be  used  to  accurately  calculate  the  transfer  times  and 
       accurately report the correct baud rate in the  Transfer  Log  file.  
       If  it  is  not  specified,  SuperK  will set its value equal to the 
       actual port speed as specified via the S parameter. 


   DirectionProtocol[b][y]

       Direction of transfer. Where D = R (receive) or S (send)
          and Protocol X = Xmodem
                       C = CRC Xmodem
                       Y = Ymodem (1k Xmodem)
                       W = WXmodem
                       J = Jmodem
                       K = K9Xmodem
                       S = Super8K
                       M = MNP Super8K-G

              b = Perform  the  transfer  in  Batch  mode.  Note  that both 
                  computers MUST be using SuperK or K9X in  order  for  the 
                  Batch mode to be operational. 

              y = SuperK  allows  you to specify if you want overwriting of 
                  existing files to be performed. By including a Y with the 
                  Direction/Protocol  parameter,   the  default   overwrite 
                  setting will be reversed during the current transfer. 

          In single file mode,  the J,  X,  C,  W and Y protocols are fully 
          compatible  with  their  counterparts  used  on all/most BBS Both 
          systems must be using SuperK to invoke the  K9Xmodem  or  Super8K 
          Protocols. 

          Both  y  and b are optional.  The y overwrite reversal only works 
          in Batch mode (when the b is also present).  If the b is omitted, 
          SuperK defaults to single file mode 

  MNP Super8K-G
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          A  brand  new  protocol!!!  As  is the case with the other SuperK 
          protocols,  the new MNP Super8K-G protocol itself may be executed 
          in either Batch (MB parameter) or Single File (M parameter) mode. 
          This  new protocol takes advantage of the MNP error correction of 
          the new high speed (and some lower speed)  modems.  When  called, 
          the  MNP Super8K-G automatically sets the Check-CTS flag and uses 
          the built-in Flow Control code. Also, the Port Locked parameter L 
          is not required.  Along with a much improved throughput,  the MNP 
          Super8K-G  protocol  also rounds file sizes up to the next higher 
          128 byte sector,  ala X/WXmodem,  rather than the next higher  1K 
          byte sector, ala Y/K9Xmodem. 

          MNP Super8K-G uses an 8K block and since it IS  NOT  a  windowing 
          protocol  (like  WXmodem and K9Xmodem),  the error/abort response 
          time is improved 1000 fold!  MNP Super8K-G also passes the number 
          of file sectors to the  receiving  system  so  a  file  size  and 
          transfer  time (approxomate) is displayed on both the sending and 
          receiving systems. 

          Of course,  the MNP Super8K-G protocol has its own colors  so  be 
          sure to setup SuperK before you use it!

          Since MNP Super8K-G only does a byte count update  each  8K,  the 
          tranfer  may seem to be taking a long time...  but in reality.... 
          the following SUPERK.LOG extract displays  the  preliminary  test 
          results  for  each of the SuperK protocols.  These tests were run 
          between two AT's via Null Modem cable.  Results  via  modem  will 
          probably be a little lower accross the board.

  Super8K
  ~~~~~~~
          A brand new protocol!!!  As is the case  with  the  other  SuperK 
          protocols,  the Super8K protocol itself may be executed in either 
          Batch (SB parameter) or Single File  (S  parameter)  mode.  Along 
          with a much improved throughput, the Super8K protocol also rounds 
          file sizes up to the next higher 128 byte sector,  ala X/WXmodem, 
          rather than the next higher 1K byte sector, ala Y/K9Xmodem. 

          Super8K uses an 8K block with a  1K  error  fallback/restart  and 
          since it IS NOT a windowing protocol (like WXmodem and K9Xmodem), 
          the  error/abort  response  time  is improved 1000 fold!  Super8K 
          also passes the number of file sectors to the receiving system so 
          a file size and transfer time (approxomate) is displayed on  both 
          the sending and receiving systems. 

          Of course,  the Super8K protocol has its own colors so be sure to 
          setup SuperK before you use it. 

          Since Super8K only does a byte count update each 8K,  the tranfer 
          may  seem  to  be  taking a long time...  but in reality....  the 
          following  SUPERK.LOG  extract  displays  the  preliminary   test 
          results for each of the SuperK protocols and a test comparison to 
          Zmodem  and  Jmodem.  These  tests  were run between two AT's via 
          Null Modem cable.  Results via modem will probably  be  a  little 
          lower accross the board.

   C   - Perform CTS checking.

       This parameter is for those of you who have your comm  ports  locked 
       at  a  higher  baud rate than the actual connection.  If this is the 
       case,  be sure to include this paramater.  The default is for no CTS 
       monitoring. Here's the result of the  ATI5  USR Modem Command"

   L   - Port Locked flag.

       In  order  for  the  Super8K protocol to work in locked port setups, 
       SuperK must  disable  its  normal  Xon/Xoff  checking  in  order  to 
       recognize  the  Xon/Xoff  sent  by  the  modem  when it has its port 
       locked.  This command line parameter is provided to let SuperK  know 
       that  the  port  is locked and MUST be present when using an USR HST 
       with the port locked. The default is port is not locked. 


   M   - Monitor Carrier,  abort if not present.

       Including this parameter allows you to use SuperK to transfer  files 
       between  systems  via  null  modem  cable.  Default  is  ON (Monitor 
       Carrier). 


   Nx  - Node Letter or Number. Where x = A to Z  or  0 to 9


   E   - The  E parameter toggles the status of the "erase" flag.

       If specified on the command line, SuperK will not erase the BATCHLST 
       file it creates when multiple filenames are specified on the command 
       line (until the next time you specify multiple filenames, that is!) 


   R   - This Command Line Parameter is for use with RBBS-PC.

       RBBS-PC  utilizes  a  true  Batch  download  with a single file mode
       upload.  During uploads, RBBS-PC includes the full path and filename
       for the f paramter.  Since SuperK Batch modes are TRUE Batch in both
       downloads and uploads,  I have added the R command  line  switch  to
       tell  SuperK  that  the  F  parameter  may  (or  may  not) include a
       filename.  When SuperK sees the R parameter,  it will look  for  the
       last  \  or :  characters and parse all characters after that,  thus
       leaving just the path...  which it then appends to any uploads.  The
       default is True (non RBBS-PC) batch uploads.

          RBBS command line for Batch Receive using K9Xmodem Batch

             SUPERK.COM p[PORT#] s[BAUD] r n[NODE] skb f [FILE]

          example:  RBBS-PC passes [FILE] as  C:\RBBS\99\filename.ext
                    (or your defined upload path) during uploads

          exclusion  of the  R  command  line parameter  results in an 
          invalid file specification of 

                   C:\RBBS\99\filename.ext\

          inclusion of the R command line parameter results in a valid file 
          specification of 

                   C:\RBBS\99\

          for obvious reasons, if you use the R command line parameter, you 
          must include the last \ or at least one superflous (non  \  or  : 
          character) at the end of the F specification. 

          when using the R parameter...

            valid     C:\RBBS\99\*.*       results in   C:\RBBS\99\
            valid     C:\RBBS\99\ABC.PAK   results in   C:\RBBS\99\
            valid     C:\RBBS\99\          results in   C:\RBBS\99\
            invalid   C:\RBBS\99           results in   C:\RBBS\
            no f parameter                 results in   *.*  (all files saved
                                                         in logged drive\dir)

          when using the default (non RBBS-PC)

            invalid   C:\RBBS\99\*.*       results in   C:\RBBS\99\*.*\
            invalid   C:\RBBS\99\ABC.PAK   results in   C:\RBBS\99\ABC.PAK\
            valid     C:\RBBS\99\          results in   C:\RBBS\99\
            valid     C:\RBBS\99           results in   C:\RBBS\99\
            no f parameter                 results in   *.*  (all files saved
                                                         in logged drive\dir)

   F   - Filespecs Next

       This  parameter  acts  as  a  flag  for  SuperK and denotes that ALL 
       parameters after the F are  to  be  interpreted  as  filenames.  For 
       obvious  reasons,  this  parameter  should be the last one specified 
       (before the filenames)! Each filename may contain a full path in the 
       form: 

                 [d:\path\]Filename [d:\path\]Filename   to send/receive.

                                  or

       You may also specify the use of a text file  containing  a  list  of 
       filenames.  Each filename in the list may contain a full path.  This 
       option is specified as: 

                 @drive:\path\Filelist   (of files to Batch send.

                                  or

       You may want to use the second option for  file  lists...  that  is, 
       include a second path where ALL of the files within the list reside. 
       This option is specified as: 

                 @drive:\path\listfilename@drive:\path 


   @   - Default Configuration Mode

       Modify colors/logfile name/xferfile name/overlay path/options  flags 
       Clone SUPERK.COM if changes are made 


   The port, speed and direction/protocol parameters MUST be supplied... If 
   operating in single file mode, the F parameter must be supplied.  The B, 
   E, U, L, C, Y, M, N and R parameters are optional... and the @ parameter
   is only used to  review/modify  the  default settings  (see modification
   mode below).

   The  direction R and S parameters are mutually exclusive (only one,  but 
   not both). 

   Command Line parameters may be supplied as upper or lower case,  and may 
   be  entered  in  any  order (except for the F paramter which must be the 
   last one... before any filenames).

XFER.TXT 
~~~~~~~~
   If  (and  only  if)  a Node character is specified OR a question mark is 
   used within the XferFile name or SuperK Log file name,  SuperK will also 
   create a Xfer Node File to show success/failure status messages. 

       This file has the following format :

                Filename
                Upload   or   Download
                Protocol      (J/X/C/Y/W/K/S/M/JB/XB/CB/YB/WB/KB/SB/MB)
                Success  or   Fail
                EOF           (^Z)

           Sample:

                SUPERK.PAK
                Download
                KB
                Success
                ^Z

   The  file  will  be created in the default directory if no drive/path is 
   specified during the command line @ parameter modification  mode.  While 
   in  batch  mode,  only the first file transfer results will be logged to 
   this file.  However,  SUPERK.LOG will contain the results of  all  files 
   transferred in the batch. 


ErrorLevel Exits 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   For ease of use within batch files.. in all cases, SuperK will exit with 
   an ErrorLevel determined by the success of the transfer. 

   If  ALL transfers are successful,  SuperK will return an ERRORLEVEL 0 If 
   ANY ONE transfer fails, SuperK will return an ERRORLEVEL 1 


Command Line @ Parameter Modification Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Starting SuperK with the @ command line parameter will put  SuperK  into 
   its  default  modification  mode.  SuperK will first display its current 
   default settings and then prompt you for any changes  you  may  wish  to 
   make.  Note  that  entering  a  blank line (simply hitting [Enter]) will 
   leave the current setting intact.  SuperK  allows  modification  to  the 
   colors it uses,  the logfile name, the xfer file name (for BBS use), the 
   overlay path and certain operational flags. 


   C - Modifying colors:

       This one's easy!  After selecting the C option,  SuperK will display 
       the  127 color palette that it supports.  Simply select a number for 
       each of the 6  colors  used...  SuperK  will  cycle  through  all  6 
       colors,  updating  the "current settings" accordingly.  If you don't 
       want to change a current color setting,  simply hit the [Enter]  key 
       and  SuperK  will move on to the next setting.  Note:  Jmodem window 
       colors default to black text on a  white  background.  The  6  color 
       types are: 

          Xcolors for Xmodem/Xmodem CRC/WXmodem transfers
          Kcolors for K9Xmodem transfers
          Ycolors for Ymodem transfers
          Scolors for Super8K transfers
          Mcolors for Super8K-G transfers
          Ucolors for universal display of the SuperK logo and batch
                      filenames


   D - Logfile Name:

       This  is  the  filename  SuperK  uses  to  record the results of any 
       tranfers it performs.  SuperK will accept upto 40 characters so  you 
       may  include  a  full  drive:\path\  along  with  the  logfile name. 
       Additionally,  you may use a question mark (?) as one (and only one) 
       of  the  logfile  name  characters.  If  a question mark is present, 
       SuperK will substitute the Node character in its place.  If no  node 
       character  is  specified,  SuperK  will  use  the letter A as a Node 
       character.  The letter A is substituted ONLY if the question mark is 
       encountered in the logfile name.  If  you  do  not  want  SuperK  to 
       maintain a logfile, simply enter a backslash (\).. which will inform 
       SuperK  to  blank out the logfile name.  The default logfile name is 
       SK4.LOG 


   E - XferFile Name:

       This is the filename SuperK uses to record transfer results for  use 
       by  BBS  programs.  Its  format and modification is identical to the 
       Logfile Name. The default Xferfile name is XFER.TXT 


   F - OvlPath:

       Although in most cases,  you will be storing all of the SuperK files 
       in  the  same  directory  as your comm/BBS program files,  there are 
       cases where you may want to store them in a directory other than the 
       logged directory.  This option allows you to do  this.  When  SuperK 
       starts  up,  it  will  use  the  OvlPath  to locate its overlay file 
       (SUPERK.000) and Jmodem module (SKA.COM).  You must supply the  full 
       drive and path in which the SKA.COM, SUPERK.COM and SUPERK.000 files 
       reside and all SuperK files MUST reside in this area.  If no OvlPath 
       is defined,  SuperK will expect all of its files to  reside  in  the 
       logged directory.  If,  after defining a path, you decide that it is 
       NOT required,  simply enter a backslash \ for  the  new  path.  This 
       will cause SuperK to null out any existing path. 


   G - Overwrite:

       This  flag  setting  tells  SuperK  whether  or not in can overwrite 
       existing files during Batch mode transfers. The default is NO 


   H - Save Aborts:

       This flag setting tell SuperK whether or  not  it  should  keep  any 
       partial  files  which were aborted during transfer.  This flag holds 
       for any protocol - batch or single file mode. The default is YES 


   I - Write On 0:

       This flag setting tells SuperK whether or not it should  create  the 
       XferFile  when  a  transfer  is  not  successfully completed and the 
       uploaded file contains 0 bytes.  The status of this flag is the last 
       check that  SuperK  makes  before  creating  the  XferFile.  A  node 
       character  and XferFile Name must be specified before the Write On 0 
       flag comes into play. The default is YES 


   P - Patch SKA.COM

       In order to  facilitate  the  use  of  JBatch  in  a  multinode  BBS 
       environment  the  SK.COM  module  has  been  renamed  SBA.COM.  In a 
       multinode BBS environement,  SuperK  requires  the  presence  of  an 
       exclusive  copy  of  SKA.COM for each node.  Each SK module is named 
       according to the BBS node it  supports  (SKA.COM  supports  node  A, 
       SKB.COM supports node B, SK1.COM supports node 1, etc.). 

       In previous versions, there was a separate patching utility provided 
       so that you could patch SKA.COM (JBA.COM before).  SuperK v4.00  now 
       provides  an internal method of performing this modification!  After 
       selecting this option,  SuperK  will  prompt  you  for  a  new  node 
       character.

       Upon making the patch, SuperK will create a new copy of SKx.COM file
       with the specified node character substituted for the A in SKA.COM.

       SuperK will strip the last character of the filename (the A in  SKA) 
       and  insert  the  node character in its place,  renaming the the new 
       SKA.COM file to SK + node character + .COM. 

       If no node character is specified on the SuperK command line (the  n 
       parameter), SuperK will use the A character...  as you have probably 
       surmised,  SuperK appends the node character (or temporary A) to the 
       SK module (JBA, JBB, JB1, etc). 

       Caution...

       If  you  haven't any use for mutiple copies of SKA.COM,  simply copy 
       SKA.COM down into your comm directory and use  it.  The  default  is 
       SKA.COM 


   W - Work Path

       This  parameter  was  included  in order to supply a simple means of 
       transferring files which have the Read Only attribute set. Since the 
       Turbo Pascal compiler opens all files in a  Read  and  Write  state, 
       SuperK  would experience an I/O error when attempting to open a Read 
       Only file.  Since this problem is more  prevelant  in  a  networking 
       environemnt...  and I didn't particularly care to have to revamp all 
       of the SuperK file  read/write  I/O  routines...  This  option  will 
       circumvent  the compiler problem for those users who wish to use the 
       SuperK driver to send Read Only files. 

       By  specifying  a  work path here,  SuperK will create a copy of the 
       requested download in this directory and then proceed  to  send  the 
       copy.  Upon  completion  (or  abort) SuperK will erase the copy.  Of 
       course,  you may use this feature regardless of the File's Read Only 
       Attribute...  if  you  feel  insecure  at  having  SuperK access the 
       "master" file,  set up a work path and SuperK.  If a  work  path  is 
       specified,  it  MUST  be  a  complete path including a drive letter, 
       colon, backspace, directory etc...  upto a maximum of 40 characters. 
       As is the case with the SuperK support files, you may use a question 
       mark  as  a  valid  character  within  the  path  string.  If SuperK 
       encounters a question mark in the Work Path,  it will substitute the 
       node  character  specified  on  the  command  line  or,  if  none is 
       specified, SuperK will substitute an A for the question mark. 

       Valid Paths:

             Specifed                    Result

             C:\BBSWORK                  C:\BBSWORK\filename

             C:\NODE?WRK         if no node specified
                                         C:\NODEAWRK\filename
                                 if node 1 specified
                                         C:\NODE1WRK\filename

             C:\BBS\NODE?        if no node specified
                                         C:\BBS\NODEA\filename
                                 if node 1 specified
                                         C:\BBS\NODE1\filename
       InValid:

             C:\NODE?WRK?        if no node specified
                                         C:\NODEAWRK?\filename
                                 if node 1 specified
                                         C:\NODE1WRK?\filename


   [Enter] Quit:

       If  you  only wish to view the current default settings,  simply hit 
       [Enter] to exit back to DOS.  If any changes have been made,  SuperK 
       will go into its cloning mode and ask if you want to clone SuperK to 
       preserve  the  new  changes.  Note  that you MUST press the Y key in 
       order to clone SuperK.  Hitting [Enter] here will simply return  you 
       to DOS without saving your changes within the SuperK program. 


Program control keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   SuperK  will recognize either the [Esc] key or ^X (control X) key during 
   transfers and will abort the current transfer,  returning  you  to  DOS.  
   Note  that  the  streaming  protocols  (Wxmodem,  K9Xmodem)  may require 
   several [Esc] or ^X to abort the transfer and Jmodem/JBatch may  require 
   a ^Break to abort the transfer. 

   I  have modified the Jmodem module (SKA.COM) to eliminate as much of the 
   delays as possible... making the batch mode cycling quite "brisk"!  Note 
   however  that there is a delay if the Jmodem transfer is aborted for any 
   reason...  this is due to the fact that the buffers have to be "drained" 
   before recycling. 


Batch transfers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   SuperK is capable of sending and receiving multiple files in batch mode.  
   Since  this  protocol  driver  was  written  for use with my MiniNet BBS 
   package...  the sending of the file creation date (ala DSZ  and  Telink) 
   tends  to  drive  me  up the wall,  creating quite a bit of confusion in 
   keeeping track of newly acquired files! 

   For this reason the major difference between SuperK Batch mode and other 
   Batch modes is that SuperK Batch only sends the File Name and File  size 
   but does not send the file creation date. 

   During  Batch  mode  transfers,  SuperK  will  display  the last 3 files 
   requested under the SuperK logo so that you may have a running update of 
   what's happening.  The present transfer progress is displayed in its own 
   window alongside the SuperK logo. 

   SuperK is able to handle multiple filenames on  the  command  line.  The 
   command  syntax  remains  the  same  but  if  more  than one filename is 
   specified, SuperK will create its own BATCHLST file. If a Node character 
   is specified on the command line,  that character will be used  for  the 
   extension  of  BATCHLST.  The  default  is  "A"  if no node character is 
   specified. 

   The number of filenames that can be specified  will  depend  largely  on 
   your own particular system setup, the string length used by your calling 
   program and the individual filename lengths. 

   This   feature  is  only  active  while  in  Batch  Send  Mode  (receive 
   automatically gets filename from sender),  the command  line  paramaters 
   can be in any order,  NO WILDCARDS ARE ALLOWED,  the first filename MUST 
   be preceeded by an F (upper or lower case) and EACH filename may include 
   a full path. 

   Your command line should look like this...

         SUPERK p1 s9600 SWB f FILE1 FILE2 FILE3

   Since the BATCHLST is created internally (by SuperK),  SuperK will erase 
   the  BATCHLST  file once it is done with it...  You may override this by 
   including an E as one of the command line parameters.  The  E  parameter 
   toggles  the  status  of  the "erase" flag.  If specified on the command 
   line,  SuperK will not erase the BATCHLST file (until the next time  you 
   specify multiple filenames, that is!) 


   Receiving files in Batch mode
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      You  do  not  have to supply any filename during batch mode receives. 
      You may of  course,  include  a  full  drive:\path\  in  place  of  a 
      filename.  Use  the F command line parameter to designate the path in 
      the form:  f C:\FOO\BAR (with or  without  the  trailing  backslash).  
      And...  DO  NOT  specify  the  f  parameter if no path or filename is 
      specified. 


   Sending files in batch mode
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   
      You  may  use  any  valid  DOS  wildcard  configuration  with  the  F 
      parameter. 

      Additionally, you may specify a list of filenames for SuperK to send.  
      The list filename is specified as 
       
              @drive\:path\listfilename

      You may also specify a full drive:\path\ to where all of the files in 
      the list reside. This is specified as 

              @drive:\path\filelist@drive:\path

      The  filenames  in the list may contain a full drive:\path\ (the same 
      or different) for each filename. 

   SuperK is capable of reading and extracting filenames from a standard  - 
   single  line  - BBS files listing.  If you use a BBS type files listing, 
   and call SuperK from the comm or BBS directory, you will have to add the 
   full drive:\path\ to each filename in the list if the files to  send  do 
   not  reside in the default directory.  There are other ways of accessing 
   files that reside in directories other than the default (default  upload 
   and download directories,  etc.),  but I won't go into this area as most 
   comm and BBS programs do this work for you (K9X does it ALL  for  you... 
   automatically!) 


Examples
~~~~~~~~
   1.  Use COM1, 1200 baud, Xmodem, Send files MYFILE.DOC and FILE.COM

        SUPERK p1 s1200 SX f MYFILE.DOC FILE.COM

   2.  Use  COM2,  19200  baud,  Ymodem Batch,  Receive file *.DOC,  do not 
       monitor carrier, override the default "do not overwrite". 

        SUPERK p2 s19200 m RYBY

       Note: The  protocol  character  must  follow  the  direction R.  The 
             second Y above is the override for the overwrite flag.  The  B 
             and  second Y may be in any order just as long as they are the 
             third and fourth characters in the Direction parameter. 

   3.  Use COM1,  9600 baud,  K9Xmodem Batch Send files in MYLIST.LST which 
       resides  in  my  C:\BBS\  directory.  The files listed in MYLIST.LST 
       reside in various directories on different drives.  Do  not  monitor 
       carrier and record success results to Node A of my BBS. 

        SUPERK p1 s9600 SKB m nA f @C:\BBS\MYLIST.LST

        C:\BBS\MYLIST.LST looks like this:

          ABC.PAK              (this one resides in the default directory)
          D:\FOO\BAR\MYGAME.EXE
          E:\LOTUS\123GRAPH.PAK

       XFER.TXT (or XFERA.TXT if ?  specified in the default xferfile name) 
       will reflect the results of the transfer.  Note that only the  first 
       filename  and  its  transfer  results  will  be present in XFER.TXT.  
       SUPERK.LOG will however, contain the results of all three files. 

   4.  Use COM2,  19200 baud,  K9Xmodem Batch Send only files containing an 
       PAK extension and residing in my C:\DLS directory, and don't monitor 
       carrier. 

        SUPERK p2 s19200 SKB m f C:\DLS\*.PAK

   5.  Use COM2,  19200 baud,  K9Xmodem Batch Receive files - store them in 
       my C:\DLS directory. 

        SUPERK p2 s19200 RKB f C:\DLS


Batch Files
~~~~~~~~~~~
   There are sample batch files included in SUPERK.PAK 

       SEND.BAT  - this batch file is set up for sending file(s) to
                   another system

       RECV.BAT  - this batch file is set up to receive file(s) from 
                   another system

   Executing any one of the batch files  without  any  parameters  (or  the 
   wrong  parameter)  will  display  a  short  message  showing the correct 
   calling procedure and parameter choices.  Since these batch files handle 
   transfers in either Send or Receive mode and single or batch  mode,  you 
   will have to supply the proper information in order to have them perform 
   correctly. 


NOTE: If you are operating a MiniNet BBS v18.00 or above... or K9X v8.xx or 
      above...  access to SuperK is handled internally and does not require 
      the use of the batch files. 

      If you are not... please read the enclosed PRODUCTS.TXT file...  It's 
      worth a look! 

      For pure BBS'ing, K9X can't be beat!

    Due  to the amount of time and money I have spent setting up SuperK for 
    use with your Comm/BBS programs,  I am  requiring  that  this  and  all 
    subsequent   versions  of  SuperK  be  registered  so  that  I  may  be 
    compensated for the many hours I have spent developing,  modifying  and 
    setting up this protocol driver.
