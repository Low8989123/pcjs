## Information about "SPACEWARS AND OTHER GAMES"

    The primary program on this disk, SPACEWAR, is an excellent asteroid
    type arcade game.  The three versions, SWC for color graphics, SWATT
    for the ATT 6300 using 640x400 graphics mode, and SWH for the Hercules
    graphics card, provide good detail in a fast paced game.  Other games
    include some Turbo Pascal offerings and a large number of BASIC games
    and demos.  The large number of small simple BASIC demos with a few
    Turbo programs to add spice make this an excellent package for the
    novice programmer.
    
    Special Requirements: Hercules or color graphics card, other
    programs require BASIC
    
    How to Start: To read DOC or TXT files, enter TYPE filename.ext and
    press <ENTER>.  To run an EXE or COM program, just type its name and
    press <ENTER>.  For instructions on running BASIC programs, please
    refer to the GETTING STARTED section in this catalog.

SWC.EXE		Version of spacewar for the standard PC Color Graphics
		Card in 640 X 200 resolution.

SWH.EXE		Version of spacewar for the Hercules Graphics Card in
		720 X 348 resolution.

OBJECT:
	Destroy the other ship before it destroys you.  Use your
	PHOTON TORPEDOS or PHASERS to reduce its SHIELD energy.
	A hit with no shields will destroy the ship.

WEAPONS:
	PHOTON TORPEDOS	The best offsensive weapon.  The torpedo takes
			one unit of energy to fire and does four units
			of damage to your opponent's shields.

	PHASERS		A good defensive weapon if you are accurate.
			The phaser requires one unit of energy to fire
			and does two units of damage to your opponent's
			shields.

DEFENSE:
	IMPULSE ENGINES	Used to move your ship in the direction you are
			pointing.  Remember in space there is no friction,
			to slow down you must turn your ship around and thrust
			from the other direction.  The impulse engines use
			about one unit of energy every half second.

	CLOAK		Used to makes your ship invisible.  You can still move,
			fire, hyper space, etc. but no one can see you.
			Cloaking will use about one unit of energy every half
			second.

	HYPER SPACE	Hyper space is a quick way to get out of a bad
			situation fast.  You pay eight energy units to use
			hyper space, and you don't know where you will end up.
COMMENTS:
	You must have energy to use your weapons or defenses.  The 'E' bar on
	your side of the bottom of the screen must display energy.  Your 'E'
	bar energy is recharged from your Dilithium crystals at one unit every
	two seconds.

	Use your phasers to shoot incoming photon torpedos.  Those torpedos do
	alot of damage.

	If you hear the warning sound, someone's shield energy is below sixteen
	units, and they are about to be distroyed.  The 'S' bar  on your side
	of the bottom of the screen indicates you shield energy.  Use the
	energy balance keys to increase your shield energy and protect yourself.
	The energy balance keys for the left player are 'Z' and 'C' and for the
	right player '1' and '3'.

	Warning, touching the planet will drain your shields very fast so stay
	away.

	When using Gravity try to get in orbit.  Care must be used when firing
	torpedoes in orbit.  If they don't hit something, they will come back
	and hit you.

	The Left Auto Robot is a good defensive player.  He is a crack shot and
	hard to destroy.

	The Right Auto Robot is an offensive player.  He will chase you around
	space firing often.
