## Information about "PC-FLOW - BUDGETING SYSTEM"

    PC-FLOW, the personal cash-flow budgeting system, lets you forecast and
    evaluate your home or small-business budget, emphasizing daily cash-
    flow. Each transaction can be designated as once-only, daily, weekly,
    or monthly. The entries can be exact or estimated. Record incoming and
    outgoing activities and sort and categorize by group.
    
    Schedule future transactions within a user-defined time period. This
    approach to budgeting lets you observe the cash-flow situation as the
    transactions are scheduled to occur. Reports of starting resources,
    cash-flow, and transaction breakdown can be printed. Sort budget
    transactions by ID, frequency or ending date. There are three cash-flow
    reports: daily transaction detail; daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly
    cash-flow summaries; and breakdown by transaction classification.

PC-FLOW, the Personal Cash-Flow Budgeting System, enables you to
forecast and evaluate your budget with an emphasis on daily cash-flow.
Each transaction can be designated as once-only, daily, weekly, or
monthly.  The entries can either be specific or an estimate.  These
transactions can record both incoming and outgoing activities, and may
be sorted and categorized by group.
 
PC-FLOW can transform transactions within a user-defined time period so
the budget may be further analyzed.  This approach to budgeting lets you
observe the cash-flow situation as the transactions are scheduled to
occur.  Reports concerning starting resources, cash flow, and
transaction breakdown can be printed at any time, and you can sort
budget transactions by ID, frequency, ending date, or classification and
configure the system parameters for your printer and screen.
