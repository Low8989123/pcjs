## Information about "POLYMATH"

    POLYMATH is a programming language much like Forth in structure, and
    developed to bridge the gap between programmable calculators and
    personal computer languages.  Anyone in the scientific or technical
    fields will find this program extremely useful for its number-handling
    abilities and ease of use.
    
    This language works much like the Hewlett Packard programmable
    calculator and can be used as a calculator.  Those familiar with the HP
    Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) know how simply complex formulas can be
    entered into the calculator.  POLYMATH uses this same scheme, but with
    defined words or functions.  Most words are defined with very simple
    tasks and then used and integrated with other words to build more
    powerful functions.  An entire programming dictionary of function words
    can then be developed.
    
    POLYMATH has a wide variety of applications and special uses.  It has
    strong on-line documentation which takes the first-time user through a
    menu-driven tutorial.  It also has files that explain the syntax
    and use of any word currently in its main dictionary.
    
    Included are a few dictionaries and application programs.  A review of
    these programs will be very helpful when learning the language.  It
    also features full graphics to round out the package.

Disk No:  606
Program Title: POLYMATH version 4.0
PC-SIG version: 2.2

POLYMATH is a language developed for number processing.  Much like
Forth, POLYMATH is highly modulated and based upon function words.

Most words are defined with very simple tasks.  These simple words are
then used and integrated with other words to build more powerful words
functions.  An entire programming dictionary of function words can then
be developed which is actually custom created by the author.
Specifically Polymath has a wide variety of applications and special
uses.  It has a strong on-line documentation application which takes the
first time user through a menu driven tutorial.  It also has explain
files that will explain the syntax and usage of any word currently in
its main dictionary.

POLYMATH as a function processor works much like the Hewlett Packard
programmable calculators.  Although a language, POLYMATH can be used
just as a calculator.  Those familiar with the HP Reverse Polish
Notation (RPN) know how simply complex formulas can be entered into the
calculator.  POLYMATH uses this same scheme, but with defined words or
functions.  Specifically Polymath has a number stack and an alpha stack
which revolves numbers through it as new computations are created and
old values are stored.  Included on this diskette are a few dictionaries
and application programs.  It is best to view these application programs
with a text editor, they all end in ".pm" and will be very informative
when learning the language.  POLYMATH also has full graphic features to
well round this language package.

The actual package has a few more features including more DOS features
and a 128k dictionary of predefined words and functions.  The full
featured version also has more variable power.  POLYMATH is rather
large, so it will require at least 192k and a color monitor is
recommended.  In short POLYMATH is a powerful, easy to use language much
like Forth in structure.  Polymath was developed to bridge the gap
between programmable calculators and personal computer languages.
Anyone in the scientific or technical fields will find this program
extremely useful for its number handling abilities and ease of use.
