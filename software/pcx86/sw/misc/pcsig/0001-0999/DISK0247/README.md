## Information about "BOBCAT"

    BOBCAT is a database of small business computer information.  Reviews,
    tutorials, general articles, buying guides, even ads on special
    products that apply to small businesses are listed.  The database may
    be searched by any combination of category, subject, form, product or
    company name.  BOBCAT is distributed as user-supported software in Jim
    Button's PC-File III format.  BOBCAT needs PC-File III, or other
    similar program to sort and print information and indexes in a usable
    format.
    
    System Requirements: 2 disk drives, PC-FILE III (Disk No 5)
    
    How to Start: It is very important to read the Documentation file
    BOBCAT.TXT.  To run it, bring up PC-FILE and enter BOBCAT as you would
    any database/data file.

                          ABOUT BOBCAT
             (BOB's CATalog of computer information)

BOBCAT is for anyone using micro-computers in business.  Anyone
that has a need to quickly get specific information - 
without having to read through hundreds of publications.

BOBCAT is a computerized INDEX, a data base.  It will tell you
where to quickly find the product reviews, tutorials, general
articles, buying guides, ads on new or special products, etc.,
that are published in leading magazines, news letters, newspapers
and research reports.

If you do not have access to the publications where the
information is, and you need it immediately, for personal study
or research, phone us for SAME DAY PHOTO COPY SERVICE.

Actually, most of the listings are useful to anyone, it's just
that we don't index information on games, educational or lab
applications, and "heavy hacking or programming".

	Each edition of BOBCAT contains approximately 1500
plus entries from approximately 200 publications.  The 7th 
and 8th characters of the BOBCAT file name (BOBCAT01.DTA)
indicate the edition number.


                        HOW TO USE BOBCAT

	The BOBCAT data files are intended to be used with 
Jim Button's PC File III program.  The files BOBCAT.HDR,
BOBCAT.INX and BOBCAT.KEY should be on the same disk as 
BOBCAT.DATA.  BOBCAT.DATA is loaded and run win the same 
way as any other PC-FILE III data file.  If you need any 
help, refer to the PC-FILE III documentation.

	You can get your copy of PC-FILE III by sending a 
diskette and a self-addressed stamped mailer to:
		
		Jim Button
		P. O. Box 5786
		Bellevue, WA 98006

	When using more than one edition of BOBCAT it may be 
worth your while to clone off separately the different categories 
from each disk and merge each category on one disk.

	Study the Subject Word/Category Matrix (not on disk).  
This shows the categories and main subject words that are used 
with each category.  Categories F, P, and R are used only if a 
listing doesn't fit one of the other categories. As a general 
rule, use the first category that clearly fits, as you come to 
it, in the Subject/Word Matrix.

	Only upper case is used to simplify searching.

	Use Soundex (?) or Scan (>) when on doubt.

	Categories F, P, or R may turn up lost items.

	Search for NOVICE in MISC. field.

	*  - a star means additional information is in the
	     MISC field.

	To identify the publication referred to in BOBCAT, 
use the file MAG.DTA.  The field FILE refers to the 
publication.

  	The documentation, CROSS-REFERENCE and the SUBJECT
WORD/CATEGORY matrix are not included on the disk. It is felt
BOBCAT can be used reasonabley well used without them, certainly
well enough to determine if BOBCAT will be of sufficient value
to warrant a contribution.

                   HOW TO GET BOBCAT

To get the latest edition (or any other edition) of:

1. BOBCAT.

2. CROSS-REFERENCE of search words and abbreviations.

3. SUBJECT WORD/CATEGORY matrix. 
                             
                     -------- Categories and meanings of
   words as used in the computer industry are oft times 
   ambiguous and shifting.  For example, a print spooler can 
   either be a hardware item or a software function, or is it
   a printer buffer?  The SUBJECT WORD/CATEGORY MATRIX, when
   used together with the CROSS REFERENCE will help solve this
   problem - and help you understand how BOBCAT is structured.

	1. Send me $10.00 and a formatted disk - double sided
	   9 sector disk.  I will supply the postage.
	2. Send me $15.00 and I will supply the disk and the 
	   postage.

	3. If you already have BOBCAT, but need the SUBJECT
	   WORD/CATEGORY matrix and the CROSS REFERENCE, send
	   $6.00 and I will send them air mail.
