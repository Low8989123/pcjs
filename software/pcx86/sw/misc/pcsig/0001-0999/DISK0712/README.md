LangWare's JAPANESE is a introduction to Japanese, and is part of LangWare's
Language Series. LangWare also makes a spanish version and a french one is to
be released soon.

This program is an updated version of JAPANESE FOR BUSINESS AND TRAVEL.
This tutorial is designed to perform as a teacher, when no teacher is
available. It keeps track of your errors and emphasizes those areas.
It should only be used by one individual at a time, so as to not confuse the
built-in teacher. This new updated version also includes a sample of
LangWare's Learn Katakana program which, when used with a color graphics
adapter, can teach a student to read japanese.

This tutorial is composed of questions about vocabulary, grammar, and culture.
The questions are of the fill-in type, multiple choice, and matching. The
course assumes no prior knowledge of Japanese. Be advised that the material
is challenging, but anything worth knowing has it's price. Don't get
discouraged. It has been written that Japanese is one of the ten most
difficult languages on earth to learn. ....When you finish the tutorial, I'm
sure that you'll disagree.
     Good ruck
