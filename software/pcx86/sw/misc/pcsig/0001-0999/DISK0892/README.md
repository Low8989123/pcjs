## Information about "COLLEGE FOOTBALL POOL"

    COLLEGE FOOTBALL POOL is designed to make football pool games easier to
    play/follow/bet each week.
    
    A demonstration schedule is included.  Pick the week you want, and all
    the games for that week will be displayed.  Choose any fourteen games
    for the selection sheet.  The object of the game is for each player to
    try to pick the most winners of the 14 weekly games.  Selection
    sheets can then be printed showing all the players' choices.
    
    After the games are completed, enter the winning teams and print a final
    report showing the number of games each player picked correctly.  In the
    event of ties, the player who was the closest in guessing the total
    number of points scored in the last game on the selection sheet is
    declared the winner.  Up to 300 players can be handled by this program.

                             GENERAL INFORMATION
                             -------------------

          College Football Pool (CFP) was designed expressly for the
          IBM-PC and compatible. A complete football schedule for the
          entire current season is included in a data file on the CFP
          disk. The operator picks the week he wants for the selection
          sheet and all the games for that week appear on the screen.
          He then chooses any 14 games he desires for the selection
          sheet.  He then decides if he wants to assign point spreads
          to the games.  CFP then prints a selection sheet.

          The selection sheet contains rules for playing the
          game.  The rules are simple and encourage non-football
          experts to participate in the game.  The object is to
          pick the most winners of the 14 weekly games. In the event
          of ties, each player enters the total number of points they
          think will be scored in the last game on the selection sheet
          and whoever is closest to the actual points scored is declared
          the winner.

          Entering each players selections has been simplified by
          a data entry screen designed expressly for this
          purpose.  Using the 10 key numeric pad on the keyboard,
          it is easy to enter 2 players a minute.  Groups of
          selection sheets may also be entered at different
          times.  Each player is stored on disk when operator is
          satisfied that entry is correct, so that in the event
          of a power failure, no work is lost accept for the
          current player being entered on the screen. After all
          players are entered the operator may produce a list of
          this weeks selections. This report shows the time and
          date and can be used to verify that no selections were
          changed after the games were played.

          Up to 300 players can be handled by CFP.  A final report must be
          produced on Monday morning.  Operator keys in the 14 numbers of
          winning teams from weekend games and CFP counts number of games
          each player picked right.




















                                       1.
  

          Operator keys in the number of points scored in last
          game and CFP prints final report in order by

                 1. Most games won.
                 2. Smallest point difference.

          Monday morning is also a good time to print the next
          weeks selection sheet.

                A:2


          Put the master CFP disk away for safe keeping.  If any

              C:\CFP
              CFP    or    CFP /MONO

===============================================================================

          The blinking cursor will be sitting in the first box [  ] on the
          bottom of the screen and you must select a game number from 1 to
          40 from the games which appear on the screen.  Enter the number
          in the first box and press the Enter key to get to the next box.
          You can enter the numbers in any order you like.  You may not
          enter a number which does not have a game listed or a number
          which you have already entered in a previous box.  The computer
          will beep at you to let you know you are doing something wrong if
          you do.  If you mess up your game number selections and want to
          start over, you may do so by pressing the Esc key.

          This allows you to customize the selection sheet with the
          games you desire.  Make the last game one which has a great deal
          of interest to people in your geographic area.  It is the game
          whose points are used as the tie breaker.









                                         6.


          After picking the games you want on the selection sheet you
          will then be asked if you want to assign points.  If you
          answer N the CFP will print your selection sheet without
          point spreads.  If you answer Y the CFP will display the
          teams in each game and you will have to pick the favorite
          and the number of points in the spread.  The teams appear as
          follows on the screen,

                A. ALABAMA       AT  B. MEMPHIS STATE

          you must enter an A or B to indicate which team is favored and
          the number of points they are favored by. If you entered

                                A7.5

          it would mean that Alabama is favored by 7 and 1/2 points.  If a
          game is even and has no points you should enter A0.  After you
          have entered each games points a selection sheet will be printed
          showing point spreads.

          HOW MANY SELECTION SHEETS DO YOU WANT PRINTED

          Enter the number to be printed and press enter.  You
          will then be told to

          SET PRINTER TO RECEIVE SELECTION SHEET & PRESS ANY KEY

          Make sure printer is turned on and loaded with paper
          and then press any key to begin printing.  When it is
          thru the program will return to main menu and you can
          end the program with item 9.

          A sample of the selection sheet is shown on page A1.

                        ENTERING PLAYERS SELECTIONS.
                        ----------------------------

          You must enter all players into computer before games
          are played.  Use item 2. on main menu to bring up the
          player selection data entry screen.  Use bottom
          tear-off stub on football selection sheet for data
          entry. Enter player's name in box where cursor is
          blinking and press enter key to get to first football
          game box.

          Enter a 1 or 2 as indicated above the box. If you enter
          anything else, you will hear a beep and cursor will
          remain in the box until you enter correct number. When
          you enter correct number the cursor will move to next
          box automatically.  Use 10 key numeric pad on right of
          keyboard for speeding up the player entries. You can
          enter numbers as fast as you like without worrying

          must answer Y and this will erase the players from last
          weeks game. The selection sheet puts a date in the computer
          and that date is saved with the players selections.  When you
          make a new selection sheet this causes CFP to prompt you for
          the message above.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL POOL is designed to make football pool games easier to 
play/follow/bet each week.                                              
                                                                        
A demonstration schedule is included.  Pick the week you want, and all  
the games for that week will be displayed.  Choose any fourteen games   
for the selection sheet.  The object of the game is for each player to  
try to pick the most winners of the 14 weekly games.  Selection         
sheets can then be printed showing all the players' choices.            
                                                                        
After the games are completed, enter the winning teams and print a final
report showing the number of games each player picked correctly.  In the
event of ties, the player who was the closest in guessing the total     
number of points scored in the last game on the selection sheet is      
declared the winner.  Up to 300 players can be handled by this program.
