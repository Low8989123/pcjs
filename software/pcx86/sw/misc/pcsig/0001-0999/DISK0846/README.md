PROGRAMMED-
COMPUTER AIDED
LEARNINGA
____________________________________________________________



           ECC Learning Systems offer an unique approach to learning
software application programs.  P-CALA (Programmed-Computer
Aided LearningA) uses the elements of computer interaction,
workbook exercises, cognitive response, real look and feel
simulations, and guided direct experience to facilitate an effective
learning experience.  This approach reduces the learning curve and
increases learning retention.

There are five other approaches used in teaching software
application programs.  First, is the instructor led classroom
situation.  Usually there are handouts, demonstrations and guided
direct experience incorporated in the classroom situation.  Second,
is the textbook approach.  A person purchases a book and works
independently to learn how to use the software application.  Third,
is the video based training method.  The student and follows the
instructions of the teacher on the tape while he uses the specific
application program on his computer.  Fourth, is the tape recorder
and workbook technique.  The student listens to a tape and follows
its instructions while practicing exercises relating to the application
program he is studying.  Lastly, is the disk-based tutorial. This is a
computer program which provides information on the application
program the student wants to learn and allows him/her to practice
simulations of the program.







P-CALAtakes a combination approach of a disk-based tutorial,
workbook, and practice in the application program.  This is
classified as PROGRAMMED because these elements are interactive
and directive.  The workbook will direct the student to use the
disk-based tutorial, the disk-based tutorial will direct the student to
use the workbook, the workbook will guide the student while
he/she is using the application program, and the workbook and
disk-based tutorial are used simultaneously.  All in all there is a high
degree of student participation while using several different types of
learning mediums.  P-CALAtakes a distinctive educational approach
utilizing solid learning theory and practical learning experiences.

____________________________________________________________


The basic layout of the computer keyboard includes the
typewriter keys, function keys and calculator/cursor keys.  Alpha
and numeric keys both in lower and upper case occupy one section
of the keyboard.  There is also a collection of keys that closely
resemble a 10-key pad normally found on a calculator, and another
special set of keys are labeled with F1 through F10...?  A variety of
keyboards are available today, some with special cursor movement
keys, mouse pads, drawing pads, etc...


        AT STYLE KEYBOARD


This style of keyboard is organized into three areas.  The first area is
the basic typewriter section and is located in the center of the
keyboard.  The second area is the 10-key pad located to the right of
the main typewriting section and is composed of number keys
which double as cursor movement keys.  It also includes plus,
minus, multiply, and special symbol keys.

To the left of the typewriter section are the function keys. They are
numbered from F1 through F10.


     ENHANCED STYLE KEYBOARD















This keyboard style expands the types and number of keys available
to the user.  In addition to the three parts mentioned for the AT
style keyboard there is a special set of keys between the typewriter
and 10-key pad.  These two groups of keys are for moving the
cursor exclusively.  They allow the 10-key pad to be used for
number entry only.

Another difference between the two keyboards mentioned is that
the enhanced keyboard puts the function keys across the top of the
keyboard instead of down the left side as on the AT style keyboard.

Regardless of the location of the keys on the various keyboards,
they perform exactly the same tasks.

ABOUT THIS PROGRAM
____________________________________________________________


Welcome to The LOTUS LEARNING SYSTEM.  This program
is especially designed for the novice computer/spreadsheet user.  
LLS (The LOTUS LEARNING SYSTEM) has been used extensively in
classroom and independent study situations.  If you do not know
how to 'boot' your system, change your current drive, name files or
load a program, this workbook will provide help with these
maintenance tasks.  This workbook describes how to get started,
the files on the diskettes, the menu structure of the disk-based
tutorial, and how to use the components of the total program.  In
addition to these explanations, this workbook contains questions
and exercises which are used in conjunction with the disk-based
tutorial.  Be sure to take the time to read this workbook up to
CELL ADDRESSES before starting up the disk-based tutorial.

LLS is organized into three components, a 500+ screen disk-based
tutorial, this workbook, and a Lotus 1-2-3 worksheet file
INTRO.WK1.  The disk-based tutorial is loaded into the computer
by executing the command "Learn Lotus".  A short series of screens
will introduce you to the topics covered, the conventions used in
the tutorial and an explanation of its menus.  The tutorial is very
user friendly.  At the bottom of each screen are options which you
can use to control the program.  Specific function keys allow you to
backup a screen, go to a menu, skip over a practice session or
proceed with the course.  When viewing a menu, the program
provides a brief explanation of topics covered by each menu option.  
Below the menu is an explanation of which keys select a menu
option.  During your studies in the disk-based tutorial you will be
directed to STOP and complete exercises in this workbook.  This
workbook contains carefully selected questions to help you focus
on important facts about Lotus 1-2-3.  The questions should be
answered as you proceed through the disk-based tutorial.  The
exercises the disk-based tutorial directs you to complete, include a
brief explanation, an example, and answers for the exercise.  As you
complete each exercise this workbook directs you to continue your
studies in the disk-based tutorial.  After studying the disk-based
tutorial, answering the questions and completing the exercises, you
can load your Lotus 1-2-3 program and using the file INTRO.WK1
build two financial models.  This last component is optional
depending on whether or not you have Lotus 1-2-3.  The last
section of this workbook, building models, provides step-by-step
directions for using the Lotus file INTRO.WK1.  The Lotus 1-2-3 file
INTRO.WK1 is an automated program which will guide you through
the model building process by itself so you may not need to use the
printed directions to build the financial models.

HOW TO USE THIS COURSE

Wouldn't it be tragically ironic to spend hours on this
program and yet fail to learn Lotus 1-2-3.  Don't take shortcuts and
don't skip over material.  Make the commitment right now to use
the disk-based tutorial as the basis for all your studies.  Answer all
of the questions in the workbook.  Complete the exercises when
directed to do so.  Preview the lesson objectives, study the lesson,
review the lesson objectives, and determine whether or not you
should go over the lesson material again.  Continue with the course
only when you have an understanding of a lesson that matches the
lesson objectives.  If you follow this carefully designed program
you will become proficient in the features of Lotus 1-2-3.

GETTING AROUND THE TUTORIAL

The structure of the menus in any program is the primary
means you have to communicate with the program.  This is true
with LLS also.  There are three menus in the program,  the ACCESS
MENU, the MAIN MENU and the COMMAND WORD MENU.  The
ACCESS MENU contains three options, GETTING STARTED, MAIN
MENU and COMMAND WORD MENU.  The program is designed
so that lesson material is presented in the proper order when the
option on the menus are selected from top to bottom.  Therefore,
you should study GETTING STARTED first and MAIN MENU
second.  The COMMAND WORD MENU is an option for review,
you should not select COMMAND WORD MENU from the
ACCESS MENU unless you have finished the entire course.

The MAIN MENU contains the bulk of the facts about Lotus 1-2-3.
The menu options should be selected from top to bottom starting
with Spreadsheet Background.  The menu option, Lotus Menu
Structure, provides real look and feel practice sessions using actual
Lotus 1-2-3 commands.  Each Lotus main menu command word is
explained and you are led through an actual application of that
command word.  Don't worry... you can't make any mistakes!  The
tutorial is designed so that you must learn how to use the
commands correctly the first time.  If you touch the wrong key, the
computer beeps and allows you to type the correct key.

The menu option Trial Balance Model is an explanation of how to
use the worksheet file INTRO.WK1 to build the financial model Trial
Balance.  The menu option Profit/Loss Model is an explanation of
how to use the worksheet file INTRO.WK1 to build the financial
model Profit/Loss.  These should be the last two subjects you
complete in the disk-based tutorial.

Getting around the menus is easy.  Observe the diagram below.  
For example, to move from the COMMAND WORD MENU to the
MAIN MENU you simply put your highlighted cursor bar on the
option MAIN MENU and press <ENTER>.  To get from the ACCESS
MENU to the MAIN MENU put the cursor bar on MAIN MENU and
press <ENTER>.  If you are unclear about what keys to press on
any screen, look at the bottom of the screen and you will see the
possibilities listed there for you.  Simply select the one you want to
use.

                      TUTORIAL MENU STRUCTURE



CONVENTIONS USED IN THE TUTORIAL

The computer screen is designed to help you be in control of
the tutorial.  This is accomplished by providing you function keys
that will allow you to Go Back One Screen, Go To The Main Menu,
Skip a Practice Session or Go To The Next Screen.  See the diagram
below for the illustration of the screen design:


                        SHORT CUT MENUS
                            \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
____________________________________________________________
_______________________________________

There are two short cut menus at the beginning of the
tutorial.  These will speed up your use of the tutorial AFTER your
initial use of the program.

TUTORIAL ACCESS MENU

This menu, illustrated below, is the first short cut menu you
will encounter in the disk-based tutorial.  On this menu, in addition
to the choices at the bottom of all the screens, are the options F, C,
and R.  Option F, For the first-time user, must be selected by
first-time users of the tutorial.  This option takes you through a
series of screens which explain the conventions used in the tutorial
and the menu structure.  Option C, For the continuing student, is
used after you have begun studying the workbook exercises.  It
takes you to another short cut menu, QUICK ACCESS.  The QUICK
ACCESS MENU allows you to re-start the tutorial from the last
completed subject.  Option R, For the person who wants to review
the tutorial, takes you directly to the ACCESS MENU and allows
you to choose either the MAIN MENU or the COMMAND WORD
MENU.  From these two menus you can select the specific subjects
you want to review.


QUICK ACCESS MENU

The QUICK ACCESS menu is selected by choosing option C
from the TUTORIAL ACCESS MENU. This is the menu you will use
when you re-load The LOTUS LEARNING SYSTEM to continue your
studies. On this menu, illustrated below, are the options Cell
Addresses, Cell Formulas, etc..., in addition to the choices at the

Follow the steps below to format your diskettes.  The words which
are enclosed within < > symbols refer to specific keys on the
computer keyboard, for example, <ENTER> refers to the ENTER
key on the keyboard.  Words or letters, in bold, following the word
type, are to be typed from the keyboard, for example, you would
type FORMAT B: when you see FORMAT B: following the word
type.

1.  Put DOS System diskette in
drive A and a blank
diskette in drive B.

2.  At the A> prompt, type

FORMAT B:

and press

<ENTER>

3.  When you see the message:

Insert new diskette in drive B:
Strike any key when ready_

Make sure you have the blank diskette in drive B: then tap

<ENTER>

If for some reason formatting does not begin, check to see that the
diskette is inserted with the label side up, and the "right protect"
notch is on the left side of the diskette.  Also check to be sure the
disk drive door is closed.  If either correction is made, tap

<ENTER>

 If you cannot begin the format process with these
instructions, check with your DOS manuals.

4.  As the disk is being formatted a message will appear on the

Format Another (Y/N)?_

6.  Remove the formatted diskette from drive B: and insert the other
blank diskette for formatting.

7.  Press

 <Y>

for yes, this tells DOS to format another diskette.

8.  Repeat steps 3 through 5.

9.  When formatting is complete press N for No, this tells DOS that
you are through formatting.

PREPARING DISKETTES:  (Hard Drive System)
Format

provides a way to move from one Lotus 1-2-3 module to another.

ANCHOR CELL  The first cell in a range of cell(s) upon which
various actions may be taken i.e. move, copy, print, etc...

ARGUMENT  @FUNCTIONS or macros require arguments.
Arguments are a value or set of values used with an @FUNCTION
or macro which define what the impact will be on the worksheet.

CALC  An indicator, located at the bottom of the worksheet screen,
which indicates that changes have been made to the worksheet
since the last manual recalculation. It is recommended that a
manual recalculation be performed prior to saving, print etc. the
worksheet.

COLUMN  A column is a vertical block of cells in the worksheet
designated with an alphabetic letter.

COMMAND  The name of a routine that performs a task in the
worksheet.  Commands are accessed by pressing the </> slash
key on the keyboard.  The main commands in Lotus 1-2-3 are
Worksheet, Range, Copy, Move, File, Print, Graph, Data, System
and Quit.

CRITERIA  These are tests used in various database functions and
commands.  Criteria is comprised of cell(s) whose contents define
or limit the actions of those functions or commands.

CURSOR  The flashing underline or block on the screen which
identifies either the location where data may be entered or
highlights a command which can be executed.

DATABASE  A range of cells organize in fields and records for the
purpose of sorting, extracting, manipulating, etc... simple data.  It
can contain values or labels but cannot contain formulas, blanks, or
@functions.

DRIVER  Normally refers to the program that properly coordinates
the Lotus 1-2-3 program and the printer you are using.

EDIT  In this mode you can change the contents of a cell(s).  It
might be used for spelling corrections, revising formulas, or erasing
the contents of the cell(s).

ERROR  This message will flash in the upper right corner of the
screen to indicate that the program doesn't understand what it has
been requested to do, or is unable to figure out how to accomplish
it, given the current set of circumstances.  A companion message
may appear in the lower left corner of the screen to clarify the what
the problem might be.

FORMULA  Relationships established between cells which use
mathematical operators to calculate a result.

LABEL  An entry placed in any cell that starts with an alphabetical
letter or a label-prefix character (*,^,').

LOGICAL  This applies to a logical operator that you might use in a
formula to establish specific relationships. (=, <, >, <=, >=, (),
#NOT#, #AND#, #OR#, etc...).

MACRO  A saved set of keystrokes that can be reused by pressing a
two-keystroke command sequence.  The macro is used to automate
the processing of data, printing, graphing, etc... especially in a
worksheet that is used for repetitive tasks that require extensive
keystroking by the user.

MENU  Primarily refers to the Lotus 1-2-3 menu that has a
multi-level structure. It can also refer to a multi-level structure of
command words which can be defined by a user during the
development of an application using the command language of
Lotus 1-2-3.

MODE  This describes a state the program is in at any time during
its operation.  For example, READY mode indicates that the user can
enter data or call up the Main Menu.  The main modes in Lotus
1-2-3 are READY, FILE, WAIT, ERROR, CMD, etc.

NAMED RANGE  A single cell or range of cells that are named using
the </>-Range-Name-Create command series.  The primary
reason for naming a range is for ease in copying, moving, etc... the
desired cells.

PRECEDENCE  The order in which Lotus 1-2-3 will execute the
various operators in a formula.

QUIT  This command, depending on what level of the Lotus Menu
structure, will terminate the particular function.  At the main menu,
and select the menu option Quit, you will have taken the first step
to terminating the Lotus 1-2-3 program.

ROW  This is a horizontal block of cell(s) in a worksheet.

SPREADSHEET  This refers to the blank collection of rows and
columns that you use to enter data or a program that contains
various functions, commands, and formulas for financial analysis
and modeling.

____________________________________________________________
_______________________________________

Be sure you have studied the section on cell addresses in the
disk-based tutorial before attempting to complete this exercise.

Lesson Goals

After completing this exercise, you will be able to:

1.  Name the cell address of a cell at any intersection on the
spreadsheet.
2.  Use a cell address to find a cell anywhere on the spreadsheet.

Introduction

This exercise provides an application of the concepts you
have studied in the tutorial.  Recall that a cell address is defined as
the intersection of a column and row on a spreadsheet.  To write a
cell address you first identify the column letter by looking up the
column to the top of the spreadsheet, second you identify the row
number by looking to the left edge of the spreadsheet.  A cell
address is written with the column letter first, then the row number.

Exercise

In the exercise below, identify the cell address for each
shaded cell by writing the cell address at the right edge of the row,
containing the shaded cell.  In the example below, the shaded area
on the left has the cell address B2, and the shaded area on the right
has the cell address E4.

Write the answers to the exercise in the blocks provided.

REVIEW

When identifying a cell address first locate the cell you wish
to identify.  Then look up to the column letter and left to the row
number.  Write down the column letter first and then the row
number.  An electronic spreadsheet has columns and rows.  Each
column is assigned a letter from A to IV.  Lotus 1-2-3 has a total of
254 columns.  Each row is assigned a number from 1 to 8192.  
Lotus 1-2-3 has a total of 2,000,000 cells at the intersections of
columns and rows which are identified by cell addresses.



                       RELATIVE REFERENCE
                            \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
____________________________________________________________


Be sure you have studied the disk-based tutorial on relative cell
references before attempting to complete this exercise.

Lesson Goals

After completing this exercise, you will be able to:

1.Use a relative cell reference to import a value from another
cell to the current cell.
2.Copy a relative cell reference to obtain expected results.
3.Apply the general rule that Lotus 1-2-3 uses to locate the cell
referenced in the current cell.
