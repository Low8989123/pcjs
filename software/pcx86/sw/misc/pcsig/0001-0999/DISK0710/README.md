## Information about "INSTACALC"

    INSTACALC is a full-featured spreadsheet program with an interesting
    twist: it's memory-resident.  This means that on the first run, nothing
    seems to happen.  INSTACALC has simply been loaded into memory and is
    now waiting for you to call it up by pressing ``Alt I''. INSTACALC waits
    patiently while you type a letter with your wordprocessor, update your
    database, or whatever.  Then when you press ``Alt I'', it's on the
    screen and ready to serve you.  This has some very useful applications,
    such as incorporating part of a spreadsheet table into a wordprocessing
    file, or cutting and pasting with other programs.  You can import and
    export from Lotus 1-2-3, dBASE, and .DIF files.  PC Magazine made
    INSTACALC an Editor's Choice among low cost spreadsheets.
