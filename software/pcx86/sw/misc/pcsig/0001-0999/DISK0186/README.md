## Information about "SCREEN AND PRINTER"

    The printer utilities in this package are for Epson and compatible
    printers.  Control your printer from the keyboard.  Specify a variety
    of print modes and fonts such as compressed, italics, emphasized,
    underline, and more -- from within other applications.
    
    SP is a print spooler used to hold data intended for the printer.
    It works like the buffers that can be installed in the printer but the
    data is stored in RAM storage instead of in the printer.  The buffer
    is unloaded to the printer at the printer's speed while DOS proceeds
    at its speed.  You can specify the the size of the buffer from 1k to
    62K, the number of copies desired, and also which printer port you want
    to use.

PC-SIG Disk No. #186, version v1 

The following is a list of the file checksums which should be produced by
the CRCK4 program on disk #9 (and others).  If the CRC numbers do not match
you may have a bad file.  To use type:  CRCK4 <filespec>

If you want the PRINT.COM program in dos 2.0 to skip
the prompt for the output list device, to allow for
automatic installation at boot-up,
 
A>debug print.com
-e c0d 90 90
-e c14 90 90
 
If your printer is the default, (LPT1:), that's all 
there is to it.  Write the file to disk and quit.
If your printer is attached to some other port,
like LPT2:, you must make one more patch, to specify
the device.
 
-e 120d 5 "LPT2:"
 
The "5" in this case is the number of characters in 
the name of the device.  Substitute for whatever port
your printer is attached to, then,
 
-w
Writing xx bytes
-q
A>
 
And thats all there is to it.

 PRINTSET, BY MICHAEL W. CSONTOS  1/18/83

THIS "PROGRAM" SETS UP THE EPSON PRINTER TO PRINT COMPRESSED PRINT
WITH 1/8 IN SPACING WITH AUTO-SKIP-OVER-PERF ON 11 INCH PAGES. IT
ALSO RESETS THE PRINTER TO TOP-OF-FORM WHEN IT IS RUN.

TO "RUN" THE PROGRAM TURN ON THE PRINTER AND, IN DOS, TYPE "TYPE PRINTSET".

THE CHARACTERS THAT APPEAR ON THE SCREEN AND THE BEEP ARE THE RESULT OF
DOS INTERPRETING THE EPSON COMMAND CODES. THE DOTS THAT ARE PRINTED ON THE 
PRINTER WERE JUST TO HELP IN DEBUGGING THE PROGRAM AND TO SHOW THAT IT 
FUNCTIONED PROPERLY.  IT TOOK QUITE A WHILE TO FIND A CODE THAT WAS 
COMPATABLE WITH EDLIN, DOS, AND THE EPSON!

I FIND THIS SMALL ROUTINE VERY USEFUL IN PRINTING OUT LONG DOCUMENTATION 
FILES WITHOUT USING TOO MUCH PAPER.

SCROLLK:  This machine-language program is attached to DOS
whenever you run scrollk.com with the A> prompt showing. It
allows much better scroll control than <Ctrl-NumLock>. See
John Socha's article in Softalk for the IBM Personal Computer
for May 1983 for more information. Scrollk will be handy in 
using files under Directory 4: "Quick Looks at Distant BBSs".

			SP: A PRINT SPOOLER
		    for the IBM Personal Computer
			    Version 3.81

SP is a software printer buffer to hold data intended for the printer.
It works like the buffers that can be installed in the printer but the
data is stored in RAM storage instead of in the printer.  The buffer
is unloaded to the printer at the printer's speed while DOS proceeds
at its speed.  The size of the buffer is specified as a parameter when
SP is invoked.	For example,

	    SP 14

will produce a buffer of 14KB (1KB = 1024 bytes).

The complete syntax is:

     SP [ss] [C=cc] [P=pp]

where:

	ss: size of buffer in kilobytes.  One kilobyte = 1024 bytes.
	    Maximum size is 62 KB.

	cc: number of copies desired.  Default: 1.

	pp: printer port desired (1, 2, or 3).	Default: 1.

NOTE:  You do not type the square brackets.  They merely indicate that the
contents are optional.	For example, if you want to use printer port 2 with
a buffer size of 20 KB, you would enter:

	SP 20 P=2

If you want to keep the previous buffer and only change the number of
copies to 3 copies, enter:

	SP C=3

For the "C" and "P" you can enter either upper or lower case characters.

If the size parameter is omitted, a default buffer of 16KB is used.

The program will work for all work sent to the printer whether it is from
the DOS TYPE command, a PrtSc command, a BASIC LLIST or LPRINT command, a
print command from The Personal Editor, etc.


TO STOP PRINTING

If you start a printout and decide you don't want it, press,
simultaneously, Alt-LeftShift-PrtSc to flush the buffer.  You can also
flush the buffer by turning the printer off and then back on.



TO PAUSE

If you want the printing to pause, hold down the ON LINE button until the
printer stops (which it will do at the end of a line).	Pressing the ON
LINE button again will allow printing to resume with no loss of data.


CHANGING BUFFER SIZE

You can remove SP from the machine by specifying a buffer of zero.  That
is:

      SP 0


will return DOS to its original state unless another DOS extension is
installed after SP such as FileCommand.

You can change the size of the buffer by re-invoking SP with the new
parameter.  In this case, SP determines that there is already a copy
present in the machine and just alters the size of the buffer of the
older copy.  (This feature not available for DOS 2.0.  However, you can
remove SP and then re-invoke it to get a different buffer size.)  If
the last copy of SP installed was other than printer 1, you must specify
the printer to remove it, e.g.:

     SP 0 P=2



MULTIPLE COPIES

To create multiple copies of a document, you must indicate to SP where the
beginning and end of the document is.  To indicate the beginning of a
document press Alt-LeftShift-B.  To indicate the end of a document press
Alt-LeftShift-E.  Of course, if you have indicated only one copy, that is
all you will get.  You can press the END indication when SP has gobbled up
the text.  You don't have to wait until the first copy is printed.

One nice way of using the multiple copies is after the fact.  That is, if
you just printed a document and decide you'd like another copy, from DOS
indicate the TOTAL number of copies you want (2 or more) and then invoke
the END indication.  SP will determine that one copy has already been
printed and proceed to print the rest according to the quantity specified.

You have to be a bit careful.  Once you indicate the beginning of a
document (Alt-LeftShift-B) that remains the beginning until you change it.
If you print multiple copies of something and then send something else to
the printer and again indicate the END, you will get a document from the
most recent BEGIN.  This may or may not be what you want.


MULTIPLE PRINTERS

SP can support more than one printer.  When you invoke SP it creates a
buffer for the specified printer.  If you do not specify one, it will
create a buffer for LPT1.  You can then re-invoke SP specifying another
printer and a new buffer will be created.  From then on, the data going to
the printer will enter the appropriate buffer and be printed on the
appropriate printer.  When you give keyboard commands, SP does not know
which printer they apply for so it uses them for all.  That is, if you
flush the buffer (Alt-LeftShift-PrtSc) all buffers will be flushed.  If you
indicate the end of a document, this will apply to all buffers.



CAVEATS:

When using with VisiCalc, do not specify a buffer larger than 23K with DOS
1.1 or 10K with DOS 2.0 since VisiCalc will not load (it cannot cross a 64K
boundary during loading.)

There is a problem when using SP with the Personal Editor Version 1.0 on
some occasions when quiting a file.  This has turned out to be a problem in
PE.  To patch PE:  On a scratch disk, rename a copy of PE.EXE to XX and
DEBUG XX.  Type E DS:56E7 and change 6 bytes of code to hex 90 by typing 90
and pressing the space bar 6 times.  The previous contents of those bytes
should be C7 06 56 EF 00 00.  Then use the debug command W (write) to write
the file back out.  Then Q (quit) to leave DEBUG and rename XX back to
PE.EXE.

When using it in some environments such as EasyWriter, there may be
commands that allow you to stop the printer.  However, when SP is present,
the program will be way ahead of the printer and will only stop sending
data to the buffer.  In cases like this, turn off the printer and then turn
back on again to stop printing.

See below.

COPYING

SP can be copied onto one of your own diskettes for use on your machine.
In fact we recommend including it in your AUTOEXEC's so that it is always
invoked.

DISCLAIMER.

In no event will the Author be liable to you for any damages, including any
lost profits, lost savings or other incidental or consequential damages
arising out of the use of or inability to use these programs, even if the
Author has been advised of the possibility of such damages, or for any
claim by any other party.

PERMISSION TO COPY:

Clubs and other non-profit organizations are granted permission by the
author to freely copy these programs and documentation and share it with
their members, so long as:

1.  No price is charged for the software or documentation.  However, a
    distribution cost may be charged for the cost of the diskette, so long
    as it is not more than $10 total.

2.  Club members are informed of the user-supported concept and encouraged
    to support it with their donations.

3.  The program or documentation are not modified in any way and are
    distributed together.


THE USER-SUPPORTED CONCEPT.

			User-Supported Software
       If you are using this program and find it to be of value
		your contribution will be appreciated.
			  ($15 is suggested)

			    Alan Jones

			  Endwell, NY 13760

	    Regardless of whether you make a contribution,
	  you are encouraged to copy and share this program.



User-supported software is an experiment in distributing computer
programs, based on these beliefs:

1.  That the value and utility of software is best assessed by the
    user on his/her own system.

2.  That the creation of personal computer software can and should
    be supported by the computing community.

3.  That copying of programs should be encouraged, rather than
    restricted.

Anyone may request a copy of a user-supported program by sending a blank,
formatted disk to the author of the program.  An addressed, postage-paid
return mailer must accompany the disk (no exceptions, please).	A copy of
the program, with documentation on the disk, will be sent by return mail.
The program will carry a notice suggesting a contribution to the program's
author.  Making a contribution is completely voluntary on the part of each
user.

Free distribution of software and voluntary payment for its use eliminates
costs for advertising and copy protection schemes.

Users obtain quality software at reduced cost.	They can try it out before
buying, and do so at their own pace and in the comfort of their own home or
office.  The best programs will survive, based purely on their quality and
usefulness.

Please join the experiment.

If you believe in these ideals, your contribution is solicited to help make
them work.

Many of you have written requesting an invoice so that you could initiate
payment through your company accounting system.  The following invoice is
provided for those of you in this category, or for those who wish an
invoice for your tax records.  Perhaps it will serve the purpose.

PRTSCFX.DOC -- Documentation for PrtScFX	9/24/84

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.3

This version fixes a bug in 1.2 where the "D" dark print mode missed
part of the top line of the screen.

Be warned that ProKey has a bug which makes it crash if it is used with
PrtScFX.  Because of this bug, PrtScFX attempts to determine (when you
press Shift-PrtSc) whether ProKey is active.  If it is, a normal screen
dump is done instead of giving you the choice of a graphics dump.  You
can include both ProKey and PrtScFX in your AUTOEXEC, but if you do, you
will not be able to get graphics dumps until you do a PROKEY/Q command
to disable ProKey.

Also, the test for discovering ProKey's presence is imperfect.  If you
are running a program which grabs the keyboard interrupt (such as
Framework or BASICA), PrtScFX may not be able to tell that ProKey is
active.  To be completely safe, such programs should be run from batch
files which disable ProKey.  For example, if you use Framework, you
might rename FW.EXE as FRAMEWRK.EXE and then use a FW.BAT file
containing these commands:

prokey /q
cd \frame		    (or wherever)
framewrk
prokey /i

(If you have Framework V1.00, you will need to do this anyway, since it
does not get along with ProKey.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PrtScFX is a screen dump program which prints a graphic image of a text
mode display on an Epson FX or RX (not MX!) series printer.  The printout
looks just like a screen display, including connected line graphics.

This is different from other graphics dumps, such as IBM's GRAPHICS program.
GRAPHICS dumps a graphics mode screen; PrtScFX dumps a text mode screen.

PrtScFX should be run once, typically from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  From
then on, if you are in 80 column text mode, the Shift-Prtsc key will give
you the prompt:

G = text graphics dump, D = darker graphics, SPACE = normal dump, Esc = cancel

and you can type:

    G		for a text mode graphics dump
    D		for a better quality (double-strike) text graphics dump
    Space Bar	for a "normal" screen dump (passes the request on to the
		standard - or other special - screen dump utility)
    Esc 	to cancel the screen dump request

Either the IBM Monochrome Display or the color/graphics adapter can be
used, but only 80-column TEXT mode displays are dumped.  For either display
adapter, the printout duplicates the font of the IBM Monochrome Display.

PrtScFX coexists nicely with IBM's GRAPHICS program.  Just run them both in
your AUTOEXEC (in either order), and then GRAPHICS will handle graphics
mode displays, and PrtScFX will kick in for text mode.

PrtScFX produced the illustrations of Transend PC screens in my article
(with Richard Moore), "A Communications Package for the IBM PC", in the
November 1983 BYTE magazine.  For camera-ready art like this, I recommend:

 *  A fairly fresh ribbon - but not brand new (smudges).  The one we used
    in the article was a little faint.
 *  Good quality bond paper - not typical printout paper (the ink bleeds).
 *  If available, friction feed instead of pin feed - better registration.
 *  The D option for double-strike graphics.

In the article, we used a ribbon that was just a little too faint.


PrtScFX is placed in the public domain without restriction.

FILES
-----

If you just want to use PrtScFX, you just need PRTSCFX.COM

If you want to modify and/or re-assemble PrtScFX, the source files are
PRTSCFX.ASM and MONOCG.ASM.  The latter file contains the character
generator data from the ROM on the display adapters.  If you don't need to
modify this, just use MONOCG.OBJ.


ASSEMBLING & LINKING
--------------------

(change drive letters as needed)

B>masm PrtScFX ;
B>masm MonoCG ;     (omit if you have MONOCG.OBJ)
B>link PrtScFX + MonoCG ;
If you have the Spacemaker program by Realia, Inc.:
    B>sm PrtScFX ; /s
If you don't have Spacemaker, you should get it!  For now, use:
    B>exe2bin PrtScFX.exe PrtScFX.com
    (Your .COM file will be larger using exe2bin)
B>erase PrtScFX.exe

Suggested modifications:  Handle 40 column text, clean up & document code
(sorry, it started out as a "quick and dirty" program).

PRTSCFX.DOC -- Documentation for PrtScFX	9/24/84

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.3

This version fixes a bug in 1.2 where the "D" dark print mode missed
part of the top line of the screen.

Be warned that ProKey has a bug which makes it crash if it is used with
PrtScFX.  Because of this bug, PrtScFX attempts to determine (when you
press Shift-PrtSc) whether ProKey is active.  If it is, a normal screen
dump is done instead of giving you the choice of a graphics dump.  You
can include both ProKey and PrtScFX in your AUTOEXEC, but if you do, you
will not be able to get graphics dumps until you do a PROKEY/Q command
to disable ProKey.

Also, the test for discovering ProKey's presence is imperfect.  If you
are running a program which grabs the keyboard interrupt (such as
Framework or BASICA), PrtScFX may not be able to tell that ProKey is
active.  To be completely safe, such programs should be run from batch
files which disable ProKey.  For example, if you use Framework, you
might rename FW.EXE as FRAMEWRK.EXE and then use a FW.BAT file
containing these commands:

prokey /q
cd \frame		    (or wherever)
framewrk
prokey /i

(If you have Framework V1.00, you will need to do this anyway, since it
does not get along with ProKey.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PrtScFX is a screen dump program which prints a graphic image of a text
mode display on an Epson FX or RX (not MX!) series printer.  The printout
looks just like a screen display, including connected line graphics.

This is different from other graphics dumps, such as IBM's GRAPHICS program.
GRAPHICS dumps a graphics mode screen; PrtScFX dumps a text mode screen.

PrtScFX should be run once, typically from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  From
then on, if you are in 80 column text mode, the Shift-Prtsc key will give
you the prompt:

G = text graphics dump, D = darker graphics, SPACE = normal dump, Esc = cancel

and you can type:

    G		for a text mode graphics dump
    D		for a better quality (double-strike) text graphics dump
    Space Bar	for a "normal" screen dump (passes the request on to the
		standard - or other special - screen dump utility)
    Esc 	to cancel the screen dump request

Either the IBM Monochrome Display or the color/graphics adapter can be
used, but only 80-column TEXT mode displays are dumped.  For either display
adapter, the printout duplicates the font of the IBM Monochrome Display.

PrtScFX coexists nicely with IBM's GRAPHICS program.  Just run them both in
your AUTOEXEC (in either order), and then GRAPHICS will handle graphics
mode displays, and PrtScFX will kick in for text mode.

PrtScFX produced the illustrations of Transend PC screens in my article
(with Richard Moore), "A Communications Package for the IBM PC", in the
November 1983 BYTE magazine.  For camera-ready art like this, I recommend:

 *  A fairly fresh ribbon - but not brand new (smudges).  The one we used
    in the article was a little faint.
 *  Good quality bond paper - not typical printout paper (the ink bleeds).
 *  If available, friction feed instead of pin feed - better registration.
 *  The D option for double-strike graphics.

In the article, we used a ribbon that was just a little too faint.


PrtScFX is placed in the public domain without restriction.

FILES
-----

If you just want to use PrtScFX, you just need PRTSCFX.COM

If you want to modify and/or re-assemble PrtScFX, the source files are
PRTSCFX.ASM and MONOCG.ASM.  The latter file contains the character
generator data from the ROM on the display adapters.  If you don't need to
modify this, just use MONOCG.OBJ.


ASSEMBLING & LINKING
--------------------

(change drive letters as needed)

B>masm PrtScFX ;
B>masm MonoCG ;     (omit if you have MONOCG.OBJ)
B>link PrtScFX + MonoCG ;
If you have the Spacemaker program by Realia, Inc.:
    B>sm PrtScFX ; /s
If you don't have Spacemaker, you should get it!  For now, use:
    B>exe2bin PrtScFX.exe PrtScFX.com
    (Your .COM file will be larger using exe2bin)
B>erase PrtScFX.exe

Suggested modifications:  Handle 40 column text, clean up & document code
(sorry, it started out as a "quick and dirty" program).

High-resolution EGA Windows drivers by Michael Geary

12/9/86


INTRODUCTION
------------

This package of Windows drivers includes several high-resolution drivers for
Enhanced Graphic Adapters with various monitors.  Most of the drivers
require a 24mhz adapter card to be installed in the feature connector of the
EGA.  Brief instructions for building this card are given below; more
complete instructions can be found in the September 16, 1986 issue of PC
Magazine, page 298.

These drivers and the 24mhz adapter card will work with any EGA card that
has 256K memory.  They do not require one of the new "enhanced" EGA's.
(The 24mhz adapter makes your EGA an "enhanced" EGA equivalent to the VEGA
Deluxe card from Video-7.)

The following drivers are included in this package:

Filenames    Resolution   Display type                24mhz req'd
----------   ----------   -------------------------   -----------
E640X480.*   640 x 480    Multisync                   Yes
E752X410.*   752 x 410    Multisync                   Yes
E896X350.*   896 x 350    Standard ECD or Multisync   Yes
M720X350.*   720 x 350    Monochrome                  No

These drivers have been tested with Windows versions 1.01 and 1.03.  They
should also work with future Windows versions.


HOW TO INSTALL THE DRIVERS
--------------------------

For each driver, there are three files, .DRV, .GRB, and .LGO.  To use the
drivers, these files should be copied to your Windows SETUP and BUILD disks.
Follow these instructions to install the drivers on your Windows disks.

1.  Make copies of the SETUP and BUILD disks and work on the copies, not the
    originals!!  You will be deleting some files from these disks to make
    room for the new drivers.

2.  Delete some files from the SETUP disk to make room for the .DRV files.
    I recommend deleting CGA.DRV, HERCULES.DRV, EGALORES.DRV, EMM.PC, and
    EMM.AT.  For Windows 1.01 and 1.03, this frees up enough space.

3.  Copy *.DRV from this directory onto the SETUP disk.

4.  Copy *.GRB and *.LGO from this directory onto the BUILD disk.

5.  That completes the installation of the enhanced drivers.  Now put the
    SETUP disk in drive A: and run SETUP as you would normally.  You will
    see the additional drivers listed when it asks you what kind of display
    you have.  Choose the one you want and try it out!

Note: If you install the 896x350 driver, you may find that the standard
system font looks awfully tall and skinny.  You may prefer the alternate
font, which is normally used with a CGA, and will give smaller, but more
normal looking characters.  If you want to try this font, then on your
SETUP disk, rename HIFONTS.FON as HIFONTS.STD and then rename LOFONTS.FON
as HIFONTS.FON, and re-run SETUP.  (You can rename the files back again if
you change your mind.)  This is also a useful trick with the other screen
resolutions if you would rather fit more lines of text on the screen when
using the system font.  It doesn't affect other fonts such as used in WRITE.


HOW TO BUILD THE 24MHZ FEATURE CARD
-----------------------------------

To use any of these drivers except the 720x350 Monochrome, you will need to
build a 24mhz "feature card" and install it on your EGA.  This is a very
simple card, with only one main component, a crystal oscillator.  If you
would like step-by-step instructions for building this card, I recommend
getting the September 16, 1986 issue of PC Magazine, and following the
instructions on page 298.  Here are brief instructions for those who are
familiar with building electronic hardware.

You will need these parts, available from a number of suppliers, including
JDR Microdevices, 1224 S. Bascom Av., San Jose, CA 95128;  (800) 538-5000
or (800) 662-6279 in California.  The total cost for parts will be around
ten dollars plus shipping.

JDR Item #      Description
----------      ----------------------------------
OSC24.0         24.0 MHZ crystal oscillator
HDR-80          2x40 breakable header strip
P25x45          Bare 2.5 x 4.5 " prototyping board
14 PIN ST       14-pin low profile IC socket

Cut the header strip so you have two rows of 16 pins each.  Cut the
prototyping board to about 1.5 x 2 inches.  Push the short pins of the
header strip through the holes along one edge of the board and glue it in
place.  (But keep the glue off the pins - you will be soldering on them.)
In the middle of the board, push the IC socket through from the other side
and glue it in place.

Cut three short pieces of hookup wire, and connect the IC socket to the
2x16 header strip as follows (you will need to pass the wires through some
holes in the board):

IC socket       Header strip    Function
---------       ------------    --------
   7                 31         Ground
  14                 32         +5 volts
   8                 28         Signal

To identify the pins of the IC socket, note that one end of the socket has a
little notch in it.  If you are looking at the bottom of the socket (where
the pins are), and you have the notch at the top, pin 14 is at the top left.
Pin 8 is at the bottom left.  Pin 7 is at the bottom right.

To identify the pins of the header strip, observe how it will plug in to the
EGA card.  On the EGA card, the topmost pin farthest from the metal bracket
is pin 31.  Pin 32 is right below that, and pin 28 is two over from pin 32.
Most EGA cards have pins 31 and 32 marked (and pins 1 and 2).

Finally, push the crystal oscillator into the IC socket.  There will be a
little dot at one corner of the oscillator.  This end of the oscillator goes
into the notched end of the socket.  You may need to trim the oscillator
pins a little bit to get it to seat fully in the socket.

Finally, double check all your connections, and cut off excess length on the
IC socket and header pins.  (Don't cut off the header pins where they will
plug in to the EGA!  It's the pins that pass through the card that should be
trimmed.)

Plug the card into the EGA.  Check that nothing looks like it is going to
short out - you may want to cut a little piece of cardboard and put between
the adapter card and the EGA, and tape or glue it in place.  Finally,
install the EGA back into your PC.  To test it, first make sure that your
normal display operations still work!  Then, try one of the enhanced Windows
drivers.  If there's any problem, you may want to try running 120COLS.COM,
which is included with these drivers.  Just run 120COLS, and then give the
command MODE BW40, and you should have a 120 column text display on your
ECD or Multisync display (it won't work on a Monochrome display).  If the
enhanced Windows drivers and 120COLS don't work, but the EGA operates
normally otherwise, there is a problem with your feature card, and you
should remove it and double check everything.  If in doubt, check the PC
Magazine article mentioned above.

High-resolution EGA Windows drivers by Michael Geary

12/9/86


INTRODUCTION
------------

This package of Windows drivers includes several high-resolution drivers for
Enhanced Graphic Adapters with various monitors.  Most of the drivers
require a 24mhz adapter card to be installed in the feature connector of the
EGA.  Brief instructions for building this card are given below; more
complete instructions can be found in the September 16, 1986 issue of PC
Magazine, page 298.

These drivers and the 24mhz adapter card will work with any EGA card that
has 256K memory.  They do not require one of the new "enhanced" EGA's.
(The 24mhz adapter makes your EGA an "enhanced" EGA equivalent to the VEGA
Deluxe card from Video-7.)

The following drivers are included in this package:

Filenames    Resolution   Display type                24mhz req'd
----------   ----------   -------------------------   -----------
E640X480.*   640 x 480    Multisync                   Yes
E752X410.*   752 x 410    Multisync                   Yes
E896X350.*   896 x 350    Standard ECD or Multisync   Yes
M720X350.*   720 x 350    Monochrome                  No

These drivers have been tested with Windows versions 1.01 and 1.03.  They
should also work with future Windows versions.


HOW TO INSTALL THE DRIVERS
--------------------------

For each driver, there are three files, .DRV, .GRB, and .LGO.  To use the
drivers, these files should be copied to your Windows SETUP and BUILD disks.
Follow these instructions to install the drivers on your Windows disks.

1.  Make copies of the SETUP and BUILD disks and work on the copies, not the
    originals!!  You will be deleting some files from these disks to make
    room for the new drivers.

2.  Delete some files from the SETUP disk to make room for the .DRV files.
    I recommend deleting CGA.DRV, HERCULES.DRV, EGALORES.DRV, EMM.PC, and
    EMM.AT.  For Windows 1.01 and 1.03, this frees up enough space.

3.  Copy *.DRV from this directory onto the SETUP disk.

4.  Copy *.GRB and *.LGO from this directory onto the BUILD disk.

5.  That completes the installation of the enhanced drivers.  Now put the
    SETUP disk in drive A: and run SETUP as you would normally.  You will
    see the additional drivers listed when it asks you what kind of display
    you have.  Choose the one you want and try it out!

Note: If you install the 896x350 driver, you may find that the standard
system font looks awfully tall and skinny.  You may prefer the alternate
font, which is normally used with a CGA, and will give smaller, but more
normal looking characters.  If you want to try this font, then on your
SETUP disk, rename HIFONTS.FON as HIFONTS.STD and then rename LOFONTS.FON
as HIFONTS.FON, and re-run SETUP.  (You can rename the files back again if
you change your mind.)  This is also a useful trick with the other screen
resolutions if you would rather fit more lines of text on the screen when
using the system font.  It doesn't affect other fonts such as used in WRITE.


HOW TO BUILD THE 24MHZ FEATURE CARD
-----------------------------------

To use any of these drivers except the 720x350 Monochrome, you will need to
build a 24mhz "feature card" and install it on your EGA.  This is a very
simple card, with only one main component, a crystal oscillator.  If you
would like step-by-step instructions for building this card, I recommend
getting the September 16, 1986 issue of PC Magazine, and following the
instructions on page 298.  Here are brief instructions for those who are
familiar with building electronic hardware.

You will need these parts, available from a number of suppliers, including
JDR Microdevices, 1224 S. Bascom Av., San Jose, CA 95128;  (800) 538-5000
or (800) 662-6279 in California.  The total cost for parts will be around
ten dollars plus shipping.

JDR Item #      Description
----------      ----------------------------------
OSC24.0         24.0 MHZ crystal oscillator
HDR-80          2x40 breakable header strip
P25x45          Bare 2.5 x 4.5 " prototyping board
14 PIN ST       14-pin low profile IC socket

Cut the header strip so you have two rows of 16 pins each.  Cut the
prototyping board to about 1.5 x 2 inches.  Push the short pins of the
header strip through the holes along one edge of the board and glue it in
place.  (But keep the glue off the pins - you will be soldering on them.)
In the middle of the board, push the IC socket through from the other side
and glue it in place.

Cut three short pieces of hookup wire, and connect the IC socket to the
2x16 header strip as follows (you will need to pass the wires through some
holes in the board):

IC socket       Header strip    Function
---------       ------------    --------
   7                 31         Ground
  14                 32         +5 volts
   8                 28         Signal

To identify the pins of the IC socket, note that one end of the socket has a
little notch in it.  If you are looking at the bottom of the socket (where
the pins are), and you have the notch at the top, pin 14 is at the top left.
Pin 8 is at the bottom left.  Pin 7 is at the bottom right.

To identify the pins of the header strip, observe how it will plug in to the
EGA card.  On the EGA card, the topmost pin farthest from the metal bracket
is pin 31.  Pin 32 is right below that, and pin 28 is two over from pin 32.
Most EGA cards have pins 31 and 32 marked (and pins 1 and 2).

Finally, push the crystal oscillator into the IC socket.  There will be a
little dot at one corner of the oscillator.  This end of the oscillator goes
into the notched end of the socket.  You may need to trim the oscillator
pins a little bit to get it to seat fully in the socket.

Finally, double check all your connections, and cut off excess length on the
IC socket and header pins.  (Don't cut off the header pins where they will
plug in to the EGA!  It's the pins that pass through the card that should be
trimmed.)

Plug the card into the EGA.  Check that nothing looks like it is going to
short out - you may want to cut a little piece of cardboard and put between
the adapter card and the EGA, and tape or glue it in place.  Finally,
install the EGA back into your PC.  To test it, first make sure that your
normal display operations still work!  Then, try one of the enhanced Windows
drivers.  If there's any problem, you may want to try running 120COLS.COM,
which is included with these drivers.  Just run 120COLS, and then give the
command MODE BW40, and you should have a 120 column text display on your
ECD or Multisync display (it won't work on a Monochrome display).  If the
enhanced Windows drivers and 120COLS don't work, but the EGA operates
normally otherwise, there is a problem with your feature card, and you
should remove it and double check everything.  If in doubt, check the PC
Magazine article mentioned above.
