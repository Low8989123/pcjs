## Information about "THE BIBLE 6-7 (766,767,768,769,770,772)"

    This disk is part of a seven-disk set with the entire King James version
    of the Bible.  It is in text file format, making it easy to locate
    verses, add passages into documents, or prepare manuscript studies.
    
    Since it is all ASCII text files, each book is a separate file.  When
    you get the disks, the files are archived, or ``squeezed'', so you must
    first unsqueeze them onto either 19 other 360K floppies or onto your
    hard drive.  Be advised that some books of the Bible are too long to fit
    into some wordprocessors that limit the size of documents to the amount
    of available RAM.
    
    To view or search these files, you need to use a wordprocessor or some
    kind of viewing shell.  No such program is provided on this disk.

```
ACT 1:1  The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began
 both to do and teach,

ACT 1:2  Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy
 Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:

ACT 1:3  To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many
 infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things
 pertaining to the kingdom of God:

ACT 1:4  And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they
 should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father,
 which, saith he, ye have heard of me.

ACT 1:5  For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the
 Holy Ghost not many days hence.

ACT 1:6  When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying,
 Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?

ACT 1:7  And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the
 seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.

ACT 1:8  But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
 you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all
 Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.

ACT 1:9  And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken
 up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.

ACT 1:10  And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold,
 two men stood by them in white apparel;

ACT 1:11  Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into
 heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so
 come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.

ACT 1:12  Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which
 is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.

ACT 1:13  And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where
 abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas,
 Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and
 Judas the brother of James.

ACT 1:14  These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with
 the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.

ACT 1:15  And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and
 said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)

ACT 1:16  Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled,
 which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas,
 which was guide to them that took Jesus.

ACT 1:17  For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.

ACT 1:18  Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and
 falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed
 out.

ACT 1:19  And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that
 field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field
 of blood.

ACT 1:20  For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be
 desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.

ACT 1:21  Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that
 the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,

ACT 1:22  Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was
 taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his
 resurrection.

ACT 1:23  And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed
 Justus, and Matthias.

ACT 1:24  And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of
 all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,

ACT 1:25  That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which
 Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.

ACT 1:26  And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and
 he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

ACT 2:1  And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one
 accord in one place.

ACT 2:2  And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
 wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.

ACT 2:3  And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it
 sat upon each of them.

ACT 2:4  And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with
 other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.

ACT 2:5  And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every
 nation under heaven.

ACT 2:6  Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were
 confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.

ACT 2:7  And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold,
 are not all these which speak Galilaeans?

ACT 2:8  And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?

ACT 2:9  Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in
 Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,

ACT 2:10  Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about
 Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,

ACT 2:11  Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the
 wonderful works of God.

ACT 2:12  And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another,
 What meaneth this?

ACT 2:13  Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.

ACT 2:14  But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said
 unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this
 known unto you, and hearken to my words:

ACT 2:15  For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third
 hour of the day.

ACT 2:16  But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;

ACT 2:17  And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour
 out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall
 prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream
 dreams:

ACT 2:18  And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those
 days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:

ACT 2:19  And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth
 beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:

ACT 2:20  The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood,
 before the great and notable day of the Lord come:

ACT 2:21  And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name
 of the Lord shall be saved.

ACT 2:22  Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved
 of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him
 in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:

ACT 2:23  Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of
 God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:

ACT 2:24  Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it
 was not possible that he should be holden of it.

ACT 2:25  For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before
 my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:

ACT 2:26  Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also
 my flesh shall rest in hope:

ACT 2:27  Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer
 thine Holy One to see corruption.

ACT 2:28  Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full
 of joy with thy countenance.

ACT 2:29  Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch
 David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto
 this day.

ACT 2:30  Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an
 oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would
 raise up Christ to sit on his throne;

ACT 2:31  He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his
 soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.

ACT 2:32  This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.

ACT 2:33  Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received
 of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which
 ye now see and hear.

ACT 2:34  For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The
 Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,

ACT 2:35  Until I make thy foes thy footstool.

ACT 2:36  Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath
 made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.

ACT 2:37  Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said
 unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we
 do?

ACT 2:38  Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you
 in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive
 the gift of the Holy Ghost.

ACT 2:39  For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that
 are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.

ACT 2:40  And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save
 yourselves from this untoward generation.

ACT 2:41  Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same
 day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.

ACT 2:42  And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and
 fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.

ACT 2:43  And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done
 by the apostles.

ACT 2:44  And all that believed were together, and had all things common;

ACT 2:45  And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as
 every man had need.

ACT 2:46  And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and
 breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and
 singleness of heart,

ACT 2:47  Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord
 added to the church daily such as should be saved.

ACT 3:1  Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of
 prayer, being the ninth hour.

ACT 3:2  And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they
 laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms
 of them that entered into the temple;

ACT 3:3  Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.

ACT 3:4  And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.

ACT 3:5  And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.

ACT 3:6  Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give
 I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.

ACT 3:7  And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately
 his feet and ankle bones received strength.

ACT 3:8  And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the
 temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.

ACT 3:9  And all the people saw him walking and praising God:

ACT 3:10  And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate
 of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which
 had happened unto him.

ACT 3:11  And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the
 people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly
 wondering.

ACT 3:12  And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel,
 why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our
 own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?

ACT 3:13  The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our
 fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him
 in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.

ACT 3:14  But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be
 granted unto you;

ACT 3:15  And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead;
 whereof we are witnesses.

ACT 3:16  And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong,
 whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this
 perfect soundness in the presence of you all.

ACT 3:17  And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did
 also your rulers.

ACT 3:18  But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his
 prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.

ACT 3:19  Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted
 out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.

ACT 3:20  And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:

ACT 3:21  Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all
 things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the
 world began.

ACT 3:22  For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your
 God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in
 all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.

ACT 3:23  And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that
 prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.

ACT 3:24  Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as
 many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.

ACT 3:25  Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God
 made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the
 kindreds of the earth be blessed.

ACT 3:26  Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless
 you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.

ACT 4:1  And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the
 temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,

ACT 4:2  Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus
 the resurrection from the dead.

ACT 4:3  And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day:
 for it was now eventide.

ACT 4:4  Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number
 of the men was about five thousand.

ACT 4:5  And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and
 scribes,

ACT 4:6  And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and
 as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at
 Jerusalem.

ACT 4:7  And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or
 by what name, have ye done this?

ACT 4:8  Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers
 of the people, and elders of Israel,

ACT 4:9  If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man,
 by what means he is made whole;

ACT 4:10  Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by
 the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from
 the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.

ACT 4:11  This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is
 become the head of the corner.

ACT 4:12  Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name
 under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

ACT 4:13  Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that
 they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge
 of them, that they had been with Jesus.

ACT 4:14  And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could
 say nothing against it.

ACT 4:15  But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they
 conferred among themselves,

ACT 4:16  Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable
 miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in
 Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.

ACT 4:17  But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly
 threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.

ACT 4:18  And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor
 teach in the name of Jesus.

ACT 4:19  But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right
 in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.

ACT 4:20  For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.

ACT 4:21  So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding
 nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men
 glorified God for that which was done.

ACT 4:22  For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of
 healing was shewed.

ACT 4:23  And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all
 that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.

ACT 4:24  And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one
 accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and
 the sea, and all that in them is:

ACT 4:25  Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen
 rage, and the people imagine vain things?

ACT 4:26  The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered
 together against the Lord, and against his Christ.

ACT 4:27  For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed,
 both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel,
 were gathered together,

ACT 4:28  For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be
 done.

ACT 4:29  And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy
 servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,

ACT 4:30  By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders
 may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.

ACT 4:31  And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were
 assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they
 spake the word of God with boldness.

ACT 4:32  And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one
 soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed
 was his own; but they had all things common.

ACT 4:33  And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection
 of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.

ACT 4:34  Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were
 possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things
 that were sold,

ACT 4:35  And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made
 unto every man according as he had need.

ACT 4:36  And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is,
 being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of
 Cyprus,

ACT 4:37  Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the
 apostles' feet.

ACT 5:1  But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a
 possession,

ACT 5:2  And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and
 brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet.

ACT 5:3  But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie
 to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?

ACT 5:4  Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was
 it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart?
 thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.

ACT 5:5  And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and
 great fear came on all them that heard these things.

ACT 5:6  And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried
 him.

ACT 5:7  And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not
 knowing what was done, came in.

ACT 5:8  And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so
 much? And she said, Yea, for so much.

ACT 5:9  Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to
 tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy
 husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.

ACT 5:10  Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost:
 and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth,
 buried her by her husband.

ACT 5:11  And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard
 these things.

ACT 5:12  And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought
 among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.

ACT 5:13  And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people
 magnified them.

ACT 5:14  And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men
 and women.)

ACT 5:15  Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid
 them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by
 might overshadow some of them.

ACT 5:16  There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto
 Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean
 spirits: and they were healed every one.

ACT 5:17  Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which
 is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,

ACT 5:18  And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common
 prison.

ACT 5:19  But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and
 brought them forth, and said,

ACT 5:20  Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this
 life.

ACT 5:21  And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the
 morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with
 him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of
 Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.

ACT 5:22  But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they
 returned and told,

ACT 5:23  Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the
 keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found
 no man within.

ACT 5:24  Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief
 priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.

ACT 5:25  Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in
 prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.

ACT 5:26  Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without
 violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.

ACT 5:27  And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and
 the high priest asked them,

ACT 5:28  Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in
 this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and
 intend to bring this man's blood upon us.

ACT 5:29  Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey
 God rather than men.

ACT 5:30  The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a
 tree.

ACT 5:31  Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a
 Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.

ACT 5:32  And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy
 Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.

ACT 5:33  When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to
 slay them.

ACT 5:34  Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a
 doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to
 put the apostles forth a little space;

ACT 5:35  And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye
 intend to do as touching these men.

ACT 5:36  For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be
 somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who
 was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to
 nought.

ACT 5:37  After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the
 taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even
 as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.

ACT 5:38  And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone:
 for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:

ACT 5:39  But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found
 even to fight against God.

ACT 5:40  And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and
 beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of
 Jesus, and let them go.

ACT 5:41  And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that
 they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.

ACT 5:42  And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach
 and preach Jesus Christ.

ACT 6:1  And in those days, when the number of the disciples was
 multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews,
 because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.

ACT 6:2  Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and
 said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve
 tables.

ACT 6:3  Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report,
 full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.

ACT 6:4  But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry
 of the word.

ACT 6:5  And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a
 man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and
 Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:

ACT 6:6  Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid
 their hands on them.

ACT 6:7  And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples
 multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were
 obedient to the faith.

ACT 6:8  And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles
 among the people.

ACT 6:9  Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the
 synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of
 Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.

ACT 6:10  And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which
 he spake.

ACT 6:11  Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak
 blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.

ACT 6:12  And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and
 came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,

ACT 6:13  And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak
 blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:

ACT 6:14  For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy
 this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.

ACT 6:15  And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his
 face as it had been the face of an angel.

ACT 7:1  Then said the high priest, Are these things so?

ACT 7:2  And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory
 appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt
 in Charran,

ACT 7:3  And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy
 kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.

ACT 7:4  Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran:
 and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land,
 wherein ye now dwell.

ACT 7:5  And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his
 foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and
 to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.

ACT 7:6  And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange
 land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil
 four hundred years.

ACT 7:7  And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said
 God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.

ACT 7:8  And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat
 Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob
 begat the twelve patriarchs.

ACT 7:9  And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God
 was with him,

ACT 7:10  And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and
 wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over
 Egypt and all his house.

ACT 7:11  Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and
 great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.

ACT 7:12  But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our
 fathers first.

ACT 7:13  And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and
 Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.

ACT 7:14  Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his
 kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.

ACT 7:15  So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,

ACT 7:16  And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that
 Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.

ACT 7:17  But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to
 Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,

ACT 7:18  Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.

ACT 7:19  The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our
 fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might
 not live.

ACT 7:20  In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished
 up in his father's house three months:

ACT 7:21  And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and
 nourished him for her own son.

ACT 7:22  And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was
 mighty in words and in deeds.

ACT 7:23  And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit
 his brethren the children of Israel.

ACT 7:24  And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him
 that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:

ACT 7:25  For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by
 his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.

ACT 7:26  And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and
 would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye
 wrong one to another?

ACT 7:27  But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made
 thee a ruler and a judge over us?

ACT 7:28  Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?

ACT 7:29  Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of
 Madian, where he begat two sons.

ACT 7:30  And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the
 wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.

ACT 7:31  When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to
 behold it, the voice of the LORD came unto him,

ACT 7:32  Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God
 of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.

ACT 7:33  Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the
 place where thou standest is holy ground.

ACT 7:34  I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in
 Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And
 now come, I will send thee into Egypt.

ACT 7:35  This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a
 judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the
 angel which appeared to him in the bush.

ACT 7:36  He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs
 in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.

ACT 7:37  This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet
 shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him
 shall ye hear.

ACT 7:38  This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel
 which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the
 lively oracles to give unto us:

ACT 7:39  To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and
 in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,

ACT 7:40  Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this
 Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become
 of him.

ACT 7:41  And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the
 idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.

ACT 7:42  Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as
 it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye
 offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the
 wilderness?

ACT 7:43  Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god
 Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away
 beyond Babylon.

ACT 7:44  Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he
 had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the
 fashion that he had seen.

ACT 7:45  Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the
 possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our
 fathers, unto the days of David;

ACT 7:46  Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the
 God of Jacob.

ACT 7:47  But Solomon built him an house.

ACT 7:48  Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as
 saith the prophet,

ACT 7:49  Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye
 build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?

ACT 7:50  Hath not my hand made all these things?

ACT 7:51  Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always
 resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.

ACT 7:52  Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have
 slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have
 been now the betrayers and murderers:

ACT 7:53  Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not
 kept it.

ACT 7:54  When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they
 gnashed on him with their teeth.

ACT 7:55  But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into
 heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of
 God,

ACT 7:56  And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man
 standing on the right hand of God.

ACT 7:57  Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and
 ran upon him with one accord,

ACT 7:58  And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid
 down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.

ACT 7:59  And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus,
 receive my spirit.

ACT 7:60  And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this
 sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

ACT 8:1  And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a
 great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were
 all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the
 apostles.

ACT 8:2  And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great
 lamentation over him.

ACT 8:3  As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every
 house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.

ACT 8:4  Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching
 the word.

ACT 8:5  Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto
 them.

ACT 8:6  And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which
 Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.

ACT 8:7  For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that
 were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame,
 were healed.

ACT 8:8  And there was great joy in that city.

ACT 8:9  But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the
 same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that
 himself was some great one:

ACT 8:10  To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying,
 This man is the great power of God.

ACT 8:11  And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had
 bewitched them with sorceries.

ACT 8:12  But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the
 kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men
 and women.

ACT 8:13  Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he
 continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which
 were done.

ACT 8:14  Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
 received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:

ACT 8:15  Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might
 receive the Holy Ghost:

ACT 8:16  (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized
 in the name of the Lord Jesus.)

ACT 8:17  Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.

ACT 8:18  And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the
 Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,

ACT 8:19  Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he
 may receive the Holy Ghost.

ACT 8:20  But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou
 hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.

ACT 8:21  Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not
 right in the sight of God.

ACT 8:22  Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the
 thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.

ACT 8:23  For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the
 bond of iniquity.

ACT 8:24  Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none
 of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.

ACT 8:25  And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord,
 returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the
 Samaritans.

ACT 8:26  And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go
 toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which
 is desert.

ACT 8:27  And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of
 great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of
 all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,

ACT 8:28  Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.

ACT 8:29  Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this
 chariot.

ACT 8:30  And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet
 Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?

ACT 8:31  And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he
 desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.

ACT 8:32  The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a
 sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he
 not his mouth:

ACT 8:33  In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare
 his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.

ACT 8:34  And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom
 speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?

ACT 8:35  Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and
 preached unto him Jesus.

ACT 8:36  And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and
 the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?

ACT 8:37  And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest.
 And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.

ACT 8:38  And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both
 into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.

ACT 8:39  And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord
 caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way
 rejoicing.

ACT 8:40  But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in
 all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.

ACT 9:1  And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the
 disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,

ACT 9:2  And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he
 found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them
 bound unto Jerusalem.

ACT 9:3  And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined
 round about him a light from heaven:

ACT 9:4  And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul,
 Saul, why persecutest thou me?

ACT 9:5  And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom
 thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.

ACT 9:6  And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to
 do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be
 told thee what thou must do.

ACT 9:7  And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a
 voice, but seeing no man.

ACT 9:8  And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw
 no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.

ACT 9:9  And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.

ACT 9:10  And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to
 him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.

ACT 9:11  And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is
 called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of
 Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,

ACT 9:12  And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting
 his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.

ACT 9:13  Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how
 much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:

ACT 9:14  And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that
 call on thy name.

ACT 9:15  But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel
 unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of
 Israel:

ACT 9:16  For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's
 sake.

ACT 9:17  And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his
 hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto
 thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy
 sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.

ACT 9:18  And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and
 he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.

ACT 9:19  And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul
 certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.

ACT 9:20  And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the
 Son of God.

ACT 9:21  But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that
 destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for
 that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?

ACT 9:22  But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews
 which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.

ACT 9:23  And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to
 kill him:

ACT 9:24  But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates
 day and night to kill him.

ACT 9:25  Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in
 a basket.

ACT 9:26  And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself
 to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he
 was a disciple.

ACT 9:27  But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared
 unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to
 him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.

ACT 9:28  And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.

ACT 9:29  And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed
 against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.

ACT 9:30  Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and
 sent him forth to Tarsus.

ACT 9:31  Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and
 Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the
 comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.

ACT 9:32  And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came
 down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.

ACT 9:33  And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed
 eight years, and was sick of the palsy.

ACT 9:34  And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole:
 arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.

ACT 9:35  And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the
 Lord.

ACT 9:36  Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by
 interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and
 almsdeeds which she did.

ACT 9:37  And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom
 when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.

ACT 9:38  And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard
 that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would
 not delay to come to them.

ACT 9:39  Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought
 him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and
 shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.

ACT 9:40  But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and
 turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and
 when she saw Peter, she sat up.

ACT 9:41  And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called
 the saints and widows, presented her alive.

ACT 9:42  And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.

ACT 9:43  And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one
 Simon a tanner.

ACT 10:1  There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion
 of the band called the Italian band,

ACT 10:2  A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave
 much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.

ACT 10:3  He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel
 of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.

ACT 10:4  And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord?
 And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial
 before God.

ACT 10:5  And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is
 Peter:

ACT 10:6  He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side:
 he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.

ACT 10:7  And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called
 two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on
 him continually;

ACT 10:8  And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to
 Joppa.

ACT 10:9  On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the
 city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:

ACT 10:10  And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made
 ready, he fell into a trance,

ACT 10:11  And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending upon him, as
 it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the
 earth:

ACT 10:12  Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild
 beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.

ACT 10:13  And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.

ACT 10:14  But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that
 is common or unclean.

ACT 10:15  And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath
 cleansed, that call not thou common.

ACT 10:16  This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into
 heaven.

ACT 10:17  Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had
 seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made
 enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,

ACT 10:18  And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were
 lodged there.

ACT 10:19  While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold,
 three men seek thee.

ACT 10:20  Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting
 nothing: for I have sent them.

ACT 10:21  Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from
 Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause
 wherefore ye are come?

ACT 10:22  And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that
 feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned
 from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words
 of thee.

ACT 10:23  Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter
 went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.

ACT 10:24  And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius
 waited for them, and he had called together his kinsmen and near friends.

ACT 10:25  And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his
 feet, and worshipped him.

ACT 10:26  But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.

ACT 10:27  And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come
 together.

ACT 10:28  And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for
 a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but
 God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.

ACT 10:29  Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent
 for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?

ACT 10:30  And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and
 at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in
 bright clothing,

ACT 10:31  And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in
 remembrance in the sight of God.

ACT 10:32  Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is
 Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who,
 when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.

ACT 10:33  Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that
 thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all
 things that are commanded thee of God.

ACT 10:34  Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that
 God is no respecter of persons:

ACT 10:35  But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness,
 is accepted with him.

ACT 10:36  The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace
 by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)

ACT 10:37  That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all
 Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;

ACT 10:38  How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with
 power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the
 devil; for God was with him.

ACT 10:39  And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land
 of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:

ACT 10:40  Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;

ACT 10:41  Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before God, even to
 us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.

ACT 10:42  And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that
 it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.

ACT 10:43  To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name
 whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.

ACT 10:44  While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them
 which heard the word.

ACT 10:45  And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many
 as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift
 of the Holy Ghost.

ACT 10:46  For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then
 answered Peter,

ACT 10:47  Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which
 have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?

ACT 10:48  And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then
 prayed they him to tarry certain days.

ACT 11:1  And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the
 Gentiles had also received the word of God.

ACT 11:2  And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the
 circumcision contended with him,

ACT 11:3  Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with
 them.

ACT 11:4  But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it
 by order unto them, saying,

ACT 11:5  I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A
 certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by
 four corners; and it came even to me:

ACT 11:6  Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw
 fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and
 fowls of the air.

ACT 11:7  And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.

ACT 11:8  But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any
 time entered into my mouth.

ACT 11:9  But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed,
 that call not thou common.

ACT 11:10  And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into
 heaven.

ACT 11:11  And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the
 house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.

ACT 11:12  And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover
 these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:

ACT 11:13  And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood
 and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is
 Peter;

ACT 11:14  Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be
 saved.

ACT 11:15  And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at
 the beginning.

ACT 11:16  Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John
 indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.

ACT 11:17  Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who
 believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?

ACT 11:18  When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified
 God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.

ACT 11:19  Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose
 about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching
 the word to none but unto the Jews only.

ACT 11:20  And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they
 were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.

ACT 11:21  And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number
 believed, and turned unto the Lord.

ACT 11:22  Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which
 was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as
 Antioch.

ACT 11:23  Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and
 exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the
 Lord.

ACT 11:24  For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and
 much people was added unto the Lord.

ACT 11:25  Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:

ACT 11:26  And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came
 to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and
 taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in
 Antioch.

ACT 11:27  And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.

ACT 11:28  And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the
 Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came
 to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.

ACT 11:29  Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined
 to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:

ACT 11:30  Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of
 Barnabas and Saul.

ACT 12:1  Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex
 certain of the church.

ACT 12:2  And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.

ACT 12:3  And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take
 Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)

ACT 12:4  And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered
 him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to
 bring him forth to the people.

ACT 12:5  Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without
 ceasing of the church unto God for him.

ACT 12:6  And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was
 sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before
 the door kept the prison.

ACT 12:7  And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined
 in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying,
 Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.

ACT 12:8  And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals.
 And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow
 me.

ACT 12:9  And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true
 which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.

ACT 12:10  When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto
 the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own
 accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith
 the angel departed from him.

ACT 12:11  And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety,
 that the LORD hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of
 Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.

ACT 12:12  And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary
 the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together
 praying.

ACT 12:13  And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to
 hearken, named Rhoda.

ACT 12:14  And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for
 gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.

ACT 12:15  And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed
 that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.

ACT 12:16  But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and
 saw him, they were astonished.

ACT 12:17  But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace,
 declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he
 said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he
 departed, and went into another place.

ACT 12:18  Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the
 soldiers, what was become of Peter.

ACT 12:19  And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined
 the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down
 from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.

ACT 12:20  And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but
 they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's
 chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished
 by the king's country.

ACT 12:21  And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his
 throne, and made an oration unto them.

ACT 12:22  And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and
 not of a man.

ACT 12:23  And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not
 God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.

ACT 12:24  But the word of God grew and multiplied.

ACT 12:25  And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had
 fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.

ACT 13:1  Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and
 teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of
 Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and
 Saul.

ACT 13:2  As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said,
 Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.

ACT 13:3  And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on
 them, they sent them away.

ACT 13:4  So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia;
 and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.

ACT 13:5  And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the
 synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister.

ACT 13:6  And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a
 certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:

ACT 13:7  Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent
 man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.

ACT 13:8  But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation)
 withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.

ACT 13:9  Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set
 his eyes on him.

ACT 13:10  And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the
 devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the
 right ways of the Lord?

ACT 13:11  And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt
 be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him
 a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the
 hand.

ACT 13:12  Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being
 astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.

ACT 13:13  Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga
 in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.

ACT 13:14  But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in
 Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.

ACT 13:15  And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the
 synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of
 exhortation for the people, say on.

ACT 13:16  Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of
 Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.

ACT 13:17  The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the
 people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high
 arm brought he them out of it.

ACT 13:18  And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the
 wilderness.

ACT 13:19  And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he
 divided their land to them by lot.

ACT 13:20  And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four
 hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.

ACT 13:21  And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the
 son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.

ACT 13:22  And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be
 their king; to whom also he gave their testimony, and said, I have found
 David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my
 will.

ACT 13:23  Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto
 Israel a Saviour, Jesus:

ACT 13:24  When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of
 repentance to all the people of Israel.

ACT 13:25  And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am?
 I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet
 I am not worthy to loose.

ACT 13:26  Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever
 among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.

ACT 13:27  For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they
 knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath
 day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.

ACT 13:28  And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they
 Pilate that he should be slain.

ACT 13:29  And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took
 him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.

ACT 13:30  But God raised him from the dead:

ACT 13:31  And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from
 Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.

ACT 13:32  And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was
 made unto the fathers,

ACT 13:33  God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath
 raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my
 Son, this day have I begotten thee.

ACT 13:34  And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more
 to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure
 mercies of David.

ACT 13:35  Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer
 thine Holy One to see corruption.

ACT 13:36  For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of
 God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:

ACT 13:37  But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.

ACT 13:38  Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this
 man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:

ACT 13:39  And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from
 which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.

ACT 13:40  Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the
 prophets;

ACT 13:41  Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in
 your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it
 unto you.

ACT 13:42  And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles
 besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.

ACT 13:43  Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and
 religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them,
 persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.

ACT 13:44  And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear
 the word of God.

ACT 13:45  But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with
 envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting
 and blaspheming.

ACT 13:46  Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that
 the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it
 from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn
 to the Gentiles.

ACT 13:47  For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a
 light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends
 of the earth.

ACT 13:48  And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the
 word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.

ACT 13:49  And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.

ACT 13:50  But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the
 chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and
 expelled them out of their coasts.

ACT 13:51  But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came
 unto Iconium.

ACT 13:52  And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.

ACT 14:1  And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the
 synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews
 and also of the Greeks believed.

ACT 14:2  But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their
 minds evil affected against the brethren.

ACT 14:3  Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which
 gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to
 be done by their hands.

ACT 14:4  But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the
 Jews, and part with the apostles.

ACT 14:5  And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also
 of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them,

ACT 14:6  They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of
 Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:

ACT 14:7  And there they preached the gospel.

ACT 14:8  And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a
 cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:

ACT 14:9  The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and
 perceiving that he had faith to be healed,

ACT 14:10  Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and
 walked.

ACT 14:11  And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their
 voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the
 likeness of men.

ACT 14:12  And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he
 was the chief speaker.

ACT 14:13  Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought
 oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the
 people.

ACT 14:14  Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent
 their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,

ACT 14:15  And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like
 passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these
 vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and
 all things that are therein:

ACT 14:16  Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.

ACT 14:17  Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did
 good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts
 with food and gladness.

ACT 14:18  And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they
 had not done sacrifice unto them.

ACT 14:19  And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who
 persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city,
 supposing he had been dead.

ACT 14:20  Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and
 came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.

ACT 14:21  And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught
 many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,

ACT 14:22  Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to
 continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into
 the kingdom of God.

ACT 14:23  And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had
 prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.

ACT 14:24  And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to
 Pamphylia.

ACT 14:25  And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into
 Attalia:

ACT 14:26  And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended
 to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.

ACT 14:27  And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they
 rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of
 faith unto the Gentiles.

ACT 14:28  And there they abode long time with the disciples.

ACT 15:1  And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and
 said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.

ACT 15:2  When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and
 disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain
 other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about
 this question.

ACT 15:3  And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through
 Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they
 caused great joy unto all the brethren.

ACT 15:4  And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the
 church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God
 had done with them.

ACT 15:5  But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which
 believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them
 to keep the law of Moses.

ACT 15:6  And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this
 matter.

ACT 15:7  And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto
 them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice
 among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the
 gospel, and believe.

ACT 15:8  And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the
 Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;

ACT 15:9  And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by
 faith.

ACT 15:10  Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the
 disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?

ACT 15:11  But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we
 shall be saved, even as they.

ACT 15:12  Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas
 and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the
 Gentiles by them.

ACT 15:13  And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and
 brethren, hearken unto me:

ACT 15:14  Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to
 take out of them a people for his name.

ACT 15:15  And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,

ACT 15:16  After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of
 David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I
 will set it up:

ACT 15:17  That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the
 Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these
 things.

ACT 15:18  Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.

ACT 15:19  Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among
 the Gentiles are turned to God:

ACT 15:20  But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of
 idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.

ACT 15:21  For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being
 read in the synagogues every sabbath day.

ACT 15:22  Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to
 send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas;
 namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brethren:

ACT 15:23  And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and
 elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles
 in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.

ACT 15:24  Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have
 troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be
 circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:

ACT 15:25  It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send
 chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,

ACT 15:26  Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus
 Christ.

ACT 15:27  We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the
 same things by mouth.

ACT 15:28  For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no
 greater burden than these necessary things;

ACT 15:29  That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and
 from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep
 yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.

ACT 15:30  So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had
 gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:

ACT 15:31  Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.

ACT 15:32  And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the
 brethren with many words, and confirmed them.

ACT 15:33  And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace
 from the brethren unto the apostles.

ACT 15:34  Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.

ACT 15:35  Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching
 the word of the Lord, with many others also.

ACT 15:36  And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and
 visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the
 LORD, and see how they do.

ACT 15:37  And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was
 Mark.

ACT 15:38  But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from
 them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.

ACT 15:39  And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed
 asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto
 Cyprus;

ACT 15:40  And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the
 brethren unto the grace of God.

ACT 15:41  And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.

ACT 16:1  Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was
 there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and
 believed; but his father was a Greek:

ACT 16:2  Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and
 Iconium.

ACT 16:3  Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised
 him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that
 his father was a Greek.

ACT 16:4  And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees
 for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at
 Jerusalem.

ACT 16:5  And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in
 number daily.

ACT 16:6  Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of
 Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,

ACT 16:7  After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but
 the Spirit suffered them not.

ACT 16:8  And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.

ACT 16:9  And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of
 Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.

ACT 16:10  And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go
 into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach
 the gospel unto them.

ACT 16:11  Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to
 Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;

ACT 16:12  And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of
 Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.

ACT 16:13  And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where
 prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which
 resorted thither.

ACT 16:14  And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of
 Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that
 she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.

ACT 16:15  And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us,
 saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my
 house, and abide there. And she constrained us.

ACT 16:16  And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel
 possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much
 gain by soothsaying:

ACT 16:17  The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the
 servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.

ACT 16:18  And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said
 to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.
 And he came out the same hour.

ACT 16:19  And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they
 caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,

ACT 16:20  And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews,
 do exceedingly trouble our city,

ACT 16:21  And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither
 to observe, being Romans.

ACT 16:22  And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates
 rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.

ACT 16:23  And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into
 prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:

ACT 16:24  Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner
 prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.

ACT 16:25  And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God:
 and the prisoners heard them.

ACT 16:26  And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations
 of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and
 every one's bands were loosed.

ACT 16:27  And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing
 the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself,
 supposing that the prisoners had been fled.

ACT 16:28  But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we
 are all here.

ACT 16:29  Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and
 fell down before Paul and Silas,

ACT 16:30  And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?

ACT 16:31  And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be
 saved, and thy house.

ACT 16:32  And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were
 in his house.

ACT 16:33  And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their
 stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.

ACT 16:34  And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before
 them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.

ACT 16:35  And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let
 those men go.

ACT 16:36  And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The
 magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.

ACT 16:37  But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned,
 being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out
 privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.

ACT 16:38  And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they
 feared, when they heard that they were Romans.

ACT 16:39  And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired
 them to depart out of the city.

ACT 16:40  And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of
 Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and
 departed.

ACT 17:1  Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came
 to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:

ACT 17:2  And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath
 days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,

ACT 17:3  Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen
 again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.

ACT 17:4  And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and
 of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.

ACT 17:5  But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them
 certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all
 the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring
 them out to the people.

ACT 17:6  And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren
 unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside
 down are come hither also;

ACT 17:7  Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of
 Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.

ACT 17:8  And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they
 heard these things.

ACT 17:9  And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let
 them go.

ACT 17:10  And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto
 Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.

ACT 17:11  These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they
 received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures
 daily, whether those things were so.

ACT 17:12  Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were
 Greeks, and of men, not a few.

ACT 17:13  But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God
 was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the
 people.

ACT 17:14  And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were
 to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.

ACT 17:15  And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving
 a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all
 speed, they departed.

ACT 17:16  Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in
 him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.

ACT 17:17  Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the
 devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.

ACT 17:18  Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks,
 encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He
 seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them
 Jesus, and the resurrection.

ACT 17:19  And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we
 know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?

ACT 17:20  For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know
 therefore what these things mean.

ACT 17:21  (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their
 time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)

ACT 17:22  Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of
 Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.

ACT 17:23  For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with
 this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship,
 him declare I unto you.

ACT 17:24  God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is
 Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;

ACT 17:25  Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any
 thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;

ACT 17:26  And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all
 the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and
 the bounds of their habitation;

ACT 17:27  That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after
 him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:

ACT 17:28  For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of
 your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.

ACT 17:29  Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think
 that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and
 man's device.

ACT 17:30  And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth
 all men every where to repent:

ACT 17:31  Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the
 world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath
 given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.

ACT 17:32  And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked:
 and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.

ACT 17:33  So Paul departed from among them.

ACT 17:34  Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which
 was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with
 them.

ACT 18:1  After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;

ACT 18:2  And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come
 from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all
 Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.

ACT 18:3  And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and
 wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.

ACT 18:4  And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the
 Jews and the Greeks.

ACT 18:5  And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was
 pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.

ACT 18:6  And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his
 raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean;
 from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.

ACT 18:7  And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named
 Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.

ACT 18:8  And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord
 with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were
 baptized.

ACT 18:9  Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid,
 but speak, and hold not thy peace:

ACT 18:10  For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I
 have much people in this city.

ACT 18:11  And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of
 God among them.

ACT 18:12  And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection
 with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,

ACT 18:13  Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the
 law.

ACT 18:14  And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the
 Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason
 would that I should bear with you:

ACT 18:15  But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye
 to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.

ACT 18:16  And he drave them from the judgment seat.

ACT 18:17  Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the
 synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none
 of those things.

ACT 18:18  And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took
 his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him
 Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.

ACT 18:19  And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered
 into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.

ACT 18:20  When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented
 not;

ACT 18:21  But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast
 that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And
 he sailed from Ephesus.

ACT 18:22  And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the
 church, he went down to Antioch.

ACT 18:23  And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over
 all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the
 disciples.

ACT 18:24  And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent
 man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.

ACT 18:25  This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent
 in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing
 only the baptism of John.

ACT 18:26  And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and
 Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way
 of God more perfectly.

ACT 18:27  And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote,
 exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them
 much which had believed through grace:

ACT 18:28  For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by
 the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.

ACT 19:1  And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having
 passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain
 disciples,

ACT 19:2  He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?
 And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any
 Holy Ghost.

ACT 19:3  And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they
 said, Unto John's baptism.

ACT 19:4  Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance,
 saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come
 after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.

ACT 19:5  When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord
 Jesus.

ACT 19:6  And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on
 them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.

ACT 19:7  And all the men were about twelve.

ACT 19:8  And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of
 three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of
 God.

ACT 19:9  But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of
 that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the
 disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.

ACT 19:10  And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which
 dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.

ACT 19:11  And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:

ACT 19:12  So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or
 aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out
 of them.

ACT 19:13  Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call
 over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We
 adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.

ACT 19:14  And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the
 priests, which did so.

ACT 19:15  And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I
 know; but who are ye?

ACT 19:16  And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame
 them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked
 and wounded.

ACT 19:17  And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at
 Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was
 magnified.

ACT 19:18  And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.

ACT 19:19  Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books
 together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price
 of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.

ACT 19:20  So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.

ACT 19:21  After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he
 had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I
 have been there, I must also see Rome.

ACT 19:22  So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him,
 Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.

ACT 19:23  And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.

ACT 19:24  For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver
 shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;

ACT 19:25  Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and
 said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.

ACT 19:26  Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost
 throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people,
 saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:

ACT 19:27  So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought;
 but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and
 her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world
 worshippeth.

ACT 19:28  And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and
 cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

ACT 19:29  And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught
 Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they
 rushed with one accord into the theatre.

ACT 19:30  And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples
 suffered him not.

ACT 19:31  And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto
 him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.

ACT 19:32  Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly
 was confused: and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.

ACT 19:33  And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him
 forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his
 defence unto the people.

ACT 19:34  But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the
 space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

ACT 19:35  And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of
 Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the
 Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which
 fell down from Jupiter?

ACT 19:36  Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to
 be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.

ACT 19:37  For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of
 churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.

ACT 19:38  Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a
 matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them
 implead one another.

ACT 19:39  But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be
 determined in a lawful assembly.

ACT 19:40  For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's
 uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this
 concourse.

ACT 19:41  And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.

ACT 20:1  And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples,
 and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.

ACT 20:2  And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much
 exhortation, he came into Greece,

ACT 20:3  And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as
 he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.

ACT 20:4  And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the
 Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus;
 and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.

ACT 20:5  These going before tarried for us at Troas.

ACT 20:6  And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened
 bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.

ACT 20:7  And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together
 to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and
 continued his speech until midnight.

ACT 20:8  And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were
 gathered together.

ACT 20:9  And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being
 fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with
 sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.

ACT 20:10  And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble
 not yourselves; for his life is in him.

ACT 20:11  When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and
 eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.

ACT 20:12  And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little
 comforted.

ACT 20:13  And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending
 to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.

ACT 20:14  And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to
 Mitylene.

ACT 20:15  And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and
 the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day
 we came to Miletus.

ACT 20:16  For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not
 spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at
 Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.

ACT 20:17  And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the
 church.

ACT 20:18  And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the
 first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at
 all seasons,

ACT 20:19  Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and
 temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:

ACT 20:20  And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have
 shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,

ACT 20:21  Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance
 toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.

ACT 20:22  And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not
 knowing the things that shall befall me there:

ACT 20:23  Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds
 and afflictions abide me.

ACT 20:24  But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto
 myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I
 have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.

ACT 20:25  And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone
 preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.

ACT 20:26  Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the
 blood of all men.

ACT 20:27  For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.

ACT 20:28  Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the
 which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God,
 which he hath purchased with his own blood.

ACT 20:29  For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter
 in among you, not sparing the flock.

ACT 20:30  Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things,
 to draw away disciples after them.

ACT 20:31  Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I
 ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.

ACT 20:32  And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his
 grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among
 all them which are sanctified.

ACT 20:33  I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.

ACT 20:34  Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my
 necessities, and to them that were with me.

ACT 20:35  I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to
 support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said,
 It is more blessed to give than to receive.

ACT 20:36  And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them
 all.

ACT 20:37  And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,

ACT 20:38  Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should
 see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.

ACT 21:1  And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had
 launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day following
 unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:

ACT 21:2  And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and
 set forth.

ACT 21:3  Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and
 sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her
 burden.

ACT 21:4  And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul
 through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.

ACT 21:5  And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our
 way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we
 were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.

ACT 21:6  And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and
 they returned home again.

ACT 21:7  And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to
 Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.

ACT 21:8  And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came
 unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which
 was one of the seven; and abode with him.

ACT 21:9  And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.

ACT 21:10  And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a
 certain prophet, named Agabus.

ACT 21:11  And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his
 own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at
 Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into
 the hands of the Gentiles.

ACT 21:12  And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place,
 besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.

ACT 21:13  Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?
 for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the
 name of the Lord Jesus.

ACT 21:14  And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will
 of the Lord be done.

ACT 21:15  And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to
 Jerusalem.

ACT 21:16  There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and
 brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should
 lodge.

ACT 21:17  And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.

ACT 21:18  And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the
 elders were present.

ACT 21:19  And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things
 God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.

ACT 21:20  And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him,
 Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and
 they are all zealous of the law:

ACT 21:21  And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which
 are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to
 circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.

ACT 21:22  What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for
 they will hear that thou art come.

ACT 21:23  Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a
 vow on them;

ACT 21:24  Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with
 them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things,
 whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou
 thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.

ACT 21:25  As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and
 concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep
 themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from
 strangled, and from fornication.

ACT 21:26  Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them
 entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of
 purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.

ACT 21:27  And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of
 Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid
 hands on him,

ACT 21:28  Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all
 men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further
 brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.

ACT 21:29  (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an
 Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)

ACT 21:30  And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they
 took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.

ACT 21:31  And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief
 captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.

ACT 21:32  Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto
 them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating
 of Paul.

ACT 21:33  Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to
 be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.

ACT 21:34  And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and
 when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be
 carried into the castle.

ACT 21:35  And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne
 of the soldiers for the violence of the people.

ACT 21:36  For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with
 him.

ACT 21:37  And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief
 captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?

ACT 21:38  Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an
 uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were
 murderers?

ACT 21:39  But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in
 Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak
 unto the people.

ACT 21:40  And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and
 beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great
 silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,

ACT 22:1  Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto
 you.

ACT 22:2  (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they
 kept the more silence: and he saith,)

ACT 22:3  I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia,
 yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according
 to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God,
 as ye all are this day.

ACT 22:4  And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into
 prisons both men and women.

ACT 22:5  As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate
 of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went
 to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be
 punished.

ACT 22:6  And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh
 unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light
 round about me.

ACT 22:7  And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul,
 Saul, why persecutest thou me?

ACT 22:8  And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus
 of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.

ACT 22:9  And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but
 they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.

ACT 22:10  And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me,
 Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things
 which are appointed for thee to do.

ACT 22:11  And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by
 the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.

ACT 22:12  And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good
 report of all the Jews which dwelt there,

ACT 22:13  Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy
 sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.

ACT 22:14  And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou
 shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice
 of his mouth.

ACT 22:15  For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen
 and heard.

ACT 22:16  And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy
 sins, calling on the name of the Lord.

ACT 22:17  And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even
 while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;

ACT 22:18  And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of
 Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.

ACT 22:19  And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every
 synagogue them that believed on thee:

ACT 22:20  And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was
 standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that
 slew him.

ACT 22:21  And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the
 Gentiles.

ACT 22:22  And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their
 voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit
 that he should live.

ACT 22:23  And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust
 into the air,

ACT 22:24  The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and
 bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore
 they cried so against him.

ACT 22:25  And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that
 stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and
 uncondemned?

ACT 22:26  When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain,
 saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.

ACT 22:27  Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a
 Roman? He said, Yea.

ACT 22:28  And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this
 freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.

ACT 22:29  Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined
 him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a
 Roman, and because he had bound him.

ACT 22:30  On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore
 he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the
 chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set
 him before them.

ACT 23:1  And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I
 have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.

ACT 23:2  And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite
 him on the mouth.

ACT 23:3  Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for
 sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten
 contrary to the law?

ACT 23:4  And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?

ACT 23:5  Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest:
 for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.

ACT 23:6  But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the
 other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a
 Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I
 am called in question.

ACT 23:7  And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the
 Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.

ACT 23:8  For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel,
 nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.

ACT 23:9  And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the
 Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but
 if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.

ACT 23:10  And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing
 lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers
 to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into
 the castle.

ACT 23:11  And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good
 cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear
 witness also at Rome.

ACT 23:12  And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound
 themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till
 they had killed Paul.

ACT 23:13  And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.

ACT 23:14  And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have
 bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have
 slain Paul.

ACT 23:15  Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that
 he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something
 more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to
 kill him.

ACT 23:16  And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went
 and entered into the castle, and told Paul.

ACT 23:17  Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring
 this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell
 him.

ACT 23:18  So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul
 the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto
 thee, who hath something to say unto thee.

ACT 23:19  Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside
 privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?

ACT 23:20  And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest
 bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire
 somewhat of him more perfectly.

ACT 23:21  But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him
 of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that
 they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they
 ready, looking for a promise from thee.

ACT 23:22  So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him,
 See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.

ACT 23:23  And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two
 hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and
 spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;

ACT 23:24  And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him
 safe unto Felix the governor.

ACT 23:25  And he wrote a letter after this manner:

ACT 23:26  Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth
 greeting.

ACT 23:27  This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them:
 then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a
 Roman.

ACT 23:28  And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I
 brought him forth into their council:

ACT 23:29  Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to
 have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.

ACT 23:30  And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I
 sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say
 before thee what they had against him. Farewell.

ACT 23:31  Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought
 him by night to Antipatris.

ACT 23:32  On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned
 to the castle:

ACT 23:33  Who, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to the
 governor, presented Paul also before him.

ACT 23:34  And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province
 he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;

ACT 23:35  I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he
 commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.

ACT 24:1  And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the
 elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor
 against Paul.

ACT 24:2  And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying,
 Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are
 done unto this nation by thy providence,

ACT 24:3  We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all
 thankfulness.

ACT 24:4  Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee
 that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.

ACT 24:5  For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of
 sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the
 sect of the Nazarenes:

ACT 24:6  Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and
 would have judged according to our law.

ACT 24:7  But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence
 took him away out of our hands,

ACT 24:8  Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom
 thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.

ACT 24:9  And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.

ACT 24:10  Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak,
 answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto
 this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:

ACT 24:11  Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve
 days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.

ACT 24:12  And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man,
 neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:

ACT 24:13  Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.

ACT 24:14  But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call
 heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are
 written in the law and in the prophets:

ACT 24:15  And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that
 there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.

ACT 24:16  And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to
 offence toward God, and toward men.

ACT 24:17  Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and
 offerings.

ACT 24:18  Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple,
 neither with multitude, nor with tumult.

ACT 24:19  Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had
 ought against me.

ACT 24:20  Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing
 in me, while I stood before the council,

ACT 24:21  Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them,
 Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this
 day.

ACT 24:22  And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of
 that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall
 come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.

ACT 24:23  And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have
 liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or
 come unto him.

ACT 24:24  And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla,
 which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in
 Christ.

ACT 24:25  And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to
 come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a
 convenient season, I will call for thee.

ACT 24:26  He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he
 might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with
 him.

ACT 24:27  But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix,
 willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.

ACT 25:1  Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he
 ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.

ACT 25:2  Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against
 Paul, and besought him,

ACT 25:3  And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to
 Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.

ACT 25:4  But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that
 he himself would depart shortly thither.

ACT 25:5  Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with
 me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.

ACT 25:6  And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down
 unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul
 to be brought.

ACT 25:7  And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood
 round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they
 could not prove.

ACT 25:8  While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews,
 neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing
 at all.

ACT 25:9  But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and
 said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things
 before me?

ACT 25:10  Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to
 be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.

ACT 25:11  For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of
 death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof
 these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.

ACT 25:12  Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast
 thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.

ACT 25:13  And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea
 to salute Festus.

ACT 25:14  And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause
 unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:

ACT 25:15  About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the
 elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.

ACT 25:16  To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver
 any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to
 face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid
 against him.

ACT 25:17  Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the
 morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.

ACT 25:18  Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none
 accusation of such things as I supposed:

ACT 25:19  But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and
 of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.

ACT 25:20  And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him
 whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.

ACT 25:21  But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of
 Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.

ACT 25:22  Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To
 morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.

ACT 25:23  And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great
 pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and
 principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.

ACT 25:24  And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present
 with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt
 with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live
 any longer.

ACT 25:25  But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and
 that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.

ACT 25:26  Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I
 have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa,
 that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.

ACT 25:27  For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal
 to signify the crimes laid against him.

ACT 26:1  Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself.
 Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:

ACT 26:2  I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself
 this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the
 Jews:

ACT 26:3  Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and
 questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me
 patiently.

ACT 26:4  My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine
 own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;

ACT 26:5  Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after
 the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.

ACT 26:6  And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of
 God, unto our fathers:

ACT 26:7  Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and
 night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the
 Jews.

ACT 26:8  Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should
 raise the dead?

ACT 26:9  I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary
 to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.

ACT 26:10  Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I
 shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when
 they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.

ACT 26:11  And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to
 blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even
 unto strange cities.

ACT 26:12  Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from
 the chief priests,

ACT 26:13  At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the
 brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with
 me.

ACT 26:14  And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking
 unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou
 me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.

ACT 26:15  And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou
 persecutest.

ACT 26:16  But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for
 this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things
 which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto
 thee;

ACT 26:17  Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom
 now I send thee,

ACT 26:18  To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and
 from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins,
 and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.

ACT 26:19  Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly
 vision:

ACT 26:20  But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and
 throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they
 should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.

ACT 26:21  For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to
 kill me.

ACT 26:22  Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day,
 witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which
 the prophets and Moses did say should come:

ACT 26:23  That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that
 should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the
 Gentiles.

ACT 26:24  And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice,
 Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.

ACT 26:25  But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the
 words of truth and soberness.

ACT 26:26  For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak
 freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for
 this thing was not done in a corner.

ACT 26:27  King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou
 believest.

ACT 26:28  Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a
 Christian.

ACT 26:29  And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that
 hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these
 bonds.

ACT 26:30  And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and
 Bernice, and they that sat with them:

ACT 26:31  And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves,
 saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.

ACT 26:32  Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at
 liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.

ACT 27:1  And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they
 delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion
 of Augustus' band.

ACT 27:2  And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail
 by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being
 with us.

ACT 27:3  And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously
 entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh
 himself.

ACT 27:4  And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because
 the winds were contrary.

ACT 27:5  And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came
 to Myra, a city of Lycia.

ACT 27:6  And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into
 Italy; and he put us therein.

ACT 27:7  And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over
 against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over
 against Salmone;

ACT 27:8  And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair
 havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.

ACT 27:9  Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous,
 because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,

ACT 27:10  And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with
 hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.

ACT 27:11  Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the
 ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.

ACT 27:12  And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part
 advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to
 Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward
 the south west and north west.

ACT 27:13  And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had
 obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.

ACT 27:14  But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called
 Euroclydon.

ACT 27:15  And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind,
 we let her drive.

ACT 27:16  And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had
 much work to come by the boat:

ACT 27:17  Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the
 ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake
 sail, and so were driven.

ACT 27:18  And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they
 lightened the ship;

ACT 27:19  And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the
 ship.

ACT 27:20  And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small
 tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.

ACT 27:21  But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and
 said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from
 Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.

ACT 27:22  And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss
 of any man's life among you, but of the ship.

ACT 27:23  For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and
 whom I serve,

ACT 27:24  Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo,
 God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.

ACT 27:25  Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall
 be even as it was told me.

ACT 27:26  Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.

ACT 27:27  But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and
 down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some
 country;

ACT 27:28  And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a
 little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.

ACT 27:29  Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four
 anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.

ACT 27:30  And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had
 let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast
 anchors out of the foreship,

ACT 27:31  Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide
 in the ship, ye cannot be saved.

ACT 27:32  Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall
 off.

ACT 27:33  And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take
 meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and
 continued fasting, having taken nothing.

ACT 27:34  Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health:
 for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.

ACT 27:35  And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God
 in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.

ACT 27:36  Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.

ACT 27:37  And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen
 souls.

ACT 27:38  And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast
 out the wheat into the sea.

ACT 27:39  And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a
 certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were
 possible, to thrust in the ship.

ACT 27:40  And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves
 unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the
 wind, and made toward shore.

ACT 27:41  And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship
 aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder
 part was broken with the violence of the waves.

ACT 27:42  And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any
 of them should swim out, and escape.

ACT 27:43  But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their
 purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves
 first into the sea, and get to land:

ACT 27:44  And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship.
 And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.

ACT 28:1  And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called
 Melita.

ACT 28:2  And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they
 kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and
 because of the cold.

ACT 28:3  And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the
 fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.

ACT 28:4  And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they
 said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath
 escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.

ACT 28:5  And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.

ACT 28:6  Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead
 suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to
 him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.

ACT 28:7  In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island,
 whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days
 courteously.

ACT 28:8  And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever
 and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands
 on him, and healed him.

ACT 28:9  So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island,
 came, and were healed:

ACT 28:10  Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they
 laded us with such things as were necessary.

ACT 28:11  And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which
 had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.

ACT 28:12  And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.

ACT 28:13  And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after
 one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:

ACT 28:14  Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven
 days: and so we went toward Rome.

ACT 28:15  And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us
 as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked
 God, and took courage.

ACT 28:16  And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners
 to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a
 soldier that kept him.

ACT 28:17  And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief
 of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them,
 Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or
 customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the
 hands of the Romans.

ACT 28:18  Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there
 was no cause of death in me.

ACT 28:19  But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto
 Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.

ACT 28:20  For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to
 speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this
 chain.

ACT 28:21  And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea
 concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any
 harm of thee.

ACT 28:22  But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning
 this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.

ACT 28:23  And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into
 his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God,
 persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out
 of the prophets, from morning till evening.

ACT 28:24  And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed
 not.

ACT 28:25  And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that
 Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet
 unto our fathers,

ACT 28:26  Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and
 shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:

ACT 28:27  For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull
 of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their
 eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should
 be converted, and I should heal them.

ACT 28:28  Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent
 unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.

ACT 28:29  And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great
 reasoning among themselves.

ACT 28:30  And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received
 all that came in unto him,

ACT 28:31  Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which
 concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.

CO1 1:1  Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of
 God, and Sosthenes our brother,

CO1 1:2  Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are
 sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place
 call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their's and our's:

CO1 1:3  Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord
 Jesus Christ.

CO1 1:4  I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is
 given you by Jesus Christ;

CO1 1:5  That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in
 all knowledge;

CO1 1:6  Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:

CO1 1:7  So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord
 Jesus Christ:

CO1 1:8  Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless
 in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

CO1 1:9  God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son
 Jesus Christ our Lord.

CO1 1:10  Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
 that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you;
 but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same
 judgment.

CO1 1:11  For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which
 are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.

CO1 1:12  Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of
 Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.

CO1 1:13  Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized
 in the name of Paul?

CO1 1:14  I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;

CO1 1:15  Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.

CO1 1:16  And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not
 whether I baptized any other.

CO1 1:17  For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with
 wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.

CO1 1:18  For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness;
 but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.

CO1 1:19  For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will
 bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.

CO1 1:20  Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this
 world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?

CO1 1:21  For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God,
 it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.

CO1 1:22  For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:

CO1 1:23  But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and
 unto the Greeks foolishness;

CO1 1:24  But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the
 power of God, and the wisdom of God.

CO1 1:25  Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of
 God is stronger than men.

CO1 1:26  For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after
 the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:

CO1 1:27  But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the
 wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things
 which are mighty;

CO1 1:28  And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God
 chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:

CO1 1:29  That no flesh should glory in his presence.

CO1 1:30  But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us
 wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:

CO1 1:31  That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory
 in the Lord.

CO1 2:1  And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of
 speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.

CO1 2:2  For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus
 Christ, and him crucified.

CO1 2:3  And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.

CO1 2:4  And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's
 wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:

CO1 2:5  That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the
 power of God.

CO1 2:6  Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the
 wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:

CO1 2:7  But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom,
 which God ordained before the world unto our glory:

CO1 2:8  Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known
 it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.

CO1 2:9  But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have
 entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them
 that love him.

CO1 2:10  But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit
 searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.

CO1 2:11  For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man
 which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of
 God.

CO1 2:12  Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit
 which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of
 God.

CO1 2:13  Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom
 teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with
 spiritual.

CO1 2:14  But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God:
 for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are
 spiritually discerned.

CO1 2:15  But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged
 of no man.

CO1 2:16  For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him?
 But we have the mind of Christ.

CO1 3:1  And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as
 unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.

CO1 3:2  I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not
 able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.

CO1 3:3  For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and
 strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?

CO1 3:4  For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are
 ye not carnal?

CO1 3:5  Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye
 believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?

CO1 3:6  I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.

CO1 3:7  So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that
 watereth; but God that giveth the increase.

CO1 3:8  Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall
 receive his own reward according to his own labour.

CO1 3:9  For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are
 God's building.

CO1 3:10  According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise
 masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But
 let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.

CO1 3:11  For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus
 Christ.

CO1 3:12  Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious
 stones, wood, hay, stubble;

CO1 3:13  Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare
 it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's
 work of what sort it is.

CO1 3:14  If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall
 receive a reward.

CO1 3:15  If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he
 himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.

CO1 3:16  Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God
 dwelleth in you?

CO1 3:17  If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the
 temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.

CO1 3:18  Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise
 in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.

CO1 3:19  For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is
 written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.

CO1 3:20  And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are
 vain.

CO1 3:21  Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your's;

CO1 3:22  Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death,
 or things present, or things to come; all are your's;

CO1 3:23  And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.

CO1 4:1  Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and
 stewards of the mysteries of God.

CO1 4:2  Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.

CO1 4:3  But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you,
 or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.

CO1 4:4  For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he
 that judgeth me is the Lord.

CO1 4:5  Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both
 will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the
 counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.

CO1 4:6  And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself
 and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men
 above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against
 another.

CO1 4:7  For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that
 thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as
 if thou hadst not received it?

CO1 4:8  Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us:
 and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.

CO1 4:9  For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were
 appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to
 angels, and to men.

CO1 4:10  We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are
 weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.

CO1 4:11  Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are
 naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;

CO1 4:12  And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless;
 being persecuted, we suffer it:

CO1 4:13  Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and
 are the offscouring of all things unto this day.

CO1 4:14  I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn
 you.

CO1 4:15  For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet have ye
 not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.

CO1 4:16  Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.

CO1 4:17  For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved
 son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my
 ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.

CO1 4:18  Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.

CO1 4:19  But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not
 the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.

CO1 4:20  For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.

CO1 4:21  What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and
 in the spirit of meekness?

CO1 5:1  It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such
 fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should
 have his father's wife.

CO1 5:2  And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath
 done this deed might be taken away from among you.

CO1 5:3  For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged
 already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this
 deed,

CO1 5:4  In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered
 together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,

CO1 5:5  To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh,
 that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.

CO1 5:6  Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth
 the whole lump?

CO1 5:7  Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye
 are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:

CO1 5:8  Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the
 leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity
 and truth.

CO1 5:9  I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:

CO1 5:10  Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the
 covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out
 of the world.

CO1 5:11  But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that
 is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a
 railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.

CO1 5:12  For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye
 judge them that are within?

CO1 5:13  But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among
 yourselves that wicked person.

CO1 6:1  Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the
 unjust, and not before the saints?

CO1 6:2  Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world
 shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?

CO1 6:3  Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that
 pertain to this life?

CO1 6:4  If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them
 to judge who are least esteemed in the church.

CO1 6:5  I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among
 you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?

CO1 6:6  But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the
 unbelievers.

CO1 6:7  Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law
 one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather
 suffer yourselves to be defrauded?

CO1 6:8  Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.

CO1 6:9  Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?
 Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor
 effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,

CO1 6:10  Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
 extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

CO1 6:11  And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified,
 but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our
 God.

CO1 6:12  All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all
 things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.

CO1 6:13  Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy
 both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and
 the Lord for the body.

CO1 6:14  And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by
 his own power.

CO1 6:15  Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then
 take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God
 forbid.

CO1 6:16  What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body?
 for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.

CO1 6:17  But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.

CO1 6:18  Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but
 he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.

CO1 6:19  What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost
 which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?

CO1 6:20  For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your
 body, and in your spirit, which are God's.

CO1 7:1  Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a
 man not to touch a woman.

CO1 7:2  Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own
 wife, and let every woman have her own husband.

CO1 7:3  Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise
 also the wife unto the husband.

CO1 7:4  The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise
 also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.

CO1 7:5  Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time,
 that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again,
 that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.

CO1 7:6  But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.

CO1 7:7  For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his
 proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.

CO1 7:8  I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if
 they abide even as I.

CO1 7:9  But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry
 than to burn.

CO1 7:10  And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the
 wife depart from her husband:

CO1 7:11  But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to
 her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.

CO1 7:12  But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife
 that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her
 away.

CO1 7:13  And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be
 pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.

CO1 7:14  For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the
 unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children
 unclean; but now are they holy.

CO1 7:15  But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister
 is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.

CO1 7:16  For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband?
 or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?

CO1 7:17  But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called
 every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.

CO1 7:18  Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become
 uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.

CO1 7:19  Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the
 keeping of the commandments of God.

CO1 7:20  Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.

CO1 7:21  Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest
 be made free, use it rather.

CO1 7:22  For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's
 freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant.

CO1 7:23  Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.

CO1 7:24  Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with
 God.

CO1 7:25  Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give
 my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.

CO1 7:26  I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I
 say, that it is good for a man so to be.

CO1 7:27  Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed
 from a wife? seek not a wife.

CO1 7:28  But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry,
 she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I
 spare you.

CO1 7:29  But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both
 they that have wives be as though they had none;

CO1 7:30  And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice,
 as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;

CO1 7:31  And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of
 this world passeth away.

CO1 7:32  But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth
 for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:

CO1 7:33  But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world,
 how he may please his wife.

CO1 7:34  There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried
 woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body
 and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world,
 how she may please her husband.

CO1 7:35  And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare
 upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord
 without distraction.

CO1 7:36  But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his
 virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do
 what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.

CO1 7:37  Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no
 necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart
 that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.

CO1 7:38  So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth
 her not in marriage doeth better.

CO1 7:39  The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if
 her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only
 in the Lord.

CO1 7:40  But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think
 also that I have the Spirit of God.

CO1 8:1  Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have
 knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.

CO1 8:2  And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet
 as he ought to know.

CO1 8:3  But if any man love God, the same is known of him.

CO1 8:4  As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in
 sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that
 there is none other God but one.

CO1 8:5  For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in
 earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)

CO1 8:6  But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things,
 and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by
 him.

CO1 8:7  Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with
 conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol;
 and their conscience being weak is defiled.

CO1 8:8  But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the
 better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.

CO1 8:9  But take heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become a
 stumblingblock to them that are weak.

CO1 8:10  For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the
 idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to
 eat those things which are offered to idols;

CO1 8:11  And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom
 Christ died?

CO1 8:12  But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak
 conscience, ye sin against Christ.

CO1 8:13  Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh
 while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.

CO1 9:1  Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our
 Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?

CO1 9:2  If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the
 seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.

CO1 9:3  Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,

CO1 9:4  Have we not power to eat and to drink?

CO1 9:5  Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other
 apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?

CO1 9:6  Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?

CO1 9:7  Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a
 vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and
 eateth not of the milk of the flock?

CO1 9:8  Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?

CO1 9:9  For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth
 of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?

CO1 9:10  Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt,
 this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that
 thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.

CO1 9:11  If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we
 shall reap your carnal things?

CO1 9:12  If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather?
 Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we
 should hinder the gospel of Christ.

CO1 9:13  Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the
 things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the
 altar?

CO1 9:14  Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel
 should live of the gospel.

CO1 9:15  But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these
 things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die,
 than that any man should make my glorying void.

CO1 9:16  For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for
 necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!

CO1 9:17  For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my
 will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.

CO1 9:18  What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may
 make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the
 gospel.

CO1 9:19  For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant
 unto all, that I might gain the more.

CO1 9:20  And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews;
 to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that
 are under the law;

CO1 9:21  To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law
 to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without
 law.

CO1 9:22  To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made
 all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.

CO1 9:23  And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof
 with you.

CO1 9:24  Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth
 the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.

CO1 9:25  And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all
 things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an
 incorruptible.

CO1 9:26  I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that
 beateth the air:

CO1 9:27  But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by
 any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.

CO1 10:1  Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that
 all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;

CO1 10:2  And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;

CO1 10:3  And did all eat the same spiritual meat;

CO1 10:4  And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that
 spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.

CO1 10:5  But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were
 overthrown in the wilderness.

CO1 10:6  Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust
 after evil things, as they also lusted.

CO1 10:7  Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The
 people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.

CO1 10:8  Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and
 fell in one day three and twenty thousand.

CO1 10:9  Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were
 destroyed of serpents.

CO1 10:10  Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed
 of the destroyer.

CO1 10:11  Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are
 written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.

CO1 10:12  Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.

CO1 10:13  There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but
 God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are
 able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be
 able to bear it.

CO1 10:14  Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.

CO1 10:15  I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.

CO1 10:16  The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the
 blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the
 body of Christ?

CO1 10:17  For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all
 partakers of that one bread.

CO1 10:18  Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the
 sacrifices partakers of the altar?

CO1 10:19  What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is
 offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?

CO1 10:20  But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they
 sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have
 fellowship with devils.

CO1 10:21  Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye
 cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.

CO1 10:22  Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?

CO1 10:23  All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all
 things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.

CO1 10:24  Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.

CO1 10:25  Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for
 conscience sake:

CO1 10:26  For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.

CO1 10:27  If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be
 disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for
 conscience sake.

CO1 10:28  But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto
 idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the
 earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:

CO1 10:29  Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my
 liberty judged of another man's conscience?

CO1 10:30  For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that
 for which I give thanks?

CO1 10:31  Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all
 to the glory of God.

CO1 10:32  Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor
 to the church of God:

CO1 10:33  Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit,
 but the profit of many, that they may be saved.

CO1 11:1  Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.

CO1 11:2  Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and
 keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.

CO1 11:3  But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and
 the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.

CO1 11:4  Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered,
 dishonoureth his head.

CO1 11:5  But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered
 dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.

CO1 11:6  For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be
 a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.

CO1 11:7  For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the
 image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.

CO1 11:8  For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.

CO1 11:9  Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.

CO1 11:10  For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because
 of the angels.

CO1 11:11  Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman
 without the man, in the Lord.

CO1 11:12  For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the
 woman; but all things of God.

CO1 11:13  Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God
 uncovered?

CO1 11:14  Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long
 hair, it is a shame unto him?

CO1 11:15  But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is
 given her for a covering.

CO1 11:16  But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom,
 neither the churches of God.

CO1 11:17  Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come
 together not for the better, but for the worse.

CO1 11:18  For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that
 there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.

CO1 11:19  For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are
 approved may be made manifest among you.

CO1 11:20  When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat
 the Lord's supper.

CO1 11:21  For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one
 is hungry, and another is drunken.

CO1 11:22  What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the
 church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I
 praise you in this? I praise you not.

CO1 11:23  For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto
 you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:

CO1 11:24  And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this
 is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.

CO1 11:25  After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped,
 saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye
 drink it, in remembrance of me.

CO1 11:26  For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew
 the Lord's death till he come.

CO1 11:27  Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the
 Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.

CO1 11:28  But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and
 drink of that cup.

CO1 11:29  For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
 damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.

CO1 11:30  For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.

CO1 11:31  For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.

CO1 11:32  But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should
 not be condemned with the world.

CO1 11:33  Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for
 another.

CO1 11:34  And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not
 together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.

CO1 12:1  Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you
 ignorant.

CO1 12:2  Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols,
 even as ye were led.

CO1 12:3  Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the
 Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is
 the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.

CO1 12:4  Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.

CO1 12:5  And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.

CO1 12:6  And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which
 worketh all in all.

CO1 12:7  But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit
 withal.

CO1 12:8  For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the
 word of knowledge by the same Spirit;

CO1 12:9  To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing
 by the same Spirit;

CO1 12:10  To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another
 discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the
 interpretation of tongues:

CO1 12:11  But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to
 every man severally as he will.

CO1 12:12  For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members
 of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.

CO1 12:13  For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be
 Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink
 into one Spirit.

CO1 12:14  For the body is not one member, but many.

CO1 12:15  If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the
 body; is it therefore not of the body?

CO1 12:16  And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the
 body; is it therefore not of the body?

CO1 12:17  If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole
 were hearing, where were the smelling?

CO1 12:18  But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as
 it hath pleased him.

CO1 12:19  And if they were all one member, where were the body?

CO1 12:20  But now are they many members, yet but one body.

CO1 12:21  And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor
 again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.

CO1 12:22  Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more
 feeble, are necessary:

CO1 12:23  And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable,
 upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more
 abundant comeliness.

CO1 12:24  For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body
 together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked.

CO1 12:25  That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members
 should have the same care one for another.

CO1 12:26  And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or
 one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.

CO1 12:27  Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.

CO1 12:28  And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily
 prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings,
 helps, governments, diversities of tongues.

CO1 12:29  Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all
 workers of miracles?

CO1 12:30  Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all
 interpret?

CO1 12:31  But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more
 excellent way.

CO1 13:1  Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not
 charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

CO1 13:2  And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries,
 and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove
 mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.

CO1 13:3  And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give
 my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.

CO1 13:4  Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity
 vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,

CO1 13:5  Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily
 provoked, thinketh no evil;

CO1 13:6  Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;

CO1 13:7  Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth
 all things.

CO1 13:8  Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall
 fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge,
 it shall vanish away.

CO1 13:9  For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.

CO1 13:10  But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part
 shall be done away.

CO1 13:11  When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I
 thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.

CO1 13:12  For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I
 know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.

CO1 13:13  And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest
 of these is charity.

CO1 14:1  Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye
 may prophesy.

CO1 14:2  For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but
 unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh
 mysteries.

CO1 14:3  But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and
 exhortation, and comfort.

CO1 14:4  He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that
 prophesieth edifieth the church.

CO1 14:5  I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied:
 for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except
 he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.

CO1 14:6  Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I
 profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by
 knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?

CO1 14:7  And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp,
 except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is
 piped or harped?

CO1 14:8  For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself
 to the battle?

CO1 14:9  So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be
 understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the
 air.

CO1 14:10  There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none
 of them is without signification.

CO1 14:11  Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto
 him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto
 me.

CO1 14:12  Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek
 that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.

CO1 14:13  Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he
 may interpret.

CO1 14:14  For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my
 understanding is unfruitful.

CO1 14:15  What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with
 the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the
 understanding also.

CO1 14:16  Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that
 occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing
 he understandeth not what thou sayest?

CO1 14:17  For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.

CO1 14:18  I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:

CO1 14:19  Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my
 understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand
 words in an unknown tongue.

CO1 14:20  Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye
 children, but in understanding be men.

CO1 14:21  In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips
 will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me,
 saith the LORD.

CO1 14:22  Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but
 to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe
 not, but for them which believe.

CO1 14:23  If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and
 all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or
 unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?

CO1 14:24  But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or
 one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:

CO1 14:25  And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling
 down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a
 truth.

CO1 14:26  How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you
 hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an
 interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.

CO1 14:27  If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the
 most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.

CO1 14:28  But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church;
 and let him speak to himself, and to God.

CO1 14:29  Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.

CO1 14:30  If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first
 hold his peace.

CO1 14:31  For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may
 be comforted.

CO1 14:32  And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.

CO1 14:33  For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all
 churches of the saints.

CO1 14:34  Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted
 unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also
 saith the law.

CO1 14:35  And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at
 home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.

CO1 14:36  What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?

CO1 14:37  If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him
 acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the
 Lord.

CO1 14:38  But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.

CO1 14:39  Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with
 tongues.

CO1 14:40  Let all things be done decently and in order.

CO1 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached
 unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;

CO1 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto
 you, unless ye have believed in vain.

CO1 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how
 that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;

CO1 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day
 according to the scriptures:

CO1 15:5  And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:

CO1 15:6  After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of
 whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.

CO1 15:7  After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.

CO1 15:8  And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due
 time.

CO1 15:9  For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an
 apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

CO1 15:10  But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was
 bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they
 all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.

CO1 15:11  Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye
 believed.

CO1 15:12  Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some
 among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?

CO1 15:13  But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not
 risen:

CO1 15:14  And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your
 faith is also vain.

CO1 15:15  Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have
 testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be
 that the dead rise not.

CO1 15:16  For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:

CO1 15:17  And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your
 sins.

CO1 15:18  Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.

CO1 15:19  If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most
 miserable.

CO1 15:20  But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits
 of them that slept.

CO1 15:21  For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection
 of the dead.

CO1 15:22  For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.

CO1 15:23  But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward
 they that are Christ's at his coming.

CO1 15:24  Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to
 God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority
 and power.

CO1 15:25  For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.

CO1 15:26  The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.

CO1 15:27  For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all
 things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put
 all things under him.

CO1 15:28  And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son
 also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may
 be all in all.

CO1 15:29  Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead
 rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?

CO1 15:30  And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?

CO1 15:31  I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I
 die daily.

CO1 15:32  If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus,
 what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to
 morrow we die.

CO1 15:33  Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.

CO1 15:34  Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge
 of God: I speak this to your shame.

CO1 15:35  But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what
 body do they come?

CO1 15:36  Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:

CO1 15:37  And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be,
 but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:

CO1 15:38  But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed
 his own body.

CO1 15:39  All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of
 men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.

CO1 15:40  There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the
 glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.

CO1 15:41  There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and
 another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in
 glory.

CO1 15:42  So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption;
 it is raised in incorruption:

CO1 15:43  It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in
 weakness; it is raised in power:

CO1 15:44  It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a
 natural body, and there is a spiritual body.

CO1 15:45  And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the
 last Adam was made a quickening spirit.

CO1 15:46  Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is
 natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.

CO1 15:47  The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord
 from heaven.

CO1 15:48  As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the
 heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.

CO1 15:49  And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the
 image of the heavenly.

CO1 15:50  Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
 kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.

CO1 15:51  Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall
 all be changed,

CO1 15:52  In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the
 trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall
 be changed.

CO1 15:53  For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must
 put on immortality.

CO1 15:54  So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this
 mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the
 saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

CO1 15:55  O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?

CO1 15:56  The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.

CO1 15:57  But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord
 Jesus Christ.

CO1 15:58  Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always
 abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is
 not in vain in the Lord.

CO1 16:1  Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order
 to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.

CO1 16:2  Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in
 store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.

CO1 16:3  And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them
 will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.

CO1 16:4  And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.

CO1 16:5  Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I
 do pass through Macedonia.

CO1 16:6  And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye
 may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.

CO1 16:7  For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while
 with you, if the Lord permit.

CO1 16:8  But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.

CO1 16:9  For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many
 adversaries.

CO1 16:10  Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for
 he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.

CO1 16:11  Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace,
 that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.

CO1 16:12  As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto
 you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but
 he will come when he shall have convenient time.

CO1 16:13  Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.

CO1 16:14  Let all your things be done with charity.

CO1 16:15  I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is
 the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the
 ministry of the saints,)

CO1 16:16  That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth
 with us, and laboureth.

CO1 16:17  I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus:
 for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.

CO1 16:18  For they have refreshed my spirit and your's: therefore acknowledge
 ye them that are such.

CO1 16:19  The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you
 much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.

CO1 16:20  All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.

CO1 16:21  The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.

CO1 16:22  If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema
 Maranatha.

CO1 16:23  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

CO1 16:24  My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.

CO2 1:1  Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our
 brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints
 which are in all Achaia:

CO2 1:2  Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus
 Christ.

CO2 1:3  Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father
 of mercies, and the God of all comfort;

CO2 1:4  Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to
 comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves
 are comforted of God.

CO2 1:5  For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also
 aboundeth by Christ.

CO2 1:6  And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation,
 which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also
 suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.

CO2 1:7  And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers
 of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.

CO2 1:8  For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which
 came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength,
 insomuch that we despaired even of life:

CO2 1:9  But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not
 trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:

CO2 1:10  Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we
 trust that he will yet deliver us;

CO2 1:11  Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed
 upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our
 behalf.

CO2 1:12  For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in
 simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of
 God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to
 you-ward.

CO2 1:13  For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or
 acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;

CO2 1:14  As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing,
 even as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus.

CO2 1:15  And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye
 might have a second benefit;

CO2 1:16  And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia
 unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.

CO2 1:17  When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things
 that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there
 should be yea yea, and nay nay?

CO2 1:18  But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.

CO2 1:19  For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us,
 even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was
 yea.

CO2 1:20  For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the
 glory of God by us.

CO2 1:21  Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us,
 is God;

CO2 1:22  Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our
 hearts.

CO2 1:23  Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I
 came not as yet unto Corinth.

CO2 1:24  Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of
 your joy: for by faith ye stand.

CO2 2:1  But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you
 in heaviness.

CO2 2:2  For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the
 same which is made sorry by me?

CO2 2:3  And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have
 sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all,
 that my joy is the joy of you all.

CO2 2:4  For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with
 many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love
 which I have more abundantly unto you.

CO2 2:5  But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part:
 that I may not overcharge you all.

CO2 2:6  Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of
 many.

CO2 2:7  So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him,
 lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.

CO2 2:8  Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.

CO2 2:9  For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you,
 whether ye be obedient in all things.

CO2 2:10  To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any
 thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of
 Christ;

CO2 2:11  Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of
 his devices.

CO2 2:12  Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a
 door was opened unto me of the Lord,

CO2 2:13  I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but
 taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.

CO2 2:14  Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in
 Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.

CO2 2:15  For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are
 saved, and in them that perish:

CO2 2:16  To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other
 the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?

CO2 2:17  For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of
 sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.

CO2 3:1  Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others,
 epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?

CO2 3:2  Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:

CO2 3:3  Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ
 ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living
 God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.

CO2 3:4  And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:

CO2 3:5  Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of
 ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;

CO2 3:6  Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the
 letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth
 life.

CO2 3:7  But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was
 glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face
 of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:

CO2 3:8  How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?

CO2 3:9  For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the
 ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.

CO2 3:10  For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect,
 by reason of the glory that excelleth.

CO2 3:11  For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which
 remaineth is glorious.

CO2 3:12  Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:

CO2 3:13  And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children
 of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:

CO2 3:14  But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same
 vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done
 away in Christ.

CO2 3:15  But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their
 heart.

CO2 3:16  Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken
 away.

CO2 3:17  Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord
 is, there is liberty.

CO2 3:18  But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the
 Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the
 Spirit of the LORD.

CO2 4:1  Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we
 faint not;

CO2 4:2  But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in
 craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation
 of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of
 God.

CO2 4:3  But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:

CO2 4:4  In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which
 believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the
 image of God, should shine unto them.

CO2 4:5  For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves
 your servants for Jesus' sake.

CO2 4:6  For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined
 in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the
 face of Jesus Christ.

CO2 4:7  But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency
 of the power may be of God, and not of us.

CO2 4:8  We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed,
 but not in despair;

CO2 4:9  Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;

CO2 4:10  Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that
 the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.

CO2 4:11  For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake,
 that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.

CO2 4:12  So then death worketh in us, but life in you.

CO2 4:13  We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I
 believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;

CO2 4:14  Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also
 by Jesus, and shall present us with you.

CO2 4:15  For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might
 through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.

CO2 4:16  For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet
 the inward man is renewed day by day.

CO2 4:17  For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a
 far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;

CO2 4:18  While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things
 which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the
 things which are not seen are eternal.

CO2 5:1  For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
 dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal
 in the heavens.

CO2 5:2  For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our
 house which is from heaven:

CO2 5:3  If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.

CO2 5:4  For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for
 that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be
 swallowed up of life.

CO2 5:5  Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also
 hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.

CO2 5:6  Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home
 in the body, we are absent from the Lord:

CO2 5:7  (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)

CO2 5:8  We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the
 body, and to be present with the Lord.

CO2 5:9  Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be
 accepted of him.

CO2 5:10  For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every
 one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done,
 whether it be good or bad.

CO2 5:11  Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are
 made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your
 consciences.

CO2 5:12  For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to
 glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in
 appearance, and not in heart.

CO2 5:13  For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be
 sober, it is for your cause.

CO2 5:14  For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that
 if one died for all, then were all dead:

CO2 5:15  And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth
 live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.

CO2 5:16  Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we
 have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.

CO2 5:17  Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things
 are passed away; behold, all things are become new.

CO2 5:18  And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus
 Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;

CO2 5:19  To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself,
 not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word
 of reconciliation.

CO2 5:20  Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you
 by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.

CO2 5:21  For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might
 be made the righteousness of God in him.

CO2 6:1  We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye
 receive not the grace of God in vain.

CO2 6:2  (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of
 salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold,
 now is the day of salvation.)

CO2 6:3  Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:

CO2 6:4  But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much
 patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,

CO2 6:5  In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in
 fastings;

CO2 6:6  By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy
 Ghost, by love unfeigned,

CO2 6:7  By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of
 righteousness on the right hand and on the left,

CO2 6:8  By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers,
 and yet true;

CO2 6:9  As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as
 chastened, and not killed;

CO2 6:10  As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as
 having nothing, and yet possessing all things.

CO2 6:11  O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.

CO2 6:12  Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own
 bowels.

CO2 6:13  Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be
 ye also enlarged.

CO2 6:14  Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what
 fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath
 light with darkness?

CO2 6:15  And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that
 believeth with an infidel?

CO2 6:16  And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the
 temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk
 in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

CO2 6:17  Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the
 Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.

CO2 6:18  And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters,
 saith the Lord Almighty.

CO2 7:1  Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
 ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness
 in the fear of God.

CO2 7:2  Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have
 defrauded no man.

CO2 7:3  I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are
 in our hearts to die and live with you.

CO2 7:4  Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of
 you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.

CO2 7:5  For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we
 were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.

CO2 7:6  Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted
 us by the coming of Titus;

CO2 7:7  And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was
 comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your
 fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.

CO2 7:8  For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I
 did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though
 it were but for a season.

CO2 7:9  Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to
 repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might
 receive damage by us in nothing.

CO2 7:10  For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented
 of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.

CO2 7:11  For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort,
 what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea,
 what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal,
 yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in
 this matter.

CO2 7:12  Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that
 had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care
 for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.

CO2 7:13  Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the
 more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you
 all.

CO2 7:14  For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but
 as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made
 before Titus, is found a truth.

CO2 7:15  And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he
 remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received
 him.

CO2 7:16  I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.

CO2 8:1  Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on
 the churches of Macedonia;

CO2 8:2  How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and
 their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.

CO2 8:3  For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they
 were willing of themselves;

CO2 8:4  Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take
 upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.

CO2 8:5  And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves
 to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.

CO2 8:6  Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also
 finish in you the same grace also.

CO2 8:7  Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and
 knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound
 in this grace also.

CO2 8:8  I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of
 others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.

CO2 8:9  For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was
 rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be
 rich.

CO2 8:10  And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have
 begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.

CO2 8:11  Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness
 to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.

CO2 8:12  For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to
 that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.

CO2 8:13  For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:

CO2 8:14  But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a
 supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your
 want: that there may be equality:

CO2 8:15  As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he
 that had gathered little had no lack.

CO2 8:16  But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart
 of Titus for you.

CO2 8:17  For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of
 his own accord he went unto you.

CO2 8:18  And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel
 throughout all the churches;

CO2 8:19  And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel
 with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same
 Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:

CO2 8:20  Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is
 administered by us:

CO2 8:21  Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but
 also in the sight of men.

CO2 8:22  And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes
 proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great
 confidence which I have in you.

CO2 8:23  Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper
 concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers
 of the churches, and the glory of Christ.

CO2 8:24  Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your
 love, and of our boasting on your behalf.

CO2 9:1  For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for
 me to write to you:

CO2 9:2  For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you
 to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath
 provoked very many.

CO2 9:3  Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in
 vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:

CO2 9:4  Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared,
 we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.

CO2 9:5  Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they
 would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had
 notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not
 as of covetousness.

CO2 9:6  But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly;
 and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.

CO2 9:7  Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not
 grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.

CO2 9:8  And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always
 having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:

CO2 9:9  (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the
 poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.

CO2 9:10  Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for
 your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your
 righteousness;)

CO2 9:11  Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth
 through us thanksgiving to God.

CO2 9:12  For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want
 of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;

CO2 9:13  Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for
 your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal
 distribution unto them, and unto all men;

CO2 9:14  And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding
 grace of God in you.

CO2 9:15  Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.

CO2 10:1  Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of
 Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward
 you:

CO2 10:2  But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that
 confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as
 if we walked according to the flesh.

CO2 10:3  For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:

CO2 10:4  (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through
 God to the pulling down of strong holds;)

CO2 10:5  Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself
 against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought
 to the obedience of Christ;

CO2 10:6  And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your
 obedience is fulfilled.

CO2 10:7  Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust
 to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as
 he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.

CO2 10:8  For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the
 Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should
 not be ashamed:

CO2 10:9  That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.

CO2 10:10  For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily
 presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.

CO2 10:11  Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters
 when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.

CO2 10:12  For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves
 with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by
 themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.

CO2 10:13  But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according
 to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to
 reach even unto you.

CO2 10:14  For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we
 reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the
 gospel of Christ:

CO2 10:15  Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's
 labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be
 enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,

CO2 10:16  To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in
 another man's line of things made ready to our hand.

CO2 10:17  But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.

CO2 10:18  For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord
 commendeth.

CO2 11:1  Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed
 bear with me.

CO2 11:2  For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused
 you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.

CO2 11:3  But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through
 his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is
 in Christ.

CO2 11:4  For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not
 preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or
 another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.

CO2 11:5  For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.

CO2 11:6  But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have
 been throughly made manifest among you in all things.

CO2 11:7  Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be
 exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?

CO2 11:8  I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.

CO2 11:9  And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no
 man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia
 supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto
 you, and so will I keep myself.

CO2 11:10  As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this
 boasting in the regions of Achaia.

CO2 11:11  Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.

CO2 11:12  But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them
 which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.

CO2 11:13  For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming
 themselves into the apostles of Christ.

CO2 11:14  And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of
 light.

CO2 11:15  Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed
 as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their
 works.

CO2 11:16  I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool
 receive me, that I may boast myself a little.

CO2 11:17  That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were
 foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.

CO2 11:18  Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.

CO2 11:19  For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.

CO2 11:20  For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you,
 if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.

CO2 11:21  I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit
 whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.

CO2 11:22  Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they
 the seed of Abraham? so am I.

CO2 11:23  Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in
 labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in
 deaths oft.

CO2 11:24  Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.

CO2 11:25  Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered
 shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;

CO2 11:26  In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in
 perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the
 city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among
 false brethren;

CO2 11:27  In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and
 thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.

CO2 11:28  Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me
 daily, the care of all the churches.

CO2 11:29  Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?

CO2 11:30  If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine
 infirmities.

CO2 11:31  The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for
 evermore, knoweth that I lie not.

CO2 11:32  In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the
 Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:

CO2 11:33  And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and
 escaped his hands.

CO2 12:1  It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions
 and revelations of the Lord.

CO2 12:2  I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the
 body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)
 such an one caught up to the third heaven.

CO2 12:3  And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I
 cannot tell: God knoweth;)

CO2 12:4  How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words,
 which it is not lawful for a man to utter.

CO2 12:5  Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in
 mine infirmities.

CO2 12:6  For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will
 say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that
 which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.

CO2 12:7  And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance
 of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger
 of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.

CO2 12:8  For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from
 me.

CO2 12:9  And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength
 is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my
 infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.

CO2 12:10  Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in
 necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am
 weak, then am I strong.

CO2 12:11  I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to
 have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest
 apostles, though I be nothing.

CO2 12:12  Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all
 patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.

CO2 12:13  For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it
 be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.

CO2 12:14  Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be
 burdensome to you: for I seek not your's but you: for the children ought not
 to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.

CO2 12:15  And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more
 abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.

CO2 12:16  But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I
 caught you with guile.

CO2 12:17  Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?

CO2 12:18  I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a
 gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same
 steps?

CO2 12:19  Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before
 God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.

CO2 12:20  For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I
 would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be
 debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings,
 tumults:

CO2 12:21  And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and
 that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented
 of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have
 committed.

CO2 13:1  This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or
 three witnesses shall every word be established.

CO2 13:2  I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second
 time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and
 to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:

CO2 13:3  Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is
 not weak, but is mighty in you.

CO2 13:4  For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the
 power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the
 power of God toward you.

CO2 13:5  Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own
 selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except
 ye be reprobates?

CO2 13:6  But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.

CO2 13:7  Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear
 approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as
 reprobates.

CO2 13:8  For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.

CO2 13:9  For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also
 we wish, even your perfection.

CO2 13:10  Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I
 should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to
 edification, and not to destruction.

CO2 13:11  Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of
 one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.

CO2 13:12  Greet one another with an holy kiss.

CO2 13:13  All the saints salute you.

CO2 13:14  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
 communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.

JOH 1:1  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
 was God.

JOH 1:2  The same was in the beginning with God.

JOH 1:3  All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made
 that was made.

JOH 1:4  In him was life; and the life was the light of men.

JOH 1:5  And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it
 not.

JOH 1:6  There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.

JOH 1:7  The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all
 men through him might believe.

JOH 1:8  He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.

JOH 1:9  That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the
 world.

JOH 1:10  He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world
 knew him not.

JOH 1:11  He came unto his own, and his own received him not.

JOH 1:12  But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons
 of God, even to them that believe on his name:

JOH 1:13  Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor
 of the will of man, but of God.

JOH 1:14  And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his
 glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and
 truth.

JOH 1:15  John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I
 spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.

JOH 1:16  And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.

JOH 1:17  For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus
 Christ.

JOH 1:18  No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is
 in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.

JOH 1:19  And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and
 Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?

JOH 1:20  And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.

JOH 1:21  And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am
 not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.

JOH 1:22  Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer
 to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?

JOH 1:23  He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make
 straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.

JOH 1:24  And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.

JOH 1:25  And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if
 thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?

JOH 1:26  John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth
 one among you, whom ye know not;

JOH 1:27  He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's
 latchet I am not worthy to unloose.

JOH 1:28  These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was
 baptizing.

JOH 1:29  The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the
 Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.

JOH 1:30  This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred
 before me: for he was before me.

JOH 1:31  And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to
 Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.

JOH 1:32  And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven
 like a dove, and it abode upon him.

JOH 1:33  And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the
 same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and
 remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.

JOH 1:34  And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.

JOH 1:35  Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;

JOH 1:36  And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of
 God!

JOH 1:37  And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.

JOH 1:38  Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What
 seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted,
 Master,) where dwellest thou?

JOH 1:39  He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he
 dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.

JOH 1:40  One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew,
 Simon Peter's brother.

JOH 1:41  He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have
 found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.

JOH 1:42  And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou
 art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by
 interpretation, A stone.

JOH 1:43  The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth
 Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.

JOH 1:44  Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.

JOH 1:45  Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of
 whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the
 son of Joseph.

JOH 1:46  And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of
 Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.

JOH 1:47  Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an
 Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!

JOH 1:48  Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and
 said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig
 tree, I saw thee.

JOH 1:49  Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of
 God; thou art the King of Israel.

JOH 1:50  Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw
 thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than
 these.

JOH 1:51  And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye
 shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon
 the Son of man.

JOH 2:1  And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the
 mother of Jesus was there:

JOH 2:2  And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.

JOH 2:3  And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They
 have no wine.

JOH 2:4  Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is
 not yet come.

JOH 2:5  His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do
 it.

JOH 2:6  And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner
 of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.

JOH 2:7  Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled
 them up to the brim.

JOH 2:8  And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor
 of the feast. And they bare it.

JOH 2:9  When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made
 wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water
 knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,

JOH 2:10  And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good
 wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast
 kept the good wine until now.

JOH 2:11  This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and
 manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.

JOH 2:12  After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his
 brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.

JOH 2:13  And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

JOH 2:14  And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and
 the changers of money sitting:

JOH 2:15  And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out
 of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers'
 money, and overthrew the tables;

JOH 2:16  And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not
 my Father's house an house of merchandise.

JOH 2:17  And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine
 house hath eaten me up.

JOH 2:18  Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto
 us, seeing that thou doest these things?

JOH 2:19  Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three
 days I will raise it up.

JOH 2:20  Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in
 building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?

JOH 2:21  But he spake of the temple of his body.

JOH 2:22  When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered
 that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the
 word which Jesus had said.

JOH 2:23  Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many
 believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.

JOH 2:24  But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,

JOH 2:25  And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was
 in man.

JOH 3:1  There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the
 Jews:

JOH 3:2  The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know
 that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that
 thou doest, except God be with him.

JOH 3:3  Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
 Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

JOH 3:4  Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he
 enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?

JOH 3:5  Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born
 of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

JOH 3:6  That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born
 of the Spirit is spirit.

JOH 3:7  Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.

JOH 3:8  The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof,
 but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one
 that is born of the Spirit.

JOH 3:9  Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?

JOH 3:10  Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and
 knowest not these things?

JOH 3:11  Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and
 testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.

JOH 3:12  If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye
 believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?

JOH 3:13  And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from
 heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.

JOH 3:14  And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must
 the Son of man be lifted up:

JOH 3:15  That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal
 life.

JOH 3:16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
 whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

JOH 3:17  For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but
 that the world through him might be saved.

JOH 3:18  He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not
 is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only
 begotten Son of God.

JOH 3:19  And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and
 men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.

JOH 3:20  For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the
 light, lest his deeds should be reproved.

JOH 3:21  But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be
 made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

JOH 3:22  After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of
 Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.

JOH 3:23  And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was
 much water there: and they came, and were baptized.

JOH 3:24  For John was not yet cast into prison.

JOH 3:25  Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the
 Jews about purifying.

JOH 3:26  And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with
 thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same
 baptizeth, and all men come to him.

JOH 3:27  John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given
 him from heaven.

JOH 3:28  Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but
 that I am sent before him.

JOH 3:29  He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the
 bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the
 bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.

JOH 3:30  He must increase, but I must decrease.

JOH 3:31  He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is
 earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.

JOH 3:32  And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man
 receiveth his testimony.

JOH 3:33  He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is
 true.

JOH 3:34  For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth
 not the Spirit by measure unto him.

JOH 3:35  The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.

JOH 3:36  He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that
 believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on
 him.

JOH 4:1  When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus
 made and baptized more disciples than John,

JOH 4:2  (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)

JOH 4:3  He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.

JOH 4:4  And he must needs go through Samaria.

JOH 4:5  Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near
 to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

JOH 4:6  Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his
 journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.

JOH 4:7  There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her,
 Give me to drink.

JOH 4:8  (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)

JOH 4:9  Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a
 Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no
 dealings with the Samaritans.

JOH 4:10  Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of
 God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have
 asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.

JOH 4:11  The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and
 the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?

JOH 4:12  Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and
 drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?

JOH 4:13  Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water
 shall thirst again:

JOH 4:14  But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never
 thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water
 springing up into everlasting life.

JOH 4:15  The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not,
 neither come hither to draw.

JOH 4:16  Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.

JOH 4:17  The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her,
 Thou hast well said, I have no husband:

JOH 4:18  For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy
 husband: in that saidst thou truly.

JOH 4:19  The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.

JOH 4:20  Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in
 Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.

JOH 4:21  Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye
 shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.

JOH 4:22  Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation
 is of the Jews.

JOH 4:23  But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall
 worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to
 worship him.

JOH 4:24  God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit
 and in truth.

JOH 4:25  The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called
 Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.

JOH 4:26  Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.

JOH 4:27  And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with
 the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?

JOH 4:28  The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and
 saith to the men,

JOH 4:29  Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not
 this the Christ?

JOH 4:30  Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.

JOH 4:31  In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.

JOH 4:32  But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.

JOH 4:33  Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him
 ought to eat?

JOH 4:34  Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent
 me, and to finish his work.

JOH 4:35  Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?
 behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they
 are white already to harvest.

JOH 4:36  And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life
 eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.

JOH 4:37  And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.

JOH 4:38  I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men
 laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.

JOH 4:39  And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the
 saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.

JOH 4:40  So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he
 would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.

JOH 4:41  And many more believed because of his own word;

JOH 4:42  And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying:
 for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the
 Saviour of the world.

JOH 4:43  Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.

JOH 4:44  For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own
 country.

JOH 4:45  Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him,
 having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they
 also went unto the feast.

JOH 4:46  So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water
 wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.

JOH 4:47  When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went
 unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he
 was at the point of death.

JOH 4:48  Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will
 not believe.

JOH 4:49  The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.

JOH 4:50  Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man
 believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.

JOH 4:51  And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him,
 saying, Thy son liveth.

JOH 4:52  Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they
 said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.

JOH 4:53  So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus
 said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.

JOH 4:54  This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out
 of Judaea into Galilee.

JOH 5:1  After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to
 Jerusalem.

JOH 5:2  Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called
 in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.

JOH 5:3  In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt,
 withered, waiting for the moving of the water.

JOH 5:4  For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled
 the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in
 was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.

JOH 5:5  And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight
 years.

JOH 5:6  When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in
 that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?

JOH 5:7  The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is
 troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth
 down before me.

JOH 5:8  Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.

JOH 5:9  And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and
 walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.

JOH 5:10  The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath
 day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.

JOH 5:11  He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take
 up thy bed, and walk.

JOH 5:12  Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up
 thy bed, and walk?

JOH 5:13  And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed
 himself away, a multitude being in that place.

JOH 5:14  Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold,
 thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.

JOH 5:15  The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made
 him whole.

JOH 5:16  And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him,
 because he had done these things on the sabbath day.

JOH 5:17  But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.

JOH 5:18  Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only
 had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself
 equal with God.

JOH 5:19  Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto
 you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for
 what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.

JOH 5:20  For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that
 himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may
 marvel.

JOH 5:21  For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so
 the Son quickeneth whom he will.

JOH 5:22  For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto
 the Son:

JOH 5:23  That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.
 He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.

JOH 5:24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
 believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into
 condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.

JOH 5:25  Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when
 the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall
 live.

JOH 5:26  For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son
 to have life in himself;

JOH 5:27  And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is
 the Son of man.

JOH 5:28  Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are
 in the graves shall hear his voice,

JOH 5:29  And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection
 of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.

JOH 5:30  I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my
 judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the
 Father which hath sent me.

JOH 5:31  If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.

JOH 5:32  There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the
 witness which he witnesseth of me is true.

JOH 5:33  Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.

JOH 5:34  But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye
 might be saved.

JOH 5:35  He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a
 season to rejoice in his light.

JOH 5:36  But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the
 Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me,
 that the Father hath sent me.

JOH 5:37  And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me.
 Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.

JOH 5:38  And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him
 ye believe not.

JOH 5:39  Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and
 they are they which testify of me.

JOH 5:40  And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.

JOH 5:41  I receive not honour from men.

JOH 5:42  But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.

JOH 5:43  I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another
 shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.

JOH 5:44  How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not
 the honour that cometh from God only?

JOH 5:45  Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that
 accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.

JOH 5:46  For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of
 me.

JOH 5:47  But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?

JOH 6:1  After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the
 sea of Tiberias.

JOH 6:2  And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles
 which he did on them that were diseased.

JOH 6:3  And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his
 disciples.

JOH 6:4  And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.

JOH 6:5  When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto
 him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?

JOH 6:6  And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.

JOH 6:7  Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient
 for them, that every one of them may take a little.

JOH 6:8  One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him,

JOH 6:9  There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small
 fishes: but what are they among so many?

JOH 6:10  And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass
 in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.

JOH 6:11  And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he
 distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down;
 and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.

JOH 6:12  When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the
 fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.

JOH 6:13  Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with
 the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto
 them that had eaten.

JOH 6:14  Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said,
 This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.

JOH 6:15  When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by
 force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.

JOH 6:16  And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,

JOH 6:17  And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And
 it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.

JOH 6:18  And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.

JOH 6:19  So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they
 see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were
 afraid.

JOH 6:20  But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.

JOH 6:21  Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the
 ship was at the land whither they went.

JOH 6:22  The day following, when the people which stood on the other side
 of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto
 his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into
 the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;

JOH 6:23  (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place
 where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)

JOH 6:24  When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his
 disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.

JOH 6:25  And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said
 unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?

JOH 6:26  Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek
 me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the
 loaves, and were filled.

JOH 6:27  Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which
 endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for
 him hath God the Father sealed.

JOH 6:28  Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the
 works of God?

JOH 6:29  Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye
 believe on him whom he hath sent.

JOH 6:30  They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we
 may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?

JOH 6:31  Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave
 them bread from heaven to eat.

JOH 6:32  Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave
 you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from
 heaven.

JOH 6:33  For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth
 life unto the world.

JOH 6:34  Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.

JOH 6:35  And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to
 me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.

JOH 6:36  But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.

JOH 6:37  All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh
 to me I will in no wise cast out.

JOH 6:38  For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of
 him that sent me.

JOH 6:39  And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which
 he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the
 last day.

JOH 6:40  And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth
 the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise
 him up at the last day.

JOH 6:41  The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which
 came down from heaven.

JOH 6:42  And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and
 mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?

JOH 6:43  Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among
 yourselves.

JOH 6:44  No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him:
 and I will raise him up at the last day.

JOH 6:45  It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God.
 Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh
 unto me.

JOH 6:46  Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he
 hath seen the Father.

JOH 6:47  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath
 everlasting life.

JOH 6:48  I am that bread of life.

JOH 6:49  Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.

JOH 6:50  This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat
 thereof, and not die.

JOH 6:51  I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of
 this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my
 flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.

JOH 6:52  The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man
 give us his flesh to eat?

JOH 6:53  Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye
 eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.

JOH 6:54  Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and
 I will raise him up at the last day.

JOH 6:55  For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.

JOH 6:56  He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I
 in him.

JOH 6:57  As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he
 that eateth me, even he shall live by me.

JOH 6:58  This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers
 did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for
 ever.

JOH 6:59  These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.

JOH 6:60  Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This
 is an hard saying; who can hear it?

JOH 6:61  When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said
 unto them, Doth this offend you?

JOH 6:62  What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was
 before?

JOH 6:63  It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the
 words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.

JOH 6:64  But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the
 beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.

JOH 6:65  And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me,
 except it were given unto him of my Father.

JOH 6:66  From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more
 with him.

JOH 6:67  Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?

JOH 6:68  Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast
 the words of eternal life.

JOH 6:69  And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the
 living God.

JOH 6:70  Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is
 a devil?

JOH 6:71  He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that
 should betray him, being one of the twelve.

JOH 7:1  After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in
 Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.

JOH 7:2  Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.

JOH 7:3  His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into
 Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.

JOH 7:4  For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself
 seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the
 world.

JOH 7:5  For neither did his brethren believe in him.

JOH 7:6  Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is
 alway ready.

JOH 7:7  The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it,
 that the works thereof are evil.

JOH 7:8  Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time
 is not yet full come.

JOH 7:9  When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.

JOH 7:10  But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the
 feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.

JOH 7:11  Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?

JOH 7:12  And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for
 some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.

JOH 7:13  Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.

JOH 7:14  Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and
 taught.

JOH 7:15  And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having
 never learned?

JOH 7:16  Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that
 sent me.

JOH 7:17  If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether
 it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.

JOH 7:18  He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that
 seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is
 in him.

JOH 7:19  Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?
 Why go ye about to kill me?

JOH 7:20  The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to
 kill thee?

JOH 7:21  Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all
 marvel.

JOH 7:22  Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of
 Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.

JOH 7:23  If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of
 Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man
 every whit whole on the sabbath day?

JOH 7:24  Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.

JOH 7:25  Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek
 to kill?

JOH 7:26  But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the
 rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?

JOH 7:27  Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man
 knoweth whence he is.

JOH 7:28  Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know
 me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me
 is true, whom ye know not.

JOH 7:29  But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.

JOH 7:30  Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because
 his hour was not yet come.

JOH 7:31  And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh,
 will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?

JOH 7:32  The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning
 him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.

JOH 7:33  Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then
 I go unto him that sent me.

JOH 7:34  Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye
 cannot come.

JOH 7:35  Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we
 shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and
 teach the Gentiles?

JOH 7:36  What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and
 shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?

JOH 7:37  In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried,
 saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.

JOH 7:38  He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly
 shall flow rivers of living water.

JOH 7:39  (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him
 should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was
 not yet glorified.)

JOH 7:40  Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a
 truth this is the Prophet.

JOH 7:41  Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out
 of Galilee?

JOH 7:42  Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of
 David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?

JOH 7:43  So there was a division among the people because of him.

JOH 7:44  And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.

JOH 7:45  Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they
 said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?

JOH 7:46  The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.

JOH 7:47  Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?

JOH 7:48  Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?

JOH 7:49  But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.

JOH 7:50  Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one
 of them,)

JOH 7:51  Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he
 doeth?

JOH 7:52  They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee?
 Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.

JOH 7:53  And every man went unto his own house.

JOH 8:1  Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.

JOH 8:2  And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the
 people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.

JOH 8:3  And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in
 adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,

JOH 8:4  They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the
 very act.

JOH 8:5  Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but
 what sayest thou?

JOH 8:6  This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But
 Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he
 heard them not.

JOH 8:7  So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto
 them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.

JOH 8:8  And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.

JOH 8:9  And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went
 out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was
 left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.

JOH 8:10  When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said
 unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?

JOH 8:11  She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn
 thee: go, and sin no more.

JOH 8:12  Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the
 world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the
 light of life.

JOH 8:13  The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of
 thyself; thy record is not true.

JOH 8:14  Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself,
 yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye
 cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.

JOH 8:15  Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.

JOH 8:16  And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I
 and the Father that sent me.

JOH 8:17  It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is
 true.

JOH 8:18  I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me
 beareth witness of me.

JOH 8:19  Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye
 neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my
 Father also.

JOH 8:20  These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple:
 and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.

JOH 8:21  Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek
 me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.

JOH 8:22  Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I
 go, ye cannot come.

JOH 8:23  And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are
 of this world; I am not of this world.

JOH 8:24  I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye
 believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.

JOH 8:25  Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them,
 Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.

JOH 8:26  I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is
 true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.

JOH 8:27  They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.

JOH 8:28  Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of
 man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as
 my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.

JOH 8:29  And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone;
 for I do always those things that please him.

JOH 8:30  As he spake these words, many believed on him.

JOH 8:31  Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue
 in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;

JOH 8:32  And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.

JOH 8:33  They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to
 any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?

JOH 8:34  Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever
 committeth sin is the servant of sin.

JOH 8:35  And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son
 abideth ever.

JOH 8:36  If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.

JOH 8:37  I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my
 word hath no place in you.

JOH 8:38  I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which
 ye have seen with your father.

JOH 8:39  They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith
 unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.

JOH 8:40  But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which
 I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.

JOH 8:41  Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born
 of fornication; we have one Father, even God.

JOH 8:42  Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for
 I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent
 me.

JOH 8:43  Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my
 word.

JOH 8:44  Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will
 do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because
 there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for
 he is a liar, and the father of it.

JOH 8:45  And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.

JOH 8:46  Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye
 not believe me?

JOH 8:47  He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not,
 because ye are not of God.

JOH 8:48  Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou
 art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?

JOH 8:49  Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do
 dishonour me.

JOH 8:50  And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.

JOH 8:51  Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall
 never see death.

JOH 8:52  Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil.
 Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying,
 he shall never taste of death.

JOH 8:53  Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the
 prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?

JOH 8:54  Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my
 Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:

JOH 8:55  Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I
 know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his
 saying.

JOH 8:56  Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was
 glad.

JOH 8:57  Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and
 hast thou seen Abraham?

JOH 8:58  Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham
 was, I am.

JOH 8:59  Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and
 went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.

JOH 9:1  And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.

JOH 9:2  And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or
 his parents, that he was born blind?

JOH 9:3  Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but
 that the works of God should be made manifest in him.

JOH 9:4  I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night
 cometh, when no man can work.

JOH 9:5  As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.

JOH 9:6  When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the
 spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,

JOH 9:7  And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by
 interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came
 seeing.

JOH 9:8  The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he
 was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?

JOH 9:9  Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am
 he.

JOH 9:10  Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?

JOH 9:11  He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and
 anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and
 I went and washed, and I received sight.

JOH 9:12  Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.

JOH 9:13  They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.

JOH 9:14  And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his
 eyes.

JOH 9:15  Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his
 sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do
 see.

JOH 9:16  Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because
 he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner
 do such miracles? And there was a division among them.

JOH 9:17  They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he
 hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.

JOH 9:18  But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been
 blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had
 received his sight.

JOH 9:19  And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born
 blind? how then doth he now see?

JOH 9:20  His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and
 that he was born blind:

JOH 9:21  But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his
 eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.

JOH 9:22  These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the
 Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he
 should be put out of the synagogue.

JOH 9:23  Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.

JOH 9:24  Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him,
 Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.

JOH 9:25  He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one
 thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.

JOH 9:26  Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine
 eyes?

JOH 9:27  He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear:
 wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?

JOH 9:28  Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are
 Moses' disciples.

JOH 9:29  We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not
 from whence he is.

JOH 9:30  The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous
 thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.

JOH 9:31  Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a
 worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.

JOH 9:32  Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes
 of one that was born blind.

JOH 9:33  If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.

JOH 9:34  They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins,
 and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.

JOH 9:35  Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he
 said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?

JOH 9:36  He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?

JOH 9:37  And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that
 talketh with thee.

JOH 9:38  And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.

JOH 9:39  And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they
 which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.

JOH 9:40  And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and
 said unto him, Are we blind also?

JOH 9:41  Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but
 now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.

JOH 10:1  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into
 the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a
 robber.

JOH 10:2  But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

JOH 10:3  To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he
 calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.

JOH 10:4  And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and
 the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.

JOH 10:5  And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they
 know not the voice of strangers.

JOH 10:6  This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what
 things they were which he spake unto them.

JOH 10:7  Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am
 the door of the sheep.

JOH 10:8  All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep
 did not hear them.

JOH 10:9  I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and
 shall go in and out, and find pasture.

JOH 10:10  The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy:
 I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more
 abundantly.

JOH 10:11  I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the
 sheep.

JOH 10:12  But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the
 sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and
 the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.

JOH 10:13  The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for
 the sheep.

JOH 10:14  I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.

JOH 10:15  As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down
 my life for the sheep.

JOH 10:16  And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must
 bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one
 shepherd.

JOH 10:17  Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I
 might take it again.

JOH 10:18  No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power
 to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I
 received of my Father.

JOH 10:19  There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these
 sayings.

JOH 10:20  And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?

JOH 10:21  Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a
 devil open the eyes of the blind?

JOH 10:22  And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was
 winter.

JOH 10:23  And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.

JOH 10:24  Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost
 thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.

JOH 10:25  Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that
 I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.

JOH 10:26  But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto
 you.

JOH 10:27  My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:

JOH 10:28  And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish,
 neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.

JOH 10:29  My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is
 able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.

JOH 10:30  I and my Father are one.

JOH 10:31  Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.

JOH 10:32  Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my
 Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?

JOH 10:33  The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not;
 but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.

JOH 10:34  Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are
 gods?

JOH 10:35  If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the
 scripture cannot be broken;

JOH 10:36  Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the
 world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?

JOH 10:37  If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.

JOH 10:38  But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye
 may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.

JOH 10:39  Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their
 hand,

JOH 10:40  And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first
 baptized; and there he abode.

JOH 10:41  And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all
 things that John spake of this man were true.

JOH 10:42  And many believed on him there.

JOH 11:1  Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of
 Mary and her sister Martha.

JOH 11:2  (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped
 his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)

JOH 11:3  Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom
 thou lovest is sick.

JOH 11:4  When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but
 for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.

JOH 11:5  Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.

JOH 11:6  When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still
 in the same place where he was.

JOH 11:7  Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea
 again.

JOH 11:8  His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone
 thee; and goest thou thither again?

JOH 11:9  Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man
 walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.

JOH 11:10  But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no
 light in him.

JOH 11:11  These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend
 Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.

JOH 11:12  Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.

JOH 11:13  Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had
 spoken of taking of rest in sleep.

JOH 11:14  Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.

JOH 11:15  And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye
 may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.

JOH 11:16  Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples,
 Let us also go, that we may die with him.

JOH 11:17  Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four
 days already.

JOH 11:18  Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:

JOH 11:19  And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them
 concerning their brother.

JOH 11:20  Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and
 met him: but Mary sat still in the house.

JOH 11:21  Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my
 brother had not died.

JOH 11:22  But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will
 give it thee.

JOH 11:23  Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.

JOH 11:24  Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the
 resurrection at the last day.

JOH 11:25  Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that
 believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:

JOH 11:26  And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest
 thou this?

JOH 11:27  She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the
 Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.

JOH 11:28  And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her
 sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.

JOH 11:29  As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.

JOH 11:30  Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place
 where Martha met him.

JOH 11:31  The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her,
 when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her,
 saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.

JOH 11:32  Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down
 at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had
 not died.

JOH 11:33  When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping
 which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.

JOH 11:34  And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and
 see.

JOH 11:35  Jesus wept.

JOH 11:36  Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!

JOH 11:37  And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes
 of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?

JOH 11:38  Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It
 was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.

JOH 11:39  Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that
 was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been
 dead four days.

JOH 11:40  Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest
 believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?

JOH 11:41  Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was
 laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou
 hast heard me.

JOH 11:42  And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people
 which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.

JOH 11:43  And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus,
 come forth.

JOH 11:44  And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with
 graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto
 them, Loose him, and let him go.

JOH 11:45  Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things
 which Jesus did, believed on him.

JOH 11:46  But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them
 what things Jesus had done.

JOH 11:47  Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and
 said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.

JOH 11:48  If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the
 Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.

JOH 11:49  And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same
 year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,

JOH 11:50  Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die
 for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.

JOH 11:51  And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year,
 he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;

JOH 11:52  And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather
 together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.

JOH 11:53  Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him
 to death.

JOH 11:54  Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went
 thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and
 there continued with his disciples.

JOH 11:55  And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the
 country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.

JOH 11:56  Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they
 stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?

JOH 11:57  Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a
 commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that
 they might take him.

JOH 12:1  Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where
 Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.

JOH 12:2  There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one
 of them that sat at the table with him.

JOH 12:3  Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and
 anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house
 was filled with the odour of the ointment.

JOH 12:4  Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which
 should betray him,

JOH 12:5  Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given
 to the poor?

JOH 12:6  This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a
 thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.

JOH 12:7  Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath
 she kept this.

JOH 12:8  For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.

JOH 12:9  Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they
 came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he
 had raised from the dead.

JOH 12:10  But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to
 death;

JOH 12:11  Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and
 believed on Jesus.

JOH 12:12  On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they
 heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,

JOH 12:13  Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried,
 Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.

JOH 12:14  And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is
 written,

JOH 12:15  Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an
 ass's colt.

JOH 12:16  These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when
 Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of
 him, and that they had done these things unto him.

JOH 12:17  The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of
 his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.

JOH 12:18  For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he
 had done this miracle.

JOH 12:19  The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye
 prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.

JOH 12:20  And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at
 the feast:

JOH 12:21  The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of
 Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.

JOH 12:22  Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell
 Jesus.

JOH 12:23  And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of
 man should be glorified.

JOH 12:24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the
 ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much
 fruit.

JOH 12:25  He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life
 in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.

JOH 12:26  If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall
 also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.

JOH 12:27  Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from
 this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.

JOH 12:28  Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven,
 saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.

JOH 12:29  The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it
 thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.

JOH 12:30  Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for
 your sakes.

JOH 12:31  Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this
 world be cast out.

JOH 12:32  And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.

JOH 12:33  This he said, signifying what death he should die.

JOH 12:34  The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ
 abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who
 is this Son of man?

JOH 12:35  Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you.
 Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that
 walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.

JOH 12:36  While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the
 children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide
 himself from them.

JOH 12:37  But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they
 believed not on him:

JOH 12:38  That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he
 spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the
 Lord been revealed?

JOH 12:39  Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,

JOH 12:40  He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they
 should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be
 converted, and I should heal them.

JOH 12:41  These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.

JOH 12:42  Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but
 because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put
 out of the synagogue:

JOH 12:43  For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.

JOH 12:44  Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me,
 but on him that sent me.

JOH 12:45  And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.

JOH 12:46  I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me
 should not abide in darkness.

JOH 12:47  And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for
 I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.

JOH 12:48  He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that
 judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the
 last day.

JOH 12:49  For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he
 gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.

JOH 12:50  And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I
 speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.

JOH 13:1  Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour
 was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having
 loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.

JOH 13:2  And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of
 Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;

JOH 13:3  Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands,
 and that he was come from God, and went to God;

JOH 13:4  He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a
 towel, and girded himself.

JOH 13:5  After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the
 disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.

JOH 13:6  Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost
 thou wash my feet?

JOH 13:7  Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but
 thou shalt know hereafter.

JOH 13:8  Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered
 him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.

JOH 13:9  Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands
 and my head.

JOH 13:10  Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his
 feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.

JOH 13:11  For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all
 clean.

JOH 13:12  So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and
 was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?

JOH 13:13  Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.

JOH 13:14  If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also
 ought to wash one another's feet.

JOH 13:15  For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to
 you.

JOH 13:16  Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his
 lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.

JOH 13:17  If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.

JOH 13:18  I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the
 scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his
 heel against me.

JOH 13:19  Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may
 believe that I am he.

JOH 13:20  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send
 receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.

JOH 13:21  When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and
 testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall
 betray me.

JOH 13:22  Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.

JOH 13:23  Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom
 Jesus loved.

JOH 13:24  Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it
 should be of whom he spake.

JOH 13:25  He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?

JOH 13:26  Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have
 dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the
 son of Simon.

JOH 13:27  And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him,
 That thou doest, do quickly.

JOH 13:28  Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.

JOH 13:29  For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had
 said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or,
 that he should give something to the poor.

JOH 13:30  He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was
 night.

JOH 13:31  Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man
 glorified, and God is glorified in him.

JOH 13:32  If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in
 himself, and shall straightway glorify him.

JOH 13:33  Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me:
 and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to
 you.

JOH 13:34  A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I
 have loved you, that ye also love one another.

JOH 13:35  By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love
 one to another.

JOH 13:36  Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered
 him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me
 afterwards.

JOH 13:37  Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay
 down my life for thy sake.

JOH 13:38  Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily,
 verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me
 thrice.

JOH 14:1  Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in
 me.

JOH 14:2  In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would
 have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.

JOH 14:3  And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and
 receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.

JOH 14:4  And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.

JOH 14:5  Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how
 can we know the way?

JOH 14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man
 cometh unto the Father, but by me.

JOH 14:7  If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from
 henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.

JOH 14:8  Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.

JOH 14:9  Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast
 thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how
 sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?

JOH 14:10  Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?
 the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that
 dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.

JOH 14:11  Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else
 believe me for the very works' sake.

JOH 14:12  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works
 that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because
 I go unto my Father.

JOH 14:13  And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the
 Father may be glorified in the Son.

JOH 14:14  If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.

JOH 14:15  If ye love me, keep my commandments.

JOH 14:16  And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter,
 that he may abide with you for ever;

JOH 14:17  Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it
 seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with
 you, and shall be in you.

JOH 14:18  I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.

JOH 14:19  Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me:
 because I live, ye shall live also.

JOH 14:20  At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and
 I in you.

JOH 14:21  He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth
 me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love
 him, and will manifest myself to him.

JOH 14:22  Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt
 manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?

JOH 14:23  Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my
 words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our
 abode with him.

JOH 14:24  He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye
 hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.

JOH 14:25  These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.

JOH 14:26  But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will
 send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your
 remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.

JOH 14:27  Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world
 giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be
 afraid.

JOH 14:28  Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto
 you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father:
 for my Father is greater than I.

JOH 14:29  And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is
 come to pass, ye might believe.

JOH 14:30  Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this
 world cometh, and hath nothing in me.

JOH 14:31  But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the
 Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.

JOH 15:1  I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.

JOH 15:2  Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every
 branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.

JOH 15:3  Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.

JOH 15:4  Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself,
 except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.

JOH 15:5  I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in
 him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.

JOH 15:6  If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is
 withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are
 burned.

JOH 15:7  If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye
 will, and it shall be done unto you.

JOH 15:8  Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye
 be my disciples.

JOH 15:9  As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my
 love.

JOH 15:10  If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I
 have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.

JOH 15:11  These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in
 you, and that your joy might be full.

JOH 15:12  This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved
 you.

JOH 15:13  Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for
 his friends.

JOH 15:14  Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.

JOH 15:15  Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what
 his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have
 heard of my Father I have made known unto you.

JOH 15:16  Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that
 ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that
 whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.

JOH 15:17  These things I command you, that ye love one another.

JOH 15:18  If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.

JOH 15:19  If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because
 ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore
 the world hateth you.

JOH 15:20  Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater
 than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if
 they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.

JOH 15:21  But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake,
 because they know not him that sent me.

JOH 15:22  If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but
 now they have no cloak for their sin.

JOH 15:23  He that hateth me hateth my Father also.

JOH 15:24  If I had not done among them the works which none other man
 did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and
 my Father.

JOH 15:25  But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is
 written in their law, They hated me without a cause.

JOH 15:26  But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the
 Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall
 testify of me:

JOH 15:27  And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from
 the beginning.

JOH 16:1  These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.

JOH 16:2  They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that
 whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.

JOH 16:3  And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known
 the Father, nor me.

JOH 16:4  But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye
 may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at
 the beginning, because I was with you.

JOH 16:5  But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me,
 Whither goest thou?

JOH 16:6  But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled
 your heart.

JOH 16:7  Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go
 away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I
 depart, I will send him unto you.

JOH 16:8  And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of
 righteousness, and of judgment:

JOH 16:9  Of sin, because they believe not on me;

JOH 16:10  Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;

JOH 16:11  Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.

JOH 16:12  I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.

JOH 16:13  Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you
 into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall
 hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.

JOH 16:14  He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it
 unto you.

JOH 16:15  All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he
 shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.

JOH 16:16  A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little
 while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.

JOH 16:17  Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that
 he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a
 little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?

JOH 16:18  They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we
 cannot tell what he saith.

JOH 16:19  Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto
 them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye
 shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?

JOH 16:20  Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but
 the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be
 turned into joy.

JOH 16:21  A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is
 come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more
 the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.

JOH 16:22  And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your
 heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.

JOH 16:23  And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto
 you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.

JOH 16:24  Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall
 receive, that your joy may be full.

JOH 16:25  These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time
 cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you
 plainly of the Father.

JOH 16:26  At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I
 will pray the Father for you:

JOH 16:27  For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and
 have believed that I came out from God.

JOH 16:28  I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I
 leave the world, and go to the Father.

JOH 16:29  His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and
 speakest no proverb.

JOH 16:30  Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that
 any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.

JOH 16:31  Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?

JOH 16:32  Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be
 scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not
 alone, because the Father is with me.

JOH 16:33  These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace.
 In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome
 the world.

JOH 17:1  These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said,
 Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify
 thee:

JOH 17:2  As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give
 eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.

JOH 17:3  And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true
 God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.

JOH 17:4  I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which
 thou gavest me to do.

JOH 17:5  And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory
 which I had with thee before the world was.

JOH 17:6  I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out
 of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept
 thy word.

JOH 17:7  Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are
 of thee.

JOH 17:8  For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they
 have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they
 have believed that thou didst send me.

JOH 17:9  I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou
 hast given me; for they are thine.

JOH 17:10  And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified
 in them.

JOH 17:11  And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I
 come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast
 given me, that they may be one, as we are.

JOH 17:12  While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those
 that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of
 perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.

JOH 17:13  And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that
 they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.

JOH 17:14  I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because
 they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

JOH 17:15  I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that
 thou shouldest keep them from the evil.

JOH 17:16  They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

JOH 17:17  Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.

JOH 17:18  As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them
 into the world.

JOH 17:19  And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be
 sanctified through the truth.

JOH 17:20  Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall
 believe on me through their word;

JOH 17:21  That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee,
 that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast
 sent me.

JOH 17:22  And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may
 be one, even as we are one:

JOH 17:23  I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and
 that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou
 hast loved me.

JOH 17:24  Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me
 where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou
 lovedst me before the foundation of the world.

JOH 17:25  O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known
 thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.

JOH 17:26  And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that
 the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.

JOH 18:1  When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples
 over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his
 disciples.

JOH 18:2  And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus
 ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.

JOH 18:3  Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief
 priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.

JOH 18:4  Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went
 forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?

JOH 18:5  They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he.
 And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.

JOH 18:6  As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went
 backward, and fell to the ground.

JOH 18:7  Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of
 Nazareth.

JOH 18:8  Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek
 me, let these go their way:

JOH 18:9  That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which
 thou gavest me have I lost none.

JOH 18:10  Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's
 servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.

JOH 18:11  Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the
 cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?

JOH 18:12  Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took
 Jesus, and bound him,

JOH 18:13  And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to
 Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.

JOH 18:14  Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was
 expedient that one man should die for the people.

JOH 18:15  And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that
 disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the
 palace of the high priest.

JOH 18:16  But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other
 disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept
 the door, and brought in Peter.

JOH 18:17  Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou
 also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.

JOH 18:18  And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of
 coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with
 them, and warmed himself.

JOH 18:19  The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his
 doctrine.

JOH 18:20  Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught
 in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in
 secret have I said nothing.

JOH 18:21  Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto
 them: behold, they know what I said.

JOH 18:22  And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by
 struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high
 priest so?

JOH 18:23  Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil:
 but if well, why smitest thou me?

JOH 18:24  Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.

JOH 18:25  And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto
 him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am
 not.

JOH 18:26  One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear
 Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?

JOH 18:27  Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.

JOH 18:28  Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it
 was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they
 should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.

JOH 18:29  Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye
 against this man?

JOH 18:30  They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we
 would not have delivered him up unto thee.

JOH 18:31  Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to
 your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put
 any man to death:

JOH 18:32  That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake,
 signifying what death he should die.

JOH 18:33  Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called
 Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?

JOH 18:34  Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others
 tell it thee of me?

JOH 18:35  Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests
 have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?

JOH 18:36  Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were
 of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered
 to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.

JOH 18:37  Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus
 answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this
 cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every
 one that is of the truth heareth my voice.

JOH 18:38  Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he
 went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at
 all.

JOH 18:39  But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the
 passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?

JOH 18:40  Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now
 Barabbas was a robber.

JOH 19:1  Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.

JOH 19:2  And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his
 head, and they put on him a purple robe,

JOH 19:3  And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their
 hands.

JOH 19:4  Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I
 bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.

JOH 19:5  Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple
 robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!

JOH 19:6  When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried
 out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye
 him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.

JOH 19:7  The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die,
 because he made himself the Son of God.

JOH 19:8  When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;

JOH 19:9  And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence
 art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.

JOH 19:10  Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou
 not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?

JOH 19:11  Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me,
 except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto
 thee hath the greater sin.

JOH 19:12  And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews
 cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend:
 whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.

JOH 19:13  When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and
 sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but
 in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.

JOH 19:14  And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth
 hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!

JOH 19:15  But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him.
 Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests
 answered, We have no king but Caesar.

JOH 19:16  Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they
 took Jesus, and led him away.

JOH 19:17  And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of
 a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:

JOH 19:18  Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side
 one, and Jesus in the midst.

JOH 19:19  And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing
 was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.

JOH 19:20  This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was
 crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and
 Latin.

JOH 19:21  Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The
 King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.

JOH 19:22  Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.

JOH 19:23  Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments,
 and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat
 was without seam, woven from the top throughout.

JOH 19:24  They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast
 lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which
 saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast
 lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.

JOH 19:25  Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's
 sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

JOH 19:26  When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by,
 whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!

JOH 19:27  Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour
 that disciple took her unto his own home.

JOH 19:28  After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished,
 that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.

JOH 19:29  Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge
 with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.

JOH 19:30  When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is
 finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.

JOH 19:31  The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies
 should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day
 was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that
 they might be taken away.

JOH 19:32  Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the
 other which was crucified with him.

JOH 19:33  But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they
 brake not his legs:

JOH 19:34  But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith
 came there out blood and water.

JOH 19:35  And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he
 knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.

JOH 19:36  For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled,
 A bone of him shall not be broken.

JOH 19:37  And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they
 pierced.

JOH 19:38  And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but
 secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the
 body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the
 body of Jesus.

JOH 19:39  And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by
 night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound
 weight.

JOH 19:40  Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with
 the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.

JOH 19:41  Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and
 in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.

JOH 19:42  There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation
 day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.

JOH 20:1  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was
 yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the
 sepulchre.

JOH 20:2  Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other
 disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the
 LORD out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.

JOH 20:3  Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the
 sepulchre.

JOH 20:4  So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun
 Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.

JOH 20:5  And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying;
 yet went he not in.

JOH 20:6  Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the
 sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,

JOH 20:7  And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen
 clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.

JOH 20:8  Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the
 sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.

JOH 20:9  For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from
 the dead.

JOH 20:10  Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.

JOH 20:11  But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept,
 she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,

JOH 20:12  And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the
 other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.

JOH 20:13  And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them,
 Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid
 him.

JOH 20:14  And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus
 standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.

JOH 20:15  Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou?
 She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have
 borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.

JOH 20:16  Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him,
 Rabboni; which is to say, Master.

JOH 20:17  Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my
 Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my
 Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.

JOH 20:18  Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the
 LORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her.

JOH 20:19  Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when
 the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews,
 came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.

JOH 20:20  And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side.
 Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD.

JOH 20:21  Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath
 sent me, even so send I you.

JOH 20:22  And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them,
 Receive ye the Holy Ghost:

JOH 20:23  Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose
 soever sins ye retain, they are retained.

JOH 20:24  But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them
 when Jesus came.

JOH 20:25  The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the LORD.
 But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the
 nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into
 his side, I will not believe.

JOH 20:26  And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas
 with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and
 said, Peace be unto you.

JOH 20:27  Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my
 hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not
 faithless, but believing.

JOH 20:28  And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God.

JOH 20:29  Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast
 believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.

JOH 20:30  And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his
 disciples, which are not written in this book:

JOH 20:31  But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the
 Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his
 name.

JOH 21:1  After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the
 sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.

JOH 21:2  There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and
 Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his
 disciples.

JOH 21:3  Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We
 also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and
 that night they caught nothing.

JOH 21:4  But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the
 disciples knew not that it was Jesus.

JOH 21:5  Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered
 him, No.

JOH 21:6  And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the
 ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to
 draw it for the multitude of fishes.

JOH 21:7  Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the
 Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's
 coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.

JOH 21:8  And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far
 from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.

JOH 21:9  As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals
 there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.

JOH 21:10  Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.

JOH 21:11  Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes,
 an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not
 the net broken.

JOH 21:12  Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples
 durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.

JOH 21:13  Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish
 likewise.

JOH 21:14  This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his
 disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.

JOH 21:15  So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of
 Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou
 knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.

JOH 21:16  He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest
 thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He
 saith unto him, Feed my sheep.

JOH 21:17  He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou
 me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou
 me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I
 love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.

JOH 21:18  Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdest
 thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou
 shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee
 whither thou wouldest not.

JOH 21:19  This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And
 when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.

JOH 21:20  Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved
 following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which
 is he that betrayeth thee?

JOH 21:21  Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?

JOH 21:22  Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is
 that to thee? follow thou me.

JOH 21:23  Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple
 should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will
 that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?

JOH 21:24  This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote
 these things: and we know that his testimony is true.

JOH 21:25  And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if
 they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could
 not contain the books that should be written. Amen.

LUK 1:1  Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a
 declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,

LUK 1:2  Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were
 eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;

LUK 1:3  It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all
 things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent
 Theophilus,

LUK 1:4  That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou
 hast been instructed.

LUK 1:5  THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest
 named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of
 Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.

LUK 1:6  And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the
 commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.

LUK 1:7  And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they
 both were now well stricken in years.

LUK 1:8  And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before
 God in the order of his course,

LUK 1:9  According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn
 incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.

LUK 1:10  And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the
 time of incense.

LUK 1:11  And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the
 right side of the altar of incense.

LUK 1:12  And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.

LUK 1:13  But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is
 heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his
 name John.

LUK 1:14  And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his
 birth.

LUK 1:15  For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink
 neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost,
 even from his mother's womb.

LUK 1:16  And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their
 God.

LUK 1:17  And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn
 the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom
 of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.

LUK 1:18  And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I
 am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.

LUK 1:19  And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand
 in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee
 these glad tidings.

LUK 1:20  And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day
 that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words,
 which shall be fulfilled in their season.

LUK 1:21  And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so
 long in the temple.

LUK 1:22  And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they
 perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto
 them, and remained speechless.

LUK 1:23  And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration
 were accomplished, he departed to his own house.

LUK 1:24  And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself
 five months, saying,

LUK 1:25  Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me,
 to take away my reproach among men.

LUK 1:26  And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a
 city of Galilee, named Nazareth,

LUK 1:27  To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of
 David; and the virgin's name was Mary.

LUK 1:28  And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly
 favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.

LUK 1:29  And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her
 mind what manner of salutation this should be.

LUK 1:30  And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found
 favour with God.

LUK 1:31  And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a
 son, and shalt call his name JESUS.

LUK 1:32  He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and
 the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:

LUK 1:33  And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his
 kingdom there shall be no end.

LUK 1:34  Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a
 man?

LUK 1:35  And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come
 upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also
 that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.

LUK 1:36  And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in
 her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.

LUK 1:37  For with God nothing shall be impossible.

LUK 1:38  And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me
 according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.

LUK 1:39  And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with
 haste, into a city of Juda;

LUK 1:40  And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.

LUK 1:41  And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of
 Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy
 Ghost:

LUK 1:42  And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among
 women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.

LUK 1:43  And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to
 me?

LUK 1:44  For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears,
 the babe leaped in my womb for joy.

LUK 1:45  And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of
 those things which were told her from the Lord.

LUK 1:46  And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,

LUK 1:47  And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.

LUK 1:48  For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold,
 from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.

LUK 1:49  For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his
 name.

LUK 1:50  And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.

LUK 1:51  He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud
 in the imagination of their hearts.

LUK 1:52  He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low
 degree.

LUK 1:53  He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent
 empty away.

LUK 1:54  He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;

LUK 1:55  As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.

LUK 1:56  And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own
 house.

LUK 1:57  Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered; and she
 brought forth a son.

LUK 1:58  And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed
 great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.

LUK 1:59  And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise
 the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.

LUK 1:60  And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called
 John.

LUK 1:61  And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called
 by this name.

LUK 1:62  And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.

LUK 1:63  And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is
 John. And they marvelled all.

LUK 1:64  And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he
 spake, and praised God.

LUK 1:65  And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these
 sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.

LUK 1:66  And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying,
 What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.

LUK 1:67  And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and
 prophesied, saying,

LUK 1:68  Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed
 his people,

LUK 1:69  And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his
 servant David;

LUK 1:70  As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since
 the world began:

LUK 1:71  That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all
 that hate us;

LUK 1:72  To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his
 holy covenant;

LUK 1:73  The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,

LUK 1:74  That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand
 of our enemies might serve him without fear,

LUK 1:75  In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.

LUK 1:76  And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou
 shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;

LUK 1:77  To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission
 of their sins,

LUK 1:78  Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on
 high hath visited us,

LUK 1:79  To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of
 death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.

LUK 1:80  And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the
 deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.

LUK 2:1  And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from
 Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.

LUK 2:2  (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)

LUK 2:3  And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.

LUK 2:4  And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,
 into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he
 was of the house and lineage of David:)

LUK 2:5  To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.

LUK 2:6  And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished
 that she should be delivered.

LUK 2:7  And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling
 clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the
 inn.

LUK 2:8  And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field,
 keeping watch over their flock by night.

LUK 2:9  And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the
 Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.

LUK 2:10  And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good
 tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.

LUK 2:11  For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which
 is Christ the Lord.

LUK 2:12  And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in
 swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.

LUK 2:13  And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly
 host praising God, and saying,

LUK 2:14  Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward
 men.

LUK 2:15  And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into
 heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto
 Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made
 known unto us.

LUK 2:16  And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe
 lying in a manger.

LUK 2:17  And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which
 was told them concerning this child.

LUK 2:18  And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told
 them by the shepherds.

LUK 2:19  But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.

LUK 2:20  And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the
 things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.

LUK 2:21  And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the
 child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he
 was conceived in the womb.

LUK 2:22  And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses
 were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;

LUK 2:23  (As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male that openeth the
 womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)

LUK 2:24  And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law
 of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.

LUK 2:25  And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and
 the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and
 the Holy Ghost was upon him.

LUK 2:26  And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not
 see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.

LUK 2:27  And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents
 brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,

LUK 2:28  Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,

LUK 2:29  Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy
 word:

LUK 2:30  For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,

LUK 2:31  Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;

LUK 2:32  A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.

LUK 2:33  And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken
 of him.

LUK 2:34  And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this
 child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign
 which shall be spoken against;

LUK 2:35  (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the
 thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.

LUK 2:36  And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the
 tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven
 years from her virginity;

LUK 2:37  And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed
 not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.

LUK 2:38  And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the
 Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.

LUK 2:39  And when they had performed all things according to the law of the
 Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.

LUK 2:40  And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom:
 and the grace of God was upon him.

LUK 2:41  Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the
 passover.

LUK 2:42  And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the
 custom of the feast.

LUK 2:43  And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child
 Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.

LUK 2:44  But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day's
 journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.

LUK 2:45  And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem,
 seeking him.

LUK 2:46  And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the
 temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking
 them questions.

LUK 2:47  And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and
 answers.

LUK 2:48  And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto
 him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have
 sought thee sorrowing.

LUK 2:49  And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that
 I must be about my Father's business?

LUK 2:50  And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.

LUK 2:51  And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject
 unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.

LUK 2:52  And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and
 man.

LUK 3:1  Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius
 Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his
 brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and
 Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,

LUK 3:2  Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto
 John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.

LUK 3:3  And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism
 of repentance for the remission of sins;

LUK 3:4  As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet,
 saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the
 Lord, make his paths straight.

LUK 3:5  Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be
 brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall
 be made smooth;

LUK 3:6  And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.

LUK 3:7  Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O
 generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

LUK 3:8  Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to
 say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you,
 That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.

LUK 3:9  And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree
 therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the
 fire.

LUK 3:10  And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?

LUK 3:11  He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him
 impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.

LUK 3:12  Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master,
 what shall we do?

LUK 3:13  And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed
 you.

LUK 3:14  And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we
 do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely;
 and be content with your wages.

LUK 3:15  And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their
 hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;

LUK 3:16  John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water;
 but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to
 unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:

LUK 3:17  Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and
 will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire
 unquenchable.

LUK 3:18  And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people.

LUK 3:19  But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his
 brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,

LUK 3:20  Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.

LUK 3:21  Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus
 also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,

LUK 3:22  And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon
 him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son;
 in thee I am well pleased.

LUK 3:23  And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as
 was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli,

LUK 3:24  Which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi, which was
 the son of Melchi, which was the son of Janna, which was the son of Joseph,

LUK 3:25  Which was the son of Mattathias, which was the son of Amos, which was
 the son of Naum, which was the son of Esli, which was the son of Nagge,

LUK 3:26  Which was the son of Maath, which was the son of Mattathias, which
 was the son of Semei, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Juda,

LUK 3:27  Which was the son of Joanna, which was the son of Rhesa, which was
 the son of Zorobabel, which was the son of Salathiel, which was the son of
 Neri,

LUK 3:28  Which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Addi, which was the
 son of Cosam, which was the son of Elmodam, which was the son of Er,

LUK 3:29  Which was the son of Jose, which was the son of Eliezer, which was
 the son of Jorim, which was the son of Matthat, which was the son of Levi,

LUK 3:30  Which was the son of Simeon, which was the son of Juda, which was the
 son of Joseph, which was the son of Jonan, which was the son of Eliakim,

LUK 3:31  Which was the son of Melea, which was the son of Menan, which was the
 son of Mattatha, which was the son of Nathan, which was the son of David,

LUK 3:32  Which was the son of Jesse, which was the son of Obed, which was the
 son of Booz, which was the son of Salmon, which was the son of Naasson,

LUK 3:33  Which was the son of Aminadab, which was the son of Aram, which was
 the son of Esrom, which was the son of Phares, which was the son of Juda,

LUK 3:34  Which was the son of Jacob, which was the son of Isaac, which was the
 son of Abraham, which was the son of Thara, which was the son of Nachor,

LUK 3:35  Which was the son of Saruch, which was the son of Ragau, which was
 the son of Phalec, which was the son of Heber, which was the son of Sala,

LUK 3:36  Which was the son of Cainan, which was the son of Arphaxad, which was
 the son of Sem, which was the son of Noe, which was the son of Lamech,

LUK 3:37  Which was the son of Mathusala, which was the son of Enoch, which was
 the son of Jared, which was the son of Maleleel, which was the son of Cainan,

LUK 3:38  Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which was the
 son of Adam, which was the son of God.

LUK 4:1  And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was
 led by the Spirit into the wilderness,

LUK 4:2  Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat
 nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered.

LUK 4:3  And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this
 stone that it be made bread.

LUK 4:4  And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live
 by bread alone, but by every word of God.

LUK 4:5  And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him
 all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

LUK 4:6  And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the
 glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give
 it.

LUK 4:7  If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.

LUK 4:8  And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for
 it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou
 serve.

LUK 4:9  And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the
 temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from
 hence:

LUK 4:10  For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep
 thee:

LUK 4:11  And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou
 dash thy foot against a stone.

LUK 4:12  And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt
 the Lord thy God.

LUK 4:13  And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him
 for a season.

LUK 4:14  And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there
 went out a fame of him through all the region round about.

LUK 4:15  And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.

LUK 4:16  And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his
 custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for
 to read.

LUK 4:17  And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And
 when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,

LUK 4:18  The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to
 preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to
 preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to
 set at liberty them that are bruised,

LUK 4:19  To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.

LUK 4:20  And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat
 down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on
 him.

LUK 4:21  And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled
 in your ears.

LUK 4:22  And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which
 proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son?

LUK 4:23  And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb,
 Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also
 here in thy country.

LUK 4:24  And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own
 country.

LUK 4:25  But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of
 Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great
 famine was throughout all the land;

LUK 4:26  But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of
 Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.

LUK 4:27  And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet;
 and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.

LUK 4:28  And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were
 filled with wrath,

LUK 4:29  And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the
 brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down
 headlong.

LUK 4:30  But he passing through the midst of them went his way,

LUK 4:31  And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the
 sabbath days.

LUK 4:32  And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with
 power.

LUK 4:33  And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an
 unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,

LUK 4:34  Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of
 Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One
 of God.

LUK 4:35  And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.
 And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt
 him not.

LUK 4:36  And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a
 word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits,
 and they come out.

LUK 4:37  And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round
 about.

LUK 4:38  And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house.
 And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him
 for her.

LUK 4:39  And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and
 immediately she arose and ministered unto them.

LUK 4:40  Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers
 diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one
 of them, and healed them.

LUK 4:41  And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art
 Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for
 they knew that he was Christ.

LUK 4:42  And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and
 the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not
 depart from them.

LUK 4:43  And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other
 cities also: for therefore am I sent.

LUK 4:44  And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.

LUK 5:1  And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the
 word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,

LUK 5:2  And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone
 out of them, and were washing their nets.

LUK 5:3  And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed
 him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and
 taught the people out of the ship.

LUK 5:4  Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the
 deep, and let down your nets for a draught.

LUK 5:5  And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the
 night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the
 net.

LUK 5:6  And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of
 fishes: and their net brake.

LUK 5:7  And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship,
 that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the
 ships, so that they began to sink.

LUK 5:8  When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart
 from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.

LUK 5:9  For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught
 of the fishes which they had taken:

LUK 5:10  And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were
 partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth
 thou shalt catch men.

LUK 5:11  And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and
 followed him.

LUK 5:12  And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full
 of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying,
 Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

LUK 5:13  And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou
 clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.

LUK 5:14  And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the
 priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a
 testimony unto them.

LUK 5:15  But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great
 multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their
 infirmities.

LUK 5:16  And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.

LUK 5:17  And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there
 were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of
 every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord
 was present to heal them.

LUK 5:18  And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy:
 and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him.

LUK 5:19  And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in
 because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down
 through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus.

LUK 5:20  And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are
 forgiven thee.

LUK 5:21  And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is
 this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?

LUK 5:22  But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them,
 What reason ye in your hearts?

LUK 5:23  Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise
 up and walk?

LUK 5:24  But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to
 forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee,
 Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.

LUK 5:25  And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he
 lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.

LUK 5:26  And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled
 with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.

LUK 5:27  And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi,
 sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.

LUK 5:28  And he left all, rose up, and followed him.

LUK 5:29  And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a
 great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.

LUK 5:30  But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples,
 saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?

LUK 5:31  And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a
 physician; but they that are sick.

LUK 5:32  I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

LUK 5:33  And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and
 make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and
 drink?

LUK 5:34  And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber
 fast, while the bridegroom is with them?

LUK 5:35  But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from
 them, and then shall they fast in those days.

LUK 5:36  And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a
 new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and
 the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old.

LUK 5:37  And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will
 burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.

LUK 5:38  But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.

LUK 5:39  No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he
 saith, The old is better.

LUK 6:1  And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he
 went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and
 did eat, rubbing them in their hands.

LUK 6:2  And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is
 not lawful to do on the sabbath days?

LUK 6:3  And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what
 David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him;

LUK 6:4  How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the
 shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful
 to eat but for the priests alone?

LUK 6:5  And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the
 sabbath.

LUK 6:6  And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the
 synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.

LUK 6:7  And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on
 the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.

LUK 6:8  But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered
 hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.

LUK 6:9  Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on
 the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?

LUK 6:10  And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch
 forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.

LUK 6:11  And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what
 they might do to Jesus.

LUK 6:12  And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain
 to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.

LUK 6:13  And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he
 chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;

LUK 6:14  Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and
 John, Philip and Bartholomew,

LUK 6:15  Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called
 Zelotes,

LUK 6:16  And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was
 the traitor.

LUK 6:17  And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company
 of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and
 Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear
 him, and to be healed of their diseases;

LUK 6:18  And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.

LUK 6:19  And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue
 out of him, and healed them all.

LUK 6:20  And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye
 poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.

LUK 6:21  Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are
 ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.

LUK 6:22  Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate
 you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as
 evil, for the Son of man's sake.

LUK 6:23  Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is
 great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.

LUK 6:24  But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your
 consolation.

LUK 6:25  Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that
 laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.

LUK 6:26  Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their
 fathers to the false prophets.

LUK 6:27  But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them
 which hate you,

LUK 6:28  Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use
 you.

LUK 6:29  And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other;
 and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also.

LUK 6:30  Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away
 thy goods ask them not again.

LUK 6:31  And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them
 likewise.

LUK 6:32  For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners
 also love those that love them.

LUK 6:33  And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye?
 for sinners also do even the same.

LUK 6:34  And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have
 ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.

LUK 6:35  But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing
 again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the
 Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.

LUK 6:36  Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.

LUK 6:37  Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not
 be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:

LUK 6:38  Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and
 shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with
 the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.

LUK 6:39  And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? shall
 they not both fall into the ditch?

LUK 6:40  The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect
 shall be as his master.

LUK 6:41  And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but
 perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

LUK 6:42  Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out
 the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that
 is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own
 eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy
 brother's eye.

LUK 6:43  For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a
 corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

LUK 6:44  For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not
 gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.

LUK 6:45  A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that
 which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth
 forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth
 speaketh.

LUK 6:46  And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?

LUK 6:47  Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I
 will shew you to whom he is like:

LUK 6:48  He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the
 foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently
 upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.

LUK 6:49  But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a
 foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat
 vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.

LUK 7:1  Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people,
 he entered into Capernaum.

LUK 7:2  And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was
 sick, and ready to die.

LUK 7:3  And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews,
 beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.

LUK 7:4  And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That
 he was worthy for whom he should do this:

LUK 7:5  For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.

LUK 7:6  Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the
 house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not
 thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:

LUK 7:7  Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say
 in a word, and my servant shall be healed.

LUK 7:8  For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and
 I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to
 my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.

LUK 7:9  When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him
 about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not
 found so great faith, no, not in Israel.

LUK 7:10  And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant
 whole that had been sick.

LUK 7:11  And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called
 Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.

LUK 7:12  Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a
 dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and
 much people of the city was with her.

LUK 7:13  And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto
 her, Weep not.

LUK 7:14  And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still.
 And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.

LUK 7:15  And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him
 to his mother.

LUK 7:16  And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a
 great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.

LUK 7:17  And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and
 throughout all the region round about.

LUK 7:18  And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.

LUK 7:19  And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus,
 saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?

LUK 7:20  When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us
 unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?

LUK 7:21  And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and
 plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight.

LUK 7:22  Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what
 things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the
 lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the
 gospel is preached.

LUK 7:23  And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.

LUK 7:24  And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto
 the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see?
 A reed shaken with the wind?

LUK 7:25  But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?
 Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in
 kings' courts.

LUK 7:26  But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and
 much more than a prophet.

LUK 7:27  This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before
 thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

LUK 7:28  For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a
 greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of
 God is greater than he.

LUK 7:29  And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God,
 being baptized with the baptism of John.

LUK 7:30  But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against
 themselves, being not baptized of him.

LUK 7:31  And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this
 generation? and to what are they like?

LUK 7:32  They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling
 one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced;
 we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.

LUK 7:33  For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and
 ye say, He hath a devil.

LUK 7:34  The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a
 gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!

LUK 7:35  But wisdom is justified of all her children.

LUK 7:36  And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And
 he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.

LUK 7:37  And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew
 that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of
 ointment,

LUK 7:38  And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet
 with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his
 feet, and anointed them with the ointment.

LUK 7:39  Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within
 himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and
 what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.

LUK 7:40  And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto
 thee. And he saith, Master, say on.

LUK 7:41  There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five
 hundred pence, and the other fifty.

LUK 7:42  And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell
 me therefore, which of them will love him most?

LUK 7:43  Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most.
 And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.

LUK 7:44  And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this
 woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but
 she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her
 head.

LUK 7:45  Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath
 not ceased to kiss my feet.

LUK 7:46  My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed
 my feet with ointment.

LUK 7:47  Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven;
 for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.

LUK 7:48  And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.

LUK 7:49  And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves,
 Who is this that forgiveth sins also?

LUK 7:50  And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.

LUK 8:1  And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and
 village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and
 the twelve were with him,

LUK 8:2  And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and
 infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,

LUK 8:3  And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many
 others, which ministered unto him of their substance.

LUK 8:4  And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out
 of every city, he spake by a parable:

LUK 8:5  A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the
 way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.

LUK 8:6  And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it
 withered away, because it lacked moisture.

LUK 8:7  And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and
 choked it.

LUK 8:8  And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an
 hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears
 to hear, let him hear.

LUK 8:9  And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?

LUK 8:10  And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the
 kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not
 see, and hearing they might not understand.

LUK 8:11  Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.

LUK 8:12  Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and
 taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be
 saved.

LUK 8:13  They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word
 with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of
 temptation fall away.

LUK 8:14  And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have
 heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this
 life, and bring no fruit to perfection.

LUK 8:15  But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good
 heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.

LUK 8:16  No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or
 putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which
 enter in may see the light.

LUK 8:17  For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any
 thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.

LUK 8:18  Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be
 given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he
 seemeth to have.

LUK 8:19  Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at
 him for the press.

LUK 8:20  And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy
 brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.

LUK 8:21  And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are
 these which hear the word of God, and do it.

LUK 8:22  Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with
 his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side
 of the lake. And they launched forth.

LUK 8:23  But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of
 wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.

LUK 8:24  And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we
 perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and
 they ceased, and there was a calm.

LUK 8:25  And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid
 wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he
 commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.

LUK 8:26  And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over
 against Galilee.

LUK 8:27  And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a
 certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode
 in any house, but in the tombs.

LUK 8:28  When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a
 loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most
 high? I beseech thee, torment me not.

LUK 8:29  (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For
 oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in
 fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the
 wilderness.)

LUK 8:30  And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion:
 because many devils were entered into him.

LUK 8:31  And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into
 the deep.

LUK 8:32  And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain:
 and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he
 suffered them.

LUK 8:33  Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and
 the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.

LUK 8:34  When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and
 told it in the city and in the country.

LUK 8:35  Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found
 the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus,
 clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.

LUK 8:36  They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed
 of the devils was healed.

LUK 8:37  Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about
 besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he
 went up into the ship, and returned back again.

LUK 8:38  Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he
 might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,

LUK 8:39  Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done
 unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how
 great things Jesus had done unto him.

LUK 8:40  And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly
 received him: for they were all waiting for him.

LUK 8:41  And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the
 synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would
 come into his house:

LUK 8:42  For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay
 a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.

LUK 8:43  And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent
 all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,

LUK 8:44  Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and
 immediately her issue of blood stanched.

LUK 8:45  And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that
 were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and
 sayest thou, Who touched me?

LUK 8:46  And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue
 is gone out of me.

LUK 8:47  And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and
 falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what
 cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.

LUK 8:48  And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath
 made thee whole; go in peace.

LUK 8:49  While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the
 synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the
 Master.

LUK 8:50  But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe
 only, and she shall be made whole.

LUK 8:51  And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save
 Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.

LUK 8:52  And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not
 dead, but sleepeth.

LUK 8:53  And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.

LUK 8:54  And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called,
 saying, Maid, arise.

LUK 8:55  And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he
 commanded to give her meat.

LUK 8:56  And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should
 tell no man what was done.

LUK 9:1  Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and
 authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.

LUK 9:2  And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.

LUK 9:3  And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves,
 nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.

LUK 9:4  And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart.

LUK 9:5  And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake
 off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.

LUK 9:6  And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the
 gospel, and healing every where.

LUK 9:7  Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was
 perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the
 dead;

LUK 9:8  And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the
 old prophets was risen again.

LUK 9:9  And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear
 such things? And he desired to see him.

LUK 9:10  And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had
 done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place
 belonging to the city called Bethsaida.

LUK 9:11  And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received
 them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had
 need of healing.

LUK 9:12  And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said
 unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and
 country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert
 place.

LUK 9:13  But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no
 more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all
 this people.

LUK 9:14  For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples,
 Make them sit down by fifties in a company.

LUK 9:15  And they did so, and made them all sit down.

LUK 9:16  Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to
 heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before
 the multitude.

LUK 9:17  And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of
 fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.

LUK 9:18  And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with
 him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?

LUK 9:19  They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and
 others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.

LUK 9:20  He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said,
 The Christ of God.

LUK 9:21  And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that
 thing;

LUK 9:22  Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected
 of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the
 third day.

LUK 9:23  And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny
 himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.

LUK 9:24  For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will
 lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.

LUK 9:25  For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose
 himself, or be cast away?

LUK 9:26  For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall
 the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his
 Father's, and of the holy angels.

LUK 9:27  But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall
 not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.

LUK 9:28  And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took
 Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.

LUK 9:29  And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his
 raiment was white and glistering.

LUK 9:30  And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and
 Elias:

LUK 9:31  Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should
 accomplish at Jerusalem.

LUK 9:32  But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when
 they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.

LUK 9:33  And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto
 Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three
 tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing
 what he said.

LUK 9:34  While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and
 they feared as they entered into the cloud.

LUK 9:35  And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved
 Son: hear him.

LUK 9:36  And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it
 close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.

LUK 9:37  And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down
 from the hill, much people met him.

LUK 9:38  And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I
 beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.

LUK 9:39  And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it
 teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from
 him.

LUK 9:40  And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.

LUK 9:41  And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how
 long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.

LUK 9:42  And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him.
 And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him
 again to his father.

LUK 9:43  And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they
 wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,

LUK 9:44  Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall
 be delivered into the hands of men.

LUK 9:45  But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that
 they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.

LUK 9:46  Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be
 greatest.

LUK 9:47  And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and
 set him by him,

LUK 9:48  And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name
 receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for
 he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.

LUK 9:49  And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in
 thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.

LUK 9:50  And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against
 us is for us.

LUK 9:51  And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be
 received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,

LUK 9:52  And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into
 a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.

LUK 9:53  And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would
 go to Jerusalem.

LUK 9:54  And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt
 thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as
 Elias did?

LUK 9:55  But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of
 spirit ye are of.

LUK 9:56  For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save
 them. And they went to another village.

LUK 9:57  And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man
 said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.

LUK 9:58  And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have
 nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.

LUK 9:59  And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me
 first to go and bury my father.

LUK 9:60  Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and
 preach the kingdom of God.

LUK 9:61  And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go
 bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.

LUK 9:62  And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the
 plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.

LUK 10:1  After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent
 them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he
 himself would come.

LUK 10:2  Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the
 labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would
 send forth labourers into his harvest.

LUK 10:3  Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.

LUK 10:4  Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the
 way.

LUK 10:5  And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this
 house.

LUK 10:6  And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if
 not, it shall turn to you again.

LUK 10:7  And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they
 give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.

LUK 10:8  And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such
 things as are set before you:

LUK 10:9  And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of
 God is come nigh unto you.

LUK 10:10  But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your
 ways out into the streets of the same, and say,

LUK 10:11  Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe
 off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God
 is come nigh unto you.

LUK 10:12  But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for
 Sodom, than for that city.

LUK 10:13  Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty
 works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had
 a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.

LUK 10:14  But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment,
 than for you.

LUK 10:15  And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust
 down to hell.

LUK 10:16  He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth
 me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.

LUK 10:17  And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the
 devils are subject unto us through thy name.

LUK 10:18  And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.

LUK 10:19  Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions,
 and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.

LUK 10:20  Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject
 unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.

LUK 10:21  In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O
 Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the
 wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so
 it seemed good in thy sight.

LUK 10:22  All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who
 the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to
 whom the Son will reveal him.

LUK 10:23  And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed
 are the eyes which see the things that ye see:

LUK 10:24  For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see
 those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things
 which ye hear, and have not heard them.

LUK 10:25  And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying,
 Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

LUK 10:26  He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?

LUK 10:27  And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
 heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy
 mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.

LUK 10:28  And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou
 shalt live.

LUK 10:29  But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my
 neighbour?

LUK 10:30  And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to
 Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and
 wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.

LUK 10:31  And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he
 saw him, he passed by on the other side.

LUK 10:32  And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on
 him, and passed by on the other side.

LUK 10:33  But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and
 when he saw him, he had compassion on him,

LUK 10:34  And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and
 wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care
 of him.

LUK 10:35  And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave
 them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou
 spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.

LUK 10:36  Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that
 fell among the thieves?

LUK 10:37  And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him,
 Go, and do thou likewise.

LUK 10:38  Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain
 village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.

LUK 10:39  And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and
 heard his word.

LUK 10:40  But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and
 said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone?
 bid her therefore that she help me.

LUK 10:41  And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art
 careful and troubled about many things:

LUK 10:42  But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which
 shall not be taken away from her.

LUK 11:1  And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when
 he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as
 John also taught his disciples.

LUK 11:2  And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in
 heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in
 heaven, so in earth.

LUK 11:3  Give us day by day our daily bread.

LUK 11:4  And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is
 indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.

LUK 11:5  And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go
 unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;

LUK 11:6  For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing
 to set before him?

LUK 11:7  And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is
 now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.

LUK 11:8  I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is
 his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many
 as he needeth.

LUK 11:9  And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye
 shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

LUK 11:10  For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth;
 and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

LUK 11:11  If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he
 give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?

LUK 11:12  Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?

LUK 11:13  If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
 children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit
 to them that ask him?

LUK 11:14  And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to
 pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.

LUK 11:15  But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the
 chief of the devils.

LUK 11:16  And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.

LUK 11:17  But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom
 divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against
 a house falleth.

LUK 11:18  If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom
 stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.

LUK 11:19  And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast
 them out? therefore shall they be your judges.

LUK 11:20  But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the
 kingdom of God is come upon you.

LUK 11:21  When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:

LUK 11:22  But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him,
 he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his
 spoils.

LUK 11:23  He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with
 me scattereth.

LUK 11:24  When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry
 places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house
 whence I came out.

LUK 11:25  And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.

LUK 11:26  Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked
 than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that
 man is worse than the first.

LUK 11:27  And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman
 of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb
 that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.

LUK 11:28  But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of
 God, and keep it.

LUK 11:29  And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say,
 This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be
 given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.

LUK 11:30  For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of
 man be to this generation.

LUK 11:31  The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of
 this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the
 earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is
 here.

LUK 11:32  The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this
 generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of
 Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.

LUK 11:33  No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place,
 neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see
 the light.

LUK 11:34  The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is
 single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy
 body also is full of darkness.

LUK 11:35  Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.

LUK 11:36  If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part
 dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a
 candle doth give thee light.

LUK 11:37  And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him:
 and he went in, and sat down to meat.

LUK 11:38  And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first
 washed before dinner.

LUK 11:39  And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the
 outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening
 and wickedness.

LUK 11:40  Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which
 is within also?

LUK 11:41  But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all
 things are clean unto you.

LUK 11:42  But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all
 manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye
 to have done, and not to leave the other undone.

LUK 11:43  Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the
 synagogues, and greetings in the markets.

LUK 11:44  Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as
 graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware
 of them.

LUK 11:45  Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus
 saying thou reproachest us also.

LUK 11:46  And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with
 burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with
 one of your fingers.

LUK 11:47  Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your
 fathers killed them.

LUK 11:48  Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for
 they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.

LUK 11:49  Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and
 apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:

LUK 11:50  That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the
 foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;

LUK 11:51  From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished
 between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required
 of this generation.

LUK 11:52  Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge:
 ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.

LUK 11:53  And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees
 began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:

LUK 11:54  Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his
 mouth, that they might accuse him.

LUK 12:1  In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable
 multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to
 say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the
 Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

LUK 12:2  For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither
 hid, that shall not be known.

LUK 12:3  Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the
 light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be
 proclaimed upon the housetops.

LUK 12:4  And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the
 body, and after that have no more that they can do.

LUK 12:5  But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he
 hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.

LUK 12:6  Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is
 forgotten before God?

LUK 12:7  But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not
 therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.

LUK 12:8  Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall
 the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:

LUK 12:9  But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels
 of God.

LUK 12:10  And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be
 forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall
 not be forgiven.

LUK 12:11  And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto magistrates,
 and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye
 shall say:

LUK 12:12  For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to
 say.

LUK 12:13  And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother,
 that he divide the inheritance with me.

LUK 12:14  And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over
 you?

LUK 12:15  And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a
 man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.

LUK 12:16  And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain
 rich man brought forth plentifully:

LUK 12:17  And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I
 have no room where to bestow my fruits?

LUK 12:18  And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build
 greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.

LUK 12:19  And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for
 many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.

LUK 12:20  But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be
 required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?

LUK 12:21  So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward
 God.

LUK 12:22  And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no
 thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall
 put on.

LUK 12:23  The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.

LUK 12:24  Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither
 have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better
 than the fowls?

LUK 12:25  And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one
 cubit?

LUK 12:26  If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye
 thought for the rest?

LUK 12:27  Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and
 yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one
 of these.

LUK 12:28  If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and
 to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of
 little faith?

LUK 12:29  And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither
 be ye of doubtful mind.

LUK 12:30  For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and
 your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.

LUK 12:31  But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be
 added unto you.

LUK 12:32  Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to
 give you the kingdom.

LUK 12:33  Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax
 not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief
 approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.

LUK 12:34  For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

LUK 12:35  Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;

LUK 12:36  And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he
 will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open
 unto him immediately.

LUK 12:37  Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find
 watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to
 sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.

LUK 12:38  And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third
 watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.

LUK 12:39  And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour
 the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house
 to be broken through.

LUK 12:40  Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour
 when ye think not.

LUK 12:41  Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us,
 or even to all?

LUK 12:42  And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom
 his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of
 meat in due season?

LUK 12:43  Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so
 doing.

LUK 12:44  Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that
 he hath.

LUK 12:45  But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his
 coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and
 drink, and to be drunken;

LUK 12:46  The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for
 him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and
 will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.

LUK 12:47  And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not
 himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many
 stripes.

LUK 12:48  But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall
 be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall
 be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask
 the more.

LUK 12:49  I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be
 already kindled?

LUK 12:50  But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened
 till it be accomplished!

LUK 12:51  Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay;
 but rather division:

LUK 12:52  For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three
 against two, and two against three.

LUK 12:53  The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the
 father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother;
 the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law
 against her mother in law.

LUK 12:54  And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the
 west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.

LUK 12:55  And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and
 it cometh to pass.

LUK 12:56  Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth;
 but how is it that ye do not discern this time?

LUK 12:57  Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?

LUK 12:58  When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art
 in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he
 hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the
 officer cast thee into prison.

LUK 12:59  I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the
 very last mite.

LUK 13:1  There were present at that season some that told him of the
 Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.

LUK 13:2  And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans
 were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?

LUK 13:3  I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

LUK 13:4  Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them,
 think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?

LUK 13:5  I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

LUK 13:6  He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in
 his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.

LUK 13:7  Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three
 years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why
 cumbereth it the ground?

LUK 13:8  And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also,
 till I shall dig about it, and dung it:

LUK 13:9  And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt
 cut it down.

LUK 13:10  And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.

LUK 13:11  And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity
 eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself.

LUK 13:12  And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her,
 Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.

LUK 13:13  And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made
 straight, and glorified God.

LUK 13:14  And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because
 that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are
 six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be
 healed, and not on the sabbath day.

LUK 13:15  The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each
 one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead
 him away to watering?

LUK 13:16  And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan
 hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath
 day?

LUK 13:17  And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed:
 and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by
 him.

LUK 13:18  Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto
 shall I resemble it?

LUK 13:19  It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into
 his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air
 lodged in the branches of it.

LUK 13:20  And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?

LUK 13:21  It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of
 meal, till the whole was leavened.

LUK 13:22  And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and
 journeying toward Jerusalem.

LUK 13:23  Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he
 said unto them,

LUK 13:24  Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you,
 will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.

LUK 13:25  When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the
 door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord,
 Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not
 whence ye are:

LUK 13:26  Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy
 presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.

LUK 13:27  But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart
 from me, all ye workers of iniquity.

LUK 13:28  There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see
 Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of
 God, and you yourselves thrust out.

LUK 13:29  And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the
 north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.

LUK 13:30  And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are
 first which shall be last.

LUK 13:31  The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him,
 Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.

LUK 13:32  And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out
 devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be
 perfected.

LUK 13:33  Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day
 following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.

LUK 13:34  O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them
 that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children
 together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not!

LUK 13:35  Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto
 you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is
 he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

LUK 14:1  And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief
 Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him.

LUK 14:2  And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy.

LUK 14:3  And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is
 it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?

LUK 14:4  And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let
 him go;

LUK 14:5  And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox
 fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?

LUK 14:6  And they could not answer him again to these things.

LUK 14:7  And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked
 how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them.

LUK 14:8  When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the
 highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;

LUK 14:9  And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man
 place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.

LUK 14:10  But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that
 when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher:
 then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with
 thee.

LUK 14:11  For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth
 himself shall be exalted.

LUK 14:12  Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or
 a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor
 thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made
 thee.

LUK 14:13  But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the
 lame, the blind:

LUK 14:14  And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou
 shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.

LUK 14:15  And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things,
 he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.

LUK 14:16  Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade
 many:

LUK 14:17  And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden,
 Come; for all things are now ready.

LUK 14:18  And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said
 unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I
 pray thee have me excused.

LUK 14:19  And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove
 them: I pray thee have me excused.

LUK 14:20  And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot
 come.

LUK 14:21  So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the
 master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the
 streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the
 maimed, and the halt, and the blind.

LUK 14:22  And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and
 yet there is room.

LUK 14:23  And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and
 hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.

LUK 14:24  For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall
 taste of my supper.

LUK 14:25  And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said
 unto them,

LUK 14:26  If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and
 wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he
 cannot be my disciple.

LUK 14:27  And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be
 my disciple.

LUK 14:28  For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down
 first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?

LUK 14:29  Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to
 finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,

LUK 14:30  Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.

LUK 14:31  Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not
 down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him
 that cometh against him with twenty thousand?

LUK 14:32  Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an
 ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.

LUK 14:33  So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he
 hath, he cannot be my disciple.

LUK 14:34  Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall
 it be seasoned?

LUK 14:35  It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men
 cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

LUK 15:1  Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear
 him.

LUK 15:2  And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth
 sinners, and eateth with them.

LUK 15:3  And he spake this parable unto them, saying,

LUK 15:4  What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them,
 doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which
 is lost, until he find it?

LUK 15:5  And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.

LUK 15:6  And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and
 neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep
 which was lost.

LUK 15:7  I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner
 that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no
 repentance.

LUK 15:8  Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece,
 doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she
 find it?

LUK 15:9  And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her
 neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece
 which I had lost.

LUK 15:10  Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels
 of God over one sinner that repenteth.

LUK 15:11  And he said, A certain man had two sons:

LUK 15:12  And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the
 portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.

LUK 15:13  And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and
 took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with
 riotous living.

LUK 15:14  And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land;
 and he began to be in want.

LUK 15:15  And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he
 sent him into his fields to feed swine.

LUK 15:16  And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the
 swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.

LUK 15:17  And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my
 father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!

LUK 15:18  I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I
 have sinned against heaven, and before thee,

LUK 15:19  And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy
 hired servants.

LUK 15:20  And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great
 way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his
 neck, and kissed him.

LUK 15:21  And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and
 in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.

LUK 15:22  But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and
 put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:

LUK 15:23  And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and
 be merry:

LUK 15:24  For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is
 found. And they began to be merry.

LUK 15:25  Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh
 to the house, he heard musick and dancing.

LUK 15:26  And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things
 meant.

LUK 15:27  And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath
 killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.

LUK 15:28  And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father
 out, and intreated him.

LUK 15:29  And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve
 thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never
 gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:

LUK 15:30  But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living
 with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.

LUK 15:31  And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I
 have is thine.

LUK 15:32  It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy
 brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.

LUK 16:1  And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man,
 which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his
 goods.

LUK 16:2  And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this
 of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer
 steward.

LUK 16:3  Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord
 taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.

LUK 16:4  I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the
 stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.

LUK 16:5  So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto
 the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?

LUK 16:6  And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take
 thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.

LUK 16:7  Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An
 hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write
 fourscore.

LUK 16:8  And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done
 wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the
 children of light.

LUK 16:9  And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of
 unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting
 habitations.

LUK 16:10  He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much:
 and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.

LUK 16:11  If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon,
 who will commit to your trust the true riches?

LUK 16:12  And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who
 shall give you that which is your own?

LUK 16:13  No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the
 one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the
 other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

LUK 16:14  And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things:
 and they derided him.

LUK 16:15  And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before
 men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men
 is abomination in the sight of God.

LUK 16:16  The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the
 kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.

LUK 16:17  And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle
 of the law to fail.

LUK 16:18  Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth
 adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband
 committeth adultery.

LUK 16:19  There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine
 linen, and fared sumptuously every day:

LUK 16:20  And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his
 gate, full of sores,

LUK 16:21  And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich
 man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.

LUK 16:22  And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the
 angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;

LUK 16:23  And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth
 Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.

LUK 16:24  And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send
 Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue;
 for I am tormented in this flame.

LUK 16:25  But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst
 thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is
 comforted, and thou art tormented.

LUK 16:26  And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed:
 so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass
 to us, that would come from thence.

LUK 16:27  Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send
 him to my father's house:

LUK 16:28  For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they
 also come into this place of torment.

LUK 16:29  Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them
 hear them.

LUK 16:30  And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the
 dead, they will repent.

LUK 16:31  And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets,
 neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.

LUK 17:1  Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences
 will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!

LUK 17:2  It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his
 neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these
 little ones.

LUK 17:3  Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke
 him; and if he repent, forgive him.

LUK 17:4  And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times
 in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.

LUK 17:5  And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.

LUK 17:6  And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye
 might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be
 thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.

LUK 17:7  But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will
 say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to
 meat?

LUK 17:8  And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and
 gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou
 shalt eat and drink?

LUK 17:9  Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were
 commanded him? I trow not.

LUK 17:10  So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are
 commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was
 our duty to do.

LUK 17:11  And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through
 the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

LUK 17:12  And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that
 were lepers, which stood afar off:

LUK 17:13  And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy
 on us.

LUK 17:14  And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the
 priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.

LUK 17:15  And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and
 with a loud voice glorified God,

LUK 17:16  And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was
 a Samaritan.

LUK 17:17  And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are
 the nine?

LUK 17:18  There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this
 stranger.

LUK 17:19  And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee
 whole.

LUK 17:20  And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God
 should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with
 observation:

LUK 17:21  Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the
 kingdom of God is within you.

LUK 17:22  And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall
 desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it.

LUK 17:23  And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after
 them, nor follow them.

LUK 17:24  For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under
 heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of
 man be in his day.

LUK 17:25  But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this
 generation.

LUK 17:26  And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days
 of the Son of man.

LUK 17:27  They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in
 marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood
 came, and destroyed them all.

LUK 17:28  Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they
 drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;

LUK 17:29  But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and
 brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.

LUK 17:30  Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.

LUK 17:31  In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff
 in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the
 field, let him likewise not return back.

LUK 17:32  Remember Lot's wife.

LUK 17:33  Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever
 shall lose his life shall preserve it.

LUK 17:34  I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one
 shall be taken, and the other shall be left.

LUK 17:35  Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and
 the other left.

LUK 17:36  Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other
 left.

LUK 17:37  And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto
 them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.

LUK 18:1  And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always
 to pray, and not to faint;

LUK 18:2  Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither
 regarded man:

LUK 18:3  And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying,
 Avenge me of mine adversary.

LUK 18:4  And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself,
 Though I fear not God, nor regard man;

LUK 18:5  Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her
 continual coming she weary me.

LUK 18:6  And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.

LUK 18:7  And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto
 him, though he bear long with them?

LUK 18:8  I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the
 Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?

LUK 18:9  And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves
 that they were righteous, and despised others:

LUK 18:10  Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the
 other a publican.

LUK 18:11  The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee,
 that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as
 this publican.

LUK 18:12  I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.

LUK 18:13  And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as
 his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to
 me a sinner.

LUK 18:14  I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than
 the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that
 humbleth himself shall be exalted.

LUK 18:15  And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them:
 but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.

LUK 18:16  But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to
 come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.

LUK 18:17  Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of
 God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.

LUK 18:18  And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do
 to inherit eternal life?

LUK 18:19  And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good,
 save one, that is, God.

LUK 18:20  Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill,
 Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.

LUK 18:21  And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.

LUK 18:22  Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest
 thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and
 thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.

LUK 18:23  And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.

LUK 18:24  And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly
 shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!

LUK 18:25  For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for
 a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

LUK 18:26  And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?

LUK 18:27  And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible
 with God.

LUK 18:28  Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.

LUK 18:29  And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that
 hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the
 kingdom of God's sake,

LUK 18:30  Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the
 world to come life everlasting.

LUK 18:31  Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go
 up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning
 the Son of man shall be accomplished.

LUK 18:32  For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be
 mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:

LUK 18:33  And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day
 he shall rise again.

LUK 18:34  And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid
 from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.

LUK 18:35  And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a
 certain blind man sat by the way side begging:

LUK 18:36  And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.

LUK 18:37  And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.

LUK 18:38  And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.

LUK 18:39  And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his
 peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.

LUK 18:40  And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when
 he was come near, he asked him,

LUK 18:41  Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord,
 that I may receive my sight.

LUK 18:42  And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved
 thee.

LUK 18:43  And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying
 God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.

LUK 19:1  And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.

LUK 19:2  And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief
 among the publicans, and he was rich.

LUK 19:3  And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press,
 because he was little of stature.

LUK 19:4  And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him:
 for he was to pass that way.

LUK 19:5  And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said
 unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at
 thy house.

LUK 19:6  And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.

LUK 19:7  And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to
 be guest with a man that is a sinner.

LUK 19:8  And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half
 of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by
 false accusation, I restore him fourfold.

LUK 19:9  And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house,
 forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.

LUK 19:10  For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.

LUK 19:11  And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable,
 because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom
 of God should immediately appear.

LUK 19:12  He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to
 receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.

LUK 19:13  And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and
 said unto them, Occupy till I come.

LUK 19:14  But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We
 will not have this man to reign over us.

LUK 19:15  And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the
 kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he
 had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by
 trading.

LUK 19:16  Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.

LUK 19:17  And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast
 been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.

LUK 19:18  And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five
 pounds.

LUK 19:19  And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.

LUK 19:20  And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I
 have kept laid up in a napkin:

LUK 19:21  For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up
 that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.

LUK 19:22  And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee,
 thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I
 laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:

LUK 19:23  Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my
 coming I might have required mine own with usury?

LUK 19:24  And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and
 give it to him that hath ten pounds.

LUK 19:25  (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)

LUK 19:26  For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given;
 and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.

LUK 19:27  But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over
 them, bring hither, and slay them before me.

LUK 19:28  And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to
 Jerusalem.

LUK 19:29  And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany,
 at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,

LUK 19:30  Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at
 your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose
 him, and bring him hither.

LUK 19:31  And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto
 him, Because the Lord hath need of him.

LUK 19:32  And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had
 said unto them.

LUK 19:33  And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto
 them, Why loose ye the colt?

LUK 19:34  And they said, The Lord hath need of him.

LUK 19:35  And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the
 colt, and they set Jesus thereon.

LUK 19:36  And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.

LUK 19:37  And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of
 Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God
 with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;

LUK 19:38  Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord:
 peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.

LUK 19:39  And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him,
 Master, rebuke thy disciples.

LUK 19:40  And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should
 hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.

LUK 19:41  And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,

LUK 19:42  Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy
 day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine
 eyes.

LUK 19:43  For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a
 trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,

LUK 19:44  And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within
 thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou
 knewest not the time of thy visitation.

LUK 19:45  And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold
 therein, and them that bought;

LUK 19:46  Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer:
 but ye have made it a den of thieves.

LUK 19:47  And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the
 scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,

LUK 19:48  And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very
 attentive to hear him.

LUK 20:1  And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the
 people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the
 scribes came upon him with the elders,

LUK 20:2  And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou
 these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?

LUK 20:3  And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing;
 and answer me:

LUK 20:4  The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?

LUK 20:5  And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From
 heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?

LUK 20:6  But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be
 persuaded that John was a prophet.

LUK 20:7  And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.

LUK 20:8  And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do
 these things.

LUK 20:9  Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man
 planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far
 country for a long time.

LUK 20:10  And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they
 should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat
 him, and sent him away empty.

LUK 20:11  And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and
 entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.

LUK 20:12  And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him
 out.

LUK 20:13  Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my
 beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.

LUK 20:14  But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves,
 saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be
 ours.

LUK 20:15  So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore
 shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?

LUK 20:16  He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the
 vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.

LUK 20:17  And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The
 stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?

LUK 20:18  Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on
 whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

LUK 20:19  And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay
 hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had
 spoken this parable against them.

LUK 20:20  And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign
 themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they
 might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.

LUK 20:21  And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and
 teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the
 way of God truly:

LUK 20:22  Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?

LUK 20:23  But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye
 me?

LUK 20:24  Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They
 answered and said, Caesar's.

LUK 20:25  And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which
 be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.

LUK 20:26  And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and
 they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.

LUK 20:27  Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is
 any resurrection; and they asked him,

LUK 20:28  Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die,
 having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his
 wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

LUK 20:29  There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and
 died without children.

LUK 20:30  And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.

LUK 20:31  And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they
 left no children, and died.

LUK 20:32  Last of all the woman died also.

LUK 20:33  Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven
 had her to wife.

LUK 20:34  And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world
 marry, and are given in marriage:

LUK 20:35  But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and
 the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:

LUK 20:36  Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels;
 and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.

LUK 20:37  Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he
 calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
 Jacob.

LUK 20:38  For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live
 unto him.

LUK 20:39  Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well
 said.

LUK 20:40  And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.

LUK 20:41  And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son?

LUK 20:42  And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my
 Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,

LUK 20:43  Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.

LUK 20:44  David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?

LUK 20:45  Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,

LUK 20:46  Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love
 greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the
 chief rooms at feasts;

LUK 20:47  Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the
 same shall receive greater damnation.

LUK 21:1  And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the
 treasury.

LUK 21:2  And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.

LUK 21:3  And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath
 cast in more than they all:

LUK 21:4  For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of
 God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.

LUK 21:5  And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly
 stones and gifts, he said,

LUK 21:6  As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which
 there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown
 down.

LUK 21:7  And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be?
 and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?

LUK 21:8  And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come
 in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not
 therefore after them.

LUK 21:9  But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for
 these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.

LUK 21:10  Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and
 kingdom against kingdom:

LUK 21:11  And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and
 pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.

LUK 21:12  But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and
 persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being
 brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.

LUK 21:13  And it shall turn to you for a testimony.

LUK 21:14  Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye
 shall answer:

LUK 21:15  For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries
 shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.

LUK 21:16  And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and
 kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.

LUK 21:17  And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.

LUK 21:18  But there shall not an hair of your head perish.

LUK 21:19  In your patience possess ye your souls.

LUK 21:20  And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know
 that the desolation thereof is nigh.

LUK 21:21  Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let
 them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are
 in the countries enter thereinto.

LUK 21:22  For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are
 written may be fulfilled.

LUK 21:23  But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck,
 in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon
 this people.

LUK 21:24  And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away
 captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the
 Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.

LUK 21:25  And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the
 stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and
 the waves roaring;

LUK 21:26  Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those
 things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be
 shaken.

LUK 21:27  And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power
 and great glory.

LUK 21:28  And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift
 up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.

LUK 21:29  And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the
 trees;

LUK 21:30  When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that
 summer is now nigh at hand.

LUK 21:31  So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that
 the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.

LUK 21:32  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all
 be fulfilled.

LUK 21:33  Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.

LUK 21:34  And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
 overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so
 that day come upon you unawares.

LUK 21:35  For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face
 of the whole earth.

LUK 21:36  Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy
 to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the
 Son of man.

LUK 21:37  And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he
 went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives.

LUK 21:38  And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple,
 for to hear him.

LUK 22:1  Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the
 Passover.

LUK 22:2  And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for
 they feared the people.

LUK 22:3  Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number
 of the twelve.

LUK 22:4  And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and
 captains, how he might betray him unto them.

LUK 22:5  And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.

LUK 22:6  And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them
 in the absence of the multitude.

LUK 22:7  Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be
 killed.

LUK 22:8  And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover,
 that we may eat.

LUK 22:9  And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?

LUK 22:10  And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the
 city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into
 the house where he entereth in.

LUK 22:11  And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith
 unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my
 disciples?

LUK 22:12  And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make
 ready.

LUK 22:13  And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made
 ready the passover.

LUK 22:14  And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles
 with him.

LUK 22:15  And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this
 passover with you before I suffer:

LUK 22:16  For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be
 fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

LUK 22:17  And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and
 divide it among yourselves:

LUK 22:18  For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until
 the kingdom of God shall come.

LUK 22:19  And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto
 them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance
 of me.

LUK 22:20  Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new
 testament in my blood, which is shed for you.

LUK 22:21  But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the
 table.

LUK 22:22  And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto
 that man by whom he is betrayed!

LUK 22:23  And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was
 that should do this thing.

LUK 22:24  And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be
 accounted the greatest.

LUK 22:25  And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship
 over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.

LUK 22:26  But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him
 be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.

LUK 22:27  For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth?
 is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.

LUK 22:28  Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.

LUK 22:29  And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto
 me;

LUK 22:30  That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on
 thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

LUK 22:31  And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have
 you, that he may sift you as wheat:

LUK 22:32  But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou
 art converted, strengthen thy brethren.

LUK 22:33  And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into
 prison, and to death.

LUK 22:34  And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day,
 before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.

LUK 22:35  And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and
 shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.

LUK 22:36  Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take
 it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his
 garment, and buy one.

LUK 22:37  For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be
 accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the
 things concerning me have an end.

LUK 22:38  And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto
 them, It is enough.

LUK 22:39  And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives;
 and his disciples also followed him.

LUK 22:40  And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter
 not into temptation.

LUK 22:41  And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled
 down, and prayed,

LUK 22:42  Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me:
 nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.

LUK 22:43  And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.

LUK 22:44  And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as
 it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.

LUK 22:45  And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he
 found them sleeping for sorrow,

LUK 22:46  And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into
 temptation.

LUK 22:47  And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called
 Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss
 him.

LUK 22:48  But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a
 kiss?

LUK 22:49  When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto
 him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?

LUK 22:50  And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off
 his right ear.

LUK 22:51  And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his
 ear, and healed him.

LUK 22:52  Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the
 temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a
 thief, with swords and staves?

LUK 22:53  When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands
 against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.

LUK 22:54  Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high
 priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.

LUK 22:55  And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were
 set down together, Peter sat down among them.

LUK 22:56  But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly
 looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.

LUK 22:57  And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.

LUK 22:58  And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also
 of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.

LUK 22:59  And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed,
 saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.

LUK 22:60  And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately,
 while he yet spake, the cock crew.

LUK 22:61  And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the
 word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt
 deny me thrice.

LUK 22:62  And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.

LUK 22:63  And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.

LUK 22:64  And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and
 asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?

LUK 22:65  And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.

LUK 22:66  And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief
 priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council,
 saying,

LUK 22:67  Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you,
 ye will not believe:

LUK 22:68  And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.

LUK 22:69  Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of
 God.

LUK 22:70  Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto
 them, Ye say that I am.

LUK 22:71  And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves
 have heard of his own mouth.

LUK 23:1  And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.

LUK 23:2  And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting
 the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself
 is Christ a King.

LUK 23:3  And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he
 answered him and said, Thou sayest it.

LUK 23:4  Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no
 fault in this man.

LUK 23:5  And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people,
 teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.

LUK 23:6  When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a
 Galilaean.

LUK 23:7  And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he
 sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.

LUK 23:8  And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous
 to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he
 hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.

LUK 23:9  Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him
 nothing.

LUK 23:10  And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.

LUK 23:11  And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and
 arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.

LUK 23:12  And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for
 before they were at enmity between themselves.

LUK 23:13  And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the
 rulers and the people,

LUK 23:14  Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that
 perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have
 found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:

LUK 23:15  No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of
 death is done unto him.

LUK 23:16  I will therefore chastise him, and release him.

LUK 23:17  (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)

LUK 23:18  And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and
 release unto us Barabbas:

LUK 23:19  (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was
 cast into prison.)

LUK 23:20  Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.

LUK 23:21  But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.

LUK 23:22  And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I
 have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let
 him go.

LUK 23:23  And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be
 crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.

LUK 23:24  And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.

LUK 23:25  And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast
 into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.

LUK 23:26  And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian,
 coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear
 it after Jesus.

LUK 23:27  And there followed him a great company of people, and of women,
 which also bewailed and lamented him.

LUK 23:28  But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not
 for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.

LUK 23:29  For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say,
 Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which
 never gave suck.

LUK 23:30  Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and
 to the hills, Cover us.

LUK 23:31  For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done
 in the dry?

LUK 23:32  And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put
 to death.

LUK 23:33  And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there
 they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other
 on the left.

LUK 23:34  Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they
 do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.

LUK 23:35  And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them
 derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be
 Christ, the chosen of God.

LUK 23:36  And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him
 vinegar,

LUK 23:37  And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.

LUK 23:38  And a superscription also was written over him in letters of
 Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

LUK 23:39  And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying,
 If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.

LUK 23:40  But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God,
 seeing thou art in the same condemnation?

LUK 23:41  And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds:
 but this man hath done nothing amiss.

LUK 23:42  And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy
 kingdom.

LUK 23:43  And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou
 be with me in paradise.

LUK 23:44  And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all
 the earth until the ninth hour.

LUK 23:45  And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the
 midst.

LUK 23:46  And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into
 thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.

LUK 23:47  Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying,
 Certainly this was a righteous man.

LUK 23:48  And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the
 things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.

LUK 23:49  And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from
 Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.

LUK 23:50  And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was
 a good man, and a just:

LUK 23:51  (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was
 of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of
 God.

LUK 23:52  This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.

LUK 23:53  And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a
 sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.

LUK 23:54  And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.

LUK 23:55  And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed
 after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.

LUK 23:56  And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the
 sabbath day according to the commandment.

LUK 24:1  Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they
 came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and
 certain others with them.

LUK 24:2  And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.

LUK 24:3  And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.

LUK 24:4  And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold,
 two men stood by them in shining garments:

LUK 24:5  And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the
 earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?

LUK 24:6  He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he
 was yet in Galilee,

LUK 24:7  Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful
 men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.

LUK 24:8  And they remembered his words,

LUK 24:9  And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the
 eleven, and to all the rest.

LUK 24:10  It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and
 other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.

LUK 24:11  And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them
 not.

LUK 24:12  Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he
 beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in
 himself at that which was come to pass.

LUK 24:13  And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called
 Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.

LUK 24:14  And they talked together of all these things which had happened.

LUK 24:15  And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and
 reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.

LUK 24:16  But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.

LUK 24:17  And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that
 ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?

LUK 24:18  And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto
 him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things
 which are come to pass there in these days?

LUK 24:19  And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him,
 Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word
 before God and all the people:

LUK 24:20  And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be
 condemned to death, and have crucified him.

LUK 24:21  But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed
 Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were
 done.

LUK 24:22  Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which
 were early at the sepulchre;

LUK 24:23  And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had
 also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.

LUK 24:24  And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and
 found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.

LUK 24:25  Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all
 that the prophets have spoken:

LUK 24:26  Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into
 his glory?

LUK 24:27  And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them
 in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.

LUK 24:28  And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made
 as though he would have gone further.

LUK 24:29  But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward
 evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.

LUK 24:30  And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and
 blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.

LUK 24:31  And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out
 of their sight.

LUK 24:32  And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us,
 while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?

LUK 24:33  And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found
 the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,

LUK 24:34  Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.

LUK 24:35  And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known
 of them in breaking of bread.

LUK 24:36  And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst
 of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.

LUK 24:37  But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had
 seen a spirit.

LUK 24:38  And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts
 arise in your hearts?

LUK 24:39  Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and
 see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.

LUK 24:40  And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.

LUK 24:41  And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto
 them, Have ye here any meat?

LUK 24:42  And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.

LUK 24:43  And he took it, and did eat before them.

LUK 24:44  And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you,
 while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were
 written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms,
 concerning me.

LUK 24:45  Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the
 scriptures,

LUK 24:46  And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ
 to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:

LUK 24:47  And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his
 name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

LUK 24:48  And ye are witnesses of these things.

LUK 24:49  And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye
 in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.

LUK 24:50  And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his
 hands, and blessed them.

LUK 24:51  And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from
 them, and carried up into heaven.

LUK 24:52  And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:

LUK 24:53  And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.

MAR 1:1  The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;

MAR 1:2  As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before
 thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

MAR 1:3  The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the
 Lord, make his paths straight.

MAR 1:4  John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of
 repentance for the remission of sins.

MAR 1:5  And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of
 Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing
 their sins.

MAR 1:6  And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin
 about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;

MAR 1:7  And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the
 latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.

MAR 1:8  I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with
 the Holy Ghost.

MAR 1:9  And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of
 Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.

MAR 1:10  And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens
 opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:

MAR 1:11  And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son,
 in whom I am well pleased.

MAR 1:12  And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.

MAR 1:13  And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and
 was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.

MAR 1:14  Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee,
 preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,

MAR 1:15  And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand:
 repent ye, and believe the gospel.

MAR 1:16  Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his
 brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.

MAR 1:17  And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to
 become fishers of men.

MAR 1:18  And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.

MAR 1:19  And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the son of
 Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.

MAR 1:20  And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee
 in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.

MAR 1:21  And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he
 entered into the synagogue, and taught.

MAR 1:22  And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one
 that had authority, and not as the scribes.

MAR 1:23  And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he
 cried out,

MAR 1:24  Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of
 Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One
 of God.

MAR 1:25  And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.

MAR 1:26  And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud
 voice, he came out of him.

MAR 1:27  And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among
 themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with
 authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.

MAR 1:28  And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region
 round about Galilee.

MAR 1:29  And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered
 into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.

MAR 1:30  But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him
 of her.

MAR 1:31  And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and
 immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.

MAR 1:32  And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that
 were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.

MAR 1:33  And all the city was gathered together at the door.

MAR 1:34  And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out
 many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.

MAR 1:35  And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went
 out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.

MAR 1:36  And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.

MAR 1:37  And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for
 thee.

MAR 1:38  And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may
 preach there also: for therefore came I forth.

MAR 1:39  And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast
 out devils.

MAR 1:40  And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to
 him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

MAR 1:41  And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched
 him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.

MAR 1:42  And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from
 him, and he was cleansed.

MAR 1:43  And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;

MAR 1:44  And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way,
 shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which
 Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.

MAR 1:45  But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad
 the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but
 was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.

MAR 2:1  And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised
 that he was in the house.

MAR 2:2  And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was
 no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached
 the word unto them.

MAR 2:3  And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was
 borne of four.

MAR 2:4  And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they
 uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let
 down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.

MAR 2:5  When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son,
 thy sins be forgiven thee.

MAR 2:6  But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning
 in their hearts,

MAR 2:7  Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God
 only?

MAR 2:8  And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so
 reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in
 your hearts?

MAR 2:9  Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be
 forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?

MAR 2:10  But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to
 forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)

MAR 2:11  I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into
 thine house.

MAR 2:12  And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them
 all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never
 saw it on this fashion.

MAR 2:13  And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude
 resorted unto him, and he taught them.

MAR 2:14  And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the
 receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed
 him.

MAR 2:15  And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many
 publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for
 there were many, and they followed him.

MAR 2:16  And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and
 sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh
 with publicans and sinners?

MAR 2:17  When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no
 need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the
 righteous, but sinners to repentance.

MAR 2:18  And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they
 come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees
 fast, but thy disciples fast not?

MAR 2:19  And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast,
 while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with
 them, they cannot fast.

MAR 2:20  But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from
 them, and then shall they fast in those days.

MAR 2:21  No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the
 new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made
 worse.

MAR 2:22  And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth
 burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred:
 but new wine must be put into new bottles.

MAR 2:23  And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the
 sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of
 corn.

MAR 2:24  And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath
 day that which is not lawful?

MAR 2:25  And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had
 need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?

MAR 2:26  How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high
 priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the
 priests, and gave also to them which were with him?

MAR 2:27  And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for
 the sabbath:

MAR 2:28  Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.

MAR 3:1  And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there
 which had a withered hand.

MAR 3:2  And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day;
 that they might accuse him.

MAR 3:3  And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.

MAR 3:4  And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days,
 or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.

MAR 3:5  And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved
 for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine
 hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.

MAR 3:6  And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the
 Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.

MAR 3:7  But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great
 multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,

MAR 3:8  And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they
 about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great
 things he did, came unto him.

MAR 3:9  And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him
 because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.

MAR 3:10  For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to
 touch him, as many as had plagues.

MAR 3:11  And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and
 cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.

MAR 3:12  And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.

MAR 3:13  And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would:
 and they came unto him.

MAR 3:14  And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he
 might send them forth to preach,

MAR 3:15  And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:

MAR 3:16  And Simon he surnamed Peter;

MAR 3:17  And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he
 surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:

MAR 3:18  And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and
 James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,

MAR 3:19  And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an
 house.

MAR 3:20  And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so
 much as eat bread.

MAR 3:21  And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him:
 for they said, He is beside himself.

MAR 3:22  And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath
 Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.

MAR 3:23  And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can
 Satan cast out Satan?

MAR 3:24  And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot
 stand.

MAR 3:25  And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.

MAR 3:26  And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot
 stand, but hath an end.

MAR 3:27  No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods,
 except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.

MAR 3:28  Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of
 men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:

MAR 3:29  But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never
 forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.

MAR 3:30  Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.

MAR 3:31  There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without,
 sent unto him, calling him.

MAR 3:32  And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy
 mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.

MAR 3:33  And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?

MAR 3:34  And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said,
 Behold my mother and my brethren!

MAR 3:35  For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and
 my sister, and mother.

MAR 4:1  And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered
 unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the
 sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.

MAR 4:2  And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his
 doctrine,

MAR 4:3  Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:

MAR 4:4  And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the
 fowls of the air came and devoured it up.

MAR 4:5  And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and
 immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:

MAR 4:6  But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root,
 it withered away.

MAR 4:7  And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and
 it yielded no fruit.

MAR 4:8  And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and
 increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an
 hundred.

MAR 4:9  And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

MAR 4:10  And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked
 of him the parable.

MAR 4:11  And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery
 of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are
 done in parables:

MAR 4:12  That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may
 hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and
 their sins should be forgiven them.

MAR 4:13  And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye
 know all parables?

MAR 4:14  The sower soweth the word.

MAR 4:15  And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when
 they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was
 sown in their hearts.

MAR 4:16  And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when
 they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;

MAR 4:17  And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time:
 afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake,
 immediately they are offended.

MAR 4:18  And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the
 word,

MAR 4:19  And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the
 lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh
 unfruitful.

MAR 4:20  And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the
 word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and
 some an hundred.

MAR 4:21  And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel,
 or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?

MAR 4:22  For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was
 any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.

MAR 4:23  If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.

MAR 4:24  And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye
 mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be
 given.

MAR 4:25  For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from
 him shall be taken even that which he hath.

MAR 4:26  And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed
 into the ground;

MAR 4:27  And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring
 and grow up, he knoweth not how.

MAR 4:28  For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then
 the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.

MAR 4:29  But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the
 sickle, because the harvest is come.

MAR 4:30  And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with
 what comparison shall we compare it?

MAR 4:31  It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the
 earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:

MAR 4:32  But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all
 herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may
 lodge under the shadow of it.

MAR 4:33  And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were
 able to hear it.

MAR 4:34  But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were
 alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.

MAR 4:35  And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us
 pass over unto the other side.

MAR 4:36  And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he
 was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.

MAR 4:37  And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the
 ship, so that it was now full.

MAR 4:38  And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and
 they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?

MAR 4:39  And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be
 still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.

MAR 4:40  And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have
 no faith?

MAR 4:41  And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of
 man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?

MAR 5:1  And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country
 of the Gadarenes.

MAR 5:2  And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out
 of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,

MAR 5:3  Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no,
 not with chains:

MAR 5:4  Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the
 chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces:
 neither could any man tame him.

MAR 5:5  And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs,
 crying, and cutting himself with stones.

MAR 5:6  But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,

MAR 5:7  And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee,
 Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment
 me not.

MAR 5:8  For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.

MAR 5:9  And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name
 is Legion: for we are many.

MAR 5:10  And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the
 country.

MAR 5:11  Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine
 feeding.

MAR 5:12  And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that
 we may enter into them.

MAR 5:13  And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went
 out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep
 place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the
 sea.

MAR 5:14  And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the
 country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.

MAR 5:15  And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the
 devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and
 they were afraid.

MAR 5:16  And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was
 possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.

MAR 5:17  And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.

MAR 5:18  And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with
 the devil prayed him that he might be with him.

MAR 5:19  Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy
 friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath
 had compassion on thee.

MAR 5:20  And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things
 Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.

MAR 5:21  And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side,
 much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.

MAR 5:22  And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus
 by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,

MAR 5:23  And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the
 point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be
 healed; and she shall live.

MAR 5:24  And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged
 him.

MAR 5:25  And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,

MAR 5:26  And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all
 that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,

MAR 5:27  When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched
 his garment.

MAR 5:28  For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.

MAR 5:29  And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt
 in her body that she was healed of that plague.

MAR 5:30  And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of
 him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?

MAR 5:31  And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging
 thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?

MAR 5:32  And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.

MAR 5:33  But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her,
 came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.

MAR 5:34  And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in
 peace, and be whole of thy plague.

MAR 5:35  While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's
 house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master
 any further?

MAR 5:36  As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the
 ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.

MAR 5:37  And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John
 the brother of James.

MAR 5:38  And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth
 the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.

MAR 5:39  And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this
 ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.

MAR 5:40  And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he
 taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with
 him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.

MAR 5:41  And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi;
 which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.

MAR 5:42  And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age
 of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.

MAR 5:43  And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and
 commanded that something should be given her to eat.

MAR 6:1  And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his
 disciples follow him.

MAR 6:2  And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue:
 and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these
 things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such
 mighty works are wrought by his hands?

MAR 6:3  Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and
 Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they
 were offended at him.

MAR 6:4  But Jesus, said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his
 own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.

MAR 6:5  And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon
 a few sick folk, and healed them.

MAR 6:6  And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about
 the villages, teaching.

MAR 6:7  And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two
 and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;

MAR 6:8  And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey,
 save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:

MAR 6:9  But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.

MAR 6:10  And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an
 house, there abide till ye depart from that place.

MAR 6:11  And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart
 thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them.
 Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha
 in the day of judgment, than for that city.

MAR 6:12  And they went out, and preached that men should repent.

MAR 6:13  And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were
 sick, and healed them.

MAR 6:14  And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he
 said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty
 works do shew forth themselves in him.

MAR 6:15  Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet,
 or as one of the prophets.

MAR 6:16  But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded:
 he is risen from the dead.

MAR 6:17  For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound
 him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had
 married her.

MAR 6:18  For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy
 brother's wife.

MAR 6:19  Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed
 him; but she could not:

MAR 6:20  For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an
 holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard
 him gladly.

MAR 6:21  And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a
 supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;

MAR 6:22  And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and
 pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask
 of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.

MAR 6:23  And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give
 it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.

MAR 6:24  And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And
 she said, The head of John the Baptist.

MAR 6:25  And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked,
 saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the
 Baptist.

MAR 6:26  And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for
 their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.

MAR 6:27  And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head
 to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,

MAR 6:28  And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the
 damsel gave it to her mother.

MAR 6:29  And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his
 corpse, and laid it in a tomb.

MAR 6:30  And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told
 him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.

MAR 6:31  And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert
 place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had
 no leisure so much as to eat.

MAR 6:32  And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.

MAR 6:33  And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot
 thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.

MAR 6:34  And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with
 compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and
 he began to teach them many things.

MAR 6:35  And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and
 said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:

MAR 6:36  Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and
 into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.

MAR 6:37  He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say
 unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them
 to eat?

MAR 6:38  He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when
 they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.

MAR 6:39  And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the
 green grass.

MAR 6:40  And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.

MAR 6:41  And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked
 up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his
 disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.

MAR 6:42  And they did all eat, and were filled.

MAR 6:43  And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the
 fishes.

MAR 6:44  And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.

MAR 6:45  And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the
 ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away
 the people.

MAR 6:46  And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.

MAR 6:47  And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he
 alone on the land.

MAR 6:48  And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto
 them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking
 upon the sea, and would have passed by them.

MAR 6:49  But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been
 a spirit, and cried out:

MAR 6:50  For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked
 with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.

MAR 6:51  And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they
 were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.

MAR 6:52  For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart
 was hardened.

MAR 6:53  And when they had passed over, they came into the land of
 Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.

MAR 6:54  And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,

MAR 6:55  And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry
 about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.

MAR 6:56  And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or
 country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might
 touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him
 were made whole.

MAR 7:1  Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes,
 which came from Jerusalem.

MAR 7:2  And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that
 is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.

MAR 7:3  For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft,
 eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.

MAR 7:4  And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not.
 And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the
 washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.

MAR 7:5  Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples
 according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?

MAR 7:6  He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you
 hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but
 their heart is far from me.

MAR 7:7  Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the
 commandments of men.

MAR 7:8  For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men,
 as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.

MAR 7:9  And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God,
 that ye may keep your own tradition.

MAR 7:10  For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth
 father or mother, let him die the death:

MAR 7:11  But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban,
 that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he
 shall be free.

MAR 7:12  And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;

MAR 7:13  Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which
 ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.

MAR 7:14  And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them,
 Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:

MAR 7:15  There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can
 defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile
 the man.

MAR 7:16  If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.

MAR 7:17  And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples
 asked him concerning the parable.

MAR 7:18  And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye
 not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it
 cannot defile him;

MAR 7:19  Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth
 out into the draught, purging all meats?

MAR 7:20  And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.

MAR 7:21  For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts,
 adulteries, fornications, murders,

MAR 7:22  Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil
 eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:

MAR 7:23  All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.

MAR 7:24  And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and
 Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could
 not be hid.

MAR 7:25  For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit,
 heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:

MAR 7:26  The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought
 him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.

MAR 7:27  But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is
 not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.

MAR 7:28  And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the
 table eat of the children's crumbs.

MAR 7:29  And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone
 out of thy daughter.

MAR 7:30  And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and
 her daughter laid upon the bed.

MAR 7:31  And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto
 the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.

MAR 7:32  And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in
 his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.

MAR 7:33  And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into
 his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;

MAR 7:34  And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha,
 that is, Be opened.

MAR 7:35  And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue
 was loosed, and he spake plain.

MAR 7:36  And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he
 charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;

MAR 7:37  And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things
 well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.

MAR 8:1  In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to
 eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,

MAR 8:2  I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me
 three days, and have nothing to eat:

MAR 8:3  And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint
 by the way: for divers of them came from far.

MAR 8:4  And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these
 men with bread here in the wilderness?

MAR 8:5  And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.

MAR 8:6  And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the
 seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set
 before them; and they did set them before the people.

MAR 8:7  And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set
 them also before them.

MAR 8:8  So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat
 that was left seven baskets.

MAR 8:9  And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them
 away.

MAR 8:10  And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came
 into the parts of Dalmanutha.

MAR 8:11  And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking
 of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.

MAR 8:12  And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this
 generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be
 given unto this generation.

MAR 8:13  And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the
 other side.

MAR 8:14  Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they
 in the ship with them more than one loaf.

MAR 8:15  And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the
 Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.

MAR 8:16  And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no
 bread.

MAR 8:17  And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye
 have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart
 yet hardened?

MAR 8:18  Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not
 remember?

MAR 8:19  When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets
 full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.

MAR 8:20  And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of
 fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.

MAR 8:21  And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?

MAR 8:22  And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and
 besought him to touch him.

MAR 8:23  And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town;
 and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if
 he saw ought.

MAR 8:24  And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.

MAR 8:25  After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look
 up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.

MAR 8:26  And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town,
 nor tell it to any in the town.

MAR 8:27  And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea
 Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do
 men say that I am?

MAR 8:28  And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others,
 One of the prophets.

MAR 8:29  And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter
 answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.

MAR 8:30  And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.

MAR 8:31  And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many
 things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and
 scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.

MAR 8:32  And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to
 rebuke him.

MAR 8:33  But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked
 Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things
 that be of God, but the things that be of men.

MAR 8:34  And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also,
 he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and
 take up his cross, and follow me.

MAR 8:35  For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall
 lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.

MAR 8:36  For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and
 lose his own soul?

MAR 8:37  Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

MAR 8:38  Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this
 adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be
 ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.

MAR 9:1  And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some
 of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen
 the kingdom of God come with power.

MAR 9:2  And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and
 John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he
 was transfigured before them.

MAR 9:3  And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no
 fuller on earth can white them.

MAR 9:4  And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking
 with Jesus.

MAR 9:5  And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be
 here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and
 one for Elias.

MAR 9:6  For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.

MAR 9:7  And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out
 of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.

MAR 9:8  And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any
 more, save Jesus only with themselves.

MAR 9:9  And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they
 should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen
 from the dead.

MAR 9:10  And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with
 another what the rising from the dead should mean.

MAR 9:11  And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first
 come?

MAR 9:12  And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and
 restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must
 suffer many things, and be set at nought.

MAR 9:13  But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done
 unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.

MAR 9:14  And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about
 them, and the scribes questioning with them.

MAR 9:15  And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly
 amazed, and running to him saluted him.

MAR 9:16  And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?

MAR 9:17  And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought
 unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;

MAR 9:18  And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and
 gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that
 they should cast him out; and they could not.

MAR 9:19  He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I
 be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.

MAR 9:20  And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the
 spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.

MAR 9:21  And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him?
 And he said, Of a child.

MAR 9:22  And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to
 destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help
 us.

MAR 9:23  Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible
 to him that believeth.

MAR 9:24  And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with
 tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.

MAR 9:25  When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the
 foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come
 out of him, and enter no more into him.

MAR 9:26  And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he
 was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.

MAR 9:27  But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.

MAR 9:28  And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him
 privately, Why could not we cast him out?

MAR 9:29  And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by
 prayer and fasting.

MAR 9:30  And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would
 not that any man should know it.

MAR 9:31  For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is
 delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he
 is killed, he shall rise the third day.

MAR 9:32  But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.

MAR 9:33  And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What
 was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?

MAR 9:34  But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among
 themselves, who should be the greatest.

MAR 9:35  And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any
 man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.

MAR 9:36  And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he
 had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,

MAR 9:37  Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth
 me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.

MAR 9:38  And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils
 in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth
 not us.

MAR 9:39  But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a
 miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.

MAR 9:40  For he that is not against us is on our part.

MAR 9:41  For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name,
 because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his
 reward.

MAR 9:42  And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in
 me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he
 were cast into the sea.

MAR 9:43  And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to
 enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire
 that never shall be quenched:

MAR 9:44  Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

MAR 9:45  And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to
 enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the
 fire that never shall be quenched:

MAR 9:46  Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

MAR 9:47  And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to
 enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast
 into hell fire:

MAR 9:48  Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

MAR 9:49  For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be
 salted with salt.

MAR 9:50  Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will
 ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.

MAR 10:1  And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the
 farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was
 wont, he taught them again.

MAR 10:2  And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man
 to put away his wife? tempting him.

MAR 10:3  And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?

MAR 10:4  And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to
 put her away.

MAR 10:5  And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart
 he wrote you this precept.

MAR 10:6  But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.

MAR 10:7  For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to
 his wife;

MAR 10:8  And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain,
 but one flesh.

MAR 10:9  What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.

MAR 10:10  And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.

MAR 10:11  And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry
 another, committeth adultery against her.

MAR 10:12  And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to
 another, she committeth adultery.

MAR 10:13  And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them:
 and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.

MAR 10:14  But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them,
 Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such
 is the kingdom of God.

MAR 10:15  Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of
 God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.

MAR 10:16  And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and
 blessed them.

MAR 10:17  And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and
 kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may
 inherit eternal life?

MAR 10:18  And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none
 good but one, that is, God.

MAR 10:19  Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill,
 Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and
 mother. 

MAR 10:20  And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed
 from my youth.

MAR 10:21  Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing
 thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the
 poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the
 cross, and follow me.

MAR 10:22  And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had
 great possessions.

MAR 10:23  And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How
 hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!

MAR 10:24  And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth
 again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in
 riches to enter into the kingdom of God!

MAR 10:25  It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for
 a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

MAR 10:26  And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves,
 Who then can be saved?

MAR 10:27  And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but
 not with God: for with God all things are possible.

MAR 10:28  Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have
 followed thee.

MAR 10:29  And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man
 that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife,
 or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,

MAR 10:30  But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and
 brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with
 persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.

MAR 10:31  But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.

MAR 10:32  And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went
 before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid.
 And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should
 happen unto him,

MAR 10:33  Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be
 delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall
 condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:

MAR 10:34  And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon
 him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.

MAR 10:35  And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying,
 Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.

MAR 10:36  And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?

MAR 10:37  They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right
 hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.

MAR 10:38  But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink
 of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am
 baptized with?

MAR 10:39  And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall
 indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am
 baptized withal shall ye be baptized:

MAR 10:40  But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give;
 but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.

MAR 10:41  And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with
 James and John.

MAR 10:42  But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they
 which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them;
 and their great ones exercise authority upon them.

MAR 10:43  But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among
 you, shall be your minister:

MAR 10:44  And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.

MAR 10:45  For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
 minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

MAR 10:46  And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his
 disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus,
 sat by the highway side begging.

MAR 10:47  And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry
 out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.

MAR 10:48  And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the
 more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.

MAR 10:49  And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call
 the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.

MAR 10:50  And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.

MAR 10:51  And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should
 do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my
 sight.

MAR 10:52  And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole.
 And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.

MAR 11:1  And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at
 the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,

MAR 11:2  And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you:
 and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon
 never man sat; loose him, and bring him.

MAR 11:3  And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord
 hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.

MAR 11:4  And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without
 in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.

MAR 11:5  And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye,
 loosing the colt?

MAR 11:6  And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let
 them go.

MAR 11:7  And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him;
 and he sat upon him.

MAR 11:8  And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down
 branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.

MAR 11:9  And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying,
 Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:

MAR 11:10  Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name
 of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.

MAR 11:11  And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he
 had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he
 went out unto Bethany with the twelve.

MAR 11:12  And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:

MAR 11:13  And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he
 might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but
 leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.

MAR 11:14  And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee
 hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.

MAR 11:15  And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and
 began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the
 tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;

MAR 11:16  And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through
 the temple.

MAR 11:17  And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall
 be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of
 thieves.

MAR 11:18  And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they
 might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished
 at his doctrine.

MAR 11:19  And when even was come, he went out of the city.

MAR 11:20  And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried
 up from the roots.

MAR 11:21  And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the
 fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.

MAR 11:22  And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.

MAR 11:23  For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this
 mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt
 in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come
 to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.

MAR 11:24  Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye
 pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.

MAR 11:25  And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any:
 that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.

MAR 11:26  But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in
 heaven forgive your trespasses.

MAR 11:27  And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the
 temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,

MAR 11:28  And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who
 gave thee this authority to do these things?

MAR 11:29  And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one
 question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these
 things.

MAR 11:30  The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.

MAR 11:31  And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From
 heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?

MAR 11:32  But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men
 counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.

MAR 11:33  And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus
 answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these
 things.

MAR 12:1  And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a
 vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and
 built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.

MAR 12:2  And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might
 receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.

MAR 12:3  And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.

MAR 12:4  And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast
 stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.

MAR 12:5  And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others;
 beating some, and killing some.

MAR 12:6  Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last
 unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.

MAR 12:7  But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come,
 let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our's.

MAR 12:8  And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.

MAR 12:9  What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and
 destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.

MAR 12:10  And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders
 rejected is become the head of the corner:

MAR 12:11  This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?

MAR 12:12  And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they
 knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went
 their way.

MAR 12:13  And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the
 Herodians, to catch him in his words.

MAR 12:14  And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that
 thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of
 men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to
 Caesar, or not?

MAR 12:15  Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their
 hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see
 it.

MAR 12:16  And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and
 superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.

MAR 12:17  And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that
 are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at
 him.

MAR 12:18  Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no
 resurrection; and they asked him, saying,

MAR 12:19  Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his
 wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his
 wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

MAR 12:20  Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying
 left no seed.

MAR 12:21  And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the
 third likewise.

MAR 12:22  And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died
 also.

MAR 12:23  In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife
 shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.

MAR 12:24  And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because
 ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?

MAR 12:25  For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are
 given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.

MAR 12:26  And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the
 book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of
 Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?

MAR 12:27  He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye
 therefore do greatly err.

MAR 12:28  And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning
 together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is
 the first commandment of all?

MAR 12:29  And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear,
 O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:

MAR 12:30  And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with
 all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the
 first commandment.

MAR 12:31  And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour
 as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.

MAR 12:32  And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the
 truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:

MAR 12:33  And to love him with all the heart, and with all the
 understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love
 his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and
 sacrifices.

MAR 12:34  And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him,
 Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him
 any question.

MAR 12:35  And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say
 the scribes that Christ is the son of David?

MAR 12:36  For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord,
 Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.

MAR 12:37  David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his
 son? And the common people heard him gladly.

MAR 12:38  And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which
 love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,

MAR 12:39  And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at
 feasts:

MAR 12:40  Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers:
 these shall receive greater damnation.

MAR 12:41  And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people
 cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.

MAR 12:42  And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites,
 which make a farthing.

MAR 12:43  And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I
 say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which
 have cast into the treasury:

MAR 12:44  For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did
 cast in all that she had, even all her living.

MAR 13:1  And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto
 him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!

MAR 13:2  And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings?
 there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown
 down.

MAR 13:3  And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter
 and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,

MAR 13:4  Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when
 all these things shall be fulfilled?

MAR 13:5  And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive
 you:

MAR 13:6  For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall
 deceive many.

MAR 13:7  And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not
 troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.

MAR 13:8  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
 and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines
 and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.

MAR 13:9  But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to
 councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought
 before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.

MAR 13:10  And the gospel must first be published among all nations.

MAR 13:11  But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought
 beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever
 shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak,
 but the Holy Ghost.

MAR 13:12  Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father
 the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause
 them to be put to death.

MAR 13:13  And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that
 shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.

MAR 13:14  But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by
 Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth
 understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:

MAR 13:15  And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house,
 neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:

MAR 13:16  And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up
 his garment.

MAR 13:17  But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in
 those days!

MAR 13:18  And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.

MAR 13:19  For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the
 beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.

MAR 13:20  And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should
 be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened
 the days.

MAR 13:21  And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he
 is there; believe him not:

MAR 13:22  For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew
 signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.

MAR 13:23  But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.

MAR 13:24  But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be
 darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,

MAR 13:25  And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in
 heaven shall be shaken.

MAR 13:26  And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with
 great power and glory.

MAR 13:27  And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his
 elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the
 uttermost part of heaven.

MAR 13:28  Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet
 tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:

MAR 13:29  So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass,
 know that it is nigh, even at the doors.

MAR 13:30  Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all
 these things be done.

MAR 13:31  Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.

MAR 13:32  But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels
 which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.

MAR 13:33  Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.

MAR 13:34  For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his
 house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and
 commanded the porter to watch.

MAR 13:35  Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house
 cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:

MAR 13:36  Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.

MAR 13:37  And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.

MAR 14:1  After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened
 bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him
 by craft, and put him to death.

MAR 14:2  But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the
 people.

MAR 14:3  And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at
 meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard
 very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head.

MAR 14:4  And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said,
 Why was this waste of the ointment made?

MAR 14:5  For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and
 have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.

MAR 14:6  And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a
 good work on me.

MAR 14:7  For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may
 do them good: but me ye have not always.

MAR 14:8  She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body
 to the burying.

MAR 14:9  Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached
 throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of
 for a memorial of her.

MAR 14:10  And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests,
 to betray him unto them.

MAR 14:11  And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him
 money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.

MAR 14:12  And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the
 passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare
 that thou mayest eat the passover?

MAR 14:13  And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go
 ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water:
 follow him.

MAR 14:14  And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house,
 The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover
 with my disciples?

MAR 14:15  And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared:
 there make ready for us.

MAR 14:16  And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as
 he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.

MAR 14:17  And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.

MAR 14:18  And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One
 of you which eateth with me shall betray me.

MAR 14:19  And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is
 it I? and another said, Is it I?

MAR 14:20  And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that
 dippeth with me in the dish.

MAR 14:21  The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to
 that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he
 had never been born.

MAR 14:22  And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake
 it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.

MAR 14:23  And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it
 to them: and they all drank of it.

MAR 14:24  And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which
 is shed for many.

MAR 14:25  Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the
 vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.

MAR 14:26  And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of
 Olives.

MAR 14:27  And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me
 this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall
 be scattered.

MAR 14:28  But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.

MAR 14:29  But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will
 not I.

MAR 14:30  And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day,
 even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.

MAR 14:31  But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will
 not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.

MAR 14:32  And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to
 his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.

MAR 14:33  And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be
 sore amazed, and to be very heavy;

MAR 14:34  And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death:
 tarry ye here, and watch.

MAR 14:35  And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed
 that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.

MAR 14:36  And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take
 away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.

MAR 14:37  And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter,
 Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?

MAR 14:38  Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly
 is ready, but the flesh is weak.

MAR 14:39  And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.

MAR 14:40  And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes
 were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.

MAR 14:41  And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and
 take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is
 betrayed into the hands of sinners.

MAR 14:42  Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.

MAR 14:43  And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the
 twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief
 priests and the scribes and the elders.

MAR 14:44  And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever
 I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.

MAR 14:45  And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith,
 Master, master; and kissed him.

MAR 14:46  And they laid their hands on him, and took him.

MAR 14:47  And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant
 of the high priest, and cut off his ear.

MAR 14:48  And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a
 thief, with swords and with staves to take me?

MAR 14:49  I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but
 the scriptures must be fulfilled.

MAR 14:50  And they all forsook him, and fled.

MAR 14:51  And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth
 cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:

MAR 14:52  And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.

MAR 14:53  And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were
 assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.

MAR 14:54  And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high
 priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.

MAR 14:55  And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against
 Jesus to put him to death; and found none.

MAR 14:56  For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed
 not together.

MAR 14:57  And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,

MAR 14:58  We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with
 hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.

MAR 14:59  But neither so did their witness agree together.

MAR 14:60  And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying,
 Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?

MAR 14:61  But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest
 asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?

MAR 14:62  And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the
 right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.

MAR 14:63  Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any
 further witnesses?

MAR 14:64  Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned
 him to be guilty of death.

MAR 14:65  And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet
 him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the
 palms of their hands.

MAR 14:66  And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the
 maids of the high priest:

MAR 14:67  And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and
 said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.

MAR 14:68  But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou
 sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.

MAR 14:69  And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by,
 This is one of them.

MAR 14:70  And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said
 again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and
 thy speech agreeth thereto.

MAR 14:71  But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of
 whom ye speak.

MAR 14:72  And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word
 that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me
 thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.

MAR 15:1  And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation
 with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and
 carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.

MAR 15:2  And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering
 said unto them, Thou sayest it.

MAR 15:3  And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered
 nothing.

MAR 15:4  And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold
 how many things they witness against thee.

MAR 15:5  But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.

MAR 15:6  Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they
 desired.

MAR 15:7  And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had
 made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.

MAR 15:8  And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had
 ever done unto them.

MAR 15:9  But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the
 King of the Jews?

MAR 15:10  For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.

MAR 15:11  But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather
 release Barabbas unto them.

MAR 15:12  And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that
 I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?

MAR 15:13  And they cried out again, Crucify him.

MAR 15:14  Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they
 cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.

MAR 15:15  And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto
 them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.

MAR 15:16  And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and
 they call together the whole band.

MAR 15:17  And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and
 put it about his head,

MAR 15:18  And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!

MAR 15:19  And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon
 him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.

MAR 15:20  And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and
 put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.

MAR 15:21  And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out
 of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.

MAR 15:22  And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being
 interpreted, The place of a skull.

MAR 15:23  And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received
 it not.

MAR 15:24  And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting
 lots upon them, what every man should take.

MAR 15:25  And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.

MAR 15:26  And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING
 OF THE JEWS.

MAR 15:27  And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right
 hand, and the other on his left.

MAR 15:28  And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered
 with the transgressors.

MAR 15:29  And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and
 saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,

MAR 15:30  Save thyself, and come down from the cross.

MAR 15:31  Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with
 the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.

MAR 15:32  Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we
 may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.

MAR 15:33  And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole
 land until the ninth hour.

MAR 15:34  And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi,
 Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast
 thou forsaken me?

MAR 15:35  And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he
 calleth Elias.

MAR 15:36  And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a
 reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will
 come to take him down.

MAR 15:37  And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.

MAR 15:38  And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the
 bottom.

MAR 15:39  And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so
 cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.

MAR 15:40  There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary
 Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;

MAR 15:41  (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto
 him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.

MAR 15:42  And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that
 is, the day before the sabbath,

MAR 15:43  Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited
 for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the
 body of Jesus.

MAR 15:44  And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him
 the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.

MAR 15:45  And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.

MAR 15:46  And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the
 linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a
 stone unto the door of the sepulchre.

MAR 15:47  And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was
 laid.

MAR 16:1  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of
 James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint
 him.

MAR 16:2  And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came
 unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.

MAR 16:3  And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from
 the door of the sepulchre?

MAR 16:4  And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it
 was very great.

MAR 16:5  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the
 right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.

MAR 16:6  And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth,
 which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they
 laid him.

MAR 16:7  But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before
 you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.

MAR 16:8  And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they
 trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they
 were afraid.

MAR 16:9  Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared
 first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.

MAR 16:10  And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned
 and wept.

MAR 16:11  And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen
 of her, believed not.

MAR 16:12  After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they
 walked, and went into the country.

MAR 16:13  And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they
 them.

MAR 16:14  Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and
 upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they
 believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.

MAR 16:15  And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the
 gospel to every creature.

MAR 16:16  He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that
 believeth not shall be damned.

MAR 16:17  And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall
 they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;

MAR 16:18  They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it
 shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall
 recover.

MAR 16:19  So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into
 heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.

MAR 16:20  And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with
 them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.

MAT 1:1  The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son
 of Abraham.

MAT 1:2  Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and
 his brethren;

MAT 1:3  And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and
 Esrom begat Aram;

MAT 1:4  And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat
 Salmon;

MAT 1:5  And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed
 begat Jesse;

MAT 1:6  And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of
 her that had been the wife of Urias;

MAT 1:7  And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;

MAT 1:8  And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat
 Ozias;

MAT 1:9  And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat
 Ezekias;

MAT 1:10  And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat
 Josias;

MAT 1:11  And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were
 carried away to Babylon:

MAT 1:12  And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel;
 and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;

MAT 1:13  And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat
 Azor;

MAT 1:14  And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;

MAT 1:15  And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat
 Jacob;

MAT 1:16  And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus,
 who is called Christ.

MAT 1:17  So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen
 generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen
 generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen
 generations.

MAT 1:18  Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother
 Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with
 child of the Holy Ghost.

MAT 1:19  Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make
 her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.

MAT 1:20  But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD
 appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to
 take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the
 Holy Ghost.

MAT 1:21  And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS:
 for he shall save his people from their sins.

MAT 1:22  Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
 of the Lord by the prophet, saying,

MAT 1:23  Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a
 son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God
 with us.

MAT 1:24  Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had
 bidden him, and took unto him his wife:

MAT 1:25  And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he
 called his name JESUS.

MAT 2:1  Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod
 the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,

MAT 2:2  Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen
 his star in the east, and are come to worship him.

MAT 2:3  When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all
 Jerusalem with him.

MAT 2:4  And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the
 people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.

MAT 2:5  And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written
 by the prophet,

MAT 2:6  And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the
 princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my
 people Israel.

MAT 2:7  Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them
 diligently what time the star appeared.

MAT 2:8  And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for
 the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may
 come and worship him also.

MAT 2:9  When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which
 they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the
 young child was.

MAT 2:10  When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.

MAT 2:11  And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with
 Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened
 their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and
 myrrh.

MAT 2:12  And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to
 Herod, they departed into their own country another way.

MAT 2:13  And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth
 to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his
 mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for
 Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.

MAT 2:14  When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and
 departed into Egypt:

MAT 2:15  And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled
 which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I
 called my son.

MAT 2:16  Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was
 exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in
 Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under,
 according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.

MAT 2:17  Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,
 saying,

MAT 2:18  In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great
 mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted,
 because they are not.

MAT 2:19  But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a
 dream to Joseph in Egypt,

MAT 2:20  Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into
 the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.

MAT 2:21  And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into
 the land of Israel.

MAT 2:22  But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of
 his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned
 of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:

MAT 2:23  And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be
 fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.

MAT 3:1  In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of
 Judaea,

MAT 3:2  And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

MAT 3:3  For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The
 voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make
 his paths straight.

MAT 3:4  And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern
 girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.

MAT 3:5  Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region
 round about Jordan,

MAT 3:6  And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.

MAT 3:7  But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his
 baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to
 flee from the wrath to come?

MAT 3:8  Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:

MAT 3:9  And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father:
 for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children
 unto Abraham.

MAT 3:10  And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore
 every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into
 the fire.

MAT 3:11  I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance. but he that cometh
 after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall
 baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:

MAT 3:12  Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and
 gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with
 unquenchable fire.

MAT 3:13  Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of
 him.

MAT 3:14  But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and
 comest thou to me?

MAT 3:15  And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus
 it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.

MAT 3:16  And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the
 water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of
 God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:

MAT 3:17  And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I
 am well pleased.

MAT 4:1  Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted
 of the devil.

MAT 4:2  And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward
 an hungred.

MAT 4:3  And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God,
 command that these stones be made bread.

MAT 4:4  But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread
 alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.

MAT 4:5  Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a
 pinnacle of the temple,

MAT 4:6  And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for
 it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their
 hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a
 stone.

MAT 4:7  Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the
 Lord thy God.

MAT 4:8  Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and
 sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;

MAT 4:9  And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt
 fall down and worship me.

MAT 4:10  Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written,
 Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.

MAT 4:11  Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered
 unto him.

MAT 4:12  Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed
 into Galilee;

MAT 4:13  And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon
 the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:

MAT 4:14  That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet,
 saying,

MAT 4:15  The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the
 sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;

MAT 4:16  The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which
 sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.

MAT 4:17  From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the
 kingdom of heaven is at hand.

MAT 4:18  And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon
 called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they
 were fishers.

MAT 4:19  And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of
 men.

MAT 4:20  And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.

MAT 4:21  And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of
 Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending
 their nets; and he called them.

MAT 4:22  And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed
 him.

MAT 4:23  And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and
 preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and
 all manner of disease among the people.

MAT 4:24  And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all
 sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those
 which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those
 that had the palsy; and he healed them.

MAT 4:25  And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and
 from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.

MAT 5:1  And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was
 set, his disciples came unto him:

MAT 5:2  And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,

MAT 5:3  Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

MAT 5:4  Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.

MAT 5:5  Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.

MAT 5:6  Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for
 they shall be filled.

MAT 5:7  Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.

MAT 5:8  Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.

MAT 5:9  Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of
 God.

MAT 5:10  Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for
 theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

MAT 5:11  Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and
 shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.

MAT 5:12  Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven:
 for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.

MAT 5:13  Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour,
 wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be
 cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.

MAT 5:14  Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot
 be hid.

MAT 5:15  Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a
 candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.

MAT 5:16  Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
 works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

MAT 5:17  Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am
 not come to destroy, but to fulfil.

MAT 5:18  For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one
 tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.

MAT 5:19  Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and
 shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven:
 but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the
 kingdom of heaven.

MAT 5:20  For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the
 righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into
 the kingdom of heaven.

MAT 5:21  Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not
 kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:

MAT 5:22  But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without
 a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his
 brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say,
 Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.

MAT 5:23  Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest
 that thy brother hath ought against thee;

MAT 5:24  Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be
 reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.

MAT 5:25  Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with
 him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge
 deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.

MAT 5:26  Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till
 thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.

MAT 5:27  Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not
 commit adultery:

MAT 5:28  But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after
 her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.

MAT 5:29  And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from
 thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should
 perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.

MAT 5:30  And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee:
 for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not
 that thy whole body should be cast into hell.

MAT 5:31  It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give
 her a writing of divorcement:

MAT 5:32  But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving
 for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever
 shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.

MAT 5:33  Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou
 shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:

MAT 5:34  But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is
 God's throne:

MAT 5:35  Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for
 it is the city of the great King.

MAT 5:36  Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one
 hair white or black.

MAT 5:37  But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is
 more than these cometh of evil.

MAT 5:38  Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth
 for a tooth:

MAT 5:39  But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall
 smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.

MAT 5:40  And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let
 him have thy cloak also.

MAT 5:41  And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.

MAT 5:42  Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee
 turn not thou away.

MAT 5:43  Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy
 neighbour, and hate thine enemy.

MAT 5:44  But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do
 good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and
 persecute you;

MAT 5:45  That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he
 maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the
 just and on the unjust.

MAT 5:46  For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even
 the publicans the same?

MAT 5:47  And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do
 not even the publicans so?

MAT 5:48  Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is
 perfect.

MAT 6:1  Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them:
 otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.

MAT 6:2  Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before
 thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they
 may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

MAT 6:3  But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right
 hand doeth:

MAT 6:4  That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret
 himself shall reward thee openly.

MAT 6:5  And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for
 they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the
 streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their
 reward.

MAT 6:6  But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast
 shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which
 seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.

MAT 6:7  But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for
 they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.

MAT 6:8  Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what
 things ye have need of, before ye ask him.

MAT 6:9  After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven,
 Hallowed be thy name.

MAT 6:10  Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.

MAT 6:11  Give us this day our daily bread.

MAT 6:12  And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.

MAT 6:13  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine
 is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.

MAT 6:14  For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will
 also forgive you:

MAT 6:15  But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father
 forgive your trespasses.

MAT 6:16  Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad
 countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to
 fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

MAT 6:17  But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;

MAT 6:18  That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is
 in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.

MAT 6:19  Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust
 doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:

MAT 6:20  But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor
 rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:

MAT 6:21  For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

MAT 6:22  The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single,
 thy whole body shall be full of light.

MAT 6:23  But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.
 If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that
 darkness!

MAT 6:24  No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and
 love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye
 cannot serve God and mammon.

MAT 6:25  Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye
 shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put
 on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?

MAT 6:26  Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap,
 nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much
 better than they?

MAT 6:27  Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?

MAT 6:28  And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the
 field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:

MAT 6:29  And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not
 arrayed like one of these.

MAT 6:30  Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day
 is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O
 ye of little faith?

MAT 6:31  Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall
 we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?

MAT 6:32  (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly
 Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.

MAT 6:33  But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all
 these things shall be added unto you.

MAT 6:34  Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take
 thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil
 thereof.

MAT 7:1  Judge not, that ye be not judged.

MAT 7:2  For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what
 measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

MAT 7:3  And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but
 considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

MAT 7:4  Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of
 thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?

MAT 7:5  Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then
 shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.

MAT 7:6  Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls
 before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and
 rend you.

MAT 7:7  Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it
 shall be opened unto you:

MAT 7:8  For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and
 to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

MAT 7:9  Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give
 him a stone?

MAT 7:10  Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

MAT 7:11  If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
 children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things
 to them that ask him?

MAT 7:12  Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you,
 do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.

MAT 7:13  Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is
 the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:

MAT 7:14  Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto
 life, and few there be that find it.

MAT 7:15  Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but
 inwardly they are ravening wolves.

MAT 7:16  Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns,
 or figs of thistles?

MAT 7:17  Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree
 bringeth forth evil fruit.

MAT 7:18  A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree
 bring forth good fruit.

MAT 7:19  Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast
 into the fire.

MAT 7:20  Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.

MAT 7:21  Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
 kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in
 heaven.

MAT 7:22  Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied
 in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many
 wonderful works?

MAT 7:23  And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me,
 ye that work iniquity.

MAT 7:24  Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I
 will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:

MAT 7:25  And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and
 beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.

MAT 7:26  And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not,
 shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:

MAT 7:27  And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and
 beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.

MAT 7:28  And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people
 were astonished at his doctrine:

MAT 7:29  For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.

MAT 8:1  When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed
 him.

MAT 8:2  And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if
 thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

MAT 8:3  And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou
 clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

MAT 8:4  And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew
 thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a
 testimony unto them.

MAT 8:5  And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a
 centurion, beseeching him,

MAT 8:6  And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy,
 grievously tormented.

MAT 8:7  And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.

MAT 8:8  The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou
 shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall
 be healed.

MAT 8:9  For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to
 this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my
 servant, Do this, and he doeth it.

MAT 8:10  When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed,
 Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.

MAT 8:11  And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and
 shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.

MAT 8:12  But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer
 darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

MAT 8:13  And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast
 believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame
 hour.

MAT 8:14  And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother
 laid, and sick of a fever.

MAT 8:15  And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and
 ministered unto them.

MAT 8:16  When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were
 possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed
 all that were sick:

MAT 8:17  That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet,
 saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.

MAT 8:18  Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to
 depart unto the other side.

MAT 8:19  And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow
 thee whithersoever thou goest.

MAT 8:20  And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the
 air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.

MAT 8:21  And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to
 go and bury my father.

MAT 8:22  But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.

MAT 8:23  And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.

MAT 8:24  And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that
 the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.

MAT 8:25  And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us:
 we perish.

MAT 8:26  And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?
 Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.

MAT 8:27  But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even
 the winds and the sea obey him!

MAT 8:28  And when he was come to the other side into the country of the
 Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs,
 exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.

MAT 8:29  And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee,
 Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?

MAT 8:30  And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.

MAT 8:31  So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to
 go away into the herd of swine.

MAT 8:32  And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went
 into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently
 down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.

MAT 8:33  And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and
 told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.

MAT 8:34  And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw
 him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts.

MAT 9:1  And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own
 city.

MAT 9:2  And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a
 bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of
 good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.

MAT 9:3  And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man
 blasphemeth.

MAT 9:4  And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your
 hearts?

MAT 9:5  For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say,
 Arise, and walk?

MAT 9:6  But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to
 forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy
 bed, and go unto thine house.

MAT 9:7  And he arose, and departed to his house.

MAT 9:8  But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God,
 which had given such power unto men.

MAT 9:9  And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew,
 sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he
 arose, and followed him.

MAT 9:10  And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many
 publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.

MAT 9:11  And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why
 eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?

MAT 9:12  But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need
 not a physician, but they that are sick.

MAT 9:13  But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not
 sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to
 repentance.

MAT 9:14  Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the
 Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?

MAT 9:15  And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn,
 as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the
 bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.

MAT 9:16  No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that
 which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made
 worse.

MAT 9:17  Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles
 break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new
 wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.

MAT 9:18  While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain
 ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and
 lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.

MAT 9:19  And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.

MAT 9:20  And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood
 twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:

MAT 9:21  For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall
 be whole.

MAT 9:22  But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter,
 be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made
 whole from that hour.

MAT 9:23  And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and
 the people making a noise,

MAT 9:24  He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but
 sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.

MAT 9:25  But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the
 hand, and the maid arose.

MAT 9:26  And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.

MAT 9:27  And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him,
 crying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us.

MAT 9:28  And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and
 Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto
 him, Yea, Lord.

MAT 9:29  Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it
 unto you.

MAT 9:30  And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying,
 See that no man know it.

MAT 9:31  But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that
 country.

MAT 9:32  As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed
 with a devil.

MAT 9:33  And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes
 marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.

MAT 9:34  But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince
 of the devils.

MAT 9:35  And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their
 synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every
 sickness and every disease among the people.

MAT 9:36  But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them,
 because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.

MAT 9:37  Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but
 the labourers are few;

MAT 9:38  Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth
 labourers into his harvest.

MAT 10:1  And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them
 power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of
 sickness and all manner of disease.

MAT 10:2  Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who
 is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John
 his brother;

MAT 10:3  Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the
 son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;

MAT 10:4  Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.

MAT 10:5  These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not
 into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye
 not:

MAT 10:6  But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

MAT 10:7  And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.

MAT 10:8  Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils:
 freely ye have received, freely give.

MAT 10:9  Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,

MAT 10:10  Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor
 yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.

MAT 10:11  And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it
 is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.

MAT 10:12  And when ye come into an house, salute it.

MAT 10:13  And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it
 be not worthy, let your peace return to you.

MAT 10:14  And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye
 depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.

MAT 10:15  Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of
 Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.

MAT 10:16  Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye
 therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.

MAT 10:17  But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and
 they will scourge you in their synagogues;

MAT 10:18  And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for
 a testimony against them and the Gentiles.

MAT 10:19  But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall
 speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.

MAT 10:20  For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which
 speaketh in you.

MAT 10:21  And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the
 father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and
 cause them to be put to death.

MAT 10:22  And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that
 endureth to the end shall be saved.

MAT 10:23  But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for
 verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till
 the Son of man be come.

MAT 10:24  The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his
 lord.

MAT 10:25  It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the
 servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub,
 how much more shall they call them of his household?

MAT 10:26  Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall
 not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.

MAT 10:27  What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye
 hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.

MAT 10:28  And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the
 soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in
 hell.

MAT 10:29  Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not
 fall on the ground without your Father.

MAT 10:30  But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

MAT 10:31  Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.

MAT 10:32  Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess
 also before my Father which is in heaven.

MAT 10:33  But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before
 my Father which is in heaven.

MAT 10:34  Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send
 peace, but a sword.

MAT 10:35  For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the
 daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in
 law.

MAT 10:36  And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.

MAT 10:37  He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me:
 and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.

MAT 10:38  And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not
 worthy of me.

MAT 10:39  He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life
 for my sake shall find it.

MAT 10:40  He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me
 receiveth him that sent me.

MAT 10:41  He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a
 prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a
 righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.

MAT 10:42  And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a
 cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he
 shall in no wise lose his reward.

MAT 11:1  And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his
 twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.

MAT 11:2  Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent
 two of his disciples,

MAT 11:3  And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for
 another?

MAT 11:4  Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those
 things which ye do hear and see:

MAT 11:5  The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are
 cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the
 gospel preached to them.

MAT 11:6  And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.

MAT 11:7  And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes
 concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken
 with the wind?

MAT 11:8  But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?
 behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.

MAT 11:9  But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and
 more than a prophet.

MAT 11:10  For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger
 before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

MAT 11:11  Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath
 not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least
 in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.

MAT 11:12  And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of
 heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.

MAT 11:13  For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.

MAT 11:14  And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.

MAT 11:15  He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

MAT 11:16  But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto
 children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,

MAT 11:17  And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have
 mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.

MAT 11:18  For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a
 devil.

MAT 11:19  The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man
 gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom
 is justified of her children.

MAT 11:20  Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works
 were done, because they repented not:

MAT 11:21  Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty
 works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would
 have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

MAT 11:22  But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at
 the day of judgment, than for you.

MAT 11:23  And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought
 down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been
 done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.

MAT 11:24  But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of
 Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.

MAT 11:25  At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord
 of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and
 prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.

MAT 11:26  Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.

MAT 11:27  All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth
 the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the
 Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.

MAT 11:28  Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
 give you rest.

MAT 11:29  Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in
 heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.

MAT 11:30  For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

MAT 12:1  At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his
 disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat.

MAT 12:2  But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy
 disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.

MAT 12:3  But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was
 an hungred, and they that were with him;

MAT 12:4  How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread,
 which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him,
 but only for the priests?

MAT 12:5  Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the
 priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?

MAT 12:6  But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the
 temple.

MAT 12:7  But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not
 sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.

MAT 12:8  For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.

MAT 12:9  And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:

MAT 12:10  And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they
 asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might
 accuse him.

MAT 12:11  And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall
 have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay
 hold on it, and lift it out?

MAT 12:12  How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful
 to do well on the sabbath days.

MAT 12:13  Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched
 it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.

MAT 12:14  Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how
 they might destroy him.

MAT 12:15  But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great
 multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;

MAT 12:16  And charged them that they should not make him known:

MAT 12:17  That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet,
 saying,

MAT 12:18  Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul
 is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment
 to the Gentiles.

MAT 12:19  He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice
 in the streets.

MAT 12:20  A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not
 quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.

MAT 12:21  And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.

MAT 12:22  Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and
 dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.

MAT 12:23  And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of
 David?

MAT 12:24  But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not
 cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.

MAT 12:25  And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom
 divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house
 divided against itself shall not stand:

MAT 12:26  And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how
 shall then his kingdom stand?

MAT 12:27  And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast
 them out? therefore they shall be your judges.

MAT 12:28  But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of
 God is come unto you.

MAT 12:29  Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his
 goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.

MAT 12:30  He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with
 me scattereth abroad.

MAT 12:31  Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be
 forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be
 forgiven unto men.

MAT 12:32  And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be
 forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be
 forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.

MAT 12:33  Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree
 corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.

MAT 12:34  O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things?
 for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.

MAT 12:35  A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good
 things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.

MAT 12:36  But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they
 shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.

MAT 12:37  For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou
 shalt be condemned.

MAT 12:38  Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying,
 Master, we would see a sign from thee.

MAT 12:39  But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous
 generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but
 the sign of the prophet Jonas:

MAT 12:40  For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly;
 so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the
 earth.

MAT 12:41  The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and
 shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and,
 behold, a greater than Jonas is here.

MAT 12:42  The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this
 generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts
 of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than
 Solomon is here.

MAT 12:43  When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry
 places, seeking rest, and findeth none.

MAT 12:44  Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out;
 and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.

MAT 12:45  Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more
 wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of
 that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked
 generation.

MAT 12:46  While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his
 brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.

MAT 12:47  Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand
 without, desiring to speak with thee.

MAT 12:48  But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother?
 and who are my brethren?

MAT 12:49  And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said,
 Behold my mother and my brethren!

MAT 12:50  For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the
 same is my brother, and sister, and mother.

MAT 13:1  The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.

MAT 13:2  And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went
 into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.

MAT 13:3  And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a
 sower went forth to sow;

MAT 13:4  And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls
 came and devoured them up:

MAT 13:5  Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and
 forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:

MAT 13:6  And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no
 root, they withered away.

MAT 13:7  And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked
 them:

MAT 13:8  But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an
 hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.

MAT 13:9  Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

MAT 13:10  And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto
 them in parables?

MAT 13:11  He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know
 the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.

MAT 13:12  For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more
 abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he
 hath.

MAT 13:13  Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not;
 and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.

MAT 13:14  And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By
 hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and
 shall not perceive:

MAT 13:15  For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of
 hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see
 with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their
 heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.

MAT 13:16  But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they
 hear.

MAT 13:17  For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have
 desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear
 those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.

MAT 13:18  Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.

MAT 13:19  When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it
 not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his
 heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.

MAT 13:20  But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that
 heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;

MAT 13:21  Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when
 tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is
 offended.

MAT 13:22  He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the
 word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the
 word, and he becometh unfruitful.

MAT 13:23  But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth
 the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth,
 some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.

MAT 13:24  Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
 heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:

MAT 13:25  But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the
 wheat, and went his way.

MAT 13:26  But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then
 appeared the tares also.

MAT 13:27  So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir,
 didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?

MAT 13:28  He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto
 him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?

MAT 13:29  But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also
 the wheat with them.

MAT 13:30  Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest
 I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them
 in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.

MAT 13:31  Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
 heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his
 field:

MAT 13:32  Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is
 the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air
 come and lodge in the branches thereof.

MAT 13:33  Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like
 unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the
 whole was leavened.

MAT 13:34  All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and
 without a parable spake he not unto them:

MAT 13:35  That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,
 I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept
 secret from the foundation of the world.

MAT 13:36  Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his
 disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares
 of the field.

MAT 13:37  He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the
 Son of man;

MAT 13:38  The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the
 kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;

MAT 13:39  The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end
 of the world; and the reapers are the angels.

MAT 13:40  As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall
 it be in the end of this world.

MAT 13:41  The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather
 out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;

MAT 13:42  And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing
 and gnashing of teeth.

MAT 13:43  Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
 of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

MAT 13:44  Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field;
 the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and
 selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.

MAT 13:45  Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking
 goodly pearls:

MAT 13:46  Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all
 that he had, and bought it.

MAT 13:47  Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into
 the sea, and gathered of every kind:

MAT 13:48  Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and
 gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.

MAT 13:49  So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come
 forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,

MAT 13:50  And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing
 and gnashing of teeth.

MAT 13:51  Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say
 unto him, Yea, Lord.

MAT 13:52  Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed
 unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which
 bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.

MAT 13:53  And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he
 departed thence.

MAT 13:54  And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their
 synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man
 this wisdom, and these mighty works?

MAT 13:55  Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and
 his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?

MAT 13:56  And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man
 all these things?

MAT 13:57  And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet
 is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.

MAT 13:58  And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.

MAT 14:1  At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,

MAT 14:2  And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen
 from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.

MAT 14:3  For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison
 for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.

MAT 14:4  For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.

MAT 14:5  And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude,
 because they counted him as a prophet.

MAT 14:6  But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced
 before them, and pleased Herod.

MAT 14:7  Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would
 ask.

MAT 14:8  And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here
 John Baptist's head in a charger.

MAT 14:9  And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them
 which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.

MAT 14:10  And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.

MAT 14:11  And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and
 she brought it to her mother.

MAT 14:12  And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and
 went and told Jesus.

MAT 14:13  When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert
 place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot
 out of the cities.

MAT 14:14  And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with
 compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.

MAT 14:15  And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is
 a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they
 may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.

MAT 14:16  But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.

MAT 14:17  And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.

MAT 14:18  He said, Bring them hither to me.

MAT 14:19  And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took
 the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he
 blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples
 to the multitude.

MAT 14:20  And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
 fragments that remained twelve baskets full.

MAT 14:21  And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women
 and children.

MAT 14:22  And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a
 ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes
 away.

MAT 14:23  And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain
 apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.

MAT 14:24  But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for
 the wind was contrary.

MAT 14:25  And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking
 on the sea.

MAT 14:26  And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were
 troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.

MAT 14:27  But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it
 is I; be not afraid.

MAT 14:28  And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come
 unto thee on the water.

MAT 14:29  And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he
 walked on the water, to go to Jesus.

MAT 14:30  But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to
 sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.

MAT 14:31  And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and
 said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?

MAT 14:32  And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.

MAT 14:33  Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of
 a truth thou art the Son of God.

MAT 14:34  And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.

MAT 14:35  And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out
 into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were
 diseased;

MAT 14:36  And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment:
 and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.

MAT 15:1  Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem,
 saying,

MAT 15:2  Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they
 wash not their hands when they eat bread.

MAT 15:3  But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the
 commandment of God by your tradition?

MAT 15:4  For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that
 curseth father or mother, let him die the death.

MAT 15:5  But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a
 gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;

MAT 15:6  And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have
 ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.

MAT 15:7  Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,

MAT 15:8  This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me
 with their lips; but their heart is far from me.

MAT 15:9  But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
 commandments of men.

MAT 15:10  And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and
 understand:

MAT 15:11  Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which
 cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.

MAT 15:12  Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the
 Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?

MAT 15:13  But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath
 not planted, shall be rooted up.

MAT 15:14  Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind
 lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.

MAT 15:15  Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.

MAT 15:16  And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?

MAT 15:17  Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth
 goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?

MAT 15:18  But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the
 heart; and they defile the man.

MAT 15:19  For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,
 fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:

MAT 15:20  These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen
 hands defileth not a man.

MAT 15:21  Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and
 Sidon.

MAT 15:22  And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and
 cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my
 daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.

MAT 15:23  But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought
 him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.

MAT 15:24  But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep
 of the house of Israel.

MAT 15:25  Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.

MAT 15:26  But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's
 bread, and to cast it to dogs.

MAT 15:27  And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall
 from their masters' table.

MAT 15:28  Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith:
 be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that
 very hour.

MAT 15:29  And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of
 Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.

MAT 15:30  And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were
 lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus'
 feet; and he healed them:

MAT 15:31  Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to
 speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and
 they glorified the God of Israel.

MAT 15:32  Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have
 compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days,
 and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they
 faint in the way.

MAT 15:33  And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread
 in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?

MAT 15:34  And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said,
 Seven, and a few little fishes.

MAT 15:35  And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.

MAT 15:36  And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and
 brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.

MAT 15:37  And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
 broken meat that was left seven baskets full.

MAT 15:38  And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and
 children.

MAT 15:39  And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the
 coasts of Magdala.

MAT 16:1  The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him
 that he would shew them a sign from heaven.

MAT 16:2  He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will
 be fair weather: for the sky is red.

MAT 16:3  And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is
 red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but
 can ye not discern the signs of the times?

MAT 16:4  A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there
 shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he
 left them, and departed.

MAT 16:5  And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had
 forgotten to take bread.

MAT 16:6  Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the
 Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

MAT 16:7  And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have
 taken no bread.

MAT 16:8  Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith,
 why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?

MAT 16:9  Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the
 five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?

MAT 16:10  Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets
 ye took up?

MAT 16:11  How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you
 concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and
 of the Sadducees?

MAT 16:12  Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven
 of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

MAT 16:13  When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his
 disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?

MAT 16:14  And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias;
 and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.

MAT 16:15  He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?

MAT 16:16  And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son
 of the living God.

MAT 16:17  And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon
 Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father
 which is in heaven.

MAT 16:18  And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I
 will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.

MAT 16:19  And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and
 whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever
 thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

MAT 16:20  Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he
 was Jesus the Christ.

MAT 16:21  From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how
 that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and
 chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.

MAT 16:22  Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from
 thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.

MAT 16:23  But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou
 art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but
 those that be of men.

MAT 16:24  Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me,
 let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.

MAT 16:25  For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will
 lose his life for my sake shall find it.

MAT 16:26  For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and
 lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

MAT 16:27  For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his
 angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.

MAT 16:28  Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not
 taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.

MAT 17:1  And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his
 brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,

MAT 17:2  And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the
 sun, and his raiment was white as the light.

MAT 17:3  And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with
 him.

MAT 17:4  Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to
 be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and
 one for Moses, and one for Elias.

MAT 17:5  While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and
 behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom
 I am well pleased; hear ye him.

MAT 17:6  And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were
 sore afraid.

MAT 17:7  And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.

MAT 17:8  And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus
 only.

MAT 17:9  And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying,
 Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.

MAT 17:10  And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that
 Elias must first come?

MAT 17:11  And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first
 come, and restore all things.

MAT 17:12  But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him
 not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the
 Son of man suffer of them.

MAT 17:13  Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the
 Baptist.

MAT 17:14  And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a
 certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,

MAT 17:15  Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for
 ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.

MAT 17:16  And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.

MAT 17:17  Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation,
 how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither
 to me.

MAT 17:18  And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the
 child was cured from that very hour.

MAT 17:19  Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we
 cast him out?

MAT 17:20  And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say
 unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this
 mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing
 shall be impossible unto you.

MAT 17:21  Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.

MAT 17:22  And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of
 man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:

MAT 17:23  And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again.
 And they were exceeding sorry.

MAT 17:24  And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute
 money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?

MAT 17:25  He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented
 him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth
 take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?

MAT 17:26  Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are
 the children free.

MAT 17:27  Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and
 cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast
 opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto
 them for me and thee.

MAT 18:1  At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the
 greatest in the kingdom of heaven?

MAT 18:2  And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst
 of them,

MAT 18:3  And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become
 as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.

MAT 18:4  Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the
 same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

MAT 18:5  And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth
 me.

MAT 18:6  But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me,
 it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that
 he were drowned in the depth of the sea.

MAT 18:7  Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that
 offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!

MAT 18:8  Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast
 them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed,
 rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.

MAT 18:9  And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it
 is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two
 eyes to be cast into hell fire.

MAT 18:10  Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say
 unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father
 which is in heaven.

MAT 18:11  For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.

MAT 18:12  How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be
 gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the
 mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?

MAT 18:13  And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth
 more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.

MAT 18:14  Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that
 one of these little ones should perish.

MAT 18:15  Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him
 his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained
 thy brother.

MAT 18:16  But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more,
 that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.

MAT 18:17  And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but
 if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and
 a publican.

MAT 18:18  Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be
 bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in
 heaven.

MAT 18:19  Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as
 touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my
 Father which is in heaven.

MAT 18:20  For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I
 in the midst of them.

MAT 18:21  Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin
 against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?

MAT 18:22  Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but,
 Until seventy times seven.

MAT 18:23  Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king,
 which would take account of his servants.

MAT 18:24  And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which
 owed him ten thousand talents.

MAT 18:25  But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be
 sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be
 made.

MAT 18:26  The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord,
 have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

MAT 18:27  Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed
 him, and forgave him the debt.

MAT 18:28  But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants,
 which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by
 the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.

MAT 18:29  And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him,
 saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

MAT 18:30  And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should
 pay the debt.

MAT 18:31  So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very
 sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.

MAT 18:32  Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou
 wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:

MAT 18:33  Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant,
 even as I had pity on thee?

MAT 18:34  And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he
 should pay all that was due unto him.

MAT 18:35  So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from
 your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.

MAT 19:1  And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he
 departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;

MAT 19:2  And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.

MAT 19:3  The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him,
 Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?

MAT 19:4  And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which
 made them at the beginning made them male and female,

MAT 19:5  And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and
 shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?

MAT 19:6  Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God
 hath joined together, let not man put asunder.

MAT 19:7  They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of
 divorcement, and to put her away?

MAT 19:8  He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts
 suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.

MAT 19:9  And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be
 for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso
 marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.

MAT 19:10  His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his
 wife, it is not good to marry.

MAT 19:11  But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they
 to whom it is given.

MAT 19:12  For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's
 womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there
 be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's
 sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.

MAT 19:13  Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put
 his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.

MAT 19:14  But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come
 unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.

MAT 19:15  And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.

MAT 19:16  And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good
 thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?

MAT 19:17  And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good
 but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the
 commandments.

MAT 19:18  He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou
 shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false
 witness,

MAT 19:19  Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour
 as thyself.

MAT 19:20  The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my
 youth up: what lack I yet?

MAT 19:21  Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou
 hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come
 and follow me.

MAT 19:22  But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful:
 for he had great possessions.

MAT 19:23  Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a
 rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.

MAT 19:24  And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the
 eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

MAT 19:25  When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying,
 Who then can be saved?

MAT 19:26  But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is
 impossible; but with God all things are possible.

MAT 19:27  Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken
 all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?

MAT 19:28  And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have
 followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne
 of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve
 tribes of Israel.

MAT 19:29  And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or
 father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall
 receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.

MAT 19:30  But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.

MAT 20:1  For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder,
 which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.

MAT 20:2  And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent
 them into his vineyard.

MAT 20:3  And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle
 in the marketplace,

MAT 20:4  And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is
 right I will give you. And they went their way.

MAT 20:5  Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.

MAT 20:6  And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing
 idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?

MAT 20:7  They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them,
 Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.

MAT 20:8  So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his
 steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the
 last unto the first.

MAT 20:9  And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they
 received every man a penny.

MAT 20:10  But when the first came, they supposed that they should have
 received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.

MAT 20:11  And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman
 of the house,

MAT 20:12  Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made
 them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.

MAT 20:13  But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong:
 didst not thou agree with me for a penny?

MAT 20:14  Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even
 as unto thee.

MAT 20:15  Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine
 eye evil, because I am good?

MAT 20:16  So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called,
 but few chosen.

MAT 20:17  And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart
 in the way, and said unto them,

MAT 20:18  Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed
 unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to
 death,

MAT 20:19  And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and
 to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.

MAT 20:20  Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons,
 worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.

MAT 20:21  And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that
 these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the
 left, in thy kingdom.

MAT 20:22  But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to
 drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism
 that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.

MAT 20:23  And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be
 baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right
 hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for
 whom it is prepared of my Father.

MAT 20:24  And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against
 the two brethren.

MAT 20:25  But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes
 of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise
 authority upon them.

MAT 20:26  But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among
 you, let him be your minister;

MAT 20:27  And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:

MAT 20:28  Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
 minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

MAT 20:29  And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.

MAT 20:30  And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard
 that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son
 of David.

MAT 20:31  And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their
 peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of
 David.

MAT 20:32  And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that
 I shall do unto you?

MAT 20:33  They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.

MAT 20:34  So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and
 immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.

MAT 21:1  And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage,
 unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,

MAT 21:2  Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and
 straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and
 bring them unto me.

MAT 21:3  And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need
 of them; and straightway he will send them.

MAT 21:4  All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the
 prophet, saying,

MAT 21:5  Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee,
 meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.

MAT 21:6  And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,

MAT 21:7  And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and
 they set him thereon.

MAT 21:8  And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others
 cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way.

MAT 21:9  And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried,
 saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name
 of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.

MAT 21:10  And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying,
 Who is this?

MAT 21:11  And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of
 Galilee.

MAT 21:12  And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that
 sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers,
 and the seats of them that sold doves,

MAT 21:13  And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the
 house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.

MAT 21:14  And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed
 them.

MAT 21:15  And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that
 he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son
 of David; they were sore displeased,

MAT 21:16  And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto
 them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou
 hast perfected praise?

MAT 21:17  And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he
 lodged there.

MAT 21:18  Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.

MAT 21:19  And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found
 nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee
 henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.

MAT 21:20  And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is
 the fig tree withered away!

MAT 21:21  Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have
 faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig
 tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be
 thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.

MAT 21:22  And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye
 shall receive.

MAT 21:23  And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the
 elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what
 authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?

MAT 21:24  And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one
 thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I
 do these things.

MAT 21:25  The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they
 reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say
 unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?

MAT 21:26  But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John
 as a prophet.

MAT 21:27  And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto
 them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.

MAT 21:28  But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the
 first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.

MAT 21:29  He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and
 went.

MAT 21:30  And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and
 said, I go, sir: and went not.

MAT 21:31  Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him,
 The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans
 and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.

MAT 21:32  For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed
 him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had
 seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.

MAT 21:33  Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted
 a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and
 built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:

MAT 21:34  And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants
 to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.

MAT 21:35  And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed
 another, and stoned another.

MAT 21:36  Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto
 them likewise.

MAT 21:37  But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will
 reverence my son.

MAT 21:38  But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves,
 This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.

MAT 21:39  And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.

MAT 21:40  When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto
 those husbandmen?

MAT 21:41  They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and
 will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the
 fruits in their seasons.

MAT 21:42  Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The
 stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner:
 this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?

MAT 21:43  Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from
 you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.

MAT 21:44  And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on
 whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

MAT 21:45  And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables,
 they perceived that he spake of them.

MAT 21:46  But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude,
 because they took him for a prophet.

MAT 22:1  And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,

MAT 22:2  The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a
 marriage for his son,

MAT 22:3  And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the
 wedding: and they would not come.

MAT 22:4  Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are
 bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are
 killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.

MAT 22:5  But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm,
 another to his merchandise:

MAT 22:6  And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and
 slew them.

MAT 22:7  But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his
 armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.

MAT 22:8  Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which
 were bidden were not worthy.

MAT 22:9  Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid
 to the marriage.

MAT 22:10  So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together
 all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished
 with guests.

MAT 22:11  And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man
 which had not on a wedding garment:

MAT 22:12  And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having
 a wedding garment? And he was speechless.

MAT 22:13  Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take
 him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and
 gnashing of teeth.

MAT 22:14  For many are called, but few are chosen.

MAT 22:15  Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle
 him in his talk.

MAT 22:16  And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians,
 saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in
 truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of
 men.

MAT 22:17  Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute
 unto Caesar, or not?

MAT 22:18  But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye
 hypocrites?

MAT 22:19  Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.

MAT 22:20  And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?

MAT 22:21  They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render
 therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things
 that are God's.

MAT 22:22  When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and
 went their way.

MAT 22:23  The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no
 resurrection, and asked him,

MAT 22:24  Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his
 brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

MAT 22:25  Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had
 married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his
 brother:

MAT 22:26  Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.

MAT 22:27  And last of all the woman died also.

MAT 22:28  Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven?
 for they all had her.

MAT 22:29  Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the
 scriptures, nor the power of God.

MAT 22:30  For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in
 marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.

MAT 22:31  But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that
 which was spoken unto you by God, saying,

MAT 22:32  I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?
 God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

MAT 22:33  And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his
 doctrine.

MAT 22:34  But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to
 silence, they were gathered together.

MAT 22:35  Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting
 him, and saying,

MAT 22:36  Master, which is the great commandment in the law?

MAT 22:37  Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
 heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.

MAT 22:38  This is the first and great commandment.

MAT 22:39  And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
 thyself.

MAT 22:40  On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

MAT 22:41  While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,

MAT 22:42  Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him,
 The son of David.

MAT 22:43  He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord,
 saying,

MAT 22:44  The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make
 thine enemies thy footstool?

MAT 22:45  If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?

MAT 22:46  And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from
 that day forth ask him any more questions.

MAT 23:1  Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,

MAT 23:2  Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:

MAT 23:3  All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do;
 but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.

MAT 23:4  For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on
 men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their
 fingers.

MAT 23:5  But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad
 their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,

MAT 23:6  And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the
 synagogues,

MAT 23:7  And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.

MAT 23:8  But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and
 all ye are brethren.

MAT 23:9  And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father,
 which is in heaven.

MAT 23:10  Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.

MAT 23:11  But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.

MAT 23:12  And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall
 humble himself shall be exalted.

MAT 23:13  But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up
 the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither
 suffer ye them that are entering to go in.

MAT 23:14  Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour
 widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall
 receive the greater damnation.

MAT 23:15  Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea
 and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more
 the child of hell than yourselves.

MAT 23:16  Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by
 the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the
 temple, he is a debtor!

MAT 23:17  Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple
 that sanctifieth the gold?

MAT 23:18  And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but
 whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.

MAT 23:19  Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar
 that sanctifieth the gift?

MAT 23:20  Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all
 things thereon.

MAT 23:21  And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that
 dwelleth therein.

MAT 23:22  And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of
 God, and by him that sitteth thereon.

MAT 23:23  Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of
 mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law,
 judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the
 other undone.

MAT 23:24  Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.

MAT 23:25  Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean
 the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of
 extortion and excess.

MAT 23:26  Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and
 platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.

MAT 23:27  Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like
 unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within
 full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.

MAT 23:28  Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye
 are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

MAT 23:29  Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build
 the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,

MAT 23:30  And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not
 have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.

MAT 23:31  Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children
 of them which killed the prophets.

MAT 23:32  Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.

MAT 23:33  Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the
 damnation of hell?

MAT 23:34  Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and
 scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall
 ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:

MAT 23:35  That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth,
 from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of
 Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.

MAT 23:36  Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this
 generation.

MAT 23:37  O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest
 them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children
 together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would
 not!

MAT 23:38  Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.

MAT 23:39  For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall
 say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

MAT 24:1  And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples
 came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.

MAT 24:2  And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say
 unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not
 be thrown down.

MAT 24:3  And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him
 privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the
 sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?

MAT 24:4  And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive
 you.

MAT 24:5  For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall
 deceive many.

MAT 24:6  And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not
 troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.

MAT 24:7  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
 and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers
 places.

MAT 24:8  All these are the beginning of sorrows.

MAT 24:9  Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you:
 and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.

MAT 24:10  And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and
 shall hate one another.

MAT 24:11  And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.

MAT 24:12  And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.

MAT 24:13  But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.

MAT 24:14  And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world
 for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.

MAT 24:15  When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of
 by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him
 understand:)

MAT 24:16  Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:

MAT 24:17  Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out
 of his house:

MAT 24:18  Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his
 clothes.

MAT 24:19  And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in
 those days!

MAT 24:20  But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the
 sabbath day:

MAT 24:21  For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the
 beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.

MAT 24:22  And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be
 saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.

MAT 24:23  Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there;
 believe it not.

MAT 24:24  For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall
 shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall
 deceive the very elect.

MAT 24:25  Behold, I have told you before.

MAT 24:26  Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert;
 go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.

MAT 24:27  For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto
 the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

MAT 24:28  For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered
 together.

MAT 24:29  Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be
 darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall
 from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:

MAT 24:30  And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then
 shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man
 coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.

MAT 24:31  And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and
 they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of
 heaven to the other.

MAT 24:32  Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet
 tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:

MAT 24:33  So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is
 near, even at the doors.

MAT 24:34  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all
 these things be fulfilled.

MAT 24:35  Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.

MAT 24:36  But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of
 heaven, but my Father only.

MAT 24:37  But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of
 man be.

MAT 24:38  For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and
 drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered
 into the ark,

MAT 24:39  And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall
 also the coming of the Son of man be.

MAT 24:40  Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the
 other left.

MAT 24:41  Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and
 the other left.

MAT 24:42  Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.

MAT 24:43  But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what
 watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have
 suffered his house to be broken up.

MAT 24:44  Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the
 Son of man cometh.

MAT 24:45  Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made
 ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?

MAT 24:46  Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so
 doing.

MAT 24:47  Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his
 goods.

MAT 24:48  But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord
 delayeth his coming;

MAT 24:49  And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink
 with the drunken;

MAT 24:50  The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for
 him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,

MAT 24:51  And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the
 hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

MAT 25:1  Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which
 took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.

MAT 25:2  And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.

MAT 25:3  They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:

MAT 25:4  But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.

MAT 25:5  While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.

MAT 25:6  And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh;
 go ye out to meet him.

MAT 25:7  Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.

MAT 25:8  And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our
 lamps are gone out.

MAT 25:9  But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for
 us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.

MAT 25:10  And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were
 ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.

MAT 25:11  Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to
 us.

MAT 25:12  But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.

MAT 25:13  Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein
 the Son of man cometh.

MAT 25:14  For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country,
 who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.

MAT 25:15  And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another
 one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his
 journey.

MAT 25:16  Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the
 same, and made them other five talents.

MAT 25:17  And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.

MAT 25:18  But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid
 his lord's money.

MAT 25:19  After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth
 with them.

MAT 25:20  And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five
 talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have
 gained beside them five talents more.

MAT 25:21  His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant:
 thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many
 things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

MAT 25:22  He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou
 deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents
 beside them.

MAT 25:23  His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou
 hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many
 things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.

MAT 25:24  Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I
 knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and
 gathering where thou hast not strawed:

MAT 25:25  And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth:
 lo, there thou hast that is thine.

MAT 25:26  His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful
 servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have
 not strawed:

MAT 25:27  Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and
 then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.

MAT 25:28  Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath
 ten talents.

MAT 25:29  For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have
 abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he
 hath.

MAT 25:30  And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there
 shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

MAT 25:31  When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels
 with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:

MAT 25:32  And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate
 them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:

MAT 25:33  And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the
 left.

MAT 25:34  Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye
 blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
 foundation of the world:

MAT 25:35  For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye
 gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:

MAT 25:36  Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in
 prison, and ye came unto me.

MAT 25:37  Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee
 an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?

MAT 25:38  When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed
 thee?

MAT 25:39  Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?

MAT 25:40  And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you,
 Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye
 have done it unto me.

MAT 25:41  Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me,
 ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:

MAT 25:42  For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye
 gave me no drink:

MAT 25:43  I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me
 not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.

MAT 25:44  Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an
 hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did
 not minister unto thee?

MAT 25:45  Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch
 as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.

MAT 25:46  And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the
 righteous into life eternal.

MAT 26:1  And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he
 said unto his disciples,

MAT 26:2  Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son
 of man is betrayed to be crucified.

MAT 26:3  Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the
 elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called
 Caiaphas,

MAT 26:4  And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.

MAT 26:5  But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among
 the people.

MAT 26:6  Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,

MAT 26:7  There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious
 ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.

MAT 26:8  But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what
 purpose is this waste?

MAT 26:9  For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the
 poor.

MAT 26:10  When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the
 woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.

MAT 26:11  For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.

MAT 26:12  For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for
 my burial.

MAT 26:13  Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached
 in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told
 for a memorial of her.

MAT 26:14  Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief
 priests,

MAT 26:15  And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him
 unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.

MAT 26:16  And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.

MAT 26:17  Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples
 came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to
 eat the passover?

MAT 26:18  And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The
 Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with
 my disciples.

MAT 26:19  And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made
 ready the passover.

MAT 26:20  Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.

MAT 26:21  And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you
 shall betray me.

MAT 26:22  And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to
 say unto him, Lord, is it I?

MAT 26:23  And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the
 dish, the same shall betray me.

MAT 26:24  The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man
 by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had
 not been born.

MAT 26:25  Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I?
 He said unto him, Thou hast said.

MAT 26:26  And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake
 it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.

MAT 26:27  And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying,
 Drink ye all of it;

MAT 26:28  For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many
 for the remission of sins.

MAT 26:29  But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the
 vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.

MAT 26:30  And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of
 Olives.

MAT 26:31  Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me
 this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep
 of the flock shall be scattered abroad.

MAT 26:32  But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.

MAT 26:33  Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended
 because of thee, yet will I never be offended.

MAT 26:34  Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before
 the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.

MAT 26:35  Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not
 deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.

MAT 26:36  Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and
 saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.

MAT 26:37  And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to
 be sorrowful and very heavy.

MAT 26:38  Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto
 death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.

MAT 26:39  And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed,
 saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:
 nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.

MAT 26:40  And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith
 unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?

MAT 26:41  Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed
 is willing, but the flesh is weak.

MAT 26:42  He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father,
 if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.

MAT 26:43  And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.

MAT 26:44  And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time,
 saying the same words.

MAT 26:45  Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on
 now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is
 betrayed into the hands of sinners.

MAT 26:46  Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.

MAT 26:47  And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with
 him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and
 elders of the people.

MAT 26:48  Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I
 shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.

MAT 26:49  And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed
 him.

MAT 26:50  And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came
 they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.

MAT 26:51  And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his
 hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and
 smote off his ear.

MAT 26:52  Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for
 all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.

MAT 26:53  Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall
 presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?

MAT 26:54  But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must
 be?

MAT 26:55  In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as
 against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you
 teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.

MAT 26:56  But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be
 fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.

MAT 26:57  And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the
 high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.

MAT 26:58  But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and
 went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.

MAT 26:59  Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false
 witness against Jesus, to put him to death;

MAT 26:60  But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found
 they none. At the last came two false witnesses,

MAT 26:61  And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of
 God, and to build it in three days.

MAT 26:62  And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou
 nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?

MAT 26:63  But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto
 him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the
 Christ, the Son of God.

MAT 26:64  Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you,
 Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and
 coming in the clouds of heaven.

MAT 26:65  Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken
 blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard
 his blasphemy.

MAT 26:66  What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.

MAT 26:67  Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote
 him with the palms of their hands,

MAT 26:68  Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?

MAT 26:69  Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him,
 saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.

MAT 26:70  But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.

MAT 26:71  And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and
 said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.

MAT 26:72  And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.

MAT 26:73  And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to
 Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.

MAT 26:74  Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And
 immediately the cock crew.

MAT 26:75  And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before
 the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.

MAT 27:1  When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the
 people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:

MAT 27:2  And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to
 Pontius Pilate the governor.

MAT 27:3  Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was
 condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver
 to the chief priests and elders,

MAT 27:4  Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And
 they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.

MAT 27:5  And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and
 departed, and went and hanged himself.

MAT 27:6  And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not
 lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.

MAT 27:7  And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to
 bury strangers in.

MAT 27:8  Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.

MAT 27:9  Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,
 saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was
 valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;

MAT 27:10  And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.

MAT 27:11  And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him,
 saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.

MAT 27:12  And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered
 nothing.

MAT 27:13  Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they
 witness against thee?

MAT 27:14  And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor
 marvelled greatly.

MAT 27:15  Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a
 prisoner, whom they would.

MAT 27:16  And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.

MAT 27:17  Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them,
 Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called
 Christ?

MAT 27:18  For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.

MAT 27:19  When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him,
 saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many
 things this day in a dream because of him.

MAT 27:20  But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they
 should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.

MAT 27:21  The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will
 ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.

MAT 27:22  Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is
 called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.

MAT 27:23  And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried
 out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.

MAT 27:24  When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a
 tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude,
 saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.

MAT 27:25  Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on
 our children.

MAT 27:26  Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus,
 he delivered him to be crucified.

MAT 27:27  Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common
 hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.

MAT 27:28  And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.

MAT 27:29  And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his
 head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and
 mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!

MAT 27:30  And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the
 head.

MAT 27:31  And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from
 him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.

MAT 27:32  And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him
 they compelled to bear his cross.

MAT 27:33  And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to
 say, a place of a skull,

MAT 27:34  They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had
 tasted thereof, he would not drink.

MAT 27:35  And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that
 it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my
 garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.

MAT 27:36  And sitting down they watched him there;

MAT 27:37  And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE
 KING OF THE JEWS.

MAT 27:38  Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right
 hand, and another on the left.

MAT 27:39  And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,

MAT 27:40  And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in
 three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the
 cross.

MAT 27:41  Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and
 elders, said,

MAT 27:42  He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of
 Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.

MAT 27:43  He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for
 he said, I am the Son of God.

MAT 27:44  The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in
 his teeth.

MAT 27:45  Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto
 the ninth hour.

MAT 27:46  And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli,
 Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
 me?

MAT 27:47  Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man
 calleth for Elias.

MAT 27:48  And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it
 with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.

MAT 27:49  The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save
 him.

MAT 27:50  Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the
 ghost.

MAT 27:51  And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top
 to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;

MAT 27:52  And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which
 slept arose,

MAT 27:53  And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the
 holy city, and appeared unto many.

MAT 27:54  Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus,
 saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly,
 saying, Truly this was the Son of God.

MAT 27:55  And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus
 from Galilee, ministering unto him:

MAT 27:56  Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and
 Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.

MAT 27:57  When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named
 Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:

MAT 27:58  He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate
 commanded the body to be delivered.

MAT 27:59  And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen
 cloth,

MAT 27:60  And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock:
 and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.

MAT 27:61  And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over
 against the sepulchre.

MAT 27:62  Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the
 chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,

MAT 27:63  Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet
 alive, After three days I will rise again.

MAT 27:64  Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third
 day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the
 people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the
 first.

MAT 27:65  Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure
 as ye can.

MAT 27:66  So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and
 setting a watch.

MAT 28:1  In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day
 of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.

MAT 28:2  And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord
 descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and
 sat upon it.

MAT 28:3  His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:

MAT 28:4  And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.

MAT 28:5  And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I
 know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.

MAT 28:6  He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place
 where the Lord lay.

MAT 28:7  And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the
 dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him:
 lo, I have told you.

MAT 28:8  And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy;
 and did run to bring his disciples word.

MAT 28:9  And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them,
 saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.

MAT 28:10  Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that
 they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.

MAT 28:11  Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the
 city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.

MAT 28:12  And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken
 counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,

MAT 28:13  Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away
 while we slept.

MAT 28:14  And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and
 secure you.

MAT 28:15  So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying
 is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.

MAT 28:16  Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain
 where Jesus had appointed them.

MAT 28:17  And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.

MAT 28:18  And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto
 me in heaven and in earth.

MAT 28:19  Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name
 of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

MAT 28:20  Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you:
 and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

ROM 1:1  Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated
 unto the gospel of God,

ROM 1:2  (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)

ROM 1:3  Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed
 of David according to the flesh;

ROM 1:4  And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit
 of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:

ROM 1:5  By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the
 faith among all nations, for his name:

ROM 1:6  Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:

ROM 1:7  To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to
 you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

ROM 1:8  First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your
 faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.

ROM 1:9  For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of
 his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;

ROM 1:10  Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a
 prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.

ROM 1:11  For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual
 gift, to the end ye may be established;

ROM 1:12  That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual
 faith both of you and me.

ROM 1:13  Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I
 purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some
 fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.

ROM 1:14  I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the
 wise, and to the unwise.

ROM 1:15  So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that
 are at Rome also.

ROM 1:16  For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of
 God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also
 to the Greek.

ROM 1:17  For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith:
 as it is written, The just shall live by faith.

ROM 1:18  For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness
 and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;

ROM 1:19  Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God
 hath shewed it unto them.

ROM 1:20  For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are
 clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal
 power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:

ROM 1:21  Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God,
 neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their
 foolish heart was darkened.

ROM 1:22  Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,

ROM 1:23  And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made
 like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping
 things.

ROM 1:24  Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts
 of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:

ROM 1:25  Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served
 the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.

ROM 1:26  For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their
 women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:

ROM 1:27  And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman,
 burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is
 unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which
 was meet.

ROM 1:28  And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God
 gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not
 convenient;

ROM 1:29  Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness,
 covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity;
 whisperers,

ROM 1:30  Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of
 evil things, disobedient to parents,

ROM 1:31  Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection,
 implacable, unmerciful:

ROM 1:32  Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things
 are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do
 them.

ROM 2:1  Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that
 judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou
 that judgest doest the same things.

ROM 2:2  But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against
 them which commit such things.

ROM 2:3  And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things,
 and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?

ROM 2:4  Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and
 longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to
 repentance?

ROM 2:5  But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself
 wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of
 God;

ROM 2:6  Who will render to every man according to his deeds:

ROM 2:7  To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and
 honour and immortality, eternal life:

ROM 2:8  But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but
 obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,

ROM 2:9  Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil,
 of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;

ROM 2:10  But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the
 Jew first, and also to the Gentile:

ROM 2:11  For there is no respect of persons with God.

ROM 2:12  For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law:
 and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;

ROM 2:13  (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers
 of the law shall be justified.

ROM 2:14  For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the
 things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto
 themselves:

ROM 2:15  Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their
 conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing
 or else excusing one another;)

ROM 2:16  In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ
 according to my gospel.

ROM 2:17  Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy
 boast of God,

ROM 2:18  And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more
 excellent, being instructed out of the law;

ROM 2:19  And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light
 of them which are in darkness,

ROM 2:20  An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form
 of knowledge and of the truth in the law.

ROM 2:21  Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself?
 thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?

ROM 2:22  Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit
 adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?

ROM 2:23  Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law
 dishonourest thou God?

ROM 2:24  For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as
 it is written.

ROM 2:25  For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou
 be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.

ROM 2:26  Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law,
 shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?

ROM 2:27  And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the
 law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?

ROM 2:28  For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that
 circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:

ROM 2:29  But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that
 of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of
 men, but of God.

ROM 3:1  What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of
 circumcision?

ROM 3:2  Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the
 oracles of God.

ROM 3:3  For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith
 of God without effect?

ROM 3:4  God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is
 written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest
 overcome when thou art judged.

ROM 3:5  But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what
 shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)

ROM 3:6  God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?

ROM 3:7  For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his
 glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?

ROM 3:8  And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm
 that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.

ROM 3:9  What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before
 proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;

ROM 3:10  As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:

ROM 3:11  There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after
 God.

ROM 3:12  They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
 unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

ROM 3:13  Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used
 deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:

ROM 3:14  Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:

ROM 3:15  Their feet are swift to shed blood:

ROM 3:16  Destruction and misery are in their ways:

ROM 3:17  And the way of peace have they not known:

ROM 3:18  There is no fear of God before their eyes.

ROM 3:19  Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them
 who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may
 become guilty before God.

ROM 3:20  Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified
 in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.

ROM 3:21  But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being
 witnessed by the law and the prophets;

ROM 3:22  Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto
 all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:

ROM 3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

ROM 3:24  Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in
 Christ Jesus:

ROM 3:25  Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his
 blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past,
 through the forbearance of God;

ROM 3:26  To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be
 just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.

ROM 3:27  Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay:
 but by the law of faith.

ROM 3:28  Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the
 deeds of the law.

ROM 3:29  Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes,
 of the Gentiles also:

ROM 3:30  Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by
 faith, and uncircumcision through faith.

ROM 3:31  Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we
 establish the law.

ROM 4:1  What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the
 flesh, hath found?

ROM 4:2  For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but
 not before God.

ROM 4:3  For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted
 unto him for righteousness.

ROM 4:4  Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of
 debt.

ROM 4:5  But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the
 ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.

ROM 4:6  Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom
 God imputeth righteousness without works,

ROM 4:7  Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins
 are covered.

ROM 4:8  Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.

ROM 4:9  Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the
 uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for
 righteousness.

ROM 4:10  How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in
 uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.

ROM 4:11  And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness
 of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the
 father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that
 righteousness might be imputed unto them also:

ROM 4:12  And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the
 circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father
 Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.

ROM 4:13  For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to
 Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of
 faith.

ROM 4:14  For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and
 the promise made of none effect:

ROM 4:15  Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no
 transgression.

ROM 4:16  Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the
 promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law,
 but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us
 all,

ROM 4:17  (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before
 him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those
 things which be not as though they were.

ROM 4:18  Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of
 many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.

ROM 4:19  And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead,
 when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's
 womb:

ROM 4:20  He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was
 strong in faith, giving glory to God;

ROM 4:21  And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able
 also to perform.

ROM 4:22  And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.

ROM 4:23  Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to
 him;

ROM 4:24  But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him
 that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;

ROM 4:25  Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our
 justification.

ROM 5:1  Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
 Lord Jesus Christ:

ROM 5:2  By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we
 stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.

ROM 5:3  And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that
 tribulation worketh patience;

ROM 5:4  And patience, experience; and experience, hope:

ROM 5:5  And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in
 our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.

ROM 5:6  For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the
 ungodly.

ROM 5:7  For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a
 good man some would even dare to die.

ROM 5:8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet
 sinners, Christ died for us.

ROM 5:9  Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved
 from wrath through him.

ROM 5:10  For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death
 of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.

ROM 5:11  And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus
 Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.

ROM 5:12  Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by
 sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:

ROM 5:13  (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when
 there is no law.

ROM 5:14  Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that
 had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the
 figure of him that was to come.

ROM 5:15  But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the
 offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by
 grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.

ROM 5:16  And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the
 judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences
 unto justification.

ROM 5:17  For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they
 which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign
 in life by one, Jesus Christ.)

ROM 5:18  Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to
 condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all
 men unto justification of life.

ROM 5:19  For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the
 obedience of one shall many be made righteous.

ROM 5:20  Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where
 sin abounded, grace did much more abound:

ROM 5:21  That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign
 through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.

ROM 6:1  What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may
 abound?

ROM 6:2  God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer
 therein?

ROM 6:3  Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ
 were baptized into his death?

ROM 6:4  Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as
 Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we
 also should walk in newness of life.

ROM 6:5  For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we
 shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:

ROM 6:6  Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of
 sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.

ROM 6:7  For he that is dead is freed from sin.

ROM 6:8  Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with
 him:

ROM 6:9  Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death
 hath no more dominion over him.

ROM 6:10  For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he
 liveth unto God.

ROM 6:11  Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but
 alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

ROM 6:12  Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey
 it in the lusts thereof.

ROM 6:13  Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto
 sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the
 dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.

ROM 6:14  For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the
 law, but under grace.

ROM 6:15  What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under
 grace? God forbid.

ROM 6:16  Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his
 servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience
 unto righteousness?

ROM 6:17  But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have
 obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.

ROM 6:18  Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of
 righteousness.

ROM 6:19  I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your
 flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to
 iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to
 righteousness unto holiness.

ROM 6:20  For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from
 righteousness.

ROM 6:21  What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?
 for the end of those things is death.

ROM 6:22  But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have
 your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.

ROM 6:23  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life
 through Jesus Christ our Lord.

ROM 7:1  Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how
 that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?

ROM 7:2  For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband
 so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law
 of her husband.

ROM 7:3  So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man,
 she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free
 from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another
 man.

ROM 7:4  Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body
 of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised
 from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.

ROM 7:5  For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the
 law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.

ROM 7:6  But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were
 held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness
 of the letter.

ROM 7:7  What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not
 known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said,
 Thou shalt not covet.

ROM 7:8  But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner
 of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.

ROM 7:9  For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came,
 sin revived, and I died.

ROM 7:10  And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto
 death.

ROM 7:11  For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it
 slew me.

ROM 7:12  Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and
 good.

ROM 7:13  Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin,
 that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin
 by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.

ROM 7:14  For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under
 sin.

ROM 7:15  For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but
 what I hate, that do I.

ROM 7:16  If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it
 is good.

ROM 7:17  Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.

ROM 7:18  For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing:
 for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find
 not.

ROM 7:19  For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not,
 that I do.

ROM 7:20  Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin
 that dwelleth in me.

ROM 7:21  I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with
 me.

ROM 7:22  For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:

ROM 7:23  But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my
 mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my
 members.

ROM 7:24  O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this
 death?

ROM 7:25  I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I
 myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.

ROM 8:1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ
 Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

ROM 8:2  For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free
 from the law of sin and death.

ROM 8:3  For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh,
 God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,
 condemned sin in the flesh:

ROM 8:4  That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk
 not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

ROM 8:5  For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but
 they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.

ROM 8:6  For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is
 life and peace.

ROM 8:7  Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject
 to the law of God, neither indeed can be.

ROM 8:8  So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.

ROM 8:9  But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the
 Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he
 is none of his.

ROM 8:10  And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the
 Spirit is life because of righteousness.

ROM 8:11  But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
 you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal
 bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.

ROM 8:12  Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after
 the flesh.

ROM 8:13  For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the
 Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.

ROM 8:14  For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of
 God.

ROM 8:15  For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye
 have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.

ROM 8:16  The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the
 children of God:

ROM 8:17  And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with
 Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified
 together.

ROM 8:18  For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy
 to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.

ROM 8:19  For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
 manifestation of the sons of God.

ROM 8:20  For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by
 reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,

ROM 8:21  Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage
 of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.

ROM 8:22  For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain
 together until now.

ROM 8:23  And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits
 of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the
 adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.

ROM 8:24  For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what
 a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?

ROM 8:25  But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for
 it.

ROM 8:26  Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not
 what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh
 intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.

ROM 8:27  And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the
 Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will
 of God.

ROM 8:28  And we know that all things work together for good to them that love
 God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.

ROM 8:29  For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed
 to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.

ROM 8:30  Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he
 called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also
 glorified.

ROM 8:31  What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be
 against us?

ROM 8:32  He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how
 shall he not with him also freely give us all things?

ROM 8:33  Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that
 justifieth.

ROM 8:34  Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that
 is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh
 intercession for us.

ROM 8:35  Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or
 distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?

ROM 8:36  As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are
 accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

ROM 8:37  Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that
 loved us.

ROM 8:38  For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
 principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,

ROM 8:39  Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to
 separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

ROM 9:1  I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me
 witness in the Holy Ghost,

ROM 9:2  That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.

ROM 9:3  For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my
 brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:

ROM 9:4  Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the
 glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of
 God, and the promises;

ROM 9:5  Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ
 came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.

ROM 9:6  Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not
 all Israel, which are of Israel:

ROM 9:7  Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children:
 but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.

ROM 9:8  That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the
 children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.

ROM 9:9  For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah
 shall have a son.

ROM 9:10  And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even
 by our father Isaac;

ROM 9:11  (For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or
 evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of
 works, but of him that calleth;)

ROM 9:12  It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.

ROM 9:13  As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.

ROM 9:14  What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God
 forbid.

ROM 9:15  For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have
 mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.

ROM 9:16  So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but
 of God that sheweth mercy.

ROM 9:17  For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have
 I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might
 be declared throughout all the earth.

ROM 9:18  Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will
 he hardeneth.

ROM 9:19  Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath
 resisted his will?

ROM 9:20  Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the
 thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?

ROM 9:21  Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one
 vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?

ROM 9:22  What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known,
 endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:

ROM 9:23  And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels
 of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,

ROM 9:24  Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the
 Gentiles?

ROM 9:25  As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not
 my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.

ROM 9:26  And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto
 them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the
 living God.

ROM 9:27  Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the
 children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:

ROM 9:28  For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness:
 because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.

ROM 9:29  And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a
 seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.

ROM 9:30  What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after
 righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which
 is of faith.

ROM 9:31  But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not
 attained to the law of righteousness.

ROM 9:32  Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the
 works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;

ROM 9:33  As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of
 offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.

ROM 10:1  Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that
 they might be saved.

ROM 10:2  For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not
 according to knowledge.

ROM 10:3  For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to
 establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the
 righteousness of God.

ROM 10:4  For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that
 believeth.

ROM 10:5  For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the
 man which doeth those things shall live by them.

ROM 10:6  But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say
 not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ
 down from above:)

ROM 10:7  Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ
 again from the dead.)

ROM 10:8  But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in
 thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;

ROM 10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt
 believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be
 saved.

ROM 10:10  For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the
 mouth confession is made unto salvation.

ROM 10:11  For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be
 ashamed.

ROM 10:12  For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the
 same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.

ROM 10:13  For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

ROM 10:14  How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and
 how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they
 hear without a preacher?

ROM 10:15  And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written,
 How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring
 glad tidings of good things!

ROM 10:16  But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who
 hath believed our report?

ROM 10:17  So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

ROM 10:18  But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into
 all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.

ROM 10:19  But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke
 you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will
 anger you.

ROM 10:20  But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought
 me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.

ROM 10:21  But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands
 unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.

ROM 11:1  I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am
 an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.

ROM 11:2  God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what
 the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against
 Israel saying,

ROM 11:3  Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars;
 and I am left alone, and they seek my life.

ROM 11:4  But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself
 seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.

ROM 11:5  Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according
 to the election of grace.

ROM 11:6  And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no
 more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work
 is no more work.

ROM 11:7  What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but
 the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.

ROM 11:8  (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of
 slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;)
 unto this day.

ROM 11:9  And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a
 stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:

ROM 11:10  Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down
 their back alway.

ROM 11:11  I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid:
 but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to
 provoke them to jealousy.

ROM 11:12  Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the
 diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?

ROM 11:13  For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the
 Gentiles, I magnify mine office:

ROM 11:14  If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my
 flesh, and might save some of them.

ROM 11:15  For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world,
 what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?

ROM 11:16  For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the
 root be holy, so are the branches.

ROM 11:17  And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild
 olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root
 and fatness of the olive tree;

ROM 11:18  Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not
 the root, but the root thee.

ROM 11:19  Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be
 graffed in.

ROM 11:20  Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by
 faith. Be not highminded, but fear:

ROM 11:21  For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also
 spare not thee.

ROM 11:22  Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which
 fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness:
 otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.

ROM 11:23  And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed
 in: for God is able to graff them in again.

ROM 11:24  For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by
 nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much
 more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own
 olive tree?

ROM 11:25  For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this
 mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part
 is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.

ROM 11:26  And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come
 out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:

ROM 11:27  For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their
 sins.

ROM 11:28  As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as
 touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes.

ROM 11:29  For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.

ROM 11:30  For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained
 mercy through their unbelief:

ROM 11:31  Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy
 they also may obtain mercy.

ROM 11:32  For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have
 mercy upon all.

ROM 11:33  O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
 how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!

ROM 11:34  For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his
 counsellor?

ROM 11:35  Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him
 again?

ROM 11:36  For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be
 glory for ever. Amen.

ROM 12:1  I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye
 present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is
 your reasonable service.

ROM 12:2  And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the
 renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and
 acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

ROM 12:3  For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is
 among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to
 think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.

ROM 12:4  For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the
 same office:

ROM 12:5  So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one
 of another.

ROM 12:6  Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to
 us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;

ROM 12:7  Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on
 teaching;

ROM 12:8  Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it
 with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with
 cheerfulness.

ROM 12:9  Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave
 to that which is good.

ROM 12:10  Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour
 preferring one another;

ROM 12:11  Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;

ROM 12:12  Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in
 prayer;

ROM 12:13  Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.

ROM 12:14  Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.

ROM 12:15  Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.

ROM 12:16  Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but
 condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.

ROM 12:17  Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the
 sight of all men.

ROM 12:18  If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all
 men.

ROM 12:19  Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto
 wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.

ROM 12:20  Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him
 drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.

ROM 12:21  Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

ROM 13:1  Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no
 power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.

ROM 13:2  Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of
 God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.

ROM 13:3  For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou
 then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have
 praise of the same:

ROM 13:4  For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that
 which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the
 minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.

ROM 13:5  Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for
 conscience sake.

ROM 13:6  For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers,
 attending continually upon this very thing.

ROM 13:7  Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due;
 custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.

ROM 13:8  Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth
 another hath fulfilled the law.

ROM 13:9  For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou
 shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and
 if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying,
 namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

ROM 13:10  Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the
 fulfilling of the law.

ROM 13:11  And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of
 sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.

ROM 13:12  The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast
 off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.

ROM 13:13  Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness,
 not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.

ROM 13:14  But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the
 flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.

ROM 14:1  Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful
 disputations.

ROM 14:2  For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak,
 eateth herbs.

ROM 14:3  Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him
 which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.

ROM 14:4  Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he
 standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him
 stand.

ROM 14:5  One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day
 alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.

ROM 14:6  He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that
 regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth,
 eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the
 Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.

ROM 14:7  For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.

ROM 14:8  For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we
 die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.

ROM 14:9  For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he
 might be Lord both of the dead and living.

ROM 14:10  But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought
 thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.

ROM 14:11  For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow
 to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.

ROM 14:12  So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.

ROM 14:13  Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this
 rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his
 brother's way.

ROM 14:14  I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing
 unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him
 it is unclean.

ROM 14:15  But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not
 charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.

ROM 14:16  Let not then your good be evil spoken of:

ROM 14:17  For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and
 peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

ROM 14:18  For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and
 approved of men.

ROM 14:19  Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and
 things wherewith one may edify another.

ROM 14:20  For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure;
 but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.

ROM 14:21  It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing
 whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.

ROM 14:22  Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that
 condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.

ROM 14:23  And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of
 faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.

ROM 15:1  We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the
 weak, and not to please ourselves.

ROM 15:2  Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.

ROM 15:3  For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The
 reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.

ROM 15:4  For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our
 learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have
 hope.

ROM 15:5  Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded
 one toward another according to Christ Jesus:

ROM 15:6  That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father
 of our Lord Jesus Christ.

ROM 15:7  Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the
 glory of God.

ROM 15:8  Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for
 the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:

ROM 15:9  And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is
 written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing
 unto thy name.

ROM 15:10  And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.

ROM 15:11  And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye
 people.

ROM 15:12  And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that
 shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.

ROM 15:13  Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing,
 that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.

ROM 15:14  And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are
 full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one
 another.

ROM 15:15  Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in
 some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me
 of God,

ROM 15:16  That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles,
 ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be
 acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.

ROM 15:17  I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those
 things which pertain to God.

ROM 15:18  For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ
 hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,

ROM 15:19  Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God;
 so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached
 the gospel of Christ.

ROM 15:20  Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was
 named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:

ROM 15:21  But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see:
 and they that have not heard shall understand.

ROM 15:22  For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.

ROM 15:23  But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great
 desire these many years to come unto you;

ROM 15:24  Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I
 trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by
 you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.

ROM 15:25  But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.

ROM 15:26  For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain
 contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.

ROM 15:27  It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the
 Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is
 also to minister unto them in carnal things.

ROM 15:28  When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this
 fruit, I will come by you into Spain.

ROM 15:29  And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the
 fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.

ROM 15:30  Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and
 for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers
 to God for me;

ROM 15:31  That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and
 that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;

ROM 15:32  That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with
 you be refreshed.

ROM 15:33  Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.

ROM 16:1  I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church
 which is at Cenchrea:

ROM 16:2  That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye
 assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a
 succourer of many, and of myself also.

ROM 16:3  Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:

ROM 16:4  Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I
 give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.

ROM 16:5  Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my
 well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.

ROM 16:6  Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.

ROM 16:7  Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who
 are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.

ROM 16:8  Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.

ROM 16:9  Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.

ROM 16:10  Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of
 Aristobulus' household.

ROM 16:11  Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household of
 Narcissus, which are in the Lord.

ROM 16:12  Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the
 beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord.

ROM 16:13  Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.

ROM 16:14  Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the
 brethren which are with them.

ROM 16:15  Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and
 Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.

ROM 16:16  Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute
 you.

ROM 16:17  Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and
 offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.

ROM 16:18  For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their
 own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the
 simple.

ROM 16:19  For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore
 on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and
 simple concerning evil.

ROM 16:20  And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The
 grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

ROM 16:21  Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my
 kinsmen, salute you.

ROM 16:22  I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.

ROM 16:23  Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the
 chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.

ROM 16:24  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

ROM 16:25  Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my
 gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the
 mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,

ROM 16:26  But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets,
 according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all
 nations for the obedience of faith:

ROM 16:27  To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.
