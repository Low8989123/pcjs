                            FOG FINDER Version 1.0 
  
  
              


         INTRODUCTION

              Most people have taken creative writing or grammar 
         classes.  These classes are designed to improve a 
         person's writing.  Creative writing classes will spur a 
         person's imagination; grammar classes stress the 
         building-block approach to writing.                                   

              There is a third technique geared to improve your 
         writing.  This approach judges the "readability" of 
         writing.  It grades writing from the reader's side; i.e. 
         do people find it easy to read.

              If you've ever struggled through the 1040 Federal 
         Tax instruction booklet, you can appreciate that some 
         writing is very difficult to read.  The 1040 
         instructions might satisfy the grammarians, and it might 
         treat the subject in as creative a way as possible, but 
         it fails the third test.  It is very complex, confusing, 
         and "unreadable" writing.  It is far past the tolerance 
         level of most readers.

              Complex subject matter does not necessarily mean 
         complex writing.  In fact, a good writer should strive 
         for the opposite.  If the subject is complex, then keep 
         the writing as simple as possible.  Otherwise, you might 
         end out swamping the poor reader.

              Researchers have been studying the characteristics 
         of readable writing for about 50 years.  They have 
         devised several formulas to evaluate writing; most of 
         these formulas deal with sentence length and word 
         complexity.  One such formula is the Gunning Fog Index.

              
         FOG INDEX

              The Gunning Fog Index measures the complexity in 
         writing.  It represents the complexity as an average 
         grade level (elementary, high school, college) at which 
         the text could be easily read.  For instance, a Fog 
         Index of 9 means 9th grade reading level.

              Most successful popular writing grades below a 13 
         on a Fog Index scale.  As the Fog Index rises, people 
         will find the text more and more difficult to read.  
         Government and business writing often has a very high 
  
                                                                         Page 1



                            FOG FINDER Version 1.0 
  
  
         Fog Index.  This high Fog Index means that people will 
         have trouble reading and understanding the writing.

              Complex subjects need not have a high Fog Index.  
         The Wall Street Journal, a prime example of clear and 
         concise coverage of complex subjects, averages around an 
         11 on the Fog Index scale.

              Note that a low Fog Index does not mean a piece of 
         text is a sample of "good" writing, only that it is 
         probably a piece of writing that is easy to read.  
         However, most of what you consider "good" writing will 
         probably score low on the Fog Index.
              
                            
         USING FOG FINDER

              FOGFIND.COM is a compiled Pascal program that 
         accepts a text file and grades it on a slightly modified 
         Gunning Fog Index.  The text file should be an ASCII 
         file; it shouldn't have any special control codes 
         imbedded in the text (printer controls are okay).  Fog 
         Finder will process a file with special codes (for 
         example, a WordStar file), but the resulting Fog Index 
         may not be accurate.

              From DOS, enter FOGFIND to begin the program.  You 
         will receive a title screen introducing Fog Finder.  
         Press any key to continue.  (Note:  I don't know why, 
         but sometimes you have to press a key a couple of 
         times.) 

              Fog Finder will prompt you for the name of your 
         text file.  It will then try to open and read the file.  
         If Fog Finder cannot do so, it will prompt you to 
         re-enter the file name.  (example: file does not exist)

              If the open is successful, Fog Finder will begin 
         processing.  You'll see a running tally of words and 
         sentences.  Fog Finder will continue processing until 
         either:  A) It reaches the end of the file, or  B) It
         has processed 50 sentences.

              The 50 sentence limit allows you to process a 
         sample from a long text file.  The 50 sentence sample is 
         more than enough to generate a representative Fog Index.

              After processing your text, Fog Finder displays a 
         Fog Index table, a graphic showing your sample's Fog 
         Index range, and your actual Fog Index.  You will have 
  
                                                                         Page 2



                            FOG FINDER Version 1.0 
  
  
         the option to process another file or to terminate the 
         program.

          
         REMEMBER
              
              A Fog Index is only a measure of what people 
         consider easy reading.  It doesn't measure whether the 
         writing is good, bad, dull, interesting, clear, or 
         muddy.  However, it will measure whether the writing 
         will tire the reader beacuse of the way the words and 
         sentences are assembled.

              
         ENHANCEMENTS

              Future versions of Fog Finder will accept special 
         text files (WordStar, MultiMate, etc.).  Registered 
         users will automatically receive a copy of the next 
         version.  All written suggestions for enhancements are 
         encouraged.

             This is a T.P.I.R product!  (The Price Is... Reasonable?)  I 
        object  to  paying  half the price of my hardware  for  a  single 
        software  package,  so  I'm trying to do something about  it.   I 
        believe  that there are enough "micros" around to make a  reason-
        able  return on your labor investment through  volume...  if  you 
        don't  have  to pay substantive advertising and marketing  costs.  
        If  you're reading this document,  you have the package.   It  is 
        copyrighted, so what are your rights?  They are given here:

        --  You are free to copy, and encouraged to distribute to any/all 
             of your friends,  the materials included in the distribution 
             diskettte.  Please include this document.

        --  You  may use these materials in any way you see fit,  but you 
             may  not "sell" the package.   

        Where's the "catch"?   Simple.   Its up to you.   If you use this 
        package, and like it, send me a check for $35.  Otherwise, thanks 
        for experimenting!   What do you get for the $35, besides a clear 
        conscience?   Not much.  I'll put you on my mailing list and when 
        (not  if)  bugs are encountered,  I'll notify you and offer   our 
        handy, dandy copy service, which incidentally is available to all 
        your friends for their initial copy,  if you don't want to bother 
        copying the diskette.   I'll also notify you when future develop-
        ments are available:   we now have the Screen Design Aid, a util-
        ity that takes a lot of the drudgery out of building  interactive 
        menus;  the  LIST  utility,  which allows for "wild  card"  print 
        requests, optionally provides headings, and fully supports all of 
        the  many and varied modes of printing without messing  with  the 
        MODE   command;   and  a  Full  Screen  Editor,   primarily   for 
        programming,  which  supports either display interface,  provides 
        very "full function", and is FAST.  All operate on PC-DOS V1.x or 
        V2.0.  

             The copy service mentioned  is also simple:  Send diskette, 
        mailer, and enough postage to the writer and we'll make a copy of 
        the distribution diskette for you.  If you don't want to send the 
        diskette,  mailer,  et al., send a check for $7.50 and we'll send 
        you a new diskette with the materials (Single surface, 8 sector).  
        The last page of this document is an order/registration form.

        Full Screen Editor - Version 2.0


        INTRODUCTION
                 
             The  Full  Screen Editor (FSED) is primarily  a  programming 
        development tool for the applications or systems programmer.   It 
        is designed to work with the IBM Personal Computer,  using either 
        the  Monochrome Display or the Color/Graphics interface,  and  at 
        least  one disk.   Although the editor will operate  on  machines 
        with  as  little  as 64K bytes of memory,  its design  point  for 
        optimum operation is the 128K memory system.  As an  environment, 
        it  expects  the IBM Disk Operating System (DOS) Versions 1.x  or 
        2.0,  and uses the facilities of this operating system as well as 
        the facilities of the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS).  

             Although  programming language independent,  the editor will 
        be  of most use to the programmer  using  Assembler,  PASCAL,  or 
        FORTRAN.  The  BASIC programmer's use of the editor will probably 
        be limited to selected special functions (eg:  search for a vari-
        able  name),  and no specific format processor  for BASIC is  in-
        cluded in the editor.  Users of the BASIC Compiler will find  the 
        editor useful,  however.  Similarily, although selected functions 
        permit  the use of the editor for "text" processing,  these tools 
        are limited and primitive when compared to a normal,  full  func-
        tion, text processor.

             The  editor works with "files" which are normal DOS files in 
        ASCII or source form.   Files to be processed by this editor  are 
        limited to "lines" of not greater than 80 characters.  
          
                                * * * WARNING * * *
               
             If  editing  is attempted on files containing lines of  more 
        than  80 characters,  truncation will occur and portions  of  the 
        data will be lost.  Under certain conditions, attempting to apply 
        functions against these lines may cause catastrophic error!!!

            Using  the  facilities of the editor,  the  programmer  may: 
        create  or  modify  source language files,  extract  portions  of 
        existing files,  insert existing files into other files,  or  use 
        existing files to create new files.   Twenty-four lines of source 
        are  normally  displayed during all editing functions,  and  pro-
        vision is made for "paging" through files by displaying sucessive 
        pages.  Characters  can be changed,  deleted,  or  inserted  into 
        existing lines.   New lines may be added, existing lines deleted, 
        moved,  or  copied.   Finally,  a substantial number of "control" 
        functions  can be exercised,  most by the depression of a  single 
        key.   All of the functions, with the exception of those that are 
        limited  by  disk speeds,  are performed  at  speeds  essentially 
        within the human response range.









        Introduction -                 4





        Full Screen Editor - Version 2.0


        STARTING OUT
              
             Since the Full Screen Editor requires IBM DOS to operate, it 
        is  assumed that you are familiar with the terms and  conventions 
        of  the DOS.   File names and disk operations are those supported 
        by the standard DOS, so no attempt is made to cover this material 
        in this document.  

             In an attempt to keep this document simple,  many details of 
        functioning are omitted from the main discussion.   These details 
        are  generally not important to the typical user,  however  since 
        they  may effect some unique process you are attempting they  are 
        included in the set of appendicies appearing at the back of  this 
        document.   When  the  general area effected by the  appendix  is 
        first discussed a parenthetical reference is included (eg: Appen-
        dix A).  You should read through the material as it is presented, 
        omitting the appendicies during your first use of the editor.  As 
        your  familiarity  grows and you attempt more complex  use,  then 
        reference to the appendicies will resolve most questions that may 
        arise.

             This document is written for the "new" programmer.   For the 
        experienced  programmer,   scanning  this  introductory  material 
        should  be  sufficient.   The largest section of  this  document, 
        "COMMANDS",  should be reviewed by all users,  and will provide a 
        ready reference during productive use of the editor.
         
                                SAVING THE EDITOR
               
             The distribution diskette included with this manual contains 
        a file named FSED.COM.   Your first action should be to copy this 
        file  to a work diskette containing your IBM DOS.   Use the  Copy 
        utility included with your DOS,  following the instructions  pro-
        vided  in the DOS manual.   File and save your distribution disk-
        ette as your "master".   The distribution diskette is "file  pro-
        tected"   which  will  prevent  accidental  destruction  of  your 
        "master".
          
                                 USING THE EDITOR
               
             The editor will operate properly on either one or two  drive 
        systems.   Initially, we'll use it by inserting the work diskette 
        containing  IBM DOS and the FSED.COM file in the drive  "A".   To 
        start the editor you may use any of three forms of DOS commands:
         
                  A:>FSED
                  A:>FSED yourfile.type
                  A:>FSED yourfile.type outfile.type
              
             As  you  gain familiarity with the editor,  the second  form 
        shown above is the one you'll use most frequently.   To help  you 
        get  started,  we'll  discuss  all three forms and  the  editor's 
        response to each.  




        Starting Out -                 5





        Full Screen Editor - Version 2.0


             In all three cases,  when you enter this command, the screen 
        will briefly display an identification screen that simply announ-
        ces  the editor has been loaded properly.   If you have used  the 
        first form of the command, a prompt near the bottom of the screen 
        will  ask for your file name.   Just as in the second  and  third 
        forms of the command,  the file name requested is a "fully quali-
        fied"  DOS file name.   Drive may be specified,  and if it is not 
        then the "default" or signed on drive is implied.   "type" is not 
        required by the editor,  but most language processors do  require 
        it, so normally it should be specified.  

             If  the  file  you have named exists on the drive  you  have 
        specified or defaulted to,  then the first 24 source lines of the 
        file will be displayed without further action.   If the directory 
        does not contain the name you gave,  then a prompt will appear at 
        the bottom of the screen:

              "New file - (Y or N)"

             If you are actually creating a new file,  reply "Y" and  you 
        will  be  presented  with a "blank" screen  containing  only  the 
        editor  prompt line (line 25),  and an "end of file" marker line. 
        If  you  have made an error in specification of your  file  name, 
        reply "N",  and the editor will prompt for the correct name, just 
        as it did when the first form of the command was used to initiate 
        the editor.  

             Before  discussing  the third form of  the  command,  it  is 
        necessary  to  understand how the editor handles file  names  and 
        directory updates.   The editor is designed to prevent catastrop-
        hic data loss.   If you are updating an existing file,  that file 
        in  its original form,  will still exist at the conclusion of the 
        edit process.  Editing the file actually causes the creation of a 
        new  file  containing the edit changes,  and normally  named  the 
        same as the file specified as "yourfile" in the command or prompt 
        sequences.   The original file is renamed to "yourfile.BAK".   If 
        "yourfile.BAK" existed prior to the start of the editor,  the old 
        backup  file  will be automatically  deleted.   This  complicated 
        sounding process simply results in maintenance of two versions of 
        "yourfile".   The current version and one back up version without 
        the last set of changes.  

             For the editor to function properly, then, there must always 
        be  sufficient disk space available on the output drive,  to con-
        tain the entire file being edited, plus any changes you introduce 
        in this edit process.  This is a "free space" requirement that is 
        in  addition to any "back up" files  and the original file to  be 
        edited, that may already reside on the disk.  

             The  third  form  of the command  over-rides  this  process. 
        "outfile.type"  is your desired name for the new file created  by 
        the editor.   When this form of the command is used, the original 
        file  is  not changed,  and the rename to a back up file  is  not 
        performed.  Note that the output file need not reside on the same 
        drive  as the input file,  in two  drive  configurations.   Drive 


        Starting Out -                 6





        Full Screen Editor - Version 2.0


        identifier may be specified with the "outfile" name.  

             Finally, there is one additional prompt that you will rarely 
        see.   If  you  have used the third form of the command and  have 
        given  a name for your output file that already  exists,  then  a 
        prompt that warns you of this condition will appear,  and you are 
        requested  to  give permission to proceed ("Y") or cancel  ("N").  
        If you permit the editor to continue, the content of the existing 
        file will be over-written and lost!!! (Appendix A).

             Before proceeding into the edit process,  a brief discussion 
        of  file  sizes and drive  configurations  is  appropriate.   The 
        editor is capable of processing a "very large" file,  essentially 
        limited only by the diskette capacity and the "space requirement" 
        cited in the previous paragraphs.   In actual practice,  you will 
        find it much more convienent to work with small or moderate sized 
        files.  The primary difference to the user is how "automati

From: Jan. 83 issue of Microcomputing

		Full Screen Editor

Following is a copy of the article describing this program by D. E. Cortesi

		IBM's MVP  (Most Valuable Program)

   The most important piece of software in any computer system, for me,
is its editor.
   The editor is used for just about everthing: source programs, memos,
business letters, batch command files, articles, datafiles...Everything
that goes onto a disk gets there throught the editor program, or descends
from something that did.
   When I was loaned an IBM Personal Computer, I found that it lacked an
editor.  It has Edlin, but I don't find that program an acceptable tool.
I've been using full-screen editors for some years now, so I find it difficult
to go back to a line-oriented editor - especially one as rudimentary as
Edlin.
   So there the machine sat, waiting for me to give it something to do.  But
what I needed was some kind of stop-gap - an editor that I could tolerate
until a professional product becomes available.
   My solution was to write a stopgap editor in Basic.
   The resulting program is interesting in several ways.  It's an example
of how much you can accomplish in IBM's Basic, and of how you can use the
Basic language in a structured style of programming.  And it's a scale 
model of a full-screen editor, so it can serve as a test bed for ideas
that you might have on how an editor should work.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES.
   The Stopgap Editor was an unusual programming project.  It was the first
time I'd written a program with the intention of using it heavily for a short
time and then throwing it away.
   The first requirement was that it had to go together quickly; that dictated
a clean, simple design using straightforward techniques.  The second requirement
was that it have adequate function from the outset, because I was determined
that there would be no second version of the program.
   The program's speed of response would not be important, although it did
have to accept input at my normal typing rate.  It wouldn't need to handle 
large files; by the time I needed to edit large files, there would be a good
editor on the market.
   With these factors in mind, I sketched the parameters of the program.  It
would keep a file of a couple hundred lines in storage as an array of strings.
Lines would be no longer than the screen was wide.  In fact, for simplicity
of coding, no line would be shorter than the screen width either.
   It would present the file on the screen 24 lines at a time.  The user 
would be able to move the cursor to insert, delete or type over characters.
The special keypad functions of the PC keyboard would be supported to move
the cursor over the screen and the screen over the file.  There would be
control key signals to delete and insert lines and to move to the head and
foot of the file.
   The only disk I/O that would be required would be the ability to save the
working file on disk and to load another file from disk.  Since there would
never be a great amount of data at risk, error-checking and reporting would
be minimal.
   These were the objectives, let's look at the program that resulted.

USING STOPGAP.
   The Stopgap Editor is loaded and executed like any other program in Basic.
Shortly after starting, it presents you with a clear screen.
   The screen now becomes the electronic equivalent of a roll of paper.  
Each screen line corresponds to a line of characters in a disk file.  Move
the cursor around with the up-,down-,left- and right-arrow keys and type
anywhere you like.
   The enter key moves the cursor to the left margin and down one line-
without putting any data in the file.  The tab key moves the cursor to the
next tab stop.  It doesn't put any data in the file either.
   The end key moves the cursor to the right side of the screen.  The home
key does one of three things, depending on where the cursor is when you
press it.  If the cursor is away from the left margin, the home key moves it
back to the left margin.  If the cursor is at the left margin but not on the
top line, then the home key moves it to the top line.  If the cursor is in
the top left corner, the home key moves it to the bottom left corner.  With
a few presses of the home and end keys, you can move to any corner of the
screen.  (I took this idea from the Magic Wand editor for CP/M.)
   Type some characters on the screen.  Move the cursor into the middle of
a word and press the insert key.  The cursor becomes double, framing the
current character.  (On the top line of the screen, the upper half of the
cursor is invisible.)
   Now, each character you type will be inserted ahead of the current character.
If the line is full, one character will be lost from the right end for each one
inserted.  Pressing any key except a printable character will end insert mode.
   You'll find that the backspace key erases the current character and moves 
cursor to the left.  Press the delete key and the current character disappears
while the rest of the line shifts to the left to fill in and the cursor stays
in place.
   If you keep inserting or deleting for about 50 characters, the screen 
seems to go dead.  After a pause of about ten seconds, though, the system comes
to life again.  This is a peculiarity of all Microsoft Basic interpreters.
   The program has been doing several operations on character strings for
every inserted or deleted character, and the Basic interpreter has filled up
its working storage with garbage character strings.  It stops to tidy up - 
and when Basic stops, everything stops.  When spring cleaning is over, work
resumes.

PAGING THROUGH THE FILE
   On every line of your file, type a few characters and hit the enter key.
When you reach the bottom of the screen, keep going.  The topmost lines scroll
out of sight.
   Keep on typing for a while, then press the "PgUp" key on the keypad.  The 
editor moves back 23 lines, or to the top of the file.  Note that the cursor
stays where it was on the screen.  Press the "PgDn" key; the editor moves
forward 23 lines, or to the bottom of the file if that comes first.
   Now try pressing the "Ctrl" and "A" together.  That makes the editor move
the screen back to the top line of the file.  Pressing "Ctrl" and "Z" causes
it to move to the last line used.  This is how you move about in a larger file.
Use control-A to get to the top of the file and then use the page-down key, or
use control-Z to move to the end and then page up.
   Go to the end of the file with control-Z, then move the cursor to the top
of the screen with the home key.  Now press the up-arrow key.  The editor
slides the screen up the file 23 lines and moves the cursor down 23 lines,
so that it is still on the line you were looking at.

LINE INSERTION AND DELETION
   Hitting contol-D causes the editor to delete the entire line on which the
cursor rests.  It redraws the whole screen afterward, so deletion is a fairly
slow process.
   Inserting lines is a bit faster.  When you press control-O, the editor
splits the file just above the line the cursor is on.  The lower part of the
file is set aside.  The line above the cursor becomes, temporarily, the
bottom of the file; the screen is blank beyond it.  Each blank line you
type on becomes part of the file at that point.
   When the file is open, you can use all the other controls for insertion.
You can page back into the upper part of the file to look at it; you can
delete lines or insert characters.  Control-Z will take you not to the real end
of the file but to the line that was inserted last.
   Once you have inserted as many lines as you want, press control-C.  The
editor splices the file back into a single piece, with the inserted lines
embedded where you typed them.  (This method of insertion is also copied
from the Magic Wand editor.)

COMMANDS
   The Stopgap Editor supports just four commands.  Press the "Esc" key.  The
editor clears the screen and displays a menu of the commands.  Pressing the
enter key will return you to the file display.
   The save command asks for a filespec and copies the entire file to disk
under that name.  (If you give it a filespec of "lpt1:", it will copy the 
file to the printer!)  The editor deletes trailing blanks from the end of the
lines saved and discards empty lines at the end of the file.
   The load command asks for a filespec and loads the lines of that file into
storage for editing.  It truncates long lines to the width of the screen
(but doesn't tell you it has done so).  The clear command wipes out everything,
giving you a blank scroll to work on.  The quit command returns you to the 
system.  If you have added or changed anything in the file, these commands
ask for confirmation before they act.
   The Stopgap Editor's disk operations are painfully slow.  It takes a couple
of minutes to load a file of a hundred lines.  If there is any sort of file 
error -  if the disk fills up during a save, for example - you'll get an
error message from Basic.
   Your work hasn't been lost though.  Kill another file to get some space,
then enter the command GOTO 1630.  You should be back in the editor with your
data intact.  But remember, this editor is only a stopgap.  Save your work
often.

Pc-spell        By:Andy Wildenberg      version 1.0     6/13/84
    Pc-spell is a dictionary oriented spelling checker. In its first version 
it will spell check small documents, about 1500 words or less dependent on 
memory. First you will be asked which drive you want for the pc-spell diskette.
In Dos version 2.x, you may also specify paths. All drive names must at least 
include a letter and a colon, or you will be asked again for a name. Then you 
will be asked for the drive that the work diskette will be in. The same 
restrictions apply. If you have one drive and your pc-spell and work diskettes
are different, then specify drive two different drives when prompted Also, ram 
drives will increase speed greatly.
    A list of files will appear on the screen after drive specification
and you will then choose the file to work on by typing in the name and pressing
return. ALL FILES THAT ARE SPELL CHECKED SHOULD BE IN ASCII FORMAT. Pc-spell 
will only spit the words back at you and possibly crash if they are in Word-
star or any other format besides ascii. 
    Now the main loop begins. During all of this time there will be prompting 
on the screen telling you what's going on. First, pc-spell takes the file 
and makes it into single words, storing them in memory. This step is followed 
by an annoying but impossible to avoid period while Basic clears out all of 
the excess memory. Third, pc-spell sorts the list of words in alphabetical 
order. In this step Pc-spell tells you when it starts sorting and when it 
should be done. THIS TIME IS ONLY A ROUGH ESTIMATE AND IS OFTEN QUITE 
INACCURATE. Fourth, it writes the sorted list to disk. This part is not 
prompted by the bottom line. Fifth, it gets rid of all duplicate words. Last, 
it compares your words to its dictionary, writing all of those that it doesn't 
find to the file `misspell'.
    The speed in which these steps occur varies greatly with the size of the 
document. Also, Pc-spell will only work with the amount that can fit in 
memory, to avoid long disk reads and writes.
    Now comes your part. Pc-spell's dictionary is quite limited at present, so 
a lot of words that are correct will still be written to misspell. You must 
take the words correctly spelled and write them to the file `update' while 
keeping the incorrect ones in the file `misspell'.
    Last of all, to add these words to the dictionary, run the program 
'Sortdic.bas', while making sure that there is enough disk space to write the 
dictionary again. i.e. If the dictionary is 35,000 bytes long, then have about 
40,000 bytes free on that disk drive.
    To correct the misspelled words, I suggest the following. Copy the file 
'misspell' to the printer using the DOS command 'Copy misspell lpt1:'. Then 
enter you word processor and use the search and replace functions to find and 
correct all misspelled words. Then after saving the file and exiting the 
word-processor, your file should all be spelled correctly without error.

```
		  Full Screen Editor - Documentation Addendum
										
	Several users have requested the ability to set the "default" format
for the editor.  Actually, they simply want to select the format the editor
will utilize immediately after initial load.  Rather than add additional com-
mands to the editor, I've now included a small utility, SETFSED.  This utility
permits "patching" the format the editor will load in.  Instructions for use
are displayed on the screen.  One caution -- the editor being "patched" MUST
be named FSED.COM and be mounted on the "A" drive.  Please "patch" only working
copies.  Do NOT patch the master.  Any errors encountered in the process will
be displayed on the screen.
										
	Good luck, and happy editing.
