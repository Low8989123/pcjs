In KINGDOM OF KROZ, you are in search of a priceless amulet that lies   
somewhere within the mystical kingdom.  Be careful, there are mysterious
rooms and vicious monsters waiting for you.  You are armed only with a

and adventure, each level is patrolled by as many as 1000 monsters, all 
with a taste for your blood. 16-color graphics and sound effects add

The STORY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As the game begins you find yourself standing on board the Titanic, on her
maiden voyage.  Of course, that particular voyage was never completed!
    Your goal is to survive and somehow get back to your home in the United
States.
    Most of your time will be spent solving numerous problems and dangers that
arise, like starvation and drowning.  If you've played any of Infocom's famous
text games you will notice that Beyond the Titanic is quite similar to Zork
and Planetfall.
    Hints:  Examine everything and make a map as you move through the many
game locations.  There are not any puzzles that cannot be solved logically;
apply an "If I were really there, I would do this..." type of attitude.
    To add to the game's realism sound effects are used throughout the game.

6)  The game will begin.

The VERBS

text adventures sold commercially.  Here is a sampling of the verbs
understood by the game's parser.
EXAMINE (or EX for short)
INVENTORY (or I)
NORTH, SOUTH, NORTHWEST, UP, DOWN, IN, OUT, etc. (or first letter)

SAY                             TYPE
CUT                             HELP
JUMP                            SHAKE
SLEEP                           FLY
DANCE                           FALL



Example structures:

TIE [object] (TO, AROUND) [object] - usually used with a rope.
EX [object] - used to study an object closely.

PUT [object] (WITHIN, UNDER, ON, BESIDE, BEHIND, etc.) [object]
SAY [something] - used to converse with other game characters.
TYPE [something] - used to enter data on a keyboard device.

>> E.N.OPEN HATCH THEN CLIMB DOWN THE LADDER. READ SCREEN. BREAK IT.
>> SHOOT THE CREATURE WITH THE GUN PLEASE, THEN RUN SOUTH!




The COMMANDS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Here's a list of the major commands you will need to know in order to play
Beyond the Titanic.

QUIT - ends the current game.
SAVE - allows you to save your present game location.  Use a separate formatted
       disk.  Up to 26 SAVE files per disk.  SAVE names can be up to eight
       letters long.  To resume a previously SAVED game use the RESTORE
       command.
RESTORE - allows you to restore a SAVED game location.
DIAGNOSE - reveals your health, appetite, etc.
LOOK (or L) - does a brief examination of your current game location.
REPEAT (or R) - repeats your last line of commands.
WAIT (or Z) - lets one move pass without any action.
SCORE - gives you your current ranking.
ROOM DESCRIPTION (or RD) - toggles between full room descriptions or brief
    room descriptions.







MISCELLANEOUS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Beyond the Titanic only recognizes the first SEVEN letters of any word or
command.  (Note: Infocom games only use the first SIX letters.)
    The word AND is not understood.  You cannot say, for example, GET GUN
AND ROPE, or PUT ROPE AND KNIFE IN SACK.
    With the verbs GET and DROP you may refer to every object by saying
GET ALL or DROP ALL.  The word ALL is not accepted anywhere else.
    It is a good idea to draw a map as you find new rooms in the game.
Without a map it is easy to get lost, or it might be difficult to find a
room you need to get to in a hurry.

These games were developed in this order:

     1) CAVERNS  - 40 levels, the easiest of the three
     2) DUNGEONS - 30 levels, the most difficult
     3) KINGDOM  - 25 levels, has the most features (or objects)

Similar games can be found in Apogee Software Productions' new FUN-PAKS.

NOTE:  This version of KINGDOM OF KROZ is a newer, better version than the
       one you may already have.  The older version has a rare bug in it that
       could cause it to lock up your computer.  (It was rare, but it could
       happen.)

Response for the Kroz games have been outstanding.  That is, only positive
comments have come in.  KINGDOM OF KROZ even won a national programming
contest earlier this year.  It took top honors as the "Best Game".


                          The Shareware Concept:
These games are shareware.  Shareware is a way to market software by
independent authors or small software companies (such as ASP).  We rely on
the honesty of users to support the shareware concept, which is basically a
"try-before-you-buy" marketing method.


NOTE:  The SLOW.COM program provided on this disk can be used on those IBM
       compatible computers that run at higher speeds than 4.77 mhz.  To use
       SLOW.COM type SLOW before your run KROZ games.  Make certain that
       you are not running any other RAM resident programs (like SideKick, etc.)
       when you use SLOW.COM or it may not work correctly.

	uses the timer click interupt to slow down the AT, it sets up a
user routine to be called on each click (interupt 1Ch), the user routine
just does a delay loop, interupts are enabled during the loop so interupt
driven devices like the keyboard still work, but the machine seems to be
slowed down (even though it's running at full speed with just a lot of idle
time). I set the values in the delay loop to come reasonably close to the
speed of a normal PC. SLOW.COM will only work with programs that run under
dos and do not disable the timer interupt or the user vector for timer.

NOSLOW.COM
	revectors the user vector for timer back to the IRET in the bios so
that the AT runs at full speed again.




When I get an AT tech ref I will put together a SLOW.COM that works with just
about anything.
