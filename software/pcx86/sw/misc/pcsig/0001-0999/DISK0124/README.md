## Information about "EXTENDED BATCH LANGUAGE"

    Extended Batch Language adds additional features to the batch processing
    capabilities already supported by DOS. The program will guide you in
    the creation of batch files that prompt for responses and keep track of
    variables.  Use it to set up printers, keep configuration parameters
    up-to-date, initialize programs or create other batch files.  Optional
    floating point, enhanced string and arithmetic operations and file I/O
    support is provided.  It is well documented and includes example batch
    programs.

            SEAWARE Corp. Announces new EBL-PLUS


Seaware Corp.  is pleased to announce the introduction of Extended Batch
Language-PLUS.  This represents a major evolutionary enhancement from EBL
Version 3.  EBL-PLUS is a powerful product integration tool and programming
language for the IBM Personal Computer - giving it the best flavors of
EXEC2, REXX and HyperTalk.

Extended Batch Language-Plus adds powerful features to batch files well
beyond what DOS provides.  The EBL-Plus on-line manual will guide you in
the creation of batch files that can have the "look-and-feel" of your
choice.  Colorful windows that use bouncing bar selection, pop-ups, fill in
the blank fields, buttons, and action bars are easily created.  Enhanced
arithmetic, string, system, file I/O, and error recovery functions are
built in.  Use its structured English-like commands to integrate
applications together, set up printers, automate execution of programs, or
even create other batch files.

New EBL-PLUS now has over 100 built-in commands and functions - additional
modules are not required.  It has slimmer and trimmer memory utilization -
requiring little or no resident memory.  Enlarged program areas are now
available - supporting EBL programs twice as large as before.

As a product integrator, it represents a significant advance in providing a
comprehensive, yet easy to learn, facility for controlling tasks you give
your computer.  As a programming language, it provides a powerful
high-level language that can replace PC-DOS batch files or be used
independantly to make stand alone applications.

With EBL-PLUS, you will have the ability to:

 *  Add powerful extensions to your batch files

      - Integrate programs, even dissimilar ones.
      - Automate execution of programs and processes.
      - Error handling and recovery.
      - String and Arithmetic expressions and operations.
      - Batch file processing up to five times faster than  <P10B>COMMAND.COM<P255D>

 * Create Custom Menus Automatically.

 * Add windows to your EBL batch file applications.

 * Design a professional user interface, creating the "Look
   and Feel" of your choice ---

      - bouncing bar menus
      - fill in the blank menus
      - buttons
      - action bars
      - sound

Call 800-634-8188 to try EBL-PLUS now. After the joy of EBL-PLUS,
using batch files will never be the same.

MS-DOS version: $79 + $3 shipping/handling (foreign shipping $12)
Mastercard and Visa accepted.
