## Information about "EZ-FORMS EXECUTIVE"

    Stop trying to satisfy your information needs by using someone else's
    idea of the "right" form. Make documents tailored to your specific
    requirements to answer your special questions.
    
    You can print forms to fill out by hand, or to fill in before printing.
    Spreadsheet math functions automate numerical extensions such as
    multiple items/per item pricing and tax computation. Merge with
    information from a database and automatically insert dates and times as
    desired. Editing functions, such as word wrap, text centering and
    automatic justification, help you make professional-looking forms,
    quickly and easily.
    
    Useful for small businesses or organizations that need few copies or
    store all data electronically. Especially valuable as a forms
    development tool for designing and streamlining before committing to a
    large print run.
    
    Features include:
    
    ~ Macros (keystroke record/playback makes form fill-out a breeze)
    
    ~ ASCII data file merge
    
    ~ Data Export in 8 different ASCII delimited formats
    
    ~ Auto date, time, increment numbering
    
    ~ Chain (multi-page forms) and multi-copy printing
    
    ~ Handles forms up to 248 columns by 132 lines
    
    ~ Enhanced printer support includes extensive user modifiable printer
    attributes and embedded characters, also double/single block/shade
    character line drawing and any character "drag" modes
    
    ~ Italics, superscript, subscript, double wide, bold, underline, etc.
    are supported for properly equipped printers
    
    ~ Laser Printer (HP and compatibles) support includes auto font
    downloading, graphics emulation and custom font support
    
    ~ File encryption to protect sensitive files
    
    ~ File compression to save valuable disk space
    
    ~ Increment number counter (different number on each form) printing
    
    ~ Auto-tab/fill-in and file (makes filling out pre-printed forms a
    snap)
    
    ~ Field markers (lock out designated areas)
    
    ~ Vertical typing
    
    ~ Cut and paste
    
    ~ Mouse support for Logitech and Microsoft mice.
    
    ~ 101+ pre-designed and user modifiable forms  (Basic Forms Pack)
    included.
    
    ~ Search Mode: Like a mini free form database.
    
    ~ Basic Laser Fonts now included. 10 soft fonts (which include the line
    drawing characters not usually available in soft fonts) for the
    HP-LaserJet Plus.
