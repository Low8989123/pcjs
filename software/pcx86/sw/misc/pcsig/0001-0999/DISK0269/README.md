## Information about "BASIC DEVELOPMENT"

    A completely functional version of BetaTool's BASIC Development
    System for programs of less than 6500 bytes.  BetaTool's system works
    with the BASIC interpreter to add easy file editing, instant
    cross-reference lists, selective line renumbering, variable dump and
    program expand/compress.  If you program in BASIC you should try this
    package.

            BetaTool's BASIC Development System (BDS)
 
This document provides a brief description of the demo version of BDS.
The demo version is identical to the full package except this version
will only work on BASIC programs with a size less than 6500 bytes.
 
To install BDS, select the file that matches the version of BASIC you
are using, then copy that file to your working disk and rename it to
BDS.COM.  For example, if you are using IBM BASIC 3.30, type the command:

           COPY  B:IBMPC.3XX  A:BDS.COM


To start BDS, type the command:

	   BDS	MX  BASICA

where "BASICA" may be replaced by whatever you would normally type to
start BASIC on your system.  For example, the command:
 
	   BDS	MX  BASICA  SAMPLE

will start BDS with Advanced BASIC and run the program SAMPLE.BAS


The following summary of BDS commands is extracted from the BDS manual:
