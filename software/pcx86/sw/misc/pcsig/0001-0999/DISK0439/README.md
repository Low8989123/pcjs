                 MODEM86(tm)                 _______        Briefly, MODEM86(tm) is a communication  program  for  Intel  8086/88
        based computers which run either a version of MicroSoft's  MS(PC)-DOS
        or a version of Digital Research's CP/M-86.  It  is  named  after the
        CP/M   User   Group  "MODEM"  program,  a   popular   public   domain
        communications program for CP/M machines, because it  uses  the  same
        protocol for file transfers.

                      MODEM86        _________________________        1.2 What does MODEM86 do?


        MODEM86(tm)        _______        MODEM86(tm) is a communication  program  for  most 8086/88 computers,
        which provides several features which are described  briefly  in  the
        following subsections.  "8086/88 computer" is the name we use for any
        computer which uses a  chip  from  the Intel iAPX 8086 family for the
        central processing unit (CPU).  This family includes  the  8086,  the
                                                        MODEM86                                                        _______        8088,  the  80186,  the  80188,  and the 80286. MODEM86 and  all  its
        utilities  run  under  both  CP/M-86  and  MS(PC)-DOS  when  properly
        installed.  "MS(PC)-DOS" is the name we use for  Microsoft's  MS-DOS,
                                                             MODEM86                                                             _______        of which IBM-PC DOS and  Zenith  ZDOS are variants.  MODEM86 requires
        about 32KB of read/write  memory  for  itself,  and  so  runs on most
                                                        MODEM86                                                        _______        machines with only 64KB of read/write memory.   MODEM86  requires  at
        least one  serial  port,  through which it can communicate.  Only one
                                                     MODEM86                                                     _______        disk drive, of any type, is necessary to run MODEM86.


        1.2.1 Is configurable for your computer

                            MODEM86                            _______        The best feature of MODEM86, and an unusual one for products  of  its
                                            MODEM86                                            _______        type,  is  that a single version of MODEM86 runs  on  many  different
                                MODEM86                                _______        types  of  computers.   MODEM86  comes  with  an intelligent  utility
        program called  MODEMSET  which  configures  it  for  use  with  most
        computers, serial I/O chips, or  serial  I/O boards.  In general, you
        don't need to know the technical details about your hardware, because
                                                             MODEM86                                                             _______        MODEMSET knows about your computer.  This means that MODEM86 supports
        many standard computers and  serial  I/O  devices  "off  the  shelf".
                                        MODEM86                                        _______        Although the source code of the MODEM86  main program is not included
               MODEM86               _______        in the MODEM86 package, there is a facility which allows you to write
                                                                     MODEM86                                                                     _______        your own  customized  serial  I/O BIOS routines for use with MODEM86.
        This allows the use of any  type of serial I/O hardware, even one-of-
                                                                MODEM86                                                                _______        a-kind hardware, without requiring a special version of MODEM86.  For
        more details about configuring, see the chapter entitled "Configuring
        MODEM86                                              abbreviated        _______                                              ___________        MODEM86".  Please  note  this  chapter is not in the abbreviated user
        manual found  on  the  distribution diskette, but is contained in the
        complete printed user manual.  For more details about which  machines
                                   MODEM86                                   _______        are    compatible   with   MODEM86,   see   the   chapter    entitled

        distribution diskette, but is contained in the complete printed  user
        manual.  Note also that these  utilities  are not usable on arbitrary
        program object files, and nor do they transfer  the  result  files to
        diskettes formatted for the other operating system.


        1.2.3 Provides reliable file copying using XMODEM protocol

        MODEM86        _______        MODEM86 provides reliable file copying using an error free  protocol.
        MODEM86        _______        MODEM86 uses the same checksummed  file  transfer protocol as used by
        the  various  versions of the CP/M User Group file  transfer  program
        MODEM,  originally  written  by  Ward Christensen, up  through  MODEM
        version 7.2. This protocol is often called the  XMODEM protocol.  All
        the file transfer modes  of  the  CP/M  MODEM  7.2  program (and most
                                                                     MODEM86                                                                     _______        earlier versions  as well) are communication compatible with MODEM86.
        The  CP/M  MODEM program is the file transfer program  used  by  most
        remote  CP/M  (RCPM) bulletin board systems.   Most  MS-DOS  bulletin
        board systems, especially RBBS-PC and FIDO  use  the  same  protocol.
                                                          MODEM86                                                          _______        Because of the compatibility with these programs, MODEM86 can be used
        to transfer data files without data corruption to any CP/M system, or
                                                                MODEM86                                                                _______        bulletin board system, or any other computer which runs MODEM86, even
                                                                      MODEM86                                                                      _______        if the diskette formats are incompatible.  In addition, with  MODEM86
        a 16-bit  CRC  checksum  mode can be specified for extremely reliable
        file copying.   Both  ASCII  (character)  and  binary  files  can  be
        transferred when using  the  checksummed file transfer protocol.  The
        checksumming assures reliable file copying in spite  of  noisy  phone
        lines.  For more details about reliable file copying, see the chapter
        entitled "Error Free File Transfer".  Please note this chapter is not
               abbreviated               ___________        in the abbreviated user manual found on  the  distribution  diskette,
        but is contained in the complete printed user manual.

        MODEM86        _______        MODEM86 provides for a "dumb" terminal  emulation.   This  means  the
        ability to be used as a terminal to any host computer  not  requiring
        the special characteristics of a specific terminal.   The  bit  rate,
        originate or  answer  mode,  number of stop bits, and optional parity
                           MODEM86                           _______        can be specified.  MODEM86 can be used to connect an 8086/88 computer
        to  practically  any  host,  including  timesharing  systems such  as
        CompuServe or  Source.   If  your computer has a console driver which
        emulates a standard  terminal  by processing escape sequences written
                                 FANSI-CONSOLE(tm)                                 _____________        to the console, like our FANSI-CONSOLE(tm) program for the IBM-PC and
                             MODEM86                             _______        compatibles,   then  MODEM86  provides  a  complete  smart   terminal
        emulation of that standard terminal.  For more details about terminal
        emulation, see the chapter entitled "General Communications".  Please

        distribution diskette, but is contained in the complete printed  user
        manual.


        1.2.5 Provides file transfer with all hosts

            MODEM86            _______        The MODEM86 communication conversation can  be  saved to a disk file,
        allowing the capture of ASCII data files from  the  host.   Files can
        also be sent to a  host  as  though  they  were  just typed in to the
        host.   The  same mechanism can be used for auto-dialing  with  smart
        modems, and for auto-logon.  For more details about file transfer see
        the  sections  entitled  "How  do  I  transfer  files   from  a  host
        computer?"  and "How do I transfer files to a host computer?"  in the
        the chapter  entitled  "General  Communications".   Please  note this
                                   abbreviated                                   ___________        chapter  is  not  in  the  abbreviated  user  manual   found  on  the
        distribution diskette, but is contained in the complete printed  user
        manual.


        1.2.6 Provides X-ON/X-OFF flow control

            MODEM86            _______        The MODEM86 terminal emulation and file copying  allow the use of the
        X-ON/X-OFF  protocol  for flow control by the host to  avoid  missing
                     MODEM86   MODEM86                     _______   _______        data sent by MODEM86.  MODEM86 also uses the  X-ON/X-OFF flow control
        to avoid missing data  send  by  the  host.   For  more details about
        X-ON/X-OFF,  see  the  chapter  entitled  "General   Communications".
                                                abbreviated                                                ___________        Please note this chapter is not in  the abbreviated user manual found

                  MODEM86                  _______        entitled "MODEM86 Command Syntax".  Please note this chapter  is  not
                 abbreviated                 ___________        in  the  abbreviated user  manual  found  on  the  diskette,  but  is
        contained in the complete printed user manual.


        1.2.8 Provides optional on-line help and menus

        In the interactive mode, you have the choice of having a command menu
                                                                      MODEM86                                                                      _______        displayed before every command or displayed only by request.  MODEM86
        has a help command which gives  an overview of the command syntax and
        sub-options.  For more details about help command,  see  the  chapter
                  MODEM86                  _______        entitled "MODEM86 Command Syntax".  Please note this chapter  is  not

        manual.


        1.2.10 Provides auto-dialing

        MODEM86        _______        MODEM86 can automatically dial phone numbers  if  an  auto-dial  chip
        requiring direct software control  is  used  in  your  serial  board.
        Please note that this is not the same  as  what  is  often  called an
        "auto-dial modem", which has textual (ASCII) commands which you  must
             _______        send through your serial port to cause it to auto-dial.  What we mean
        by an "auto-dial chip"  is  one  that  has  no  textual commands, but
                                                                  MODEM86                                                                  _______        instead requires direct  software  control to auto-dial.  MODEM86 has
        no extra  automatic  support  for auto-dial modems, since they are so
        easy to use in the first place.   For more details about auto-dialing
        with  auto-dial   serial  chips,  see  the  chapter  entitled  "Modem
        Control".  For more details about auto-dialing with auto-dial modems,
        see the chapter entitled "General Communications".  Please note these

        2.1.1 NO!

               ___        You do not have to read this whole manual from cover to cover to take
                     MODEM86                     _______        advantage of MODEM86.  You only have  to know what is in this chapter

        description of this chapter in the table of  contents!   We  know how
        much  you  hate  to  have  to  read the manual before  trying  out  a
        program.

        We have provided an extensive index  at the end of this manual.  It's
        there to help you if you have  problems  finding  what  you  want  to
        know.  Please use it, especially if you don't  read  the  manual from
        cover to cover.  For example,  solutions  to many common problems can
        be found by looking  up  the  keyword "problem" in the index.  If you
        can't  find  something where you looked first in the  index,  let  us
        know!  We think the index should be  comprehensive.   That  minimizes
        the  number  of  calls  we  get asking about things which  are  fully
        explained in the manual but aren't found.

        If what you want to know is only found  in  the complete printed user
        manual and not the abbreviated user manual found  on the distribution
        diskette,  then  it's  probably  time  you  paid for a complete  user
        manual.  You can tell this is the case when you find yourself looking
        for a page number listed in the index or table of contents that isn't
        in your abbreviated user manual.  The index and the table of contents
        are  complete,  but  your  abbreviated  user  manual  found  on   the
                                 ___        distribution diskette is not!

                                                  MODEM86                                                  _______        Lastly, even though it is possible to use MODEM86 without reading the
        chapter  on  its distribution, please read it, too.  It  has  details
        which are important to us about what we expect in return from you for
                               MODEM86                               _______        your being able to use MODEM86.

        2.1.2 Manual Style Notes

        Throughout  the  user manual, upper case  and  underlining  indicates
        input which you must provide.  This is for emphasis only.  Input does
        not need to be in upper case, as all  lower  case input is translated
        into upper case before interpretation as a command.

             ^        The "^" preceding a capital letter represents the typing of a control
                                  ^C               Control-C        character.  For example, "^C" is read as  "Control-C".   To  generate
        the character from the keyboard, hold down  the control key and press
                     C        the letter ("C" in the example).

        2.2.2 Backup distribution diskette        _____ ______ ____________ ________        2.2.2 Backup distribution diskette

        The  second  step  is  to make backup  copies  of  your  distribution
        diskette.  Start out by making sure that the distribution diskette is
        write protected, so that you don't accidentally destroy  what's on it
                   __                       ____        by copying to it instead of copying from it.  After all,  the  reason
        that  you  should make the backup copy in the first place is so  that
        you'll have extra copies if one  copy  gets  accidentally  destroyed.
        Then use  whatever  commands  you  normally  use to make a copy of an
        entire  diskette.   Just  follow  the directions in  your  computer's
        operating system manual for making a copy of a diskette.

        The third step is to  configure  MODEM86.SET  using  MODEMSET.   This
              MODEM86              _______        tells MODEM86 what type of  serial  device your 8086/88 computer has.
                        MODEM86                        _______        It  also  tells MODEM86 what the settings of various  default  values
                    MODEM86                    _______        should be.  MODEM86 does  not work if this is not done, or if this is
        not done properly.  Fortunately, it is not that difficult to do.

                     MODEM86                     _______        To configure MODEM86 to your specific 8086/88 computer and its serial
        device, enter the following MS(PC)-DOS or CP/M-86 command:

             A>MODEMSET               ________             A>MODEMSET

        MODEMSET asks a series of  questions  about your 8086/88 computer and
                                                                      MODEM86                                                                      _______        personal preferences,  and  then  writes out a new version of MODEM86
        which works on that computer.  It is completely  menu  driven,  so it
        should  be  self  explanatory.   All  that  absolutely  needs  to  be
        specified the first time you run  it is which computer you are using,
        and which  serial  port  you  want  to use.  This may be specified by
        choosing choice 1 from the main menu and answering two questions, and
        then choosing  choice  6  from the main menu.  Details of configuring
        MODEM86        _______        MODEM86,  if  necessary,  may  be  found  in  the  chapter   entitled
                     MODEM86                     _______        "Configuring MODEM86".  Please note that this chapter is not included

        The  fourth  step  may  be necessary if  your  8086/88  computer  has
        non-standard serial hardware.  If the serial device is not a standard
        one which is already supported, it requires writing a small amount of
        assembly language code.  In other  words,  for most people, this step
        has been automatically completed for you by us.  Details may be found
        in the chapter entitled "Customized Serial I/O  BIOS".   Please  note

        MODEM86        _______        MODEM86 expects a command to be typed in, followed by a return.

        If you use the CP/M MODEM program, you should note that  the  command
        syntax  is  similar,  but  some of the  menu  option  characters  and
        suboption characters are different.   A  partial  list of differences
                MODEM86                _______        between MODEM86 and MODEM7.2 is given  in  an  appendix.   If  you've

        11.1 Why does MODEMSET say it can't open MODEM86.SET"?        ______________________________________________________        11.1 Why does MODEMSET say it can't open MODEM86.SET"?


        MODEM86.SET is the file that MODEMSET  reads  to  create  a  runnable
                   MODEM86                   _______        version of MODEM86.  MODEMSET gives this error message if MODEM86.SET
        is not on the default disk, or  not  in  the  default  directory  for
        MS(PC)-DOS, or  has  a different user number for CP/M-86, or has been
        given a different  name  than  MODEM86.SET.   The  solution  to  this
        problem  is  to either copy the file into the  current  disk  current
        directory or user number.

        Occasionally  an   incompatible   MODEMSET   program   placed   on  a
                                    MODEM86                      MODEM86                                    _______                      _______        distribution diskette with  MODEM86.   Both MODEMSET and MODEM86 have
        internal version numbers to prevent this  from  happening  without  a
                                                                      MODEM86                                                                      _______        warning.   MODEMSET  leaves a copy of its version number  in  MODEM86
        during  the  configuration process.  The version  numbers  are  later
                      MODEM86                      _______        compared when MODEM86 runs.  If the versions are  not  the  same then
        this error message is given.  The solution is to contact Hersey Micro
        Consulting, Inc.  and ask for a new distribution diskette.

        11.3 Why does MODEMSET gives strange default answers?        _____________________________________________________        11.3 Why does MODEMSET gives strange default answers?


        MODEMSET gets the default answers from  the  MODEM86.SET  file.   The
                                                       MODEM86                                                       _______        MODEM86.SET file  is  really just a version of MODEM86 which has been
        configured for some computer.  So the  default  values  for  MODEMSET
        question answers should usually be reasonable values.  If  the  wrong
        computer is indicated as the 8086/88 computer being  used, this leads
        to values which do not look right.  The solution  is  to  just  press
        return until the  main  menu  is  printed again, and choose the first
        selection again, remembering to be  more  careful  in  answering  the
        questions.

        This problem might also indicate that the  version of MODEMSET is not
                                       MODEM86                                       _______        compatible with the version of MODEM86 in  MODEM86.SET.   This  means
        that  the  distribution  diskette  was  not  properly made up by  the
        MODEM86        _______        MODEM86 distributor.   The  solution  is  to  ask  the  Hersey  Micro
        Consulting, Inc.  for a new distribution diskette.  The old one might
        have to be returned as well.

        11.4 Why does MODEM86 print the SIO parameter error message?        ____________________________________________________________        11.4 Why does MODEM86 print the SIO parameter error message?


        MODEM86        _______        MODEM86 only prints this error  when  it detects something wrong with
        the  serial  I/O port description given to it by  MODEMSET.   Usually
        this is because the questions  asked  by  MODEMSET  were  incorrectly
                                        MODEM86                                        _______        answered for the computer which MODEM86 is currently running on.  The
        solution is to run MODEMSET, and  be careful about the answers to the
                              MODEM86                              _______        questions.  Sometimes MODEM86  cannot  detect  a configuration error.
        Usually when this happens, it does something bad  immediately and the
        8086/88 computer often requires resetting.  Again, the solution is to
                     MODEM86                     _______        reconfigure  MODEM86  using  MODEMSET,  being careful to  answer  the
        questions correctly.  The sample configuration answers might be used,
        but there is a chance that they might be wrong.  Usually it is a good
        idea to verify the  answers  by  carefully  reading  the  appropriate
                                                                  MODEM86                                                                  _______        technical reference manual for the 8086/88 computer that  MODEM86  is
        to run on.

        Sometimes what is required is to find  the correct address or channel
        number  for  the  serial  device involved, as  this  user  manual  or
        MODEMSET might be incorrect about the values for some computers.

        11.5 Why do half of the characters look wrong?        ______________________________________________        11.5 Why do half of the characters look wrong?


        If half of the characters look right but half of them look wrong when
        you connect to a host, then you probably have set the serial port for
        the wrong kind of parity.  When this happens some of the  letters  of
        the alphabet will always look correct and the others will always look
        incorrect.  So on any given line about half  of  the  characters will
        look OK, but the other half are  often  displayed  as  some  kind  of
        graphics character or other special character,  or  possibly  with  a
        different video attribute like inverse video, depending on  the  type
                                                     MODEM86                                                     _______        of 8086/88 computer on which you are running MODEM86.

                                                                         'N'        This  only  happens when  you  have  selected  the  no  parity  ('N')
                                                               'O'        suboption  when  your host computer is using the odd  ('O')  or  even
         'E'        ('E') parity.  When this happens, half of  the alphabet will have the
                           MODEM86                           _______        parity expected by MODEM86 and half of the  alphabet  will  not.  The
        solution is to choose the correct parity  suboption for use with that
        host computer.

        11.6 Why does is data lost from each line?        __________________________________________        11.6 Why does is data lost from each line?


        For some 8086/88 computers which  take a long time to do a line feed,
        serial data is missed when a line feed is  followed  too  closely  by
        characters from the next line.   It is wise to tell the host to delay
        after sending a line feed  and before sending more data, if it can be
                            MODEM86                            _______        done.   Otherwise,  MODEM86  might  miss  a  few  characters  at  the
        beginning of each line  at  the  higher bit rates (>= 1200 BPS).  The
        IBM-PC running MS(PC)-DOS is an example of such an 8086/88 computer.

        If a host delay after a line feed does  not  solve this problem, then
        the  bit  rate is probably higher than the 8086/88  computer  or  its
        console terminal can handle.  Try lowering the bit  rate  to  300, as
        this  should  be  slow  enough  to be handled by most  computers  and
        terminals.  If this works  then  it  was probably too high a bit rate
        originally.  Now try higher bit rates until the highest rate that the
        computer and terminal can handle is found.

        11.7 Why does the checksummed file copy cancel?        _______________________________________________        11.7 Why does the checksummed file copy cancel?


        This  is  often  a  bit rate problem.   There  are  several  possible
        solutions.

        The most common problem is  that  the  bit  rates  used  by  the  two
        computers are not the same.  The  solution is to change the bit rates
        to match and try again.

        Another common problem is the  use  by  a  CP/M  system  of  a  newer
        protocol  which  uses  CRC  checking but is  not  yet  understood  by
        MODEM86                        MODEM86        _______                        _______        MODEM86.   When  this happens, MODEM86 manages to send files  to  the
                                                                          'C'        CP/M system but not receive files.  The solution is  to  us  the  'C'
        suboption on the CP/M system's send command, if it has one.  Give the
        CP/M system a command something like:

             XMODEM  SC  FILENAME.EXT                      _             XMODEM  SC  FILENAME.EXT

        On some other versions of the CP/M program, there is a command like:

             TCC             ___             TCC

        command to toggle the checksum type.

        Another common problem is that the data  rate  is  set  too  high  in
        relation  to  the  rate  of the console  screen.   This  is  because,
        sometimes, writing  things  to  the console takes long enough to miss
        characters on the serial device.  When the characters are missed, the
        data must be resent,  but  usually  the  result  of  resending is the
        same.  The IBM-PC running MS(PC)-DOS  is  a  serious  offender  here,
        since it takes "forever" to do a line feed.  When this  happens,  the
                        'Q'                             MODEM86                                                        _______        quiet suboption 'Q'  can  be  used  to keep any MODEM86 messages from
                                                         MODEM86                                                         _______        being displayed on the console.   This  can keep MODEM86 from missing
        the data,  since  it  doesn't print the message.  The quiet suboption
        can speed up file copies at  higher bit rates, or sometimes make file
        copies at higher bit rates work.

                'Q'        If the  'Q'  suboption fails to work, another possible solution is to
                  'F'        use  the  'F'  suboption  on  both  computers.  This might slow  both
        computers down at the critical points.

                              'Q'      'F'        If  neither  of  the  'Q'  or  'F' suboptions allow the file copy  to
        proceed, then you probably have to reduce the bit rate for  the  file
        copy.  The appropriate bit  rate  can  be found in the same manner as
        for  screen  writing problems.  Sometimes it is possible to  do  file
                         'Q'      'F'        copying with the 'Q'  or  'F'  suboptions  at  higher  bit rates than
        normal terminal operations.






        11.8 Why does the checksummed file copy always start with a timeout?        ____________________________________________________________________        11.8 Why does the checksummed file copy always start with a timeout?


        If  the  transmitting  computer  starts  the  file  copy  before  the
        receiving computer, then there is often a delay of  as  much  as  one
        minute before the copying of  data  becomes regular.  This is because
        the  receiving  computer  misses  the  first  time  the  transmitting
        computer sends the data.  If the start up delay is annoying,  it  can
        be avoided by always starting the receiving computer first.

        Regardless of which computer starts first,  it  is  likely  that  the
        first computer that starts will indicate several timeouts.   This  is
                                              MODEM86                                              _______        very normal for the XMODEM protocol.  MODEM86 is set up to start with
        very  small  timeout  periods  which get increasingly  longer.   This
        allows the file copy to start  up quickly if both computers are setup
        in about the same time, and yet still work without too  many  timeout
        messages if it takes much longer to setup one computer than the other
        computer.  Once  both  computers  are set up, the file copying starts
        the next time receiving computer indicates a timeout.

        11.9 Why aren't file data and host messages displayed?        ______________________________________________________        11.9 Why aren't file data and host messages displayed?


                                                                   ^T        During a simple non-checksummed file transfer started by a ^T when in
        Terminal  mode,  file  data  and  host  messages  are  not   normally
        displayed.  This speeds up the file  transfer  because  there  is  no
        delay caused by  the  scrolling  of  the console of the computer that
        MODEM86        _______        MODEM86 is running on.  However,  if  something goes wrong, any error
        message generated by the host is not  displayed on the console.  This
        can make it difficult to figure out what went wrong.  The solution is
                   'F'      'V'                     'T'        to use the 'F'  or  'V'  suboptions  on the 'T' command used to enter
        Terminal mode.  When one of these options is  used,  all  echoing and
        messages from the host are displayed on the console during the simple
        file  transfer.   Depending  upon  the  type  of console used on  the
                         MODEM86                         _______        computer running MODEM86, this often  also  has the effect of slowing
        down the transfer by delaying after each line  feed.   This  can help

        There are many situations which have this symptom.  Check out all the
        following possibilities.

                                                  'V'        Check the handshaking signals line in the 'V' command report.

            MODEM86            _______        If  MODEM86  indicated that the handshaking signals were not  all  on
        then DCD (Data Carrier  Detect = pin 8), CTS (Clear To Send = pin 5),
        or DSR (Data Set Ready = pin  6)  was not connected to the modem, and
        might be required for the serial chip to send data to the host.

        It might also be the  case  that RTS (Request to Send = pin 4) or DTR
        (Data Terminal Ready = pin 20) was not connected and the host doesn't
                                               MODEM86                                               _______        see any data from the computer running MODEM86.

        For some computers (not  many,  but  some)  a  "null  modem" cable is
        necessary for connection to a modem.   For  most  computers,  a  null
        modem is necessary to connect two  computers.  A null modem is just a
        cable with the wires "crossed"  so  that:  pin  2  on  each  side  is
        connected to pin 3 on the other side; pin 8 on each side is connected
        to pin 20 on  the  other  side, and to pins 5 and 6 on the same side;
        pins 1 and 7 connect  directly to the same numbered pins on the other
        side.

        A wiring diagram for a null modem would look something like this:


             pin  1 ----------------------- pin  1

             pin  2 >---------| |---------< pin  2
                               X
             pin  3 <---------| |---------> pin  3

             pin  5 <---|             |---> pin  5
             pin  6 <---|             |---> pin  6
             pin  8 >---|-----| |-----|---< pin  8
                               X
             pin 20 <---------| |---------> pin 20
             pin  7 ----------------------- pin  7


        The  resulting  null  modem  is  a  symmetric cable, other than  that
        possibly one side requires a female connector, and the other requires
        a male connector.  In other words, if the connectors are the same, it
        does not matter where each end of the cable is connected.

        Check that the instructions  for  installing  the asynchronous serial
        card were followed correctly.

        Sometimes what is required is to find  the correct address or channel
        number  for  the  serial  device involved, as  this  user  manual  or
        MODEMSET might be incorrect about the values for some computer.

        If the modem being used has a half/full duplex  switch,  is it set on
        full duplex?  If it is set to half duplex, change it to full duplex.

        If the modem being used has a originate/answer switch, is it  set  to
        originate?  If it  is  set  to  answer, change it to originate.  Most
        hosts use answer mode, and expect "terminals" to use originate mode.

        If the modem is an acoustic modem, one with "ear muffs" for the phone
        handset, is the handset placed in the  modem correctly?  There is one
        end of  the  modem's acoustic coupler which must always have the cord
        end of the handset, and the modem is usually marked to indicate which
        end.

        Also, is the handset placed  in  the modem's acoustic coupler quickly
        enough?  If not, the host will probably hang up the phone  before  it
        is in.

        If  the  handset  is  never  placed  in the acoustic coupler  quickly
        enough,  try  putting the handset in the acoustic coupler  after  the
        first ring, instead of when the carrier signal comes on as  the  host
        answers the phone.

        Is the modem a "smart"  modem,  capable of "auto-dialing"?  The modem
        must be told to  dial up the host.  See the user manual for the modem
        for help in doing this.

        Was  the  bit  rate  specified  correctly  using MODEMSET, or in  the
        MODEM86                                      MODEM86        _______                                      _______        MODEM86 command?   If specified incorrectly, MODEM86 does not receive
        any characters correctly, although it  is  able to detect the carrier
        signal and so thinks  the  host  is  connected.   The  solution is to
        specify the correct bit rate.

           MODEM86           _______        Is MODEM86 running  when  the  network  or host phone number is being
        dialed?  If not, then the network or host might hang up  because  the
        DTR  (Data  Terminal Ready) signal cannot be provided when  the  host
        answers  the  phone.   The  solution  is to hang up, and  then,  when
        MODEM86        _______        MODEM86 is running, dial up the host again.

        Is the phone number being dialed the correct number for the  host  to
        be used?  Is it the correct phone  number  for  the  bit  rate  being
        used?  If not, then the solution is to use the correct phone number.

        11.11 Why doesn't the backspace or delete key work?        ___________________________________________________        11.11 Why doesn't the backspace or delete key work?


        Some  hosts  do  not  allow  the  use  of  both backspace and  delete
        (sometimes called rubout) to delete  characters.   The  solution,  of
        course,  is  use the character appropriate for the host.   Note  that
        this is only a problem in terminal mode.

                                   MODEM86        ________________________________________        12.1 What limitations does MODEM86 have?


        MODEM86        _______        MODEM86 does have some limitations and we hope to remedy these in the
        future.

              MODEM86              _______          1.  MODEM86 does not emulate any particular type of terminal,  such
              as VT52 or VT100, unless your  8086/88  computer's  version  of
              MS(PC)-DOS or CP/M-86 emulates that type  of  terminal  or  has
                                                   MODEM86                                                   _______              that kind of terminal as a console.  MODEM86 also does not make
              any use of such special  escape  sequences to format the screen
              output.  It should have full screen output support using escape
              sequences.

              MODEM86              _______          2.  MODEM86  should  have an improved command  language  with  more
              command options.  The main problem here is  that it is too much
              like  the  CP/M Modem program syntax.  It should be  made  more
              friendly.

              MODEM86              _______          3.  MODEM86 supports only  one  error checking protocol.  It should
              support the Kermit protocol, and maybe others.

                                               MODEM86                                               _______          4.  It should  be  easier  to change MODEM86 options and to restore
              them.  It should be able to save options to a file.  This would
              make it easier to set up for use with several hosts.

              MODEM86              _______          5.  MODEM86 should allow writing new serial I/O code to be easier.

              MODEM86              _______          6.  MODEM86  should allow complete pathnames for MS(PC)-DOS  files,
              but currently it does not.   Currently  it expects all files to
              be in the current directories of the drives which are on-line.

        MODEM86        _______        MODEM86 has at exactly one  current  version.  That same version runs
                                                                 MODEM86                                                                 _______        on all the types of computer and  operating system which MODEM86 runs
        on.  This makes it convenient for distribution  purposes.   Only  one
        distribution master needs to be made for a new version.

        _________________________        13.1 How did you do that?


        We know you have questions about our company and how our products are
        produced.   Needless  to  say,  we  use  only  the  finest  unnatural
        ingredients.

        Hersey Micro Consulting, Inc.  is a small  new company formed in 1984
        from a  three  year old consulting business owned by Mark Hersey.  We
        are specialists in  system  software for microcomputers.  Our company
        is dedicated to promoting software portability among machines.

        MODEM86        _______        MODEM86 was conceived as  a notion that there must be a way to make a
        program like the CP/M Users Group MODEM  which would work for 8086/88
        computers, which would be able to talk with  existing remote bulletin
                                                               MODEM86                                                               _______        board systems and exchange files.  The programming of  MODEM86  began
        in March, 1982. It was introduced  to the public in June, 1982. Until
        December, 1984, it was sold through CompuView Products, Inc.

            MODEM86            _______        The MODEM86 source program is about 20000 lines  of  code  written in
        Microsoft's  Macro  Assembler.   For  some reason, it  keeps  getting
        bigger, too.  Unlike many folks, we like  that  assembler,  including
        its primitive  type  checking.  We use a set of macros for structured
        programming that give us nested IF-THEN-ELSE type statements and LOOP
        type statements.

        Some utility programs were written in C and  compiled  with  either a
        Lattice  C  compiler  (we  like the generated  code)  or  a  Computer
        Innovations C compiler (we like the library source).

        Rough drafts  and  abbreviated  on diskette forms of this user manual
        were processed by the Mark of the Unicorn's FinalWord word processing
        program for MS-DOS computers.   Final  copies  of  the  printed  user
        manual were produced by passing the FinalWord source  text through an
        conversion program  called  FW2TXF  written  by  Pat  Sherry  at  the
        University of Michigan Computing Center and a word processing program
        called Textform written at the University of Alberta.  Textform  runs
        on IBM 360/370 type computers  under  the MTS operating system, which
        was  originally  written by the staff of the University  of  Michigan
        Computing Center.  The camera ready printed manual was  produced on a
        Xerox 9700 page printer.

        Programs were  compiled  and assembled on a 6 MHz Lomas Data Products
        Lightning 286 S-100 bus computer running MS-DOS, which  is  sometimes
        downgraded  with  an 8 MHz Seattle Computer Products 8086  card  set.
        Memory  used  includes CompuPro RAM 22 256K static memory  cards  and
        Seattle Computer Products SCP-110 64K static memory cards.

        Programs were tested first and most frequently on  an  IBM-PC  with a
        Tecmar Graphics Master display adaptor board and a Princeton Graphics
        color monitor.  It  also  has  an  AST  Six  Pack Plus multi-function
        board, a Mountain fixed disk  controller,  and an Interface I**2 Disk
        System.  Naturally, we use IBM-PC DOS.

        We thank these companies for  their  creative efforts and for putting
        their useful products in the marketplace.

        We also thank our beta-testers for putting up  with unstable versions
        and providing useful comments.

                      MODEM86        _____________________________________        14.1 You mean MODEM86 isn't freeware?


                      MODEM86(tm)                      _______        The  program  MODEM86(tm) is a commercial product and is  not  public
        domain.  It is not "freeware" either, although  its  distribution  is
        similar to that of "freeware".

                  NOT                  ___        We prefer NOT to call it "freeware" for three reasons:

          1.  The name "freeware" implies something for nothing, and we still
              believe that we are  entitled  to  be paid by you for using our
              software, if you like it enough to use it.

                         abbreviated                         ___________          2.  Only  the  abbreviated  user  manual  is  on  the  distribution
              diskettes.  Several chapters describing  advanced  features  in
                                                   complete                                                   ________              detail have been removed  from  the  complete  user  manual  to
              create the abbreviated  user  manual.  The complete user manual
              is not free and must be purchased if one is desired.

          3.  "Freeware" is also a trademark of  The  Headlands  Press,  Inc.
              and not of our own.  If it were not trademarked and were merely
              a generic classification, we  would  have  less complaint about
              that aspect of things.

        Instead, perhaps we should call it "fairware".   We want things to be
        fair for you and for us.

                                                  MODEM86                                                  _______        software which is freeware is that use of MODEM86 beyond a free trial
                                      _________ _____ _______ _______        period, is subject to a  low  mandatory usage royalty payment instead
        of   a   voluntary  usage  royalty  payment   (sometimes   called   a
        "contribution" in  the latter case).  Unlike many commercial software
        vendors, we feel that you are entitled  to  a  test  drive  with  our
        software for a free  trial  period.   On  the  other  hand, like many
        commercial  software  vendors, we feel that if you continue  use  our
        software  you  should pay us for the privilege.  The  price  you  pay
        should still be fair, but it should not be free.

              manual.  So the program must not  be  distributed  without  the
              abbreviated  user  manual,  for  example.   The  files  may  be
              condensed via data compression  techniques if the decompression

              that there  is  room for such files on the media.  Such changes
              must not  remove  or  change the copyright notices found in the
              program or abbreviated user manual.

              _____ _____ ________ __ _______ __ _  _________  _____  _______              "free trial period", is subject to a  mandatory  usage  royalty
              _______ __ ___              payment of $35 (United States)  per  computer  console  CRT  on
              which it  will  be used.  This is true unless you have received
              the published (printed and bound) form  of  the  complete  user
              manual, the cost of which includes the usage  royalty  payment.
              This usage royalty must be delivered directly to  Hersey  Micro
              Consulting, Inc.  at the address on  the  cover  page  of  this
              manual.  The free trial period is intended  to allow you to try
              the program before paying  for  it.   If at the end of the free
              trial period, you decide  you  do  not  want  to  pay the usage
              royalty, this may be done  providing  all copies of the program
              which are or will be in your possession are never used  by  you
              again.  Even in this case  they  may  be  further  distributed.
              Obviously, even though payment is  legally  mandatory,  we  are
              relying on your honesty, because in most  cases, we do not have
              much capability to enforce it.  Remember that your payment will
              help us  to  afford to develop other fine programs that you may
              also be interested in using.

              means that payment of such distribution fees does not cover the

              Consulting, Inc., if the program is used beyond  the free trial
              period.   Distribution charges (such as materials and  postage)
              may be made if they are no  more  than $10 per copy and no more
              than  that  charged for other media  of  similar  construction,
              capacity, and quantity from the same distributor.

              feature you would like included, and we feel that we are likely

              similar feature is supported.

                           use                     MODEM86                           ___                     _______          2.  A license to use updated versions of MODEM86, if you can obtain
                                                                  not                                                                  ___              them, for no additional usage royalty fee.  It does not include
              the costs of distributing such updated versions.

              however, that we do not  guarantee  that telephone help will be
              provided to each licensed user.  Remember that such things cost
              a good deal of money  to support.  We hope to set up a bulletin
              board system to provide information about new  versions  and  a
              mechanism for initiating problem resolution.

          4.  Assignment of a new serial number.  It will  be  placed  in the
              version heading of any update you receive directly from us.  It
              should be used as an identifying number when requesting updates
              or help.

        MODEM86        _______        MODEM86 and its user manual are  provided "as is".  If you don't like
        it  after  the free trial period, don't use it.  If you don't use  it
        after the free trial period, don't  pay for it.  We cannot warrant it
        for all possible purposes, as we know it  has  limitations.   We have
        even tried to notify you of the limitations  we  already  know about.
        We  cannot  warrant it for your specific purposes, because  it  would
        cost us much more to determine its suitability for your purposes than
        we are charging.

                                                                 MODEM86                                                                 _______        It is up to  you  to  determine the suitability of using MODEM86 with

        program or  computer.   We  do occasionally make mistakes in the user
        manuals,  and  they  cannot  always  be  rectified  by  changing  the
        program.

        In no event will Hersey Micro Consulting,  Inc.  be liable, either to
        you  or to any other  party,  for  any  damages,  including  loss  of
        profits, lost savings,  or  other incidental or consequential damages

        have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

        Since you may have received this  version  from  someone  other  than
        Hersey Micro Consulting, Inc., it may have been mangled on its way to
        you.  We obviously can't  warrant  that  no  one  has  done that.  We
        certainly hope no one will do that, anyway.

        We reserve the right to make modifications to  the  program  and user
        manuals without notification to you.

        All prices below are subject  to change if our costs get out of hand.
        We  will  try  to  hold  the  price as low as possible, to  encourage
        everyone        MODEM86        ________        _______        everyone to use MODEM86.  It is also the case  that  as  the  program
        goes in function, the printed user manual will grow in size, and this
        will require a higher price for the manual.

        Updated versions of the  program  and  abbreviated  user  manual,  or
        versions on differently formatted  diskettes,  may  be purchased from
        Hersey Micro Consulting, Inc.  for $10 per diskette.  This requires a
        previously or simultaneously paid  license  fee.   The price includes
        the media, so please don't send us any.  We don't want our mailperson
        to be  overwhelmed  with  incoming packages.  Of course, you can also
        get updates from other customers of Hersey  Micro  Consulting,  Inc.,
        for whatever they charge.

        Diskettes are currently available in 8-inch  SSSD  formats  and  most
        5-inch DSDD formats.  We also expect availability in some  sub-4-inch
        formats when  such  formats  become more common.  We're sorry, but we
        cannot directly support  formats  requiring  one-of-a-kind  hardware,
        such as Victor 9000 (Sirius  1),  Apple  II,  or  any  type  of  hard
        sectored diskettes.  Orders  requiring  such  one-of-a-kind  hardware
        will require  an  extra  $25 processing charge per order, assuming we
        can find such hardware to borrow.

        We provide software  update  notice  service  for a $25 one time fee.
        This requires a previously or simultaneously paid license fee.   This
        puts you on our mailing list of customers who are interested in being
        directly notified of the availability of  newer  versions.   We  will
        send you a notice giving an overview of new features and bug fixes in
        new versions on a quarterly basis.  Then you  can  decide  whether to
        obtain a new version, either directly from  us or elsewhere.  We will
        also notify you of the availability of other programs from us.

        ______________________________________________________        14.5 What do we pay if we have more than one computer?


        Site licenses may be purchased from  Hersey  Micro  Consulting,  Inc.
        The  charge for such a  site  license  is  $25  (United  States)  per
        computer console CRT  owned  by  the  licensing entity on which it is
                        MODEM86                        _______        possible to use MODEM86 (fair  estimates  accepted).   If  additional
        computers are purchased by the licensing entity, the  royalty  should
        be recalculated and the increase paid annually.  Site licenses  cover
        all use by  all  employees  or  students,  regardless  of whether the
        computers used are  owned  by  the  licensing entity.  So home use is
        included, for example.  Site license pricing  does  not  include  any
        printed user  manuals.   They  may be purchased for an additional $40
        each.

                                          MODEM86        ______________________________________________________        14.6 Can I get a printed complete MODEM86 user manual?


        Printed user manuals in "IBM  standard"  size loose leaf binders with
        slip covers may be purchased for $75.  The  $75  price  includes: the
        printed  manual;  a usage royalty fee for one CRT;  one  distribution
        diskette,  formatted  for  either  MS(PC)-DOS  or  CP/M-86, with  the
        program and a magnetically copyable version of the  abbreviated  user
        manual.  This is the "commercial"  version  of the program.  When the
        order is prepaid, the price also  includes  ground  shipping  by  UPS
        within  the  USA.   Other  shipping arrangements require  a  shipping
        charge.

                          MODEM86                          _______        If you  received  MODEM86  from us or from another commercial product
        vendor, and did not receive a  printed user manual, then you may have
                                                   MODEM86                                                   _______        received our registration coupon with your MODEM86 serial  number  on
        it.   Receiving  that  coupon  means  that  vendor  has  paid  us  to
                   MODEM86                   _______        distribute MODEM86 with their product,  and  it means that your usage
        royalty (for one CRT)  has  already  been paid for you by the vendor.
        If you did  not  receive  our  registration  coupon  with your serial
        number on it, or a printed user manual, then  the  vendor did not pay
        your  usage  royalty  fee,  and  you  must  pay   it  yourself.   The
        registration coupon  is  redeemable  for a printed user manual at the
        reduced cost of $40.

        Updates for the complete user  manual  will cost $25, assuming you've
        purchased the commercial version of the program,  or  have  otherwise
        payed the usage royalty licence fee.

        We didn't include  the  complete  user  manual  on  the  distribution
        diskettes for several reasons:

              ________ __  ________  ___  __ _ _________ _____          1.  Frankly, it  wouldn't  fit  in a printable form.  At least, not
              the way we want it printed.

          2.  Using data compression might have  made  it fit, but would have
              scared  away   some   potential   users,   and   made  printing
              inconvenient.

          3.  An abbreviated user manual is quicker and less discouraging  to
              print, or to download from a bulletin board system.

          4.  We wanted some control over how it got  abbreviated, for people
              desiring only a shorter form.

          5.  It  provides  some small encouragement to pay us for  our  hard
              work.

                                     MODEM86                                     _______        You  may  want  to  include  MODEM86  with your hardware or  software
        product.  Companies interested in publishing the complete user manual
        should contact  us.   We would prefer to program than to publish!  We
        can provide you with a license to publish  the  complete  user manual
        with  a  distribution diskette; or we can provide you  a  license  to
        distribute  diskettes  with   a   serialized   registration   coupons
        redeemable for reduced cost printed user manuals.  The  license  cost
        includes the usage royalty  fee  for  one CRT for each recipient of a
        published  complete  user  manual,  or  the  serialized  registration
        coupon.  Essentially,  all  we  are doing is selling you a particular
        lot of serial numbers and a clear conscience.  However, your customer
        gets an even bigger bargain on our product.

        Generally, we would prefer that you use one or the other of the above
        licenses  if  you  distribute   our   software   with  your  product.
        Distributing  our  software  with  your product without  the  license
        falsely implies to  the  customer  that  you've paid us a royalty and
        therefore that customer has already paid to use our software.

                                                                  MODEM86                                                                  _______        We would be happy to provide you with the source code for MODEM86, if
        you are willing to sign a non-exclusive licensing  agreement, and pay
        $250,000 U.S. dollars for the privilege.  For  an even larger sum, we
        might even allow  you  to  publish  the  source.   We obviously don't
        expect  too  many  takers.   Although  we  don't  expect  to   become
        millionaires selling this program, we  do  have some stake in keeping
        the  source  to  ourselves  until  we have made some money  from  our
        efforts.

## PATCHES.DOC

{% raw %}
```
All patches require read and writing MODEM86.SET
Followed by rerunning MODEMSET.
For versions before 04/24/83 with problems with:
    Cloberring op system/can't handle large files:
	For CP/M-86:
	    Need to DDT86 MODEM86.CMD to find the address as follows:
	    IRQ    (change command tail to do RCV QUIET)
	    L50 look for "JMF" followed by "CALL", take dest addr (~185F)
	    L at that addr until "CALL BX", take addr of call inst (~18BD)
	    G to that addr and then L once, take dest of 3rd call (~113C)
	    L twice at that addr, look for "INC AL","CMP AL,[?]", "JNZ",
		"CALL" take destination of that call (~D64)
	    L at that addr, look for "MOV", "MOV", "MOV", "REP MOV", "MOV"
		"INC", "CMP". 
	    If the CMP is "CMP DI" forget this patch!  (Some other problem)
	    If the CMP is "CMP SI" then change to "CMP DI".
	    To do that, remember address of CMP inst and exit DDT86
	    DDT86 MODEM86.SET and add 080H to address and change
		inst at that address (should be the CMP!)
	For MS-DOS:
	    Same a above but:
		first two addresses are 80 less.
		must add 100H to address to find it when finally patching.
For version 04/30/83:
    Machines using 2651 or 2661 SIO chip gives SIO parameter error:
	For CP/M-86:
	    A260E	CMP AL,00
	    A26F4	AND AL,38	
	For MS-DOS:
	    @ 258E change 3C 05 (CMP AL,05) to 3C 00 (CMP AL,00)
	    @ 2674 change 24 1C (AND AL,1C) to 24 38 (AND AL,38)
For version date 06/06/83:
    For DEC RAINBOW CP/M-86:
	To turn handshaking signals on:
	    A2652   JMP 2600
	    A2600   CALL [1440]
		    XOR AL,AL
		    OUT 02,AL
		    JMP 2656
	To select port correctly:
	    SIO dev#=6 (NEC 7201)
	    Not memory mapped
	    Base=40
	    Spacing=1
	    Order=1
	    Channel=0
	    BPS dev#=1 (Must use setup key to change rate)
	    Base=0
    For NEC APC both CP/M-86 and MS-DOS:
	Cannot set or change data rate:
	    Select BPS channel 1, not 0 for COM1: (2 not 1 for COM2:)
For version of 08/15/83 with problems with:
    Godbout Interfacer 3 or other 2651 based serial I/O:
	SIO parameter error problem:
	    For CP/M-86 or MP/M-86:
		A2490 NOP	;Clears error jump after buggy SIO check.
		      NOP	;Was a JZ.
		A265A JMP 2542	;Use correct baud rate table.
		A2643 JMP 2693  ;Fix channel selection....
		A2693 XCHG AH,AL ;This patch will make it not work on
		      MOV AL,[16D4] ;Non 2651 system ... other serial 
		      MOV DX,7   ;chip code is clobbered...
		      ADD DX,[1B12]
		      OUT DX,AL
		      XCHG AL,AH
		      RET
	Note that it will probably cause MP/M-86 to crash if other user's
	use keyboards (ie. unsafe unless single user)
	Newer version should fix this.
For version of 08/15/83 with problems with:
    CP/M-86 or MP/M-86 won't allow new commands after an R command or
    Goes into loops when saving conversation or
    Gets into problems with any other situation calling for making a file:
	A1D63 OR AL,01
	      JMP 1D7B
	Has side effect: Will not delete old files (files named same
	as ones received), but instead reuses them.  If new file is
	supposed to be smaller, it may have garbage (from old file)
	at the end.  CP/M-86 may also make two files with same name!
    Break causes MODEM86 to lock up on 2661/2651 code:
	For CP/M-86:			Was:
	    A25CE MOV AL,08		MOV AL,09
		  XOR AL,37		XOR AL,36
	For MS-DOS:			Was:
	    A264E MOV AL,08		MOV AL,09
		  XOR AL,37		XOR AL,36
For version of 10/06/83:
    This version has problems with nearly all of the MODEM7 protocol
    file transfer options.  These patches fix all of the problems.

With the 11/21/83 version:
    All equipment labelled as untested by MODEMSET will probably work.
    (Other than Altos 8600/586 see below)
    Patches, if required, would be minor since we have managed
    to provide successful patches (via phone call) to owners of
    previous versions.
For version of 11/21/83 to make Altos 8600/586 code work:
    Will still likely cause MP/M to fail mysteriously after running
    MODEM86.  Later versions will fix this. 
    In DDT86 on MP/M-86:
	A2058 TEST ES:BYTE PTR 04[BX],80	Was DI
	A2064 JMP 5030
	A5030 MOV AX,DS
	      MOV CL,4		These two insert this instruction.
	      ROL AX,CL
	      JMP 2068
	M208A,20B4,2081		These two will reorder instructions.
	A20AC POP SI
	      POP AX
	      ADD SI,204D
	      ADC AX,0000
	A2081 MOV CH,B4         Was 74
	A208A MOV CH,97		Was 57
	A2093 MOV CH,95		Was 55
	A20B9 MOV ES:BYTE PTR 0C[BX],AL		Was 0A
	      MOV ES:WORD PTR 0A[BX],SI		Was 0B
For version of 11/21/83 to make Godbout code work:
    In DDT86 on CP/M-86:
	A2991 CALL 2873		Was CALL 2863
	A2979 JMP 5030		Was MOV AX,[1864]
	A5030 PUSH AX		Was zeroes
	      MOV AL,[1864]
	      MOV DX,0007
              ADD DX,[1CA2]
	      CLI
	      CALL [15E2]
	      POP AX
	      RET
For version of 11/21/83:

	For CP/M-86:			Was:
	    A28FF MOV AL,08		MOV AL,09
		  XOR AL,37		XOR AL,36
	For MS-DOS:			Was:
	    A297F MOV AL,08		MOV AL,09
		  XOR AL,37		XOR AL,36
For version of 12/28/83 to make Altos 8600 code work:
    Will still likely cause MP/M to fail mysteriously after running
    MODEM86.  Later versions will fix this. 
    In DDT86 on MP/M-86:		Was:
	A2228 JMP 5050			MOV AX,[BX+11]
	A5050 MOV AX,[BX+11]		Patch area (zeroes)
	      MOV DX,AX
	      JMP 222B
	A2237 MOV BX,DX			MOV BX,AX
	A2154 JMP 5060			ES:INC BYTE 05[BX]
	A5060 ES:INC BYTE 05[BX]	Patch area (zeroes)
	      MOV BX,[2054]
	      ES:MOV BYTE 04[BX],83
	      MOV BX,[2052]
	      ES:INC BYTE 05[BX]
	      OR AL,TRUE
	      JMP 2158
For version of 12/28/83:
    MODEMSET does not allow choice of Customized Serial I/O BIOS:
    (Apply patch to MODEMSET, not MODEM86)
	For CP/M-86:			Was:
	    A50D NOP			JZ ...
		 NOP
	For MS-DOS:
	    A58D NOP 			JZ ...
		 NOP
For version of 12/28/83:
    Break causes MODEM86 to lock up on 2661/2651 code:
	For CP/M-86:			Was:
	    A2931 MOV AL,08		MOV AL,09
		  XOR AL,37		XOR AL,36
	For MS-DOS:			Was:
	    A29B1 MOV AL,08		MOV AL,09
		  XOR AL,37		XOR AL,36
For version of 01/19/83 to make Altos 8600 code work:
    May require patches...but it should not cause MP/M to fail now.
For version of 01/19/83:
    Break causes MODEM86 to lock up on 2661/2651 code:
	For CP/M-86:			Was:
	    A29BD MOV AL,08		MOV AL,09
