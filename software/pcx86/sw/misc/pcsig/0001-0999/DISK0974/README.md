## Information about "BIBLE QUIZ PLUS 1 OF 2 (ALSO 2126)"

    BIBLE QUIZ PLUS is a religious trivia game with three different levels
    of play for one to six players.  Questions are asked and answers can be
    in  multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, or answer only format.  These
    questions are from the Book of Psalms and the Book of Proverbs from the
    King James version of the Bible.
