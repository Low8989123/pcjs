The GRAPHIC COACH (v4.1) provides serious runners of all abilities an easy
and inexpensive way to monitor their current training, compare current
training to their past progress, and plan their training to improve future
fitness and race performance.  It utilizes the potential of computer
database and graphics functions as a personal coach of the user.
GRAPHIC COACH performs these valuable functions:
*Calculates training pace (minutes per mile) for each training and
     racing day.
*For each month it graphs the pace and distance for each day's run relative
     to the average pace for that month.
*Presents a table of any month listing the exact pace and distance of the
     runs, the average training pace for that month and the
     total distance run for the month.
*Graphs the monthly average pace and total miles run for the whole year.
*Presents a table of elapsed time, distance and pace for each race
     run in a year.
*Calculates and displays a specific training schedule
     (distance, pace and number of runs) for the next week, based on
     most recent 5K or 10K race elapsed time.
     The training schedule is based on calculated aerobic capacities
     and maximizes the training effect.

Version 4.1 of GRAPHIC COACH supports Microsoft compatible mice.
Version 4.1 also uses the color capabilities of EGA and VGA equipped systems
	to systematically use color to highlight and code running data
Hardware requirements: 128k RAM, DOS 2.0+, CGA, EGA, or VGA.

            The GRAPHIC COACH provides serious runners of all abilities
            an easy and inexpensive way to monitor their current












            training, compare current training to their past progress
            and plan their training to improve future fitness and race
            performance.  It utilizes the potential of computer database
            and graphics functions as a personal coach of the user.

            GRAPHIC COACH:

                 Calculates the pace (minutes per mile) for each
                 training and racing day.

                 Graphs the pace and distance for each day's run
                 relative to the average pace and reports the total
                 milage, for each month.

                 Presents a table of any month listing the exact pace
                 and distance of the runs, the average training pace for
                 that month and the total distance run for the month.

                 Graphs the monthly average pace and miles run per month
                 for the whole year.  Reports the cumulative miles run
                 per year.

                 Presents a table of elapsed time, distance and pace for
                 each race run in a year (up to 68 races).

                 Calculates and displays a specific training schedule
                 (distance, pace and number of runs) for the next week,
                 based on most recent 5K or 10K race elapsed time.  The
                 training schedule is based on calculated aerobic
                 capacities and maximizes the training effect.

                 On VGA/EGA compatible systems, systematically uses
                 color to indicate length of run, average pace, and
                 total miles run.

            REQUIREMENTS:

                 GRAPHIC COACH requires an IBM PC (or compatible) with a
                 graphics adapter (CGA, EGA or VGA) or a Compaq
                 computer, one disk drive, and PC or MS DOS 2.0 or
                 higher.  Computers with Hercules graphics adaptors may
                 be able to run this program by obtaining a CGA
                 simulation program available on most computer bulletin
                 boards.

            GETTING STARTED:

                 Make a backup of GRAPHIC COACH for your everyday use
                 and save the original disk for safekeeping.  Installing
                 DOS will allow you to start your computer with the
                 GRAPHIC COACH backup disk.

            FLOPPY DISK INSTALLATION













            Installing DOS (optional).

                 For PC DOS:

                 1)  Boot with DOS in floppy drive A and get the A>.

                 2)  If you have two floppy drives place a formatted
                 disk in drive B.  (If you have only one floppy drive,
                 don't worry, DOS will tell you when to put each disk in
                 your drive.)

                 3)  Type at the A> B:SETUP  and press enter.

                 4)  When the process is complete, the message "1 file
                 copied" will appear.

                 For MS DOS:

                 1)  Format a new disk with the format /s command.

                 2)  Copy the file COMMAND.COM to the newly formatted
                 disk.

                 II. Copying GRAPHIC COACH

            For 2 floppy drive systems:

                 1. Insert the original GRAPHIC COACH disk in drive A.

                 2. Insert the future backup disk in drive B.

                 3. Type at the A> copy a:*.* b:  and press enter.

            For 1 floppy drive systems:

                 1. Insert the original GRAPHIC COACH disk in drive A.

                 2. Type at the A> copy a:*.* b:  and press enter.

                 You will be prompted when to change floppy disks so
                 that all the files can be copied.  Remember:  "Source
                 disk" refers to the original GRAPHIC COACH disk, and
                 "target disk" refers to your future backup copy.

            Verifying backup

                 Place the backup disk in drive A and type at the A> dir
                 and press enter.

                 A list of files should be displayed which will include
                 the file coach4-1.exe.  This file on the backup disk
                 will verify that the backup was successful.

            HARD DISK INSTALLATION












                 1) From the root directory of the hard disk (C:\), make
                 a subdirectory for GRAPHIC COACH.  Use the DOS command
                 MD SUBDIRECTORYNAME, for example, MD COACH.

                 2) Use the command CD SUBDIRECTORYNAME (ex. CD COACH)
                 to move to that subdirectory.

                 3) Put the original GRAPHIC COACH disk in drive a: and
                 type copy a:*.*.  This will copy the necessary files to
                 the GRAPHIC COACH subdirectory.

            USING GRAPHIC COACH:

            Floppy Disk Systems

                 Using the back-up disk prepared above, GRAPHIC COACH
                 may be started in two ways.

                 1) If DOS was copied to a floppy backup disk you may
                 boot your computer with this backup disk and a batch
                 file (included on disk) will automatically start
                 GRAPHIC COACH after logging the date and time.

                 2) If DOS was not copied to the backup disk type at the
                 A> COACH4-1 and press enter.

            Hard Disk Systems

                 1) Use the CD SUBDIRECTORYNAME

                 2) Type COACH4-1 and press enter.

                 GRAPHIC COACH requires an IBM PC (or compatible) with a
                 graphics adapter (CGA, EGA or VGA) or a Compaq
                 computer, one disk drive, and PC or MS DOS 2.0 or
                 higher.  Computers with Hercules graphics adaptors may
                 be able to run this program by obtaining a CGA
                 simulation program available on most computer bulletin
                 boards.

            GETTING STARTED:

                 Make a backup of GRAPHIC COACH for your everyday use
                 and save the original disk for safekeeping.  Installing
                 DOS will allow you to start your computer with the
                 GRAPHIC COACH backup disk.

            FLOPPY DISK INSTALLATION













            Installing DOS (optional).

                 For PC DOS:

                 1)  Boot with DOS in floppy drive A and get the A>.

                 2)  If you have two floppy drives place a formatted
                 disk in drive B.  (If you have only one floppy drive,
                 don't worry, DOS will tell you when to put each disk in
                 your drive.)

                 3)  Type at the A> B:SETUP  and press enter.

                 4)  When the process is complete, the message "1 file
                 copied" will appear.

                 For MS DOS:

                 1)  Format a new disk with the format /s command.

                 2)  Copy the file COMMAND.COM to the newly formatted
                 disk.

                 II. Copying GRAPHIC COACH

            For 2 floppy drive systems:

                 1. Insert the original GRAPHIC COACH disk in drive A.

                 2. Insert the future backup disk in drive B.

                 3. Type at the A> copy a:*.* b:  and press enter.

            For 1 floppy drive systems:

                 1. Insert the original GRAPHIC COACH disk in drive A.

                 2. Type at the A> copy a:*.* b:  and press enter.

                 You will be prompted when to change floppy disks so
                 that all the files can be copied.  Remember:  "Source
                 disk" refers to the original GRAPHIC COACH disk, and
                 "target disk" refers to your future backup copy.

            Verifying backup

                 Place the backup disk in drive A and type at the A> dir
                 and press enter.

                 A list of files should be displayed which will include
                 the file coach42.exe.  This file on the backup disk
                 will verify that the backup was successful.

            HARD DISK INSTALLATION












                 1) From the root directory of the hard disk (C:\), make
                 a subdirectory for GRAPHIC COACH.  Use the DOS command
                 MD SUBDIRECTORYNAME, for example, MD COACH.

                 2) Use the command CD SUBDIRECTORYNAME (ex. CD COACH)
                 to move to that subdirectory.

                 3) Put the original GRAPHIC COACH disk in drive a: and
                 type copy a:*.*.  This will copy the necessary files to
                 the GRAPHIC COACH subdirectory.

            USING GRAPHIC COACH:

            Floppy Disk Systems

                 Using the back-up disk prepared above, GRAPHIC COACH
                 may be started in two ways.

                 1) If DOS was copied to a floppy backup disk you may
                 boot your computer with this backup disk and a batch
                 file (included on disk) will automatically start
                 GRAPHIC COACH after logging the date and time.

                 2) If DOS was not copied to the backup disk type at the
                 A> COACH42 and press enter.

            Hard Disk Systems

                 1) Use the CD SUBDIRECTORYNAME

                 2) Type COACH42 and press enter.
