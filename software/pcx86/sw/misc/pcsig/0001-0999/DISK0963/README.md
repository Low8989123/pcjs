## Information about "PAY-TIME PAYROLL SYSTEM (ALSO 1034)"

    For most of us, payday is one of the most important times of the week.
    Shouldn't you do your employees, and yourself, a favor by making this
    time one of the most error-free periods as well?
    
    PAY-TIME figures out your company payroll and writes the paychecks for
    your employees. Several sample data files are included to familiarize
    you with the program. Store information for each employee, including
    the person's name, mailing address, employee ID, Social Security number,
    and payroll status. Once all the information for the tax files are
    entered, you can edit, display, add, delete, and print the records.
