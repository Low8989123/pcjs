         PC-MAIL was programed on and designed for operation on true 
         IBM compatible machines. Unfortunately some compatibles are 
         not truly IBM compatibles. Every effort has been made to 
         assure PC-MAIL will be free from difficulties when operated 
         on compatible equipment, however, problems may be 
         experienced on occasional machines.. Should you encounter a 
         problem, please drop a note to FOTO 64, Inc. describing the 
         difficulty and your equipment configuration. This feed back 
         will assist in the development of future versions of PC-
         MAIL. 

         Assistance will be given to registered users to correct or 
         circumvent the compatibility difficulty.

         operated directly from the master PC-MAIL disk with no 
         alterations, The following steps are recommended for making 
         your master working disk.        
                                          
                           ** 5 1/4" DISK DRIVES **
            
             1.Format four disks as follows. 
               
                Place DOS System disk in drive A: and an 
                unformatted disk in drive B:. Enter at the A: prompt 
                the following:
         
                              A>format B:/V/S.

                DOS will validate the format and return  to the 
                system prompt. There can be no bad sectors on these 
                disks, as all available space will be required.

                       ** HARD DRIVE INSTALLATION  **

         To install PC-MAIL on a hard drive complete the following 
         steps.
                 
             13. Place your master PC-MAIL SYSTEM disk in A:

             14. Change the system default to the drive on which 
                 PC-MAIL is to be located. If drive C: then enter
                 A>C:
         
             15. Make a directory called PCMAIL by entering:
         
                                  C>MD PCMAIL 
         
             16. Change to the PCMAIL directory by entering:
         
                                 C>CD\PCMAIL
         
             17. Copy the PC-MAIL master system disk to the directory 
                 PCMAIL. Enter:
             
                                C>COPY A:*.*       

                                                                   16.
             18. Place the PCMAIL master utility disk in drive A:. 
                                                                   
             19. Copy the PC-MAIL master system disk to the directory 
                 PCMAIL. Enter:
                           
                                 C>COPY A:*.*
                                                               
             20. Place the PCMAIL master print disk in drive A:. 
                                                       
             21. Copy the PC-MAIL master print disk to the 
                 directory. Enter:

                                C>COPY A:*.*

             22. Complete and return the registration form with 
                 the registration fee.
                   
             23. PC-MAIL will now operate from the hard drive, but 
                 installation procedure is not complete.


                                                                 
         When you receive your registration/license number and                                    
         the access code complete the installation procedure
         by entering:
         
                                 C>INSTALLR  

             19. Follow directions outlined in steps 10 to 12.
                                                                       
         Maintaining the data files in the same directory as the 
         PC-MAIL operation files is not recommended. The data files
         work best if placed in their own directory or directories. 
         If your data will be stored on seperate disk prepare it a 
         outlined in steps 1 through 7.

                             ** 3 1/2" DRIVES **     
            
         If creating a 3 1/2" working disk from 5 1/4" PC-MAIL disk 
         set, copy all of the two disk set to the 3 1/2" drive. 
         Operate the 3 1/2" disk as you would a hard disk.



                                                                    17.
                          ** START UP OF PC-MAIL **
                                
         The program start up sequence is critical to  the proper 
         operation of PC-MAIL. Variables are set on the start up of
         PC-MAIL which are transferred to other routine. PC-MAIL was
         designed to function as a whole unit. 

         ---- INDIVIDUAL ROUTINES WILL NOT OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY. ----
         
         To simplify this start up two batch files have been included 
         on the master disk. If you are starting the program from a 
         monographic or colorgraphic system enter at the system 
         prompt the word PCM. If you have a dual color/bw system 
         enter PCMD while in the monographic system. These start up 
         sequence must be followed. 

         During start up PC-MAIL THE screen driver must be loaded 
         before any other program. This includes residential programs 
         such as SIDEKICK or XTREE. If you encounter difficulties 
         with program conflicts try operating PC-MAIL with out other 
         residential programs. If you still have difficulties contact

                              UPDATE - VERSION 2.91S

        Version 2.91 incorporated the feature known as "VARIABLE STRING 
        SEARCH" in the search/correct/delete routine. This feature 
        permitted the searching for a specific combination of characters 
        imbedded in the data records. for example, it is possible to 
        locate all last mames beginning with "MC" or "MAC" 

        The introduction of the "VARIABLE STRING SEARCH" made possible 
        the inclusion of more than one classificarion code, and the 
        searching for that code. This greatly increased the flexiblity
        of the search routine. 

        In version 2.92 this search ability has been extended to the
        classification code sorts of all print and utility routines.
        For example, if the Class Code field contains the following data.

                               "SJS/412/412A/HOME"

        If the sort criteria inputted is 412, the program will print all 
        records(addresses) containing 312 and 412A in class code field. 
        If the slash limiter is included, ie "412/", only the fields 
        containing  "412" will be printed. 

        The string search has only been extended to the classification 
        code field in the print and utilities routines.
