## Information about "LABEL MASTER"

    LABEL MASTER is a program for maintaining, sorting, and printing lists
    of names and addresses (mailing lists), with a couple of added
    twists.  You will find all the regular capabilities of a labeling
    program such as full search and replace on all fields, full screen
    records browsing, accommodation for international addresses, and a
    larger phone field to accommodate any size phone number.  The extra
    added twists you will find is a pop-up help system, pop-up calendar,
    pop-up digital clock, and pop-up calculator.  There's even a coffee
    break game built into the program for times of over-stress and
    under pay.
    
    LABEL MASTER will automatically date-stamp each new record in a
    "notes" field for future reference.  Label Master will print multiple
    labels across te page, and will pause after each page, if requested
    (great for single sheet labels).  The documentation consists of a
    brief description of each of the menu selections and a couple of
    paragraphs on installing the program on your system.
    
    You will find LABEL MASTER to be one of the easiest-to-use mailing
    list management programs around.
