## Information about "MISC. UTILITIES"

    This disk contains about twenty different utilities for your PC or
    compatible computer.  For example, the selective print screen utility
    will select the number of rows on the screen that you want to printout
    using the ``PrtSc'' option on your keyboard.  An ``unprotect'' guide
    helps you run ``Managing Your Money'' from a hard disk without
    inserting the original disk in drive A.
    
    Also included are communication utilities for Qmodem and other
    utilities for Microsoft Word; DOS command utilities within windows;
    some C language utilities; how to unprotect Chessmaster 2000; a

```
Documentation for DC1.COM  DOS color program

*******************************************************************************
Special note: Users of enhanced keyboards please remember that keyboard
              commands to DC1 must be issued with Number Lock off (otherwise
              the program will just ignore).  This is to avoid problems with
              BIOS routine's accomodation for entering ASCII codes directly
              from the keyboard via the ALT NumLock nnn combination.  This
              means that you will need to issue keyboard commands to DC1 from
              your NUMERIC keypad with NUMBER LOCK OFF.

              DON'T USE DC1 WITH A COMMAND.COM THAT'S BEEN PATCHED WITH MY
              CP21 patch.  The patch causes DOS colors to be redefined and
              my DC1 program won't work properly with it.

*******************************************************************************

KEYBOARD COMMANDS:

   After installing DC1 (by entering DC1 at the A> prompt: A>DC1) you can
easily flip through foreground, background, and border colors by ALT
arrow key combinations. These combinations are as follows:

              (WITH NUMBER LOCK OFF)

   ALT LEFT ARROW     Flips through 16 BORDER colors
   ALT UP ARROW       Flips through 16 FOREGROUND colors
   ALT RIGHT ARROW    Flips through 7 BACKGROUND colors

   ALT DOWN ARROW     Toggles program ON/OFF

Once you select the colors you want via the ALT ARROW KEY combinations----
you're set........Your selected colors will survive mode changes and
DOS CLS's (If you enter a graphics mode the program will deactivate itself
but your colors will once again return as soon as you enter back into a text
mode).


COMMAND LINE COMMANDS:

   After you've installed DC1 you can turn the program on and off, or cause
it to uninstall itself and return your memory via command line parameters.
These parameters are as follows:

   S  will suspend DC1  Example: A>DC1 S
   R  will resume DC1   Example: A>DC1 R

   V  will vacate DC1 and return memory to system pool Example: A>DC1 V


A WARNING ABOUT THE V PARAMETER:

   DON'T USE IT EXCEPT FROM THE DOS LEVEL (i.e. don't try to use it from a
                                           DOS shell).
   DON'T USE IF YOU'VE LOADED OTHER TSR (terminate stay resident) TYPE
   PROGRAMS AFTER YOU LOADED DC1. (as this could create "holes" in your memory
                                   --- and maybe cause a system crash).

*******************************************************************************

TRYING IT OUT:

   With the DC1.COM program on a disk in your A drive type  DC1

Example:  A>DC1

   A message telling you DC1 has installed itself and containing instructions
similiar to the above should appear on your screen.

   Now, make sure you're not in Number Lock mode (if you've got a standard PCjr
keyboard this is probably already the case).

   Press down on the ALT key (in lower left corner of your keyboard)

   While holding down on ALT press and release the LEFT ARROW key.

   Your border color should change. WOW!

   Hold down the ALT key and press LEFT ARROW repeatedly (this will have the
   effect of "flipping" through the border colors) until you find one you like.

   Now hold down ALT, press and release UP and RIGHT ARROW until you get
   foreground and background colors you find pleasing. It's that simple.

   OH MY GOSH! ALL MY TEXT HAS DISSAPPEARED!!!!!!!!!

   No, not really, your text is still there.  What's happened is that you've
   defined background and foreground to the same color.

   Just press ALT UP ARROW or ALT RIGHT ARROW and YOUR TEXT WILL REAPPEAR.

*******************************************************************************

TECHIE NOTES:
   DC1 works by redefining some values in the VGA registers.  It's a PCjr
specific, PCjr only program.

PROBLEMS:
  You can get ahold of me via Compuserve 74206,1751


OH, YEAH.

   Now that you got a DOS border you may notice that your screen isn't
   properly centered.  TO CENTER YOUR SCREEN:

      ALT + CTRL + RIGHT ARROW shifts screen right
      ALT + CTRL + LEFT ARROW shifts screen left

                          LINE26  Ver 2.00
                         (C) Copyright 1986
                      NetWork Business Systems
                         ALL RIGHTS RESERVED

                           Tue 11-Nov-86


LINE26 is an MS-DOS(TM) compatible memory-resident utility that displays
system status information on line 26, a portion of the monitor screen
not used by application programs. The status line consists of day of
week, date, caps, num & scroll indicators, and time of day.

LINE26 is a productivity enhancement tool that provides the computer
operator with access to important system variables within a
consistent format among various application programs.  This is accom-
plished by increasing the display area of the screen to include an
additional line of text located in the previously unused border area.
This "user friendly" utility reduces frustrating keyboard errors for
both "power users" and occasional or new computer users alike.

LINE26 is compatible with the color graphics adaptor and is active in 
screen modes 2 & 3 (80 column text) only with composite, color, and
Compaq(TM) monochrome-graphics monitors.

LINE26 is inactive when used with the monochrome, EGA, and Hercules(TM)
Graphics Card video adaptors.  (EGA compatibility is currenty under
development.)

To invoke LINE26, enter "LINE26 n" 
             
          where n is 0 = white on black  (default)
                     1 = white on blue
                     2 = black on green
                     3 = black on turquoise
                     4 = black on red
                     5 = black on purple
                     6 = black on yellow
                     7 = black on white
                     8 = inactivate LINE26

Color combinations may be changed, and LINE26 may be inactivated or re-
activated in 80 column text mode by entering "LINE26 n" with a new "n" 
parameter.  When an application program changes screen mode to graphics
or 40 column text, LINE26 remains resident but becomes inactive (no dis-
play).  As soon as screen mode returns to 80 column text, LINE26 re-
appears on the screen.  Compaq(TM) users may have LINE26 active in either
internal (Ctrl-Alt->) or external (Ctrl-Alt-<) screen modes.  When 
LINE26 is active, it always uses the currently displayed video page.
LINE26 will not "reload" to an additional memory location after it
is already resident.  LINE26 may be included in "autoexec.bat" as well
as other batch files providing a transparent means (through switching
the "n" parameter) of changing colors and active status of LINE26 with
various application programs.  LINE26 will not scroll on the screen,
and is not included in the printer output of "PrtSc" (Print Screen).

				(713) 946-8679  hm.



On with the documentation:

QUICKSTART:
As with much software, somethings are just easier to see for
yourself than they are to explain.  I suggest running it just to
see what it does before reading all of the documentation.  It is
really easy, I just don't know it the instructions are clear
enough or not.  I understand them, but I wrote it.  Load
Fkeys.xtk.  Then DO MIRRORDD.  If your in Houston, then many of the
boards are probably familier to you.  If not, just unplug the
phone and pretend.  Type A B C <ENTER> (no spaces) to the
prompts.  It should dial directory entries A, B and C in circular
fashion.  After it has dialed a few times, hit escape three times
quickly.  Hit F8.  It will delete from the queue the number it
was on and now only dial the other two numbers.  Hit escape 3
times quickly.  Now hit F9.  This time, it will not delete, it
will restart where it left off, dialing the two numbers.  Try
again and use F8 again.  There will only be one number left to
dial.  If it does not go smoothly, the rest of the documentation
should be of help.


INTRODUCTION:

MIRRORDD.XTS gives Mirror a dialing directory with simaler to Qmodem.
MIRRORDD.XTS is a scipt file that will allow you to dial in a
circular fashion up to ten numbers chosen from a menu.  As it is
a script file, it can run in the background while you are
working with other software in the foreground.  When it reaches
a connection, it will beep you, even if Mirror is in the
background.  When you finish that call, you have the option to
continue dialing the same list of numbers minus the one that you
reached.  In case you got disconnected,  you can have it
continue dialing the list including and starting with the one
you reached.  You can of course choose to use different function
keys than I use, but in expaining what to do, I will say "hit
F9" so you are stuck with learning my keys.  This is for my ease
of making this documentation.  You might also try a DO XFER right
away.  I think my documentation on it makes it sound like you
need a college degree in Mirror to use it, but its simple.

OPERATION:

Enter the command:  DO MIRRORDD <return.>  (Note: it will run a
little faster if you keep MIRRORDD.XTS on a RAM disk)   You will
be given a menu of 46 names.  Setting the directory entries up
will be covered in the section SET UP.  Beside each number is a
letter, digit, or special character such as ].  The command line
will prompt you for the first number for the queue.  Type the
letter of character to the left of the desired entry.  It will
prompt you for the second number.  Continue this process until
you have given it the entire list you wish to dial.  If you have
entered less than ten numbers, hit the return key to terminate the
list and start dialing.

When it gets a connection, you will be beeped.  Even if you were
processing in the foreground.  When you complete that call, you
can type the command JUmp Continue.  You will be prompted as to
whether you wish to delete from the queue.  Typing Y will delete
the number that you were connected to from the list.  Typing N
will not delete from the queue and will start dialing starting
with the number you were just connected to.  This is in case you
were inadvertantly disconnected.

Another way to accomplish restarting the list is to assign
function keys.  There are several labels in the program to
assist you.  If you set a function key to @JUMP DELETE|  hitting
that function will delete from the queue and start dialing.
@JUMP RECALL|  will start dialing from the last number.
@JUMP CONTINUE|  will prompt you if you wish to delete or not.

When dialing, you may wish to abort a dial and have it continue
with the list.  Hit the ESC key once.  You might wish to
delete from the queue.  For example, if you see that one number
is just ringing.  Hit the ESC key three times quickly.
Then do whichever method of deletion described above.  You might
wish to immediatly redial a number.  Hit the ESC key three times
quickly and do whichever method of recall as described above.
Note, the above suggestions only work if you hit the ESC key
before the dial in question is aborted by Mirror.  (before
timeout, busy, etc.)  If you wait to hit the ESC key after a
BUSY or NO CONNECTION message appears, it is to late to do as
described above.  (If you are to late you will delete the next call
from the queue; or you will restart from the next call in the
queue.)

SET UP:

Use your favorite editor to edit MIRRORDD.XTS.  Using Mirror's
built in editor is recomended because you will then be able to
edit MIRRORDD.XTS even if you have a program suspended in the
background.

The first section is a the menu section.  You will see two
columns of letters and other characters.  Beside each letter,
put in the name of a computer system you wish to have in your
directory.  Leave insert off to avoid moving of the columns
around.  But this section does nothing but give you the menu, so
its appearance is up to you.

Farther down in the program is a label, LABEL START-DIAL.  You
may wish to use your editor's search capability to find it.  Its
purpose is to initial all of your stardard parameters before it
starts to dial.  If you're like most people, you probably don't
change vary many parameters from one system to another,
especially if your modem supports automatic speed setting.  But
you may find one system requires 7 data bits and others require
8.  Later, I will tell you where to put the DAta 7 statement for that
one number.  But rather than now having to put a DAta 8 under all
other numbers, instead, put DATA 8 on a line under
START-DIAL.  Alternatively, you may wish to reload your entire STD
file.  You will need to convert your STD.XTK to a nested script
file.  To do this, copy STD.XTK to STD.XTS.  Change the last
statement which should be a GO statement to a RTurn statement.
Then put a DO STD statement under START-DIAL.  NOTE:  The
statements after START-DIAL are executed before it starts to
dial the chain, not between each dial.  Therefore, it will not
slow down redials if you put nested script files under
START-DIAL.

Farther down is where you place the names and phone numbers.
There is a section that that looks like the following:

LABEL CALL-A
NAME
NUMBER
GO R1/45
IF -$ JUMP @C10
JUMP ONLINE

LABEL CALL-A is for menu choice A, CALL-B is for menu choice B,
and so on.  Put each name and number into this section.  Make
sure they corrospond to what you put into the menu section.  If
this particular system is one that requires 7 data bits, put a
DATA 7 statemtent between the IF -$ and the the JUMP ONLINE
statements.  You can put as much as you want here.
Alternatively, you may wish to call a nested script file.
Perhaps even one that was created with the LRn command.  Be sure
it ends with a RTurn statement.  You will note you won't have to
stick in DATA 8 statements anywhere else because you already put
it under START-DIAL.  (This has been an example of course)


NOTE:  MIRRORDD.XTS uses the alternate function key assignments to
store what numbers to dial.  It also uses FK C7,C8,C9 and C10 as
internal variables.

Another hint:  It is suggested you set the first two characters
of the Call Progress string to hyphens.  (ie. disable NO
CONNECTION)  First of all, this message means your modem timed
out and it should not be set to time out before Mirror does.  If
your modem times out first, lengthen its timeout.  This is
stored in register 7 of Hayes compatable modems.  Second of all,
a NO CONNECTION message from you modem can get stored into
Mirror's buffer and foul the next redial.  If everytime you
start to redial, the first redial gets aborted, then this is
what is happening!!!  I was told this bug with Mirror had been
corrected, but I find it not works fine with my old setup, so I
haven't messed with it.



XTRA...XTRA...XTRA:  NEW FEATURES:

Once Mirror detects that a call has been successful, it will put
itself into a WAit Manual mode.  This means that the script file
has been suspended so that you can continue it.  The JUmp
statements unsuspend the script file.  But if you decide to run
another script file while MIRRORDD is suspended, MIRRORDD will
get aborted.  I wish Mirror would treat such a condition as a
nested script file, but it doesn't.  There is a get around.
But before I descibe it, I will tell you that I
made some mods to help keep MIRRORDD from getting aborted by getting
it to run nested script files.  But then I figured I might as well
set it up so that it can easily be restarted.  To restart Mirrordd, just hit
F10 (rerun MIRRORDD), then a return to the first prompt.  You will be asked
whether or not you wish to delete (from the previous queue) and
you will continue as though nothing has happened.  This assumes you
don't mess with the function keys I have reserved for MIRRORDD.

The next couple of paragraphs show how to get Mirrordd to run nested
script files.  This will keep it from getting aborted.  But you can
really just ingore this feature as you might as well just restart.  A DO
by itself will unsuspend MIRRORDD.  MIRRORDD will now ask you what
script file you wish to run.  If you hit return, it will give you
a menu of the script files from the current drive and directory.
If you hit return again, MIRRORDD will return to suspended mode.
If you tell it to run a script file that ends in a RTurn, it will
return to suspended mode, retaining the ability to Delete or
Recall.  I set up F5 to @DO| to do this.  As I said, you if you
do as I say, you will still be able to hit F8 or F9 to restart
the queue.  From now on, all my script files end with these two lines:

Label RTurn
RTurn

If the script in question wasn't really nested, this satement
will have no effect.  I set up F7 to @JUmp RTurn|.  This is in
case I abort a script file run as a nested script via the method
described above.  I hit F7, this will get me out of the
nested script, back to MIRRORDD, suspended.  F8 and F9 work.

In case you didn't understand what I've said in the last couple of
paragraphs, let me restate it a bit.  I first tried to find a work-
around to keep MIRRORDD from getting aborted when running other
script files.  I set MIRRORDD to up to run nested script files.
A DO command will get MIRRORDD to run a nested script file.  Then
I decided that I would like to make MIRRORDD restartable even if
it does get aborted.  This is the F10 <return> (rerun MIRRORDD)
method.  Below, when
I describe XFER.XTS, I say to type DO <return> XFER <return>  rather
than just DO XFER <return>  This is because the later method will
get MIRRORDD aborted.  But if you want, you can really ignore all
the garbage about RTurns and keeping MIRRORDD active and just use
the F10 <return> method.

As of now, I'm including two script files set up like this.
The first, NS.XTS is very simple, but it may make you realize a
little script file might make your life easier.  When I ask a
BBS for a list of all files in all directories, it will keep
asking me Y,N,NS?  Even if I type NS (non stop) when it gets to
the next directory, it will ask again.  NS.XTS makes an infinite
loop to watch for [NS]?  or NS?  And will reply NS|

XFER.XTS is a file transfer menu.  Believe me, I'm not a menu
finatic and I would just as soon type RX xxxx.xxx than put up a
menu asking me what protocol, etc.  But since Mirror won't beep
at you when it completes a transfer, I needed at least a small
script file to ALarm after the transfer.  Second of all, since a
lot of Sysops don't like you to set up a download and leave the
BBS to timeout afterwords, it is set up that if you don't do
respond within 5 seconds after the end-of-transfer alarm, it will
log off.  XFER isn't too smart at logging off, but it works for
the BBS's I've so far tried it with.  It sends a G| for goodbye.
Then it sends N| for those boards that ask if you want to leave a
comment.  For those boards that ask if your sure you want to log
off, it then sends G| then Y| then N| then BYe.  You may need to make
this smarter if it won't always log you off.  Enter DO <return>
XFER <return>.  I use F5 for DO| and F6 for XFER|
It will give you a menu of protocols, ask you if you are
receiving or xmitting, and the file name.  While some protocols
do not allow specifying the file name on the receiver, they all
allow at least a path name.  Some protocols even allow a second
parameter.  If necessary, just type this in too.  Just remember
that when it asks for filename, just type whatever you would
type if you were entering the command yourself.  The command
structure to my menu is set up so that you type the same thing
you would ordinarily type, but give you the added features as
described above.  For instance XX is the Mirror command to xmit with
xmodem and the XFER command to do likewise.  The menu is
put on the status screen, then you are put back on the terminal screen.
My menu also adds RS which means receive single file ymodem protocol.
And RN for no error checking version of ymodem.  According to SoftKlone,
these options are not needed for the transmit ymodem, but I do have
XN and XS on my menu.  These menu choices just append a /s or /n to
the command for you.  You can do this yourself by using the normal
RY command and appending a /s or /n to the filename.  This is what you
have to do if you want both (according to SoftKlone, use /sn)  And you
can also do this with the /t option.  I've never messed with these, so
I don't really know if my menu options work, but they should.

PERSONAL NOTES:
An off line utility maintanance utility would ease set up of the
dialing directory.  I have thought about writing such a utility.
Features that it would have would include easy entry of names
and phone numbers, set up of length of time allowed per dial,
whether it would be silent or alarm, etc.  I also thought about
having it set up nested scripts so that a person could have it
call up to 10 BBS's and automatically get all of his messages
off of each board.  The nested scripts would most likely be
created by the LRn command.  Presently, the dialing directory is
limited to one screen of 46 numbers.  I have also planned to add
additional screens.  Adding multiple pages would start to make
the script file rather large.  Of course that really doesn't hurt
anything.  But one small enhancement to the script language would
eliminate one large section of code.  There is a section of code
that follows the following pattern:

LABEL SET-A
@C9 CALL-A
JUMP @C10

This entire section would not be needed if I could simply have
a statement:  @C9 CALL-@   where the present value of @ would be
processed.

               HOW TO RUN "MANAGING YOUR MONEY(tm)" FROM A
                  HARD DISK WITHOUT THE "KEY" DISK AND 
                      WITHOUT PROGRAM MODIFICATIONS 

         If you wish to run "Managing Your Money" (including version 
     2.0) from a hard disk, but are annoyed by the requirement for 
     having the original disk 1 in drive A, then read on....  

         Part of this ARC file is the program "MYMFIX.COM".  All you have to
     do is to include this program in your "autoexec" file when running
     Managing Your Money.  For instance, your "autoexec.bat" might look like
     this:

         DATE
         TIME
         MYMFIX  (to install "MYMFIX")
         MYM
         MYMFIX  (to uninstall "MYMFIX")

         That's all there is to it.  MYM will no longer look for the key 
     disk in drive A.  If you are using version 2.0 of MYM, when the 
     request is made to put the key disk in drive A, simply proceed as 
     though you had actually inserted the disk.  

     A request:

         If you find this program of value and wish to encourage the
     availability of similar programs in the future, then you may wish

Did you see the writeup in the August issue of PC Tech Journal about disk
cacheing?  They have good things to say about Super PC-Kwik.  Have you seen
the shareware version of PC-Kwik, usually found in the arc file

    SHAREPCK.ARC

If you have tried it, you probably got disgusted looking at all 6 (count
em, 6) of the opening screens.  The following is a simple patch to stop the
screen display of the 6 opening screens, and also the necessity of hitting
return 6 times.  The first patch gets rid of the call to the subroutine
which displays the screens and waits for the ENTER keys.  The second part of
the patch is necessary because the writers were sneaky.  They incremented a
counter each time you pressed enter, and later they check this counter and
reboot your system if the counter is not equal to 6.  What is this?  Reminds
me of copy protection in a so-called "shareware" program.

I created this patch mainly because I enjoy tinkering with the innards of such
programs.  It is not my intention to deprive MultiSoft Corporation of their
right to registration fees if you use their program.  As a matter of fact, I
encourage you to register your copy if you use it regularly.  Shareware will
only work if we support it.  However, I resent anyone who releases a program
as "shareware" and then makes you look at six screens of advertising every
time you use the program.

On to the actual operation.  Extract the files from the Sharepck.arc file,
and copy three files onto a blank, formatted floppy disk.  The three files
are:
      1.  SHAREPCK.COM      The "shareware" version of PC-KWIK
      2.  DEBUG.COM         from your DOS disk.  Any version >= 2.00
      3.  PCKWKPAT.SCR      The other file that come along with this doc file

Make the disk drive containing the new floppy the default drive, and then
type in:
         DEBUG   <PCKWIKPAT.SCR

This will alter the SHAREPCK.COM file.

## SPS.DOC

```
          SPS.COM ver 2.0 by Bob Montgomery, 4-23-87

This is a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program which does  a
Selective  Print Screen (hence the name SPS). Once installed,  it
vectors  interrupt 5 (the print screen interrupt) to itself,  and
sits waiting for a print screen request. When you request a print
screen,  the  cursor is moved to the top of the screen,  and  the
prompt  'Set  start  position' appears in the  lower  right  hand
corner.  The  cursor  can be moved around  the  screen  with  the
following keys:

     Right arrow - move cursor right; stops at right edge
     Left arrow -  move cursor left; stops at left edge
     Up arrow -    move cursor up one line; stops at top line
     Down arrow    move cursor down one line; stops at bottom line
     Page Up       move cursor to top line
     Page Down     move cursor to bottom line
     ^Right arrow  move cursor to right edge of screen
     ^Left arrow   move cursor to left edge of screen
     Home          move cursor to upper left corner of screen
     End           move cursor to lower right corner of screen
     P             Print whole screen
     Escape        Cancel print screen

When the cursor is at the desired start position, press Enter and
the prompt 'Set end position' will appear in the lower right hand
corner.  Move the cursor to the desired end position,  and  press
Enter  again. The text within the rectangle defined by the  start
and end positions will then be printed.

If  you don't want to do a print screen, press Escape  to  cancel
the operation and return to the interrupted program. If you  want
to print the whole screen, press the P (upper or lower case) key.

Before the printer starts printing, the prompt in the lower right
corner  is  removed  and the original text is  restored.  If  the
printer  is  not  ready (or deselected), a  prompt  'Printer  not
ready'  will  appear  in the lower right  corner  after  about  2
seconds. Then after about 10 seconds, if the printer is still not
ready,  the  print  screen operation aborts and  returns  to  the
interrupted  program.  If during the print screen  operation  the
printer  becomes  'not ready', a prompt will tell you  this,  and
give you about 10 seconds to fix the problem before aborting.

The  program only traps interrupt 5 (print screen) until  invoked
by  pressing Shift PrtSc. Then, it vector the timer and  keyboard
interrupts  (8 and 9) to itself, and saves the old vectors.  When
it is done, it puts the old vectors back, and quits. In this way,
it is essentialy 'not there' until called, and 'not there'  after
it  is  done. This means that it will not  interfere  with  other
programs,  and  not  cause  additional  processing  delays.  Once
invoked, it traps all keyboard input and does not pass it on,  so
the  interrupted  program, other TSRs, and BIOS never  know  that
keys have been pressed. Since the last thing BIOS knew before the
program  was invoked was that the Shift and PrtSc keys  had  been
pressed, the releasing of the Shift key is passed on so that BIOS
can do its housekeeping; releasing the PrtSc key does not  affect
the  BIOS housekeeping, so it is not passed on. This  means  that
the  program must service the keyboard each time it generates  an
interrupt 9, a job which is normally done by BIOS.

This program  solves  a number of problems, some  of  which  were
present with the previous version of SPS by Paul Trioano.

     1. Passing  keys  on is sometimes a problem,  because  other
        programs (like CED) will save the keypresses, and act  on
        them  after the interrupting program quits.
     2. Sending  the  screen characters directly is  sometimes  a
        problem,  since  some screens contain  control  character
        (below  20h) and make them appear as blanks  by  changing
        the attribute to black on black; HDIR is an example. This
        will  cause  the printer output to not  match  the  video
        screen.
     3. Routing  interrupts  thru  a program  when  not  required
        takes  extra processing time, and can cause  interference
        with other programs.

The source code is included, and is liberally commented to  allow
those  interested to understand how it works. It uses  only  BIOS
calls  and no DOS calls; DOS calls will not work in TSR  programs
because DOS is not re-entrant. It has been tried on the XT and AT
with no problems, so will probably work on all machines with  IBM
compatible  BIOS. If you have any problems or comments,  leave  a
message  with the Black Hole BBS in Orlando, Florida, (305)  260-
6397. Enjoy.

        PURPOSE:

        This utility creates incredibly quick multi-level windows
        in Turbo Basic programs for IBM PC/XT/AT compatibles.


        TEST DRIVE:

        Compile and run the tutoring program DEMO20.BAS to get a feeling
        for features and speed.


        FILES:

        In this version, TBWINDO.ARC contains:
            TBWINDO.INC  - Turbo Basic include file
            QPRINT.BIN   - Quick print inline subroutine
            QPRINTC.BIN  - Quick print between columns
            QATTR.BIN    - Re-attribute an area of the screen
            QFILL.BIN    - Fill an area of the screen with a
                           specified character and attribute

            Assembly language source code for all BIN files is included
            for all those interested.  Any suggestion for improvements to
            the code would be appreciated, as I do not profess to be good
            at Assembly Language.

        USING TBWINDO

        Include the TBWINDO.INC program in your program with
        the following statement:

        $INCLUDE "TBWINDO.INC"

        Dimension the array for screen saves(see below).

        Set the SNOCHK% variable (see below).

        You invoke the routines by means of a CALL with a list of
        parameters, rather than a GOSUB.








        Using the MAKEWINDOW procedure:

        CALL MAKEWINDOW(ROW%,COL%,ROWS%,COLS%,ATTR%,BRDRSEL%,SHADOW%,ZOOM%)

        Where: ROW - the screen row of the upper left hand corner of your
                     desired window.  Value should be between 2 and 23
                     (for reasons explained below).  WARNING - the subroutines
                     doe not check for proper values. You must check these
                     yourself or accept the consequences.

               COL - the screen column of the upper left hand corner. Value
                     should be between 2 and 79.

              ROWS - the number of rows long the window should be.

              COLS - the number of columns wide the window should be.

              ATTR - the attribute of the window colors.

           BRDRSEL - the border you desire around the window.  Valid
                     selections in this release are:

                        0 - No Frame (just a border of BACKground
                            color.
                        1 - Single Line Frame
                        2 - Double Line Frame
                        3 - Single Horizontal Line, Double Vertical
                            Line Frame
                        4 - Single Vertical Line, Double Horizontal
                            Line Frame

            SHADOW - Another "switch" to indicate if the window should
                     have a black "shadow" under it offset down and to
                     the left. This gives a three-dimensional effect
                     that seems to "raise" the window away from the
                     screen. A value of 1 indicates a shadow is desired
                     while a value of 0 means no shadow.

              ZOOM - A "switch" used to indicate to the subroutine if
                     the window should "grow" from a small box at the
                     midpoints of the coordinates to full size. A value
                     of 1 indicates the window should grow. A value of
                     0 indicates it should not.























        using the TITLEWINDOW procedure:

        CALL TITLEWINDOW(LOC%,TITLE$)

        Where: LOC - Indicates where the title should be placed.  Valid
                     selections are:

                        1 - Top left hand corner
                        2 - Top center
                        3 - Top right hand corner
                        4 - Lower left hand corner
                        5 - Lower center
                        6 - Lower right hand corner

             TITLE - The string data you would like printed.

                     NOTE:  The TITLEWINDOW procedure uses the coordinates
                            from the most recent use of MAKEWINDOW.  Use this
                            procedure only after a call has been made to
                            MAKEWINDOW.

        Using the FNATTR% function:

        FNATTR%(FORE%,BACK%)

        Where: FORE - is the foreground color.  Any Turbo Basic color
                      number is valid.

               BACK - is the backgound color.  Any Turbo Basic background
                      color number is valid.

               FNATTR% returns the attribute of the colors specified.


        Using the SAVESCRN procedure:

        First you must  define  an  integer array  with  a  dimension
        of 2000 (allowing for 4000 bytes)  for each screen you store, early
        in the program.  If you plan on saving screens three deep then the
        array must be 6000.

        When making the call to SAVESCRN, you  must  pass the location of
        this array as follows:
                   10 DIM SCRDATA%(2000)
                   .
                   80 SNOCHK%=0:'Test retrace (1 will not test retrace)
                   90 FIRST%=VARPTR(SCRDATA%(0))
                  100 CALL SAVESCRN(SNOCHK%,FIRST%)
        Also,  since  the  SAVESCRN operation 'loses' the position of the
        cursor, you should preserve it prior to making the  call  if  you
        need it as follows:
                   90 OLDX=CSRLIN:OLDY=POS(0)
        The RESTSCRN procedure is used in exactly the same way:
                  200 CALL RESTSCRN(SNOCHK%,FIRST%)
        and  if  necessary,  the cursor position can be restored by using
        the following statement:
                  210 LOCATE OLDX,OLDY









        Using the CALCATTR procedure:

        CALL CALCATTR(FORE%,BACK%,ATTR%)

        Where: FORE - Is the foreground color. Valid numbers are 0-31.

               BACK - Is the background color. Valid numbers are 0-7.

               ATTR - The attribute is returned in this variable.

                   CALL CALCATTR(15,1,ATTR%)
                   Y% = ATTR%

        Using the RECOLOR procedure:

        CALL RECOLOR(OLDATTR%,NEWATTR%,SNOCHK%)

        Where: OLDATTR - Is the attribute of the areas on the screen
                         you wish to change.

               NEWATTR - Is the attribute of the color you want.

               SNOCHK  - Snow checking switch.

                    X% = SCREEN(1,1,1)  ' RETURNS CURRENT SCREEN ATTRIBUTE
                    CALL CALCATTR(14,4,ATTR%) ' CALCULATE NEW ATTRIBUTE
                    CALL RECOLOR(X%,ATTR%,SNOCHK%)

                    This will recolor everything on the screen that has
                    the same attribute a the upper left corner of the screen
                    to a foreground of 14 and a background of 4.


        All of the above variables (with the exception  of  TITLE$)  must
        either  be  declared  globally  as  integers by means of a DEFINT
        statement early  in  the  program;  or  must  have  the  specific
        integer  identifier  (%)  attached  wherever  they  appear in the
        program. The BASIC compiler is picky about this; so  be  sure  to
        verify that the type assignment is correct.

        TBWINDO  requires  no special handling when it comes to compiling
        your program. Just  make  certain  that  all  of  your  variables
        passing  parameters  to  the TBWINDO subroutine are identified as
        integers, and you will  be  able  to  proceed  with  the  compile
        operation as with any other program.
