## Information about "FIVE DICE GAME"

    Get ready to roll!  FIVE DICE GAME is a fun way to play dice.  It is
    played by two or more players, with the object to attain a score of
    5000 points or more.  Each player rolls the dice, accumulating a score
    as long as he rolls scoring dice.  If he fails to roll any score, he
    loses his turn and a "scratch" is posted against him.  After any player
    has 5000 points, every other player gets one more chance to beat that
    score.  The game can be played by up to 15 human or
    computer-controlled players (counting yourself).  The computer can play
    any of three different strategies, from very conservative to fairly
    aggressive.
    
    The program is very easy to run and instructions are included.  This is
    an excellent program for any user -- novice to expert.  The Turbo Pascal
    source code is included in case you want to modify or write your own
    computer opponents.

Five is based on a dice game played by two or more players. The object of
the game is to accumulate a score of 5000 points or more. Each player rolls
the dice, accumulating scoring dice as long as he rolls scoring dice, if he
fails to roll any score, he loses his turn and a 'scratch' is posted
against him. After any player has 5000 points, every other player gets one
more chance to beat that score. At the end, the player with the highest
score wins. Each losing player pays the winner $0.25 for the game, and
$0.10 for each scratch. A typical losing score is five to ten scratches.
The gam ecan be played by up to 15 human or computer controlled players
(counting yourself). The computer can play any of three different
strategies from very conservative to fairly aggressive. This game is
extremely addictive I found myself playing for literally hours at a time.
The program is is very simple to operate and instructions are provided
within the program if requested. This is an excellent program for any user,
novice to expert. The source code is included in case you wish to modify or
write your own computer players. The source language is Turbo Pascal. The
program will run on any IBM-PC or compatable with at least 128 K of memory
