## Information about "TEACHER'S DATABASE FOR THE CLASSROOM"

    TEACHER'S DATABASE is designed particularly for teachers to organize
    information on their students.  The database can track up to 500
    students, each student having as many as 80 individual items of data in
    his record.
    
    Store names and addresses, alphabetize or reorder records based on their
    contents, sort by homerooms or subjects, and print individual student
    progress reports, class gradebook sheets, and student seating charts.
    
    Student test scores may be weighted, averaged, statistically analyzed,
    changed to a percentage or a letter grade.  Graphs of student test
    results may be created using the computer's high-resolution graphic
    screen.  Grade distribution can be displayed numerically or as a
    histogram.  A spreadsheet-style editor makes data entry and editing a
    snap.
    
    Let the computer do the paperwork while you focus on teaching.  After
    all, that's why you became a teacher.

                                 TEACHERS' DATABASE 4.0
                                  by David G. Bodnar


          Teachers' Database 4.0 (TDB) is a program designed to allow
        teachers to keep a computerized file of information about their
        students.  Version 4.0 has been totally redesigned for ease of use and
        efficiency while maintaining its reputation as the most complete and
        full-featured grade book program available.

          The program requires an IBM or an IBM compatible computer with at
        least 256K of RAM and a single floppy disk drive.

          - Information on as many as 500 students may be in the computer at
            one time.

          - Students may have as many as 80 individual items of data in their
            record.

          - Spreadsheet style data entry and editing makes the program easy
            to learn and use.

          - The program has many easy to follow menus.

          - Records may be easily changed, deleted, or combined.

          - Information about students may be numerical or text.

          - Records may be quickly alphabetized or reordered based on their
            contents.

          - Records may be sorted by various criteria.

          - A full statistical analysis, including mean, median, mode and
            standard deviation, may be done and sent to the printer.

          - Student test scores may be weighted, averaged, changed to a
            percentage or changed to a letter grade.  

          - Letter grades may be changed into percentages.

          - Individual student progress reports and class grade book sheets
            may be printed.

          - Random student data entry speeds the task of typing in student
            grades and test results.

          - Student seating charts may be created and printed.

          - Graphs of student test results may be created using the
            computer's high resolution graphic screen.

          - Grade distribution can be displayed numerically or as a
   version 4.0            histogram.

                             WHAT IS TEACHERS' DATABASE?

          A database is simply a computer program that is designed to store
        and manipulate information.  TDB is designed to store and act upon the
        types of information that teachers face in their work.

          At the beginning of a school year TDB can be used to store student
        names and addresses, alphabetize, sort by homerooms or subjects, print
        student grade book pages, print seating charts and simplify other
        numerous clerical tasks. Throughout the school year TDB can perform
        all of the functions of the classic teacher's grade book without the
        bother of using a calculator for computing totals, averages,
        percentages, etc.  More importantly, once a student's name has been
        entered into TDB once you should never have to hand write that name
        again.  Every time a class list or report is needed TDB can generate
        it for you.

          TDB can also take all of the information that it holds and create
        custom printouts for insertion into 'normal' grade books.  Creation of
        individualized student grade reports and seating charts becomes a
        snap.

                   *** IMPORTANT! *** READ THESE NOTES BEFORE USING TDB ***

        ++Make a backup copy of the TDB disk before using it.  Follow the
          instructions in Appendix A at the end of this manual.

        ++Whenever you see a word or letter in this manual in these brackets,
          <>, it means to press that key.  For example, if the manual
          instructs you to press <A>, simply press the A key.

        ++Do not press <ENTER> after selecting an item from one of the menus. 
          You only need to press <ENTER> if there is a flashing cursor on the
          screen.  If no flashing cursor is present just pressing the key
          will select the option that you want.

        ++When you are completely done with the program press <Q>, for quit,
          from the main menu.  This will end the program and erase all data
          from memory and return you to DOS, the >A prompt.

        ++Although it is not absolutely necessary, it is recommended that the
          CAPS LOCK button be used throughout TDB.  Lower case is best
          reserved for headings, comments and category titles.

        ++Throughout this program you will find that pressing <F1> or <ESC>
          will return you to the menu.  If in doubt or in trouble press <F1>
          and/or <ESC>.

        ++ See Appendix B for an important note about making back-up files.

        ++ Sample printouts from TDB are at the end of the manual.

          TDB is composed of 4 programs but you only need to concern yourself
        with the main program, TDB, since it will load and run the other
        programs for you.  To start boot your computer, place the TDB disk
        into the disk drive and type TDB at the A> prompt and press <ENTER>.
        The drive will run for several moments and the first menu will be
        displayed.  You will be asked to choose one of the following:

          EDIT, PRINT, GRAPH & SEATING CHART and CUSTOM are the programs that
        make up TDB.  It was necessary to break TDB up into four smaller
        programs so that more memory would be available for student names and
        information.

          EDIT is the part of TDB that is used most often for day-to-day
        entry and editing of student names and test scores.  It allows you to
        enter scores from a randomly arranged pile of papers or in sequential
        (alphabetical) order.  You can also compute averages, percentages,
        letter grades, weight scores, rank students by percentage or letter
        grade, drop high or low scores and print lists of missing or
        incomplete grades.

          PRINT allows you to take all of the information in TDB and to print
        it in the form of grade book sheets and simple or very elaborate
        student progress reports.  It also will print blank grade book sheets
        to ease your transition from a 'normal' grade book to TDB.

          CUSTOM allows you to change many things that TDB does so that the
        program will better fit your grading methods.  It also permits you to
        set up the program so that you can use your printer's special
        features.

          GRAPH AND SEATING CHART will print seating charts, randomly or
        alphabetically, using the student lists that are entered into TDB.  It
        will also display or print information about student grade
        distribution numerically, as a histogram or as a bar graph.  A
        complete statistical analysis can be made of a groups performance on a
        test.

          FOREGROUND, BACKGROUND and MODE allow you to change the foreground
        and background colors of the screen.  If you wish to make these
        changes permanent select C, for custom, after setting the colors. 
        When finished with the custom menus answer yes to the question that
        asks if you want save present values.  The next time the program
        starts it will come up with the color scheme that you selected.

          Throughout TDB similar menus will be displayed.  To choose an
        option from the menu simply press the key that is to the left of the
        option that you want.  For example, to choose B Begin new file you
        would press the <B> key.  DO NOT press <ENTER> after pressing <B>. 
        Remember, it is not necessary to press <ENTER> unless there is a
        flashing cursor on the screen.

        B Begin new file
          Press <B> from the main edit menu to begin a new student list.

        Note:  If student information has already been typed or loaded from
               disk you will be cautioned that any names in memory will be
               erased.  If you need to save a list answer <N> and save the
               list.  Otherwise press <Y>.

          Type each student's name, LAST NAME <comma> FIRST NAME.  Use the
        CAP LOCK key to insure that the name is typed in all capital letters. 
        (You can have the program automatically change names to lower case for
        printouts.)  Use SMITH,SALLY as our first student.  After you have
        finished typing the name press <ENTER>.  If you make a mistake you can
        correct before pressing <ENTER> by using <LEFT ARROW> or <RIGHT ARROW>
        to move to the error and typing over it.  You can insert letters by
        pressing <INSERT>.  Note that when inserting the cursor is larger then
        when in typeover mode.  You can delete a letter with <DELETE> or
        <BACKSPACE>.

          If you notice that you made an error after you have pressed
        <ENTER>, make a note of the student's number and you can use the
        editor to correct it later.

          Type and enter several more names, BROWN,BILLY and ANDERSON,JIMMY
        will do.  If you forget to use a comma between the last and first
        names an error message will remind you.  After the last name is typed,
        press <ENTER> then press <F1> to return to the main EDIT menu.
        V  View names
          From the main menu you can view the names that you have entered by
        pressing <V>.  Press <SPACEBAR> to start the display of names and
        press it again to pause.  After they have been displayed press <ANY
        KEY> to return to the main menu.

        N  Notes
          You may leave notes or comments about a set of grades by pressing
        <N>, for notes, from the main menu.  You will find yourself in the
        screen editor that you used to enter student names.  You may type up
        to 3 lines of comments about the grades that have been entered.  You
        may wish to include the date of the last entry, scores that need to be
        added, reminders about makeup tests, etc.  Whatever notes you leave
        will be saved with the file of names and grades and displayed at the
        bottom of the main menu when the file is loaded.  Exit the screen
        editor by pressing <ENTER>.  See Appendix D for a complete description
        of the screen editor and its functions.

        S  Save file
          To save our file of students and names press <S> from the main
        menu.  As soon as <S> is pressed you will find the current notes
        displayed.  This serves as a reminder that you may wish to update your
        notes before saving.  If you wish to make no changes simply press
        <ENTER>.

          Type a file name under which the list will be saved on the disk. 
        This name must be no more than 8 characters in length and it is wise
        to use only letters and/or numerals in the name.  Avoid other
        characters, especially spaces, . and *.  The name must not have an
        extension.  Use JUNK for this file name since the 3 names we have
        typed are not very important to us.  Press <ENTER> and the file will
        be saved and you will return to the main menu.  You should get into
        the habit of saving your files on 2 or more disks to protect against
        losing information.  The easiest way to do this is to switch to a
        second, formatted, disk and repeat the above steps.  The second time,
        however, the computer remembers that you named the file JUNK and you
        can just press <ENTER> when asked for file name and the file will be
        saved with the name JUNK.  If you wish to change the name, to GARBAGE
        for example, just type GARBAGE and press <ENTER>.

          If you have two drives you may also save the file to Drive B by
        keying <S> again from the main menu and typing B: (B and colon) when
        asked for a file name.  The file will be saved on Drive B with the
        same name, JUNK.  If you do not have two drives, it is a good idea to
        get into the habit of swapping disks and saving disks and saving each
        file again.

        L  Load file
          To confirm that your JUNK file was saved properly try to load it
        back into the computer.  Press <L> from the main menu.  The computer
        will examine the disk and display all of the files than are on the
        disk.  You should see JUNK displayed with a number next to it.  To
        load JUNK type the number that is to JUNK's left and press <ENTER>. 
        The computer will load the file and return to the main menu.

          Now that you have tried loading JUNK into TDB let's load a longer
        list of students and grades into the program. Press <L> again and load
        in the file called SAMPLE2.  When you return to the main menu use <V>
        to examine the list.  You will find that the list contains more
        students and more grades for each student than the list we had been
        using.

        E  Edit file 
          Most functions of TDB can be carried out from within the main
        editor.  To enter the main editor press <E> from the main EDIT menu. 
        Up to 20 student names will be displayed along with any scores that
        have been entered.  In the bottom right hand corner you will see
        <SPACEBAR> for <ALT> Commands displayed.  Each time the spacebar is
        pressed a different alternate key function is displayed.  These
        alternate key functions do most of the work in the editor.  You can
        see a complete list of them by pressing and holding <ALT> and pressing
        <H> once.  Press any other key to have the list removed from the
        screen.

          Make sure that the list SAMPLE2 has been loaded before continuing.

          Entering a sequential list of student scores 
            If you have not yet entered any data when you enter the editor
          you must define the size and give a name of the first category of
          data.  The Width of New Column is the length of the longest score
          that you will enter.  If you make it too long or short you may
          change it later.  If you will be entering whole numbers between 0
          and 100 enter 3 for the column width and press <ENTER>.  Type the
          name for the category and press <ENTER>.  Once defined the first
          column on the screen will be filled with question marks (?) to show
          that no score has been entered for that category.  To type scores
          place the cursor in the appropriate column with the <LEFT><ARROW>
          and <RIGHT><ARROW> keys and next to the first student with the
          <UP><ARROW> and <DOWN><ARROW> keys.  Once you have placed the
          cursor type a score and press <ENTER>.  Continue down the column
          with the <DOWN><ARROW> until finished.  Leave a question mark for
          any students who have incomplete scores.

            To add another category of data press and hold <ALT> and press
          <M>, for make category.  Again you will be asked to define the
          width of the column and give its name before you can enter scores. 
          To enter a new category, TEST3, for example, press <ALT><M>, enter
          3 for the category width and type TEST 3 for the category name. 
          Once the column of question marks is displayed try entering several
          grades between 0 and 100.  Place the cursor with the <ARROW> keys,
          type a score and press <ENTER>.

          Working with more than 20 students
            The file SAMPLE2 contains 21 students.  To move beyond the first

          labeled <PGUP> and <PGDN>.

          Working with more than one screen of data
            If you have entered more columns of data than will fit on the
          screen the <TAB> key will move to the right one screen.  The
          <SHIFT><TAB> key will move you one screen to the left.

          EDITING STUDENT NAMES
            You can change a student's name, insert a new name, erase a name,
          order the names alphabetically or change the case of student's
          names while in the editor.  To change a student's name press and
          HOLD the <ALT> key and press the <N> key.  This two key sequence is
          referred to as pressing <ALT><N>.  The student whose name is on the
          same line as the cursor will be displayed in the screen editor at
          the bottom of the screen.  Make any changes to the name and press
          <ENTER>.  Remember that a comma MUST separate the last and first
          names.

            The other name editing functions can be accessed by pressing
          <ALT><I> to insert a new name, <ALT><E> to erase the name to the
          left of the cursor, <ALT><O> to order the names alphabetically or
          <ALT><C> to change from lower to upper or upper to lower case

          be used to change student names.

          EDITING GRADES
            Press <ALT><W> to change the width of a column of data.  This
          would be necessary if you had entered a series of scores as two
          digit whole numbers, 88 for example, and you needed more space to
          enter a scores such as 94.5, which requires a width of 4 spaces.  

            Press <ALT><M> to make a new column.  Note that it will be
          appended to the end of the list and will contain all question marks
          (?) to indicate that no scores have been entered.  

            <ALT><D> will delete the column that the cursor is on.  

            <ALT><L> preforms a very important check on your data.  The
          computer is continually keeping track of whether your columns of
          data contain numbers or letter (called string) grades.  It also
          watches the length of each column.  If you create a column and
          place letter information into it a dollar sign ($) is appended to
          the end of that column's name.  This happens even if you
          accidentally enter a letter when you meant to enter a number.  The
          length/string test function will check and update these values. 
          Use it whenever you make a change that may effect the number vs
          letter grade or length status of a column.  

            To change all occurrences of one score to another use <ALT><S>. 
          This function will search for the first score entered and replace
          it with the second.  For example, to change all incomplete grades,
          indicted with a question mark, to the letter grade E place the
          cursor anywhere on the column that you want to search, press
          <ALT><S>, type ? for what to search for and E for what to replace
          it with.

            <ALT><T> allows you to change the title of a category.  

            <ALT><A> displays all category names and allows you to alter the
          order in which they appear on the screen.  You might, for instance,
          want all quizzes displayed together.   Type the number of each
          category, separating each with a comma.  If you accidentally or
          intentionally skip any categories you will be warned before the
          changes are made.  Note that this is the quickest way to remove
          several unneeded categories of data.  

            <ALT><R> will order, or rank, the student's names and their
          scores based on the column that the cursor is in when it is
          pressed.  

            <ALT><F> allows you to enter a formula that will add, average or
          weight scores.  The following examples show how to add scores.  The
          other formula functions are described in the advanced section.

          will be displayed.  You may edit it according to the rules
          displayed on the screen.  Up to 13 grades can be entered.  Grades
          must be entered using the format GRADE=MINIMUM SCORE  with spaces
          between each grade description.  Press <ENTER> when done and type a
          name for the new category.  If the cursor was on a numeric column
          when you chose <ALT><G> a new letter grade column will be created. 
          If the cursor was on a letter grade column a category containing

          NAME LENGTH is the number of characters that is allocated for
        student names.  If a student's name is over 20 characters in length,
        for example, it will be truncated at the 21st. character.  Many TDB
        users have asked if it is possible to print grade sheets that identify
        students by an ID number rather than by name.  With this in mind you
        can set this variable to 0 and place each student's ID number in one
        of the categories.  Grade book pages will print without a name.  If
        you make the first category the one containing the ID it will head up
        each line of the report.  

          CHARACTERS/LINE is the number of characters that your printer
        normally prints on one line.  This is usually between 32 and 132, but
        80 is most common.  Experience has shown that the best printouts are
        made when characters per line is set 2 or 3 less than the printer's
        maximum width.  This prevents the printer from sending an extra line
        feed should the line be exactly 80 characters in length.

          TOTAL STUDENTS is the number of students that are in the computer's
        memory.  If you change this to a lower number, say 10, only the first
        10 student's information will be included.  If you change this to a
        higher number blank spaces will be left at the bottom of the sheet
        where new students might be added if that should become necessary.

          DESCRIPTOR SIZE is the number of characters that is allocated for a
        category title.  If your title is longer than this value it will be
        truncated.

          LINES/PAGE is used so that the computer will not print on the
        perforations between pages.  66 is normal for an 11 inch piece of
        printer paper.  If you wanted to print on half sheets of paper this
        could be changed to 33.  If you didn't care about printing on the
        perforations or were using roll paper this could be set to 0.

          LEFT MARGIN is the number of spaces that are left blank at the left
        of a printout.

          CONTROL CODES are described and selected under CUSTOM.  If you wish
        to send control codes set this to 1.  If it is set to 0 no codes are
        sent.

          SPACES controls how students are grouped on the printout.  When it
        is set to 5 a line will be drawn after every fifth student.  If it is
        set to 3 a line is drawn after every third student and so on.  If it
        is set to 0 no lines will be drawn to separate students.

          ALIGNMENT determines if the printout is spaced evenly across the
        page or if it is printed with the columns of the page spaced as
        closely together as possible.  The best way to describe this feature
        is for you to try a printout each way and determine which is best for
        you.  Simply press <A> to toggle between WIDE and NARROW.  Leave it at
        WIDE for now and try NARROW later.

          Press <SPACEBAR> to indicate that you are done.  The computer will
        test to see that the categories that you have selected will fit onto a
        page having the width that you have indicated under characters/line. 
        If it will fit the page will be printed.  If it will not fit you will
        be given an error message and you must return to C SELECT CATEGORIES
        and remove one or more categories.

          Next, select the number of lines for the heading.  You may use the
        control key sequences displayed at the bottom of the screen to center,
        left justify or right justify a line.  Press <ENTER> after typing each
        line.  When the last line has been entered the printout will begin.

          After the printout has been made you will return to the main menu.

          Note that this grade sheet was displayed, or printed, on the
        screen, not on the printer.  If you wish to have a printed copy of the
        grade sheet return to the main menu and change DEVICE = SCREEN to

        the width for each category.  This is normally set at 2 which will
        allow for 16 categories on one 78 column page. Higher values will

        Press <R> from the main menu to select it and <R> again to select
        regular.  CUSTOM is discussed under advanced features.

          You will be asked for the number of lines for heading & title. 
        This might include the school name, date, your name, the course, etc. 
        To include all of these things type and enter 6 for the number of
        lines. 

        Type the following:

          After the last line is entered you will choose the categories to be
        included in the report.  Select them in the order that they are to be
        printed.  Use 1,2,3,4,6,5,7 and press <ENTER>.

          A printer option menu will be displayed next.  Again, most of these
        are rarely changed.

          Remember that LINES/PAGE can be used to save paper if your report
        is short.  If you change it to 33 each report will be printed on half
        a sheet of paper.  22 will print on third sheets.  Press <3> and
        change it to 33 for our reports.

          STUDENTS (3-12) allows you to choose the students that you wish to
        include in this printout.  If you want all students 1-20 will print
        them all.  If you wanted only the first 10 you could use 1-10.  5-15
        would print for student number 5 through number 15.

          When you are done press <D> and printing will begin.  Remember that

          By now you should have a good understanding of the basic
        capabilities of TDB.  You have used all of the functions that you will

          VOCABULARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

            VMS is a program designed to allow a teacher to manage
          vocabulary and spelling words.  It contains the following
          programs:

            -EDITOR - Enter, edit, modify, delete and merge
             word/definition lists.

            -  WORD SEARCH - Prints word searches using the words entered
               into the editor

            -  TEST PRINTER - prints multiple choice tests, word lists and
               word/definition lists

            -  QUIZZER -

               Part 1
               QUIZZER quizzes students on vocabulary words using a
             multiple choice format.  The computer chooses a definition at
             random and displays a word list.  One of the words in the
             word list is the correct word for the definition.  Difficulty
             levels and times for responses may be selected.

               Part 2
               CODE, the second part of quizzer, is used by students once
             they have a good grasp of a word/definition list.  It encodes
             a word and definition using a simple letter substitution
             code.  The student must decode the word/definition before his
             points are exhausted.

            -  FORTUNE - A 'WHEEL OF FORTUNE' style game where each letter
               of a definition is replaced by a star (*).  The student may
               buy consonants and vowels as he tries to determine the word
               that matches the definition.

            -  SPELLER -

               Part 1
               In FLASH a randomly selected word is flashed on the screen
             and the student is asked to spell it correctly.  The duration
             of the flash may be changed by the student.

               Part 2
               ANAGRAMS scrambles a spelling word 12 different ways and
             challenges the student to spell the word.

          GUESSME, NEAREST, ROMAN, SUPER GUESS

            A series of programs designed to challenge students to develop
          strategies while guessing secret numbers.  The following programs
          are included:

            -  GUESSME - A program that allows students to guess a secret
               number between 1 and 100, 1 and 50, 1 and 25 or 1 and 10.  A
               number line is displayed and after each guess 'too high' or
               'too low' is reported to help the student to determine the
               next guess.  Leads students to develop a binary searching
               technique.  After the number is found the student is
               challenged to discover a secret number word by guessing
               letters.

            -  ROMAN - The same program as GUESSME except that all numbers
               and responses are Roman numerals.  The range of secret
               numbers is from 1 to 100.

            -  NEAREST - A more complex game where two or more students try
               to determine a secret number.  Now, however, the computer
               does not report 'too high' or 'too low', but tells which of
               the two to four students is closest.  Very challenging.
               Again, students must discover secret number words to
               determine the winner.

            -  SUPER GUESS - The most sophisticated of the guessing games
               requires students to compete to find a secret number by
               buying clues.  The clues include:

             Is the number prime or composite?

             What is the sum of the number's digits?

             What is the product of the number's digits?

             What is the difference between the number's digits?

             Is the number odd or even?

             How many digits does the number have?

             Is the number evenly divisible by another number?

               A graphic game that follows each successful number discovery
             determines the winner.
