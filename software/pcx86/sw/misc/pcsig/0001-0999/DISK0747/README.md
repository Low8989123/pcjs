## Information about "FOOTBALL FUN"

    FOOTBALL FUN (FFUN) is a complete office football pool management
    system -- just what your office might need!  It has the entire season
    schedule for professional teams, thus saving you the monotony
    of keying in all the team names every week when preparing weekly
    selection sheets.  Just a few keystrokes are needed to make a weekly
    selection sheet.
    
    Last year's schedule is on this disk for demonstration purposes, but
    you can order the current season from the author any time after June 1.
    The new season schedule also includes any new revisions to the
    program.  The schedule costs $10 every year.
    
    The program is easy to operate.  A data-entry screen makes it simple to
    enter team selections of each participant.  The participants' names do
    not have to be keyed in every week if they are stored in the seasonal
    database.
    
    You win if you pick the most games right.  If there is a tie, total
    points scored in Monday night's game is used for a tiebreaker.  Player
    standing reports are printed after Sunday games and Monday games.
    
    Weekly results can be accumulated in a seasonal database which can be
    used to operate a separate pool for the whole season.
    
    The program makes a playoff selection sheet that includes the four
    quarterfinal games, the two conference championships, and the Super
    Bowl.
