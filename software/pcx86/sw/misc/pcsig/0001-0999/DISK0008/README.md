## Information about "CROSSREF"

    Here's an excellent Shareware BASIC programming tool that provides a
    cross-referenced listing of variables referenced in the construction of
    a BASIC program. Listing shows what and where the variable has been
    used in the source code.
    
    The cross-referenced package is put into text file format which the
    programmer can either punch up on the screen or print out for future
    reference. Crossref is one of those "glad-to-have" tools that save the
    programmer from re-inventing the wheel with each project.
    
    How to Start: Read and then print the file CROSSREF.DOC.  The
    directions to run the programs are on that file.
    
    File Descriptions:
    
    CROSSREF DOC  Documentation file
    CRMAIL   EXE  Generates a reply/contribution letter to the author
    CROSSREF EXE  Extensive cross-reference generator for BASIC programs
    MONITOR  DOC  Documentation file
    MONITOR  BAS  BASIC subroutines for formatted screen displays
    CROSSOPT      Options file

                          CROSSREF DISTRIBUTION NOTICE

CROSSREF is being  distributed using the "Freeware"* approach.  To those of you
unfamiliar with  this  approach, it  works like  this.   You may send either  a
preformatted  single-sided  disk (or  a prepaid  contribution  for our disk and
mailer) to  us with a prepaid return mailer and we will send a complete copy of
the product.   If the product does not meet your needs, please pay nothing.  If
the product  does meet your needs, and you can use it, then we would appreciate
a  contribution of  whatever  you  feel  is  appropriate.  Naturally,  we  have
probably given  you  a clue  in several  places  as to what is  our "completely
unprejudiced opinion" of an appropriate contribution amount.  Contributions are
completely voluntary and much encouraged.  

Even if you  do not  contribute, you are encouraged to  copy and distribute the
product freely subject to the following restrictions: 

     1. Do not  distribute altered copies.  Note: You may distribute a separate
        set of modifications  to merge in if you  wish but they must be clearly
        identified  as  not originating  from Computerenergy.   If  you do make
        modifications, we  would like to see what you've done, if possible, for
        future versions.  

     2. The  product  is to  be distributed  as  a complete "distribution copy"
        produced  by the  copy  utility  provided  with  the product  for  this
        purpose.  

     3. No fee is to be charged for copying or distributing the program without
        an express written agreement with Computerenergy Corporation.  

     4. Commercial  sale of  this product  in any manner is prohibited  without
        Computerenergy's  written  permission.  Some  products will be released
        with this permission automatically given and expressly stated.  

User Groups/Clubs:  Computerenergy's  freeware  products may  be distributed by
Clubs and User Groups subject to the same restrictions.  We would ask only that
contributions to  our continuing efforts be encouraged by those performing such
distribution.  

Computer Bulletin Boards: Computerenergy's freeware products may be distributed
by  BBS's  subject  to the  same restrictions  and  contribution encouragement.
However, as the products tend to be large and consist of several files, we have
some concern as to the reliability of transmissions and length of connect time.
Perhaps disks could be mailed or just the documentation placed on the board for
browsers.

                                    CHAPTER 2

                                  INTRODUCTION


Computerenergy's Cross   Reference   was   created  to   make  programming  and
maintenance jobs  easier.   We  feel  that  a computer  should  help as much as
possible in  its own  development efforts.  CROSSREF is a  tool that produces a
cross-reference  for  each reference  to a  variable or a line number  within a
program.  



After you have  setup the  system and read the Operation  chapter, we recommend
that you  try  CROSSREF  on some  of your  own  programs.  If you are  going to
"wing-it"  without   reading  further,  then  SAVE  the  Basic  program  to  be
cross-referenced in  ASCII (true  wingers understand this), type CROSSREF,  and
good luck!

                                    CHAPTER 3

                                  SYSTEM SETUP


The Cross  Reference  distribution disk  contains a  version  of the program in
compiled  formats  along  with its  Syntax file.   Compiled  versions are being
distributed as they execute much faster.  

3.1  Copying CROSSREF

     There is a batch file which copies the entire distribution disk for backup
     or distribution purposes.  We highly recommend making a backup copy before
     proceeding as it is safer and the mails can be slow.  

     Place the Cross  Reference distribution  disk in Drive A: and  a formatted
     disk without  DOS on it in Drive B:.  While in DOS, type CRCOPY and follow
     any instructions.  

3.2  Program Setup - Final Installation

     We recommend that a  copy of CROSSREF and its  control file, CROSSWDS.DAT,
     be placed  on a Basic Program Development DOS System disk if possible.  If
     this is  your first  run-through, do not perform this  step yet - use your
     copy of the distribution disk and proceed to the Operation Chapter.  

     1. Copy CROSSREF.EXE to the System disk.  

             A Sample COPY command might be:

                            COPY B:CROSSREF.EXE A:

     2. Copy  the CROSSWDS.DAT  file  to  the  same  disk.  This  file  must be
        available any time CROSSREF program is used.  

             A sample COPY command might be:

                            COPY B:CROSSWDS.DAT A:

                                    OPERATION

4.1  Execution

     Starting Cross  Reference is  simply a  matter of entering DOS and  typing
     CROSSREF followed by the Enter key.  

4.2  Entering Responses

     You will quickly  notice that all input requested by Cross Reference is at
     the  bottom  of  the screen,  following a  prompt,  and contained within a
     "target".  We have found that a relatively constant area for data entry is
     superior  to  the  more  typical  design  of  "fill-in-the-blanks"  as  it
     minimizes  eye travel  and  usually  makes  for  a more  consistant  entry
     process.   All  responses  are completed  by pressing  the  Enter key.  In
     several prompts,  and on  the keyboard, the Enter key  is represented by a
     symbol roughly similar to this: (<-').  

     In addition  to  the  normal  editing  functions provided  for inner-field
     editing there are a couple of special functions available: 

               Field Erase:  Press the ESC key to erase an entry and start over
                             or to change a field that has a pre-loaded value.

               Field Backup: Press the Up-Arrow to "backup" to the previous
                             entry.  The current entry will be erased as you
                             "backup".
                             Note: You can "backup" as far as you like until
                             the very beginning of the program.

4.3  Maillist/Donation Assistance

     The first  screen you  see is  a title, information, and copyright  screen
     with a "Press Enter to continue or space for Maillist/Donation assistance"
     prompt.  Normally, you will press the Enter key to start CROSSREF.  If you
     press the space bar, a program will run which will help you print a letter
     that you  can  send  to us  to be  sure  you are placed on  our maillist -
     particularly important  if you did not receive your copy directly from us.
     Amazingly enough, the letter will even assist you in making a contribution
     but that is not required (nice though).  

     Note: The assistance program  - CRMAIL - is contained  on the distribution
     disk and  its copies but should not be copied to your DOS development disk
     as it  is  large,  not required,  and a  waste  of disk space.  CRMAIL  is
     chained  from CROSSREF  as it  resides on the distribution disk  or may be
     executed directly from the distribution disk by typing CRMAIL.  

4.4  Program Entry

     Up to 25 programs  may be specified to be  listed in sequence at one time.
     NOTE: Each program must be previously saved in ASCII format using the ",A"
     option of the Save command in Basic.  Example: 

                    SAVE "B:progname.S",A

     We use the  .S  extension  for  "Source"  to differentiate  between  Basic

CROSSREF                             - 4 -           Computerenergy Corporation
                                                           CHAPTER 4: OPERATION


     encoded programs  and those saved in ASCII.  This approach also provides 2
     copies of  each program  as it is developed -  a sort of automatic backup.
     Any program extension may be used.  

     If a program is  read by CROSSREF that has  accidentally not been saved in
     ASCII, CROSSREF will display an ERR=62 message and return to DOS.  

     For each program to be listed, CROSSREF asks for 3 pieces of information -
     program name, beginning  line number to start listing,  ending line number
     to end listing.  Each program name may be entered without an extension and
     CROSSREF will  append the a default Program Name Extension = ".S".  If the
     program is entered  with an extension, then the  entered extension will be
     used.  

     Each line  number field  is pre-loaded  with a default value which  may be
     changed  most easily  by pressing  the ESC key and keying  a new number or
     backspacing and  re-keying the  number.  The default value is  selected by
     pressing the Enter key.

     If you  can  spare  the  time,  we  would  appreciate  your  feedback  and
     suggestions to  help us  to improve CROSSREF.  As an  added inducement, we
     will also send  a free CROSSREF (corrected) to  the first person reporting
     each bug.   Immediate family  members of Computerenergy employees are  NOT
     eligible.    If   possible,   each   bug   reported   should   include   a
     short-as-possible  printout  of  the reference  situation with explanatory
     notes.   Our unprejudiced  judging panel  will make "Bug Awards" when  the
     spirit moves them and, of course, their decisions are final.  

     We are also  aware of  some esthetic errors when operating  with the color
     video interface.  Those still remaining should be corrected soon, but we'd
     still like to hear about any you find.  

     Please address  correspondence  to  the address  on the  title  page.  (If
     you've lost  your title page, just send us a note and we'll send you a new
     one.)

                             MONITOR DISTRIBUTION NOTICE

     Monitor is being  distributed using the "Freeware"* approach.  To those of
     you  unfamiliar  with  this approach,  it works  like  this.  You may send
     either a preformatted single-sided disk (or a prepaid contribution for our
     disk  and mailer)  to us  with a prepaid return mailer  and we will send a
     complete copy  of the  product.  If the product does  not meet your needs,
     please pay  nothing.  If the product does meet your needs, and you can use
     it, then  we  would  appreciate  a  contribution of  whatever  you feel is
     appropriate.   Naturally,  we have  probably given  you  a clue in several
     places  as  to  what  is  our  "completely  unprejudiced  opinion"  of  an
     appropriate  contribution amount.   Contributions are completely voluntary
     and much encouraged.  

     Even if you do  not contribute, you are encouraged  to copy and distribute
     the product freely subject to the following restrictions: 

          1. Do  not  distribute altered  copies.  Note:  You  may distribute a
             separate  set of  modifications to  merge in if you wish  but they
             must be clearly identified as not originating from Computerenergy.
             If  you do  make modifications,  we would like to see  what you've
             done, if possible, for future versions.  

          2. The product is to be distributed as a complete "distribution copy"
             produced by  the copy  utility provided with the product  for this
             purpose.  

          3. No fee  is to  be charged for copying or  distributing the program
             without   an   express   written  agreement   with  Computerenergy
             Corporation.  

          4. Commercial sale  of  this  product  in  any manner  is  prohibited
             without  Computerenergy's written  permission.  Some products will
             be released with this permission automatically given and expressly
             stated.  

     User Groups/Clubs:  Computerenergy's freeware  products may be distributed
     by Clubs and  User Groups subject to the  same restrictions.  We would ask
     only that contributions  to our continuing efforts be  encouraged by those
     performing such distribution.  

     Computer Bulletin  Boards:   Computerenergy's  freeware  products  may  be
     distributed  by BBS's  subject to  the  same restrictions and contribution
     encouragement.  However, as  the products tend to be  large and consist of
     several files, we have some concern as to the reliability of transmissions
     and  length of  connect time.   Perhaps disks could be mailed  or just the
     documentation placed on the board for browsers.  


     * The Freeware  concept was  initially developed by Andrew Fluegelman  and
     the  term  "FREEWARE"  is a  trademark of  The  Headlands Press, Inc.  The
     Headlands Press  provides a catalog of information about Freeware products
     available  from multiple  sources.  They  may be contacted at PO  Box 862,

                               INTRODUCTION AND SETUP


     Computerenergy's Monitor is a series of routines that provide a consistant
     user  interface  for  application  development.   It  helps  minimize  the
     drudgery of  screen development, menus, titles, prompts, and editing input
     as  the  user  interacts with  your application.   Monitor's  routines are
     designed to be incorporated as a "front end" into application programs and
     were created to make custom application development easier.  

     Monitor has been  developed in various forms for a number of microcomputer
     basics  over  the past  several  years.   It  has  been used  for  serious
     application development for all of that time by a number of developers and
     now represents our consensus of the best standard set of useful routines. 

     However, we have  noticed that each developer has his own biases as to how
     things should  be accomplished and variations to Monitor frequently occur.
     You are  encouraged to alter Monitor in any way for your own use.  What is
     important is that you use or develop a standard set of routines so that as
     you develop  applications,  there  is  a  consistant user  appearance  and
     function.  

     2.1  Use Restrictions

          There are no restrictions  on the incorporation of Monitor  or any of
          its  routines into  any application  system or program.  There is  no
          royalty or notice  required of the source of  the routines.  The sole
          restriction is  that  the  Monitor  is  subject to  the  distribution
          requirements stated in the Distribution Notice when it is distributed
          as Monitor itself.  

     2.2  This Document

          This document  is   organized  by  routine  with  detailed  reference
          information on  each routine  in a separate section.  Several  screen
          images  have been  included as  examples and are at the  beginning of
          their sections between  lines of equal signs.  In  addition, there is
          routine  summary  information which  you may  wish  to copy for quick
          reference.  

     2.3  Setup and Use

          At first blush,  the Monitor  routines may appear complex and  overly
          large.  However, we ask that you be patient and try incorporating the
          routines as  a front  end to some of the  programs you develop.  With
          use, the  routines and their structures will become second nature and
          you  will  be  able to  develop code  faster  with substantially more
          function and a consistant user interface.  

          We would  also  recommend  that  you  run  the  Monitor  through  our
          Expanding Lister (if it is available) in order to better see what the
          code  is  doing.   The Lister  should print  around  16 pages for the
          Monitor.  File  this copy for later reference.  When you subsequently
          use  the Lister  on a  program incorporating the Monitor, start  with

          line 10000 as it will save reprinting those 16 pages.  

          Before proceeding, it  is  highly  recommended  that  a copy  of  the
          distribution  disk  be  made immediately  for your  use  and that the
          original distribution disk be filed in a safe place.  

          The Monitor is  supplied in  Basic encoded source (.BAS) that  can be
          loaded into into Basic when entering entire programs.  It may also be
          convenient to  save a  version in ASCII (.S) form  that can be merged
          with any application program.  

          Monitor also contains  a significant number of single-line REMarks to
          aid in modification - these may be removed to save space if required.

          Some routines may not apply for a given program and may be deleted to
          save space.   Shorter versions of Monitor that eliminate the targeted
          menus and some of the lesser used error messages are common.  

          Monitor routines may be operated and tested in an interactive mode by
          entering the  routine-calling code  after line number 10000 and  then
          "running"  Monitor.  We  suggest you  give them a try as  you proceed
          through this document.  

     2.4  Color Video Board Notes


          If you are  going to  be using the Color Video  Interface rather than
          the Monochrome  (green) interface, you will need to change 2 lines of
          code in the Monitor as otherwise the cursor will seem to disappear.  

               Change line 1155:
                         from:  1155 ZINS%=1:LOCATE ,,,4,12:RETURN
                           to:  1155 ZINS%=1:LOCATE ,,,0,7:RETURN

               Change line 1165:
                         from:  1165 ZINS%=0:LOCATE ,,,11,12:RETURN
                           to:  1165 ZINS%=0:LOCATE ,,,6,7:RETURN

          We will add some code to make this automatic at a later time.

                                GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS


     Video-based computer systems  have the  advantage of very quick and  quiet
     response to a user.  This allows the user to interact with the computer at
     basically  their own  speed.  Applications  can and should be designed  to
     take advantage of these characteristics.  

     The Monitor is a series of CRT-oriented routines that provide a convenient
     base for application  development.  Routines are supplied for  many of the
     most common operations in the following areas: 

                              Input
                              CRT Output
                              Data Editing
                              CRT Management
                              Error Messages
                              End Program - Common Exit

     Monitor is designed  to be  incorporated as a front-end into  each program
     that  requests  input  from a  user.  The  application  program is usually
     constructed  by  using BASIC  to  call  in  a  copy of  Monitor  (via LOAD
     "MONITOR" or LOAD "MONITOR.S") and performing the following steps: 

          1. Modify the REM at statement 10 to reflect the application
               program name.
          2. Place the application's title in the ZTITLE$= statement
          3. Modify the END at statement 25 to link to another program
               if necessary
          4. Enter the application's code (via Basic) beginning at the supplied
               statement: 10000 REM Begin Program Here
          5. Save the program with a NEW NAME


     Notes: Some  functions  use  graphic  characters  that are  not reproduced
     exactly in this manual.  

     The "ENTER" key is the large key with a "down and left" arrow on it to the
     right  of  the keyboard.   This key  will be referred to as  the ENTER key
     within this manual.  

     3.1  Program Interface to the Routines

          The program  interface  is  similar  for  all the  routines.  Several
          variables may be loaded with information to be passed to the routine,
          and the  routine is  then called by setting Z=  to the routine number
          and executing a GOSUB 100.  

          Example:

              10010 Z$="Information to be passed to the routine":Z=1:GOSUB 100


          The most  common  calling  procedure is  to first  load  any required

     Monitor                           - 4 -         Computerenergy Corporation

                                                CHAPTER 3: GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS


          variables (usually  Z$), set Z= to the routine number, and then issue
          a GOSUB 100.   Most of the time this  can be accomplished on a single
          line.  

     3.2  Returned Data

          Data, if any, is returned from a routine in two variables: 

                    ZD$ = Any alphanumeric data
                    ZN  = Any numeric data


     3.3  Return Codes

          Return codes  from  a  routine  (if  any)  are  provided  in the  ZR%
          variable.   They   are  designed  to  communicate  the  occurance  of
          different classes  of  events  to  the  programmer who  is  using the
          routine.  He may then take any appropriate action he deems necessary.


     3.4  Returned Values

          Returned Values (if  any) are returned in the ZV% variable.  Examples
          of returned values can be seen in ZTESTYN and ZAOK below.  


     3.5  Routine Interface Procedure

          To have  your   program  utilize  any  routine,  simply  follow  this
          procedure: 

               1.  Load Z-prefix variables as directed in the Routine's
                     format (usually Z$).
               2.  Set Z equal to the Routine's Number.
               3.  Execute a GOSUB 100
               4.  Test Return code with "ON ZR% GOTO ...." as appropriate.
               5.  Take action for each Return Code and/or Returned Value.
               6.  Save returned values of ZD$ or ZN in user variables
                   if appropriate.

          Many Routines will not require all of the above steps.  

     3.6  Routine Names

          For ease of communication, each Monitor Routine has been given a name
          which begins with Z as a prefix.  

     3.7  Reserved Variables

          The Monitor  uses  variables that  begin with  a  "Z".  All Variables
          beginning with  Z should  be reserved for use by  the Monitor and not
          used within the application program.

     Prompt Message for Entry [...............]

     ==========================================================================

     ZIN provides a  general purpose  data entry capability and is  the bedrock
     routine  in the  Monitor.  A  prompt message and a variable-length  target
     consisting of periods  surrounded by brackets are displayed  at the bottom
     left-hand  corner of  the screen  on the 23rd line.  Rudimentary  editing,
     "backup to  previous entry",  and function-key options are also  provided.
     Editing commands  within the  field during entry are also  supported.  The
     user can not enter data outside the target, and will hear a gentle buzz if
     he attempts to do so.  

     FORMAT:

          Z$ = "Prompt Message for Entry,n1,n2" : Z=1 : GOSUB 100

               n1 = Length of target field
               n2 = Type of entry edit:

                    1 = Alphanumeric
                    2 = Integer only
                    3 = Numeric

     Note: Commas are  used as information separators, and  may not be included
     in the prompt message.

     EDITS PERFORMED:

          Type 1 (Alphanumeric):

               No editing performed.  All data is accepted as valid.

          Type 2 (Integer):

               Numeric integers only  accepted as valid.  Upon non-integer data
               (ddd)  being  entered,  the  message  "ddd  Is  Not Integer"  is
               displayed below the  entry line in reverse video  and the prompt
               is redisplayed.  

          Type 3 (Numeric): 

               Numbers which may  be decimal, integer, and positive or negative
               may be  entered.   Upon  alpha  data  (aaa) being  entered,  the
               message "aaa Is  Not Numeric" is displayed below  the entry line
               in reverse video and the prompt is then redisplayed.  

     RETURNS: 

          Data is contained in:

               ZD$ for Alphanumeric      (Note: string eqs. for ZN also ret'd h
               ZN for Integer or Numeric

          Function-Key Number is contained in ZN if Function or Ctrl Keys were 

          Return Code in ZR%:

               ZR% = 1 = Normal entry
                     2 = Up-Arrow entered or Plus entered as first character
                             - Field Backup character
                     3 = ENTER key was entered as first char.
                     4 = Function Key or Control key was entered
                     5 = Help requested

          When ZR% =  2 or 3 then ZD$ is blanked and ZN is zeroed.  This allows
          an ENTER-only  response  to  be  used  to blank  out  entries without
          further code.  

     EXAMPLES:

          Alphanumeric;

               10000 Z$ = "Entry Prompt,10,1" : Z=1 : GOSUB 100
               10010 ON ZR% GOTO 10020,10030,10040,10050,10060

          You may also  prevent the  user from using any of  the entry types by
          merely branching  back to the prompting line with the ZR% branch.  No
          error message  will be displayed.  If you wish an error message to be
          displayed,  set Z  and GOSUB  100 to display the appropriate  message
          (see Error Messages below) before taking the branch.  

          Example: Prohibit Backup, ENTER Key, Function Key, and Help Entry 

                    10000 Z$ = "Entry Prompt,10,1" : Z=1 : GOSUB 100

     FUNCTION SUMMARY: 

          ZTMENU is used  in  conjunction  with  ZTCLR,  ZIN, and  ZUPTMENU  to
          provide a complete  set of consistant data entry  routines.  ZTMENU's
          function  is  to display  the entire  entry screen which is used  for
          feedback to  the  user.   Each  field  in turn  is  then prompted and
          entered  with  ZIN on  line 23.   As each field is properly  entered,
          ZUPTMENU is  used to display the field in the ZTMENU area.  After all
          fields have been entered and processed, ZTCLR clears the ZTMENU entry
          fields for the next set of entries.

                                   ERROR MESSAGES


     9.1  No. 20-26 - Error Messages - ZERRname


          ZERRname is a convenient way to display an error message response for
          either an entry that fails a test or an invalid entry type.  

          The responses provided  are: "Invalid", "Not Integer", "Not Numeric",
          "Function  =  nn  Not  Available  at  this  Point",  "ENTER-Only  Not
          Available at this Point", "Backup Entry Not Available at this Point",
          and "Help Not Available at this Point".  

          Where appropriate,  the  value  of the  failing variable is displayed
          with  the  error messages.   The message  will  appear just below the
          entry line, centered, and in reverse video.  Each message also pauses
          for approximately 1.5 seconds.  

          SET: 

               ZD$ = Item to be shown as in error.
                         Note: Use ZCTL% for Func. Key on msg 23

          FORMAT:

               Each error routine is  called with its own number  after placing
               the offending information in ZD$ if it is not already there.  

                    Z = No.   Error Message
                    -------   ----------------------------------

                      20      "Is Invalid"
                      21      "Is Not an Integer Number"
                      22      "Is Not Numeric"
                      23      "Function Key = nn Not Available at this Point"
                      24      "Field Backup Entry Not Available at this Point"
                      25      "ENTER-Only Entry Not Available at this Point"
                      26      "HELP Not Available at this Point"

               The Format in all cases is:

                                 STANDALONE ROUTINES


     There are 2  standalone  routines  available  in  Monitor for  use  during
     program development.  If  memory space is a consideration,  these routines
     should be deleted from production or final versions of your programs.  


     11.1  Save Program Routine

          The Save Program  Routine will  save 2 copies of your  program with a
          simple GOSUB 9000  command.  A copy is saved  in encoded Basic format
          (.BAS extension)  and in  ASCII format (.S extension) for  use by the
          Expanding  Lister, CROSSREF,  Basic Compiler, etc.  To initialize the
          routine, enter your program name in the ZPROG$ variable at line 9010.
          Then,  to save  the copies  of your program, enter a  GOSUB 9000 from
          Basic's immediate or command mode.  

          If you forget to initialize the ZPROG$ variable with the name of your
          program, you  will simply save a copy of "PROGNAM.NAM" on your disk -
          no harm will be done.  

          However, BE AWARE,  that if  you are developing a series  of programs
          and  are  using a  copy of  Monitor from another program, the  ZPROG$
          variable may  contain the  wrong program name.  Should you  forget to
          change it,  and delete  the old program lines and  add new ones, when
          you GOSUB 9000, both copies of the original program will be destroyed
          by the new program which will be saved with the old program name.  BE
          CAREFUL!  This is an easy mistake to make (speaking from experience).


     11.2  Program Memory Map

          There is  a  standalone  routine that  will display memory statistics
          during  program  development.  It  is accessed  with  a GOSUB 9100 in
          immediate or command mode.

                       SUGGESTIONS, FEEDBACK, AND BUG REPORTS

          If you  can  spare the  time, we  would  appreciate your feedback and
          suggestions  to  help  us  to  improve  the  Monitor.   As  an  added
          inducement, we will also send a free Monitor (corrected) to the first
          person   reporting   each   bug.    Immediate   family   members   of
          Computerenergy employees are NOT eligible.  Valid bugs do not include
          obvious  architectual  limitations.   If possible,  each bug reported
          should include a  short-as-possible printout of the before  and after
          bug situation with explanatory notes.  Our unprejudiced judging panel
          will  make "Bug  Awards" when  the spirit moves them and,  of course,
          their decisions are final.  

          We are  also aware  of some  esthetic errors when operating with  the
          color  video  interface.   Those still  remaining should be corrected
          soon, but we'd still like to hear about any you find.  

          Please address correspondence  to the address on the title page.  (If
          you've lost your title page, just send us a note and we'll send you a
          new one.)
