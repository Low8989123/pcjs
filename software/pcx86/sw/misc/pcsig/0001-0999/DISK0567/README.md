## Information about "DUNGEONS OF THE NECROMANCER'S DOMAIN"

    DND is a computer fantasy role-playing game inspired by Dungeons and
    Dragons -- the "grandaddy" of all the computer games that was
    developed and played on mainframe computers back in the '60s.
    
    Different than most games, it uses character graphics in the upper-right
    corner of the screen, instead of graphics.  Become a wizard and fight
    evil monsters and ghosts with your growing power.  Or become a fighter
    and go head-to-head with mighty dragons.  Or a cleric and try to dispel
    the evil spirits of the dungeons.  The object is to stay alive and
    venture deeper and deeper into the depths of the dungeons.  You have
    five completed dungeons to choose from, with expanded screen displays,
    character spells, and room furnishings.   No matter which character you
    choose to be, this is a game that will test all of your game playing
    skills.  Registration of the program includes a copy of "The Domain
    Master" for creating and editing both characters and dungeons.
