## Information about "NEWSBASE"

    NEWSBASE is a convenient and powerful database application to help you
    keep track of the contents of each issue of a periodical. It is great
    for publishers of journals, magazines, and newsletters, as well as
    radio and television broadcasters.
    
    Articles, descriptions, synopses, or key words and phrases are entered
    along with the column number, page number, volume, and issue date. The
    search function can then find the article related to a particular
    subject by entering a key word or phrase, or it can list all the
    descriptions of articles entered within a certain time frame. Print
    the list or save it for later use to an ASCII file.
    
    NEWSBASE is terrific for doing any kind of library research, such as
    for term papers (especially when used on a laptop). Reporters and
    editors will find it useful for keeping their "morgue" (files of old
    stories) organized and easily accessible. Whether you are an
    investigative reporter hot on a story, a bewildered publisher/editor
    needing to keep track of materials, or a student struggling on a term
    paper -- NEWSBASE will help you stay on top of the information heap.

Program Description:
 
 
Newsbase is a convenient and powerful database application designed to help
one keep track of the contents of each issue of a periodical.  It can be
useful to publishers of journals, magazines, news and newsletters, as well as
television and radio broadcasters.  Various menus and a help screen make this
prigram very easy to use.  Newsbase makes it easy to find a story, editorial,
or artwork that is related to a particular subject.  For advertisers, Newsbase
can give an overview of all the ads placed by a certain customer in the
periodical over the last few months.  This program allows the user to give a
description, headline, synopsis, and key words or phrases for the article that
is to be stored in a file on a data disk.  The starting column, page number,
volume and number of the periodical, and the issue date can also be recorded
with the short description.  Afterwards, the search function will look for a
particular word or phrase that is entered or list all the articles within a
certain time frame in order to find the particular article that is being
looked for.  Afterwards the serach function allows the user to make a hardcopy
of the information to the printer or to an ASCII file.  Newsbase can work with
either a color or monochrome moniter, and can work with a fixed disk as well
as one or two floppy disk drives.
