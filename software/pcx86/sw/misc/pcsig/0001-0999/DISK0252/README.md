## Information about "LISTMATE AND LOAD-US"

    documentation, and is compatible with MultiMate files.

		   Load-US Abstract and Instructions


    Load-US (tm) is a utility developed by SWFTE, Inc.	which allows you to
    run Lotus 123 (tm) and Symphony (tm) directly from a hard disk without
    the system disk in Drive A.  This utility is NOT a copy program; it is
    a technological breakthrough that allows authorized users to use 123
    and Symphony on a hard disk system.  Load-US saves you the aggravation
    of locating your System disk each time you need to run 123 or Symphony.
    Load-US protects you from being "locked out" of your own data and
    software if your System disk is lost, stolen or destroyed.	Use Load-US
    and use hard disk storage technology with confidence!

    The Load-US System includes:

	LOAD-US  COM		 Load-US execution file.  Not listable.
	LOAD-US  ABS		 Load-US abstract file.  Listable.

    To start Load-US:  load DOS, copy Load-US onto your hard disk (into
    your Lotus subdirectory, if you have made one), type 'Load-US' and
    press Return to start Load-US.  Follow the instructions on the Load-US
    system screens to install the system.  Once installed, Load-US permits
    you to run Lotus 123 or Symphony normally without your Sytem disk.

    Load-US should be run only at reboot time or start up time.  It is
    necessary to install the program once per session; however, installing
    the program more than once will not cause any change to the system.
    Multiple installations will be flagged by:

	"Load-US needs to be installed only once!"

    Perhaps most importantly, this product is being distributed on a
    FairWare (tm) basis.  The product can be copied and circulated freely
    by anyone.	If a user derives benefit from the product, we expect that
    they will send us the suggested contribution of $10 as outlined on the
    Load-US cover screen.  Diskettes may also be purchased directly from
    SWFTE, Inc.  for $10, plus $5 for postage and handling.  Please feel
    free to contact us directly if you have any questions concerning the
    distribution or function of this FairWare product.

    Load-US does not violate ANY copyright laws or licensing agreements.
    Use Load-US and use your hard drive with confidence and peace of mind.
