                             1. The Timber Room 
                             2. Hades 
                             3. The Platinum Bar 
                             4. The Pot of Gold 
                             5. Opening the Egg 
                             6. The Bauble 
                             7. The Sluice Gates 
 

1.  Consider the uses of a basket, as well as alternate light sources. 
    Remember that the solution to a problem may not necessarily reside in 
    the same room...or at the same height.


2.  First, get the spirits' attention. Having done that,  there's only two 
    other things  left to do, so play around a little until you have 
    everything in the right order. Read any  good books lately?


3.  This one is easy, if subtle. Consider the outstanding quality of the 
    room, and make an order  of it.


4.  Well, you know where to look, right? You just have to do something 
    first. Have you seen anything around that might remind you of a rainbow? 
    Get the point?


5.  The program didn't lie: *YOU* have neither the skills nor the expertise, 
    so who else is left? Be generous, it will pay off in the end.


6.  First, you need to have the egg open. Then, you have to go to  the 
    logical place and do the logical thing. When the egg is open, this 
    should be music to your ears.


7.  Everything you need is at hand. Play around in the Maintenance Room, and 
    remember to check other rooms as well for a  change. Tools can come in 
    handy, too.



                          * * *  Zork II Hints  * * *

                               1. The Riddle Room 
                               2. The Red Sphere 
                               3. The Dragon 
                               4. The Balloon 
                               5. The Bank 
                               6. The Menhir 
                               7. The Oddly-Angled Room 
                               8. The Demon 


1.  Aren't riddles a pain? This one should make you thirsty. (Think about 
    that for awhile)



2.  You can't do this one by  yourself, so bring along some help. And keep 
    in mind that just because you can't see something, that doesn't mean 
    it's out of range.


3.  You can't do anything with him where you find him; now, if you could 
    just get him to follow  you...


4.  Balloons are filled with hot air; seen anything flammable  around 
    lately?


5.  Yes, this is certainly a tricky one! The key is the curtain of light; 
    pay close attention to its description, as well as the piece of paper on 
    the floor.  Also keep in mind that things are not always what they seem 
    to be here, either.


6.  Ah, if only you had magical powers, you might be able to do something 
    about this!


7.  First, remember that this room is *oddly-angled*. Second, what does the 
    club look like to you? Third, read the name on the club carefully; that 
    should give you some ideas. Fourth, what's on the floors? Think about 
    all that and you should be able to figure out what to do here.


8.  A *very* greedy character...but he will help you, if you know what you 
    want! (Hint: remember the Menhir!)



                          * * *  Zork III Hints  * * *

                              1. The Hooded Figure 
                              2. The Chest 
                              3. Scenic Vista 
                              4. The Ship 
                              5. The Jewel Room 
                              6. The Royal Puzzle 
                              7. The Guardians of Zork 
 

1.  Mysterious, isn't he? Also, not too friendly! However, beter not kill 
    him...he has something you need.


2.  *You* will certainly never be able to open it. 


3.  What would you do here if you couldn't see? And don't forget what's on 
    the wall.


4.  Remember the book from Zork I? No? Well, just be friendly!


5.  First, read the date on the cage carefully. Second, don't be greedy! 
    Third, the way to bring back what you have should be obvious; you just 
    have to look in the right place.


6.  Don't take the easy way out...be pushy! (It helps to have paper  and 
    pencil handy here!) Westward Ho!


7.  The solution is transparent.... bottoms up!



                         * * *  StarCross Hints  * * *

                                1. The Red Rod 
                                2. The Blue Rod 
                                3. The Green Rod 
                                4. The Silver Rod 
                                5. The Violet Rod 
                                6. The Crystal Rod 
                                7. The Control Bubble 
                                8. Breathable Air 


1.  No more Mr. Nice Guy! Be cruel!


2.  This one is tricky. The disks will help you here, once you figure out 
    what they are. You will also need something else here ("a tisket, a 
    tasket...").


3.  Again, the disks will be  helpful. Also, be a litterbug!


4.  This one you have to look for, but it isn't far away. Shake a few 
    things, and see what happens


5.  First, you have to weasel your  way to the Green Dock. After that, those 
    mysterious disks  will once again come in handy.


6.  You have to project yourself  into this one. It would also  help if you 
    could see, if only in a fragmentary way.


7.  "For every action, there is an equal AND OPPOSITE reaction...". Think 
    about where you want to go, and aim accordingly.


8.  Do something with the Red Rod. It helps a little if you know chemistry.




                         * * *  Suspended Hints  * * *

                        1. Trouble with Weather Control? 
                        2. Can't fix Iris? 
                        3. Main Supply Machine broken? 
                        4. Want the camera? 
                        5. Looking for spare parts? 
                        6. Worried about Poet and Waldo? 
                        7. Trying to reset? 
                        8. Still trying to reset? 



1.  The bard will take only a second to fix a hundred problems.


2.  This is touchy, but not too rough.


3.  I see that you aren't grasping the concept of teamwork.


4.  His legs may be Longfellow's, but he'd rather ride.


5.  Imagine a cutting sensation.


6.  'Tis a far, far better thing....


7.  You can learn a lot from TV.


8.  Be sure the errand boy knows that inches matter.



                         * * *  Deadline Hints  * * *

                        1. Looking for a motive? 
                        2. Can't figure out the method? 
                        3. Still wondering about method? 
                        4. Need more proof? 
                        5. Trying to lay a trap? 
                        6. Does your trap fail? 


1.  Spend a couple of minutes fiddling with what's on the desk.


2.  A criminal after Romeo's heart.


3.  You look like you need to freshen up.  When you get where you're going, 
    be very snoopy.


4.  Take time to stop and smell the roses.


5.  Make like Juliet, and your patience will be rewarded.


6.  Exact timing is the key that unlocks many a door.



                          * * *  Witness Hints  * * *

                         1. Nothing exciting happening? 
                         2. Can't find any clues? 
                         3. Wondering about the method? 
                         4. Is the butler inscrutable? 
                         5. Trying to nail down proof? 
                         6. Can't unlock the clock? 


1.  You look tired.  Sit down and relax.


2.  Ring for the butler.


3.  Better look around some more, but watch out for sharp objects.


4.  Don't worry, he's just an average mystery fan, too.


5.  Well, then, go find some nails.


6.  Be quick with your nippers.




                        * *  Mask of The Sun Hints  * *    

                         1. The Silver Bowl 
                         2. Exiting the first pyramid 
                         3. The Gas Chamber 
                         4. Leaving the Altar Room 
                         5. Exiting the third pyramid 



1.  Something you've had with you from the very beginning of the  game can 
    help you here. Be  careful how you use it!


2.  You have to urn your way out of this one. Heavy stuff!


3.  Try a direction....remember, there are more than four!


4.  You might find a way out if you look through a glass darkly.


5.  Patience is a virtue. Don't expect anything to happen for awhile.




                         * *  Serpent's Star Hints  * *   

                         1. Getting past the wolf 
                         2. The Wandering Monk 
                         3. The First Monastery

                         8. The Dragon's First Question 
                         9. The Dragon's Second Question 



1.  Do the obvious thing and remember: if at first you don't succeed...


2.  He might be in the mood for a little conversation....and  doesn't he 
    look a bit thin?


3.  It pays to be generous. Butter them up a little.


4.  The answer to this one just scrolled right past you!


5.  The answer is monstrous. Anyone seen George around lately?


6.  The answer to this one is hard to give a hint for; you really have to 
    know something about Eastern religion. If you happen to know the names 
    of the male and female principles, that's the answer. Check out the wall 
    in the monk's room for a symbol.


7.  Well, the answer is *not* Sophia Loren...think about that for awhile!


8.  Judy Garland could probably tell you the answer to this riddle. (No, it 
    isn't the Yellow Brick Road!)


9.  The answer to this one is just heavenly.

                         5. Getting to the Crystal 




1.  Well, you can't just walk through the swamp, so, do you remember seeing 
    anything anywhere that floats?


2.  Don't go around in circles; the answer is staring right at you.


3.  Well, don't just stand there, move! And move fast!!


4.  There could be something behind those bars; wonder if there's anyone 
    around who could slip through them?


5.  Be daring! Eavesdropping helps, so does a thorough search.

                         5. The microbe 
                         6. The mutants 



1.  The solution is an attractive one; have you been to the Tool Room yet?


2.  Extend yourself, and you may get the idea!


3.  Visit the Repair Room with a friend. Don't be shy about giving orders.


4.  Floyd could help you here, if only he understood the situation.


5.  HOT stuff! In fact, too hot to handle!


6.  Don't stop for anything!!

                         8. The Winding Stairs 



1.  Think sharp....you might have to risk your life for this one, but the 
    sacrifice is worth it. Get the point?


2.  Do like Dr. Dolittle, only get a substitute...teacher.


3.  Too much light is bad for the eyes, dreamer.


4.  First, get his attention (why not give him a call?). Then, get on his 
    good side. 


5.  You'll get by with a little help from your friends.


6.  This is child's play. Have you been below the dungeon? And  don't chew 
    on the pencil!


7.  Remember that a pencil has two ends, and two functions. Don't be afraid 
    to let the cat out of the bag, so long as you can  close the bag again.


8.  Bet you didn't know your character was a mime.
