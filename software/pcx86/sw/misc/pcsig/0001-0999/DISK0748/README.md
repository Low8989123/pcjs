The DIRECTORY ASSISTANT is a system to assist you in organizing name and
address information for use in personalized phone books, mailing labels,
on- line phone number lookups, and organizing meetings and events. The
program is completely menu-driven and has an option to display help
messages at each prompt. There is also an on-line help menu within the
program. The Documentation is very easy to read and understand, but there
are a few places where it seems to skip a line (a sentance doesn't make
sense, it seems to have some words missing). If you read the manual with
the program running though it doesn't present too much of a problem. The
manual is very well organized and give plenty of examples. The program will
run on any IBM-PC or compatable with at least 128 K of memory and one disk
drive. This is a good program for the 'Novice' computer user.
