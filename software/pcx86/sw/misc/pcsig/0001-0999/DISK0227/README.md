## Information about "FINANCIAL PROGRAMS"

    A user-supported finance program to determine present and compound
    values.  FINANCE is a well written, well documented, user friendly
    series of menu driven software from computer handholders.  It runs
    well and even includes such useful programs as a personal loan tracker
    and a home mortgage routine.  This is a fine collection for the
    homeowner or student who doesn't want, or have, time to calculate
    these formulas for themselves.
    
    How to Start:  Load DOS and type FINANCE to enter the main program.
    Consult FINANCE.DOC for program documentation.
    
    Suggested Registration:  $30.00, or $10.00 for students.
