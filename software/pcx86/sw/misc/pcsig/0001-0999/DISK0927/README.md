## Information about "PRO-DEX DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM"

    PRO-DEX is a Rolodex tracking system that stores and maintains an index
    of names, addresses, telephone numbers, and other vital data.
    
    Add, edit, delete, search, view, or print information.  Search by name,
    address, city, state, firm/company, or title/position.  Each entry
    includes a standard industrial code, a business/home phone, date of
    contact, a staff initial of connected person, and a comments section.
    
    Flag each entry for mailing and labels, or to call again on a future
    date.  The entry will appear on the appointments screen when the date is
    within two weeks of the current date.  Print single mailing labels, all
    names flagged for mailing, or all names flagged with a particular
    status.  The utilities menu lets you backup files, update the index,
    specify the drive/path setting, and enter your company name to be
    displayed on the logo of the program.
