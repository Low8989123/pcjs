## Information about "DISK SPOOL II & UNARCHIVING PROGRAMS"

    Don't waste valuable computer time waiting for a report, a memo, a
    spreadsheet or any other printing job to finish printing.  Send your
    print files to a spooler.  The spooler will hold your file until the
    printer is available while you go on with your work.  DISK SPOOL II has
    two main parts: a spooler and a writer.  The spooler intercepts data
    going to the printer, and redirects it to disk.  The writer takes data
    from the disk and sends it to the printer.
    
    The pop-up menu lets you control whether or not the spooler and/or the
    writer are active.  You can, for example, start the spooler and not the
    writer, sending the printed output to disk and nothing will be printed.
    This mode is particularly useful if you don't have a printer attached to
    your computer.  You can still do your work and transport the spool file
    to a machine that has a printer attached.
    
    Change spool and writer ports as needed, drive more than one printing
    device at a time, and fine-tune your system for optimal printing speed.
    
    A collection of file archiving utilities. Use the space on your disks
    more efficiently. Because file compatibility can change with
    different versions of "ARC," four different versions are included.
