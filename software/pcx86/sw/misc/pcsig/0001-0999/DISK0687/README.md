## Information about "IN-CONTROL 1 OF 2 (ALSO 688)"

    IN-CONTROL is a well-rounded business prospect/contacts and activity-
    tracking system. It provides a Rolodex, activities list, management
    reports, expense reports and an appointments tickler.
    
    Everything is on-line with fast search capabilities.  The Rolodex
    features names, addresses and notations retrieval and a graphic
    ``layer-in'' ability which lets you temporarily merge mailing lists. In
    addition, it is network-ready.  The system also includes:
    appointments tracking, expenses, graphics, free-form data search,
    labels management and reports.  A built-in telephone dialing system
    uses your modem and frees your phone for incoming calls.  A built-in
    proposal and invoice generator is provided.  The program standardizes
    your prospecting and follow-up information and converts forgotten
    verbal commitments into a focused daily list of appointments and
    callbacks that nets you extra business.
    
    IN-CONTROL requires registration after you have placed 50 records in
    the Prospect file.  If not registered, this program will lock you out
    from access to the program, though the data files are always intact.

## FSPACE.DOC

{% raw %}
```
The  amount  of space remaining on your floppy disk in drive A is critical  to 
the  functionality of this program.   All of your data and on-line Help  files 
are stored on that disk.  

If  you  have  less than 10,000 characters remaining,  remove ALL  Help  files 
ending in 'DOC' and place them onto the third disk for this program, SALESDOC. 
[The SALESDOC disk is not used interactively with this program]

Later on,  if you select a Help message, the program will display a message to 
you that it cannot find that file.  At that point, you could exit the program, 
copy  that one single DOC file from SALESDOC to the SALE-A disk,  restart  the 
program,  then examine that Help file.   Let's say, for example, that you were 
in the Labels Menu and you selected 'H' for Help.   If you had already removed 
all  DOC files,  the program would display this message to you:   'Can't  find 
that file [LABEL1.DOC]'.  In this case the on-line documentation for the Label 
Menu is contained in LABEL1.DOC.  You don't need to memorize what DOC files go 
with  what screens,  since the program will tell you the name of  the  missing 
Help file.    

Also, if you use the Memo function in the program and you appear to be running
out of space fast, go to the Other Options Menu periodically and enter option
9: Repack and Reindex.  That should free up space from the Memo files.

## INDEXERR.DOC

{% raw %}
```

                       Index Error

The program cannot find a record in your file that has 'NEW' in the
name field.  This is probably an indexing problem.  When the  program
exits, erase all files that end in 'NTX'.

After you do this, start the program again and it will re-index itself.

If that does't work, you will have to restore your original empty 
data files with this batch command:

## INVOICE1.DOC

{% raw %}
```

                             Proposal or  Invoice

This  module  will create a proposal or an invoice from this current  activity 
record.  It uses the name,  address,  and zip code from this record and places 
that  information onto the form.   Observe that the form for this proposal  or 
invoice  is  predefined and the program does not accumulate totals  from   one 
printout  to  the  other.    This option is to be used as  a  convenient  word 
processor, not as an accounting package.

Also,  note that the comment you entered into the activity record,  up to  200 
characters, will be placed into the lower portion of the proposal/invoice. The 
placement  of  your entries on the proposal/invoice will become clear  if  you 
experiment a few times with this procedure.

If you want your own comments to appear in the lower portion of the proposal/
invoice, you can enter up to 500 characters of your own choice instead of
the comment that you entered into the activity record.
