## Information about "THE ENABLE READER 2 OF 4 (674,676,677)"

    The ENABLE READER PROFESSIONAL SPEECH SYSTEM was written to improve
    computer access for the blind and visually-impaired, and is actually two
    programs in one.
    
    The ``Full Screen Speech Review System'' is designed to let the
    visually-impaired use the wide selection of software written for
    MS-DOS compatibles.  Now programs like Lotus 1-2-3 or dBASE are
    available to everyone.
    
    The ``Talking Tutorial Programmer's Aid'' gives programmers access to
    many of the speech functions of the ENABLE READER to write talking
    tutorials for their software.
    
    Several synthesizer language versions are included for the most popular
    synthesizers available.  Among these are:
    
    ~ Artic Technologies - speech board.
    
    ~ Speech Plus - calltext 5050.
    
    ~ Digital Equipment Corp. - dectalk.
    
    ~ Street electronics - echo qp.
    
    ~ Votrax, Inc. - Votalker ib., Votrax pss., Votrax pss/b.

DISK NO  675  Enable Reader Speech System  V3.0  (2 of 4)          V1.0 DS2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Enable Reader 3.0 Speech System is actually two programs in one. The
FULL SCREEN SPEECH REVIEW SYSTEM is designed for visually impaired and
blind people. With Full Screen Speech Review, a visually impaired person
has access to the wide selection of commercial software available for MSDOS
compatible machines, such as the IBM PC and dozens of other machines.
Whether it is Wordstar, dBase, or Lotus 1-2-3 , a visually impaired person
can now use these programs efficiently.
 
The second program built into the Enable Reader 3.0 Speech System is the
TALKING TUTORIAL PROGRAMMER'S AID. Professional programmers now have access
to many of the speech functions of the Enable Reader 3.0 Speech System for
writing talking tutorials for their software. This gives blind and visually
impaired people the best of both worlds. One, they have access to the
Review Mode of the Enable Reader 3.0 Speech System for running commercial
software. And two, any program that is written with the Talking Tutorial
Programmer's Aid will run for them.
 
This system consists of 4 disks.  They are as follows:
 
Disk No. 674 is the main program disk.
Disk No. 675 contains the manual.
Disk No. 676 contains the Votrax word processing programs.
Disk No. 677 contains the Dectalk word processing programs.
