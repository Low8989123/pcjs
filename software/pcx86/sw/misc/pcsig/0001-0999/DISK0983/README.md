## Information about "NATIONAL BUREAU OF STANDARDS LIFE-CYCLE"

    NATIONAL BUREAU OF STANDARDS LIFE-CYCLE COST (NBSLCC) performs thorough
    cost-analyses of buildings and building systems, and compares the
    economic performances of differing designs and alternatives.
    
    It computes total life-cycle costs, net present value savings,
    savings-to-investment ratio and adjusted internal rate-of-return.  It
    can apply to commercial and non-commercial buildings and includes income
    tax adjustments and financing effects in the analysis.  Long-term energy
    price projections can be automatically retrieved for use in the LCC
    analysis of energy projects when you want them.
    
    NBSLCC consists of an introductory program, five major modules, a
    worksheet and a stand-alone program called DISCOUNTs for computing
    discounted cash flows.  NBSLCC is user-oriented -- it prompts you for
    data and assumptions, advises you when entries appear improper, lets
    you make changes to input data files, and allows you to move by menu
    selection.
