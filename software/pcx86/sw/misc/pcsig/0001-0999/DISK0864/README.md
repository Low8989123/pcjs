## Information about "CATALIST 1 OF 2 (ALSO 865)"

    Biorhythm theory holds that the human body is influenced by three
    biological cycles which begin at birth and continue to rise and fall
    throughout our lives ~- a physical cycle, an emotional cycle and an
    intellectual cycle.  These cycles have differing periods so that one
    cycle may be at its low point in a curve while another may be at the
    peak of its own curve.  It is believed that the overlapping and timing
    of these cycles or curves can be used to predict how you will perform in
    the future.
    
    This program can calculate these biorhythm cycles for any person born
    after the year 1753.  The physical, emotional and intellectual cycles
    are marked by letters in columns for each day of the month, each letter
    showing how high or low that particular cycle is.  An asterisk
    indicates
    a critical day for that cycle.
    
    Also included is a comparison of the biorhythms of two persons, which
    will display the percentage of compatibility for each cycle.  Maybe it
    wasn't just luck, maybe it really was a bad (or good) day when you met.

CATALIST is a comprehensive list manager to produce labels, envelopes,  
Rolodex cards, and bulk-mail flyers.  It formats data from each entry   
that is easily merged into more than 15 of the most popular             
wordprocessing packages, including PC-WRITE.  The program can also      
format for foreign addresses including postal codes for 106 countries.  
                                                                        
At least one help screen is given for each main screen in the system,   
giving beginner and intermediate users plenty of needed help.  For data 
entry and modification, a legend is shown at the bottom of each screen  
defining the function keys and their specific functions.                
                                                                        
ASCII file format is used throughout the entire database system, which  
helps in compatability with most other software in the computer world.
