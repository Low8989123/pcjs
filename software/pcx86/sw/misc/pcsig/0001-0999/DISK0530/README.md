Program Description:  FreeWord is a powerful menu  driven word-processor
                      of interest to students, writers, secretaries and
                      others working with a great deal of text.

                      There are several good features:

                      1. Moving the cursor either by character, word,
                         line, screen or page.

                      2. Marking a block of text for deletion, moving or
                         copying.

                      3. Searching a document for a word or phrase

                      4. Both right and left justification of text

                      5. Printing upto 9 copies of a document

                      6. Being able to print in the background mode so
                         that the user can proceed on to doing other things

                      A bonus for registered users is SPELL a spelling
                      checker program.

                      FreeWord needs 256 Kb of memory and DOS 2.0 or above
                      to run. It can work with a monochrome or color display
                      but needs a parallel PC printer.
