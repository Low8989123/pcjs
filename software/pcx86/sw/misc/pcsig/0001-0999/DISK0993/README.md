## Information about "BOARD GAMES"

    A trio of classic board games.
    
    PC-PENTE is a game with its roots in the ancient game of Go.  The
    playing field is a grid and the object is simple: either get five of
    your pieces in a row or capture 10 of your opponent's pieces by
    surrounding them with your pieces.  It is assumed that you already know
    how to play the game, but in case you don't, Rules.com has a concise
    overview of the basic strategy of Pente.
    
    PYRAMIDS is a strategy game based on an ancient Egyptian theme.  You and
    the Pharaoh Cheops are vying to discover the other's pyramid before your
    own is found.  The playing pieces include sphinxes, lions, bulls, rams,
    wolves, hawks, camels, cats, antelopes and a cobra -- each with special
    powers.  You can see your opponent's pieces and your opponent can see
    yours, but you do not know the rank and power of each until one of you
    attacks the other.
    
    YAHTZEE is the classic dice game we've all played in which you try to
    collect pairs, three-of-a-kinds, full houses, and the like for points by
    rolling six dice.  From each roll, you can pick up from one to six of
    the dice and re-roll them, to try to better the score you receive for
    the roll.  Once a requirement has been filled, you cannot use that roll
    again.  The winner completes his list with the highest total score.

Program Title: BOARD GAMES
PC-SIG version 1.1
 
PC-PENTE is a game which has its roots in the ancient game of Go. The
board is constructed of solid lines which create a grid on the playing
board.  The object of Pente is simple: either get five of your pieces in a
row OR capture ten of your opponent's pieces by surrounding them with your
pieces.
 
PC-PENTE contains the logic needed to automatically check for captured
pairs, remove them from the board, and increment the players scores.  As
in the original game, when five pairs have been taken by one of the
players, the game is over.  It is also okay to form a pair between two
enemy pieces, as PC-PENTE checks if a pair was actually captured or if a
player "moved into" a capture situation, in which case the player in the
middle would not be taken.  In addition, it checks for all five-in-a-row
combinations and terminates the program if one is found.
 
PC-PENTE assumes that you already know how to play the game, but in case
you don't, RULES.COM contains a concise overview of the basic strategy of
PENTE.
 
PYRAMIDS is a strategy game based on an ancient Egyptian theme.  You and
the Pharaoh Cheops are contending to discover the other's pyramid before
yours is discovered.  You each have a set of pieces consisting of
sphinxes, lions, bulls, rams, wolves, hawks, camels, cats, antelopes, and
a cobra.  Each animal has special powers.
 
The key to this game is that you can see your opponent's pieces and your
opponent can see your pieces, but you do not know the rank and power of
your opponent's pieces until you attack or are attacked by one.  This is
also true of your opponent, who doesn't know the rank of your pieces until
he attacks.  This version of the game is the limited version and only
plays to fifty turns.
 
YAHTZEE is the classic dice game we've all played in which you try to
collect pairs, three-of-a-kinds, full houses, and the like for points by
rolling six dice.  From each roll, you may pick up from one to six of the
dice and re-roll them, to try and better the score you receive for the
roll.  Once a slot has been filled, you cannot get that roll again.  For
example, if you roll a full house, and then roll another full house, the
second full house does not supercede the first one.
 
Usage:  Entertainment.
 
System Requirements:  Yahtzee requires BASIC or GW-BASIC.

                                Theme


Pyramids is a strategy game based on an ancient Egyptian theme.  You
and the pharaoh Cheops are contending to discover the other's pyramid
before your own is discovered.  You each have a set of pieces
consisting of sphinxes, lions, bulls, rams, wolves, hawks, camels,
cats, antelopes and a cobra.  Every animal has special powers:

   A sphinx remains behind to protect the pyramid.  It cannot move but
   it will defeat anything which attacks it, except a sacred cat.

   A lion, bull, ram or wolf relies on its strength.

   A hawk can fly over the animal nearest it to the space on the other
   side.

   A camel can cross directly across a desert.

   A sacred cat can use its magic to overcome a sphinx.

   An antelope can cover great distances in a single move.

   Only the cobra can defeat the lion.


                           Rules of Play


Game Board

Pyramids is played on an 11 x 11 board with two deserts in the middle.


Pieces

Each side begins with 44 pieces; Cheops' pieces are arranged along
the top of the board, while yours are along the bottom.  A piece set
consists of one pyramid, one cobra and 42 other pieces which you may
configure with the SETUP program explained below.  At the beginning
you will not know the ranks of Cheops' pieces and he will not know
yours.  The identities of pieces become known only through attacks and
by moves which are unique to specific ranks.


Objective

The winner is whoever first finds his opponent's pyramid or eliminates
all of his opponent's mobile pieces.




PYRAMIDS MANUAL                                                      1





                         Start of Game


Each side first lays out his pieces along his side of the board.  You
may decide whether Cheops' pieces should be arranged randomly or in a
strategic setup.  Random setups always position the pyramid in one of
the two back rows.  Strategic setups usually fortify the pyramid with
sphinxes.  Your setup also may be random or strategic.  For a
strategic setup you may select from a file of setups you have created
previously or create a new one.  Up to 255 strategic setups may be
stored at a time.


Movement

Cheops and you take turns, moving one piece each turn; the first turn
in the game is assigned at random.  You may move a piece forward,
backward, left or right according to these rules:

   1) The pyramid and the sphinxes cannot move.

   2) All other pieces can move along a straight line to a vacant
   square, so long as all intervening squares are vacant and the
   distance of the move is not greater than the allowable 'slide' (see
   Changing the Slide under Game Options below).

   3) An antelope (rank 8) can move through any number of vacant
   squares, regardless of the slide.

   4) A hawk can fly over an adjacent piece to an empty square on the
   other side.

   5) A camel can cross directly from one side of a desert to the
   other side.

   6) A piece resting on a 'power square' in one of the lanes can move
   directly to a vacant power square in another lane.


Attacks

An attack occurs when a piece tries to occupy the square of an
opponent piece.  These rules govern attacks:

   1)  A piece may attack an opponent piece to which it is adjacent by
   attempting to occupy its square.

   2) A hawk (rank 5) can attack an opponent piece by flying over an
   adjacent piece.




PYRAMIDS MANUAL                                                      2





                      Resolution of Attacks


Attacks are resolved according to these rules:

   1) Any piece can capture the pyramid.

   2) An attacking piece can defeat any numeric piece of greater or
   equal number.

   3) A cat (rank 7) can overpower a sphinx.

   4) The cobra can defeat the lion (rank 1) if it attacks; any piece,
   including the lion, can defeat the cobra by attacking it.

The losing piece is removed from the board.  If the attacker wins, it
immediately occupies the square of the loser; if the defender wins,
it remains in place.  The identity of the winning piece is revealed to
the opponent (except see Hiding Attacks in Game Options below).


Move Repetition

No piece may move from square A to square B and then back to square A
in three consecutive moves.


End of Game

When the game has ended you will be given the opportunity to watch
the game be replayed automatically.  You can watch the entire replay
or press <ESC> to stop the replay.  Then, you can either begin a new
game or exit Pyramids to the DOS prompt.

                          Game Options


Changing the Level (Function Key 1)

Cheops can play at four skill levels; level '1' is the lowest and
level '4' is the highest.  At higher levels Cheops examines his moves
in greater depth, and so is better able to find effective attack
combinations and to direct his pieces against squares where your
pyramid may be located.  Approximate timings for moves on an AT
personal computer follow:

        ...................................................

While Cheops is thinking, you can terminate his search process by
pressing any key; Cheops will select the best move he has found thus
far.  Although Cheops looks at his most promising moves first (just as
you do), he performs a depth-first search on them, that is, he
examines each move sequence in detail before looking at the next move.
If Cheops' actual best move is not among the first that he looks at,
terminating a search too quickly at a high skill level could actually
yield a worse move than would the same amount of time at a lower
level.

It is best to use the search termination feature when you have waited
at least one-fourth the normal time required for the skill level-slide
settings.  This gives Cheops a chance to find a good move in a short
time while freeing you from waiting longer while he looks for a
surprise game buster.  The Watching the Move Selection Process option
(Function Key 6) explained below allows you see how long it usually
takes Cheops to find his best move.

Changing the Slide (Function Key 2)

The slide determines the number of vacant squares across which pieces
can move.  The slide can be set from one to three squares.  Antelopes
have an unlimited slide and are not affected by this option.

The setting of the slide has a profound influence on the style of
play.  With the slide set at '1', the lanes between the deserts in the
middle of the board can be protected by a single powerful piece; no
piece of lesser or equal rank can get by it.  With the slide set at
'2' or '3' the lanes are much more difficult to control, with the
result that games are more wide-open and aggressive.


Hiding Attacks (Function Key 3)

When this option is set, the identity of Cheops' pieces remain
concealed if they win an attack, except for sphinxes and the cobra.
All you learn is that they were powerful enough to win.  This is an
advanced option for players who are confident of their skill.


Hiding Cheops' Pieces (Function Key 4)

With this option, Cheops' pieces are displayed only while they are
moving; at all other times, they are invisible.  This option, combined
with Level 1 and Slide 3, creates a fast, 'arcade-like' game with lots
of surprises.


Controlling the Sound Effects (Function Key 5)

Normally, sound effects are played during the game to signal attacks,
captures and special moves, and error bells are rung after illegal
keyboard entry.  This option may be switched on or off with the F5
function key.


Watching the Move Selection Process (Function Key 6)

You can watch while Cheops selects his next move by activating this
option.  The board will come alive as Cheops considers all important
move combinations.  Initial and final scores for each move are
displayed in the message box on the left, while intermediary scores
for each level of the move are shown on the bottom line.  The message
box on the right shows the current best move and its score.

Loading a Saved Game (Function Key 7)

At any time you can stop playing the current game and load an
unfinished game that you had saved previously.  Type in the name of
the game you want to finish.  After the game is complete it will be
erased from the disk.  (Also see Command Line Parameters below.)


Saving the Current Game (Function Key 8)

This option allows you to save the game in progress to finish at
another time.  Type in the name under which to save the game.  Saved
games are assigned the extension .GAM.


Starting a New Game (Function Key 9)

If you don't want to finish the current game, you can start a new one
with this option.


Quitting the Current Game (Function Key 10)

Press <F10> at any time to quit the game you are playing and return to
the DOS prompt.  If you have not first saved the current game, you
will be given the opportunity to do so.

                          The Setup Program

Program SETUP allows you to configure the piece sets, colors (if you
have a color monitor) and display speed.  Run SETUPS before you start
program PYRAMIDS to change these configurations.


Configuring the piece set

You can decide how many sphinxes, lions, rams, etc. you want to have
for your side and for Cheops' side.  Simply add and subtract from each
piece rank, making sure that you finish with a surplus of zero for
each side.  There must be one pyramid and one cobra on each side.

The new configuration will be used for random setups in new games and
for new strategic setups you create.  All of Cheops' strategic setups
are based on the original configuration.


Configuring the colors (color monitor only)

The display shows a sample game position with the current color
configuration.  Press the function keys as indicated to cycle through
the colors available to find a combination you like and then save the
changes.  All subsequent games you play will use the new colors.


Configuring the display speed

You can change the speed at which the display updates piece movements,
messages and so forth.  Set the speed faster or slower and then save
the change.  When you next run PYRAMIDS it will use the new speed.

This configuration affects only the display speed.  Set the skill
level for each game to determine Cheops' movement selection speed.

                        Move Selection Algorithm


Pyramids uses a recursive min-max move selection algorithm with tree
pruning on refutation.  For each level, all legal moves are assigned
initial values based on a criterion list.  At levels above the
terminal nodes of the tree, the moves are sorted by these initial
values; moves are then selected for recursion which are deemed to be
'hot' (attacks and so forth) or which have the highest initial values.

Cheops' moves in the recursion are evaluated according to his
perception of the board, including inferences made about your unknown
pieces.  Your moves in the recursion are evaluated according to
Cheops' inferences about your perception of the board, including both
his inferences about your unknown pieces and inferences you might have
made about Cheops' unknown pieces.  In other words, Cheops never knows
more about your pieces than a human opponent would.

This two-layered uncertainty creates unique problems for a computer
solution to Pyramids.  At times Cheops must infer that you will make a
bad move without himself being fooled by your high assessment of it.
Therefore, the min-max algorithm is modified to return not only a
maximum value for each node, but also both the extent to which the
parent of that node perceives the child to have been fooled by the
selected best move ('He thinks he'll win the attack, but I know
better.') and the extent to which the child's child (and thus the
parent, who is the same player) was fooled ('My child thinks he'll win
the attack.  I know better, but I'm not telling my parent, only my
grandparent.')  In the peculiar genetics of the min-max world, players
are reborn as their own grandchildren, in perpetual competition with
their children, who are reborn as their grandchildren.

Inferences made about your pieces are probabilistic in nature.  If you
aggressively move an unknown piece against one of Cheops' pieces,
sometimes he will assume you are in earnest and sometimes he will call
your bluff.  If he does back off, at some point he will change his
mind and come after your piece to find out what it really is.

Cheops' depth of search is the user-selected skill level plus one,
that is, a maximum of three moves.  However, the game of Pyramids
requires a sense of the board which goes much deeper than three moves
ahead.  To achieve this vision over distance without full-depth
recursion, Cheops draws a 'force field' over the board which attracts
pieces of various ranks according to the positions of your pieces.
This is similar to the process you employ in moving a piece 'closer'
to where you think Cheops' pyramid is.

                         System Requirements


IBM PC, PC Jr, XT, AT, PS/2 or true compatible with at least:

	one floppy disk drive
	256 KB memory
	monochrome or color monitor
	DOS 2.0 or higher.


                        Command Line Parameters


Pyramids may be started from the DOS prompt in these ways:

   1) Type: PYRAMIDS.  This starts a new game.

   2) Type: PYRAMIDS <filename>.  This resumes the game saved under
   <filename>

   3) Type: PYRAMIDS /NM.  This turns off all sound effects at the
   beginning of the program.

   4) Type: PYRAMIDS /NH.  This turns off the help messages which
   describe the pieces.

Any combination of these parameters may be used.


                               File Extensions


File extensions have these meanings:

   .EXE	     program file
   .PYR	     internal data files
   .GAM	     saved game.

What follows is a more in-depth description of the files on this disk.

PCPENTE.COM ............ This is the Hercules version of PC PENTE.  A Hercules
                         (or compatible) graphics card must be present in the
                         computer for this program to operate properly.
IBMPENTE.COM ........... This is the IBM version of PC PENTE.  While it is
                         still in monochrome, the program is compatible with
                         IBM CGA as well as several other popular monitors,
                         such as the monochrome and color Tandys.  As a rule
                         of thumb, try this version of the program first if
                         you are unsure as to what kind of graphics card is
                         present in your system.
ERROR.MSG .............. This contains the list of possible error messages
                         for use with Borland's Turbo Graphix Toolbox (TM).
4X6.FON ................ This contains the specialized font that PC PENTE uses
                         in its initial and terminal graphics screens.  As
                         with ERROR.MSG, this program is also provided in
                         Turbo Graphix Toolbox (TM).
RULES.COM .............. This program lists a concise set of rules for playing
                         PC PENTE.  Additional reading for the novice is sug-
                         gested.
FILES.TXT .............. This is a concise listing of the files on this disk.
NOTES.TXT .............. This is the text file containing what you are reading.
HARDSET.BAT ............ This file creates a subdirectory on your hard disk
                         (C:\PCPENTE) and copies all of the necessary files to
                         that subdirectory.

SECOND SCREEN (or Title Screen)                                                 
Here we see the HOT KEYS listed and the question about instructions which got   
you here.   Let's take the Hot Keys one at a time.  F8-Select Verify on/off -   
Verify on - When you select to score, you will be asked to verify your choice   
by name.   If it's OFF, then any selection will be accepted, even if it's wrong.
An incorrect choice will ZERO that scoring position in the Upper Section.   The 
Lower Section will not ZERO without you specifying it.  But, it will score in   
the wrong place if you tell it to.   F9-Sound on/off - Sound effects, beeps and 
music is either on or off.   F10-Qyit - Drops you into basic with no frills.    
These Hot Keys are live throughout the game and may be used at any time.        
                                                                                
NAME SCREEN (or Second Title Screen)                                            
Enter the player names, may be any combination of Upper or Lowercase, for a max-
imum of six (6) characters.   After each name, press the ENTER key and you will 
be asked to enter the next name.   If you press the enter key without entering a
name or you have entered four names, then you are shown the next screen.        
                                                                                
FOURTH SCREEN (or Name Confirm Screen)                                          
First game -Displays player names and asks if ready to play.  Yes and you start 
play.  No and you go back to the Name Screen to re-enter all players.           
Second and subsequent games -Displays player names and asks if ready to play.   
Yes and you start play.   No and you are asked if you wish to add players (Y/N) 
A No will start play.  A Yes will send you back to name entry if you have less  
than four (4) players.                                                          
                                                                                
PLAY SCREEN (or play screen)                                                    
On the left side of the screen, we find the standard Yahtzee scoresheet.   And  
in the middle, the status of the hot keys.   When they (F8 & F9) are red, they  
 are off and green for on.   On the right, five (5) blank dice.   The number of 
players determines the width of the scoresheet.   The first roll of the dice is 
accomplished by pressing any key.   The second and third are done by pressing   
number keys (1 to 5) corresponding to the numbers below each die and then by    
pressing the "R" to roll.   By the way, pressing a number twice will eliminate  
it from being rerolled.  The numbers turn red if selected for reroll and green  
if "locked".   If you press "R" without selecting any dice for reroll or after  
the third roll, you will be asked where to post the score.   That brings us to: 
                                                                                
SCORING (or I win, you lose)                                                    
Upper Section - There are thirteen (13) scoring positions per game, of which six
(6) are in the Upper Section and the other seven (7), of course, in the Lower   
Section.   The first six(6) are ACES  TWOS  THREES  FOURS  FIVES  SIXES and will
only score dice with the same number.   For example, the roll is 1,1,4,2,6.  On 
each turn, a player can only score once.  So our dice can be scored in several  
places but used only in one.  Aces would be a score of 2(two) and so on.  Remem-
ber that if you score at least three(3) die in each position of the Upper Sect- 
ion, your total will be 63 or more, which would entitle you to the bonus of 35  
points.                                                                         
Lower Section - This is the easy stuff.                                         
3 of a Kind - Score of all dice IF at least three(3) are the same.              
4 of a Kind - Score of all dice IF at least four(4) are the same.               
Full House - Three(3) of a kind PLUS a pair(2) and scores 25(twe...never mind). 
Small Straight - Four(4) die in sequence and scores 30                          
Large Straight - All the dice in sequence and scores 40                         
Yahtzee - All dice the same and scores 50                                       
Chance - Score is the total of all five(5) dice.  This is a one-time catch-all  
for a bad break in luck and your roll doesn't score elsewhere.                  
Multiple Yahtzees - Yahtzees are scored 50 points in the Yahtzee position of the
Lower Section.  If that position is filled by a 0(Zero) or a previous Yahtzee,  
then we look to the appropriate spot in the Upper Section. If that is also taken
we look again to the Lower Section.   Now we can use it as a Joker in any of the
open positions.  And scores accordingly, 40 for a Large Straight, 30 for Small  
Straight, 25 for a Full House and the total of the dice for Chance, 3 and 4 of a
Kind.  The second (and subsequent) Yahtzee(s) also give the player a 100 point  
bonus that is added to his total only.                                          
                                                                                
END GAME (or whose ahead)                                                       
After each game, you will be told who won(as if you didn't know) and then asked 
if you want to play another game.  An "N" will send you to Basic and if it's the
second through sixth game, you will go to the RECAP SCREEN and then to basic.   
If you pressed "Y", you will also go to the Recap Screen and then to the Fourth 
Screen where you may add players (up to 4 total) and start the new game.        
The Recap Screen shows the winner and scores for each game and the aggregate to-
als for each player.                                                            
This game has been heavily tested by family and friends and should be bug free. 
Technical Note-The dice are truly random.  The random generator is reseeded at  
the start of each players turn.   Thank you and happy playing.
