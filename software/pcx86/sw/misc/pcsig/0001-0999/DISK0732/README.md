## Information about "TRACKER AND CATCHER FOR THE BLIND"

    TRACKER is a general-purpose income/expense tracking program written for
    the visually-impaired.  The program is designed for use with a speech
    synthesizer, to vocalize information usually read from the screen.  The
    documentation has internal help screens for each of the program's
    commands.
    
    CATCHER is an interesting twist on an old theme.  The object is to catch
    falling characters with a paddle at the bottom of the screen.  The twist
    is the program was written for visually-impaired people and is designed
    for use with a speech synthesizer.

TRACKER is a general purpose income/expense tracking program written for
the blind. The program is designed to be used with a speech synthesizer to
speak information usually read from the screen. The documentation consists
of internal help screens for each of the programs commands.
 
CATCHAR is an interesting twist on an old theme. The object is to catch
falling characters with a paddle at the bottom of the screen. The twist is
that the program was written (like TRACKER) with blind people in mind. The
game can be used with a speech synthesizer and played without the need for
a sceen display (even though it does have one). Instructions are included
within the program.
 
WAIT causes the computer to do just that, wait. for use in batch files, to
use type 'WAIT n' where n is the number of minutes to wait.

Program Description:
     TRACKER is a general purpose income/expense tracking program written for
the blind.  The program is designed to be used with a speech synthesizer to
speak the information usually read from the screen (the program can be used
without its speech features though).  The program has a full screen display so
can be used by the sighted as well as the blind.
     The documentation is internal (there is no printed documentation at all)
and can read from the screen or spoken through the speech synthesizer.  The
help screens are viewed one command at a time.
     CATCHAR is interesting twist no an old theme.  The object of the game is
to catch falling characters with a paddle at the bottom of the screen.  The
twist  is that the program was designed (like TRACKER) with blind people in
mind.
     All of the documentation is internal and can be spoken through a speech
synthesizer as well as read from the screen.  Actions within the game are
displayed on the screen while a series of sound effects indicate what is
happenning for those who cannot see (or aren't looking at) the screen display.
For those who don't wish to close their eyes to play, the screen can be turned
off completely. Both programs will run on color or monochrome systems with one
disk drive and at least 128K memory.
