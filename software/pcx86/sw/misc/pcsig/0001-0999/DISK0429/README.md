## Information about "ELEMENTARY C"

    Are you just learning how to program in C?  Or have you been doing it
    for a while?  This collection of C language routines has something for
    both of you.
    
    They can help you learn the language and also provide a shortcut
    library for more experienced users.  Included are some basic data
    movement routines, a help facility, amortization programs, and matrix
    manipulation.  A short but succinct example shows how to initialize a
    Hayes smartmodem with Lattice C.  An entire set of functions is
    provided for string processing of a list of arguments, with an example
    showing how to use these functions for command tail processing.
    
    Take advantage of the edge you can find here and save yourself time and
    trouble with this variety of tools.

Disk No 429   Elementary C                                      v1 DS2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A collection of C language routines that will help a programmer learn
the language and will also provide a shortcut library for more
experienced users.  Included are some basic data movement routines,
a "help facility", amortization programs, and matrix manipulation.
A short but succinct example shows how to initialize a Hayes Smart-
modem out of Lattice C.  An entire set of functions is provided for
string processing of a list of arguments, with an example showing how
to use these functions for Command Tail Processing.
