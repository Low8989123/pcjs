## Information about "GRAPHTIME II 2 OF 2 (ALSO 669)"

    GRAPHTIME-II is a business and technical graphics system with text and
    font editors.  Designed for use with dBASE II/III, Multiplan, Lotus 1-
    2-3 and ASCII files, it can also be used on its own with data entered
    from the keyboard into the built-in spreadsheet.  Epson compatible, HP
    Deskjet and Laserjet printers are supported.
    
    The package consists of six main modules:
    
    ~  GRAPH -- 19 types available with up to 10 graphs per screen
    
    ~  DRAW -- Full-screen color graphics editor
    
    ~  FONT -- Text generator and font editor
    
    ~  FILE -- External file input/output
    
    ~  TEXTED -- Text and macro editor
    
    ~  PRINT -- Printer driver
    
    The graphics editor can create free-form diagrams or enhance a
    previously made graph.  You can select arrow keys, joystick or mouse to
    control the graphics cursor.
    
    GRAPHTIME-II can be either menu or command-driven, with an emphasis on
    ease of use.  All scales and labels are made automatically with manual
    override.  A macro facility is included for commonly-used
    command sequences and to control slide shows.  Macros can also be
    created by recording a sequence of commands as they are used.

Special Requirements: 512K RAM, CGA or EGA graphics.                    
                                                                        
GRAPHTIME II is a business-presentation graphics program.  GRAPHTIME II 
does various line, column and pie charts.  The charts can be printed or 
plotted, viewed individually, or set up to run as an unattended ``slide 
show'' on the monitor.  It accepts data from dBase II/III, Multiplan,   
and Lotus 1-2-3, or you can enter data directly.  It has a font editor, 
macro editor and math functions including moving averages.  There is    
even an ``undo'' function.  A Microsoft mouse (or compatible) is        
recommended.                                                            
                                                                        
This version will plot 24 data points and will print ``paint''          
files, but will not save them.
