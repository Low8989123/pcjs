## Information about "BRIDGEPAL THE GAME OF CONTRACT BRIDGE"

    Want a good game of bridge but lack the players?  Want to improve your
    skill a bit before your next big game with your friends?
    This game's for you.
    
    BRIDGEPAL is played just like a normal game of bridge, except the
    computer shuffles, deals, makes bids, plays the other three hands, and
    keeps score.  You start bidding and playing from the south hand
    position.  If your team wins the bidding, you get to play both the north
    and south hands; otherwise, you play defense with east or west as dummy.
    Optional besthand feature increases your chances for offensive play.
