                              PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS
                              --------------------


     AUTOMATED PLANNING FORM (APF) is a menu driven set of planning tools.
     The product diskette contains the following programs:

     AUTOMATED PLANNING FORM (APF)
     -----------------------------

     APF lets you quickly generate, store, retrieve and update project
     schedules. Unlike most other scheduling software, APF uses high
     resolution graphics, and via DOS GRAPHICS.COM, can produce fast
     presentation quality printouts on most wire-dot printers.

     Use it to plan projects, communicate plans and progress to management,
     to clients and those working on the project.

     APF features:
        * Up to 17 action items - use sub-schedules if you need more detail

        * Work in weeks, months, quarters or years

        * Automatically translate from weeks to months to quarters to years

        * Show percent completion of each task (action item)

        * Show constraints (dependencies) i.e. indicate that one event
          can't start until an earlier event is completed.

        * Full edit capability - insert, delete, add items, change bar
          location, change percent completion, etc.

        * Automatic origination and revision dating

     WHAT, WHO and WHEN (W3) PLANNER
     -------------------------------

     The W3 planner is an excellent project management tool for detailed
     project planning. It lists action items (WHAT), assigns responsibility
     for completing each action item (WHO) and indicates the date on which
     each task must be completed (WHEN).  W3 plans may be created, stored,
     retrieved, updated and printed.

        * Handles up to 95 action items

	* Full editing capability - insert, delete, edit, etc.

        * Single line scrolling and full page scrolling

        * Automatic origination and revision dating

        * Print via DOS GRAPHICS.COM or under program control

     NOTE: The + and - keys on the numeric keypad provide full page
	   scrolling of multi-screen W-3 plans.

     SINGLE TIER GPM
     ---------------

     Given any two of the three following variables, cost, price, gross
     profit margin (GPM), the program will solve for the third. Simply
     press ENTER without making a data entry to define the unknown.

     TWO-TIER GPM
     ------------

     This program deals with manufacturer's cost, manufacturer's GPM,
     manufacturer's price, retailer's cost (same as manufacturer's price),
     retailer's GPM and retail price. Given enough information, the program
     will solve for more than one variable. It will first determine if it
     has enough information to solve for any variable, if so, it will solve
     for that variable and use that solution, along with your previous
     inputs, to solve for other variables.


     LEARNING CURVE
     --------------

     The more of something that you manufacture, the less it should cost
     due to experience, automation, practice, purchasing leverage, etc.
     This reduction in cost with increasing volume can be described by the
     complex "learning curve" equation. This program makes the complexity
     transparent to the user. The following variables are listed:

                    - Number of units at low volume

                    - Cost per unit at low volume

                    - Number of units at high volume

                    - Cost per unit at high volume

                    - Learning Curve percentage   (85 - 93 are typical)

     This program will will solve for any single variable. After solving for
     the missing variable, you can change one or more parameters and get a new
     solution. Up to 10 complete solutions may be stored and displayed upon
     exiting the program.


     PROWESS PERSONAL REMINDER
     -------------------------

     Up to 14 dates, times and messages may be stored. When the computer's
     clock/calendar time or date equals or exceeds the programmed time and
     date, the program "beeps" and displays the date, time and message. Once
     you have acknowledged the reminder, it is erased from the reminder file
     to make room for new entries.

     The program must be active for reminders to be displayed (it does not
     run in background), but could be useful in a variety of ways:











     Example #1

        Program a week's appointments with each appointment's time set to,
        say 7:00 AM, on the correct date. Put the actual appointment time in
        the message column along with the appointment message. Activate PPR
        when you get to work at 7:30 or 8:00 AM and the day's appointments
        will all be displayed.

     Example #2

        Prior to a meeting in your office, program a fictitious appointment
        for whatever time you would like to terminate the meeting. Leave
        PPR active. At the programmed time, the computer will beep and
        announce your "appointment", allowing you to gracefully terminate
        the meeting.

     Example #3

        You are extremely busy, but must make a phone call at exactly 10:30
        AM and are afraid that you will forget. Program a reminder and
        leave PPR active while you work. At the appointed time, you will
        get a beep and your reminder will be displayed. (the message could
        contain the phone number).




                       USING YOUR AUTOMATED PLANNING FORM
                       ----------------------------------


     SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
     -------------------

                       *  IBM-PC or 100% compatible with CGA graphics
                          capability (or equivalent mono graphics)

                       *  DOS 2.x or greater (must contain GRAPHICS.COM
                                              for printing)
                       *  128K RAM

                       *  Wire-dot printer setup for graphics mode

     PREPARATION
     -----------

     First format a new diskette with the /S option.

          EXAMPLE:   FORMAT B:/S  (assuming that a new diskette is
                                   installed in dirve B.)

     Next, copy the contents of your APF product diskette to the newly
     formatted diskette.

          EXAMPLE:  COPY *.* B:   (Assuming that you have the product
                                   diskette in drive A and the newly
                                   formatted disk in drive B)

          The new diskette will become your working copy, so protect your
          investment and put the APF product diskette in a safe place.






     Then copy your DOS graphics printing utility GRAPHICS.COM to your
     working diskette. Put your DOS system diskette in drive A and your
     working diskette in drive B and enter:

         COPY GRAPHICS.COM B:

     Your working copy is ready to use. Label it AUTOMATED PLANNING FORM.


     RUNNING AUTOMATED PLANNING FORM
     -------------------------------

     Put your working diskette in drive A and enter:  GOAPF  <return>

     This will execute a batch file that first loads GRAPHICS.COM and then
     loads the APF program. Once GRAPHICS.COM is loaded, you can print both
     text AND graphics on most wire-dot printers by pressing SHIFT-PRTSC.
     To work properly, your printer must be capable of printing graphics.
     IBM printers, most EPSON printers and most others have this capability.
     If you have problems printing, check your printer manual to insure that
     the dip switches, or jumpers, in the printer are set to the graphics
     mode. You may leave your printer in the graphics mode for other
     applications and it will work normally.

     Even though we have gone to great lengths to make these programs user
     friendly and highly intuitive, we strongly suggest that you read
     through each program's help file before executing it. After reading a
     help file carefully, you should be able to operate the associated
     program sucessfully in a matter of minutes!

     For the full registration fee of $45 (+ $4 shipping and handling), we
     will send you a diskette containing the latest version of all programs
     and will remove all shareware pleas. The product will have the look and
     feel of any other quality commercial software product.


     GENERAL OPERATION GUIDE
     -----------------------

     All of the above programs are accessed from the main menu. When you
     exit from any of the programs, you will be given a choice of returning
     to the main menu or exiting to DOS.

     As with all Prowess, Inc. products, you can enter a 'Q' at most user
     inputs to exit the programs. From the exit screen, you may typically
     restart the current program, return to the menu or exit at DOS.

     Options are selected by entering the capitalized letter in the option
     word (usually the first letter). On color systems, this letter is
     displayed in a different color. On some monochrome systems, you may
     need to increase the display intensity to see the key letters in
     option words.

     Unless instructed otherwise, DO NOT use the TAB key or ARROW keys to
     position the cursor or use commas or double quotes (") in your inputs!
     In some circumstances, entering a comma or double quote will result in
     the error message "REDO FROM START". If this message appears, do not
     attempt to reposition the cursor - simply make a correct input, at the
     current cursor position. Although the screen will be "messy" until it is
     redrawn, the program will proceed normally.
