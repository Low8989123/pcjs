## Information about "QREF, VXREF, AND CLOCK"

    A memory-resident utility that displays a list of all the DOS commands
    available and a detailed description of them.
    
    Scroll through a display of all the MS/PC-DOS commands. The DOS
    prompt will always be displayed at the top. You can limit the list by
    typing in a letter -- only the commands that begin with that letter
    will be displayed. Pressing another letter will limit the list to
    commands that begin with those two letters. Get a brief summary of the
    command or a detailed description.
    
    BASIC programmers -- VREF (Variables Cross-Reference) is a programming
    utility which will show all lines where a specific variable is located
    in a BASIC program.
    
    VXREF works with all BASIC programs written in GW/PC BASIC or BASICA and
    saved in an ASCII format.  It can distinguish between variables and
    arrays of the same name and will ignore type declarations and system
    variables.  Each occurrence of a variable in a line is mentioned once.
    The list may be printed on a printer or saved to a disk file.
    
    CLOCK displays a full analog clock face on the screen of your computer,
    including second hand, in real time taken from DOS.  A menu-based help
    function is available to allow sizing and positioning of the clock on
    the screen, but the default is full screen size.  The C source code for
    the program is included.

; CSYSINT  - Lattice "C" interface to the world
;
; This program was adapted from PSYSINT, a program listed
; and described by Will Fastie in SOFTALK Magazine, which
; provided access to system calls from IBM Pascal programs.
; It in turn was taken from George Eberhart's version for the
; Computer Inovations C86 Compiler, with permission.
;
; Modified by T. Cox to match the Microsoft C Compiler
; assembly language interface call conventions, and renamed
; to CSYSINT.
;
; C calling sequence:
;
;     flags = csysint(interrupt,&sreg,&rreg);
;
; Where sreg and rreg are structures of four words each representing
; the 8088 registers AX, BX, CX, and DX.  "regsetT is a structure
; defining these as all the half-register names (e.g.,AL,AH).
;
; interrupt is the number of the system interrupt desired.
;
; The return value is a 16-bit unsigned integer. It contains
; the machine status register.
;
; This C function calling sequence passes the interrupt code as a value
; and the two register sets as pointers to their respective structures.
;
; The incoming stack looks like this in memory locations "mem".  Note
; that the call is a NEAR call (page 1-36 of the Microsoft C manual),
; so only the return address (and not the segment address) is pushed.

Program Title: Q-REF, VXREF version 1.3, Clock
PC-SIG version 1.1

    Q-REF is a memory-resident utility that displays a description of the
DOS commands available to you. It includes all MS/PC-DOS commands for
version 2.10, and the version available on registration includes DOS 3.20
commands and additional help utilities. Once Q-REF is installed, you can
press the keys ALT and LEFT SHIFT together to get a display of all the DOS
commands, which you can scroll through. The DOS prompt is always displayed
at the top. You can limit the list by typing in a letter, and then only the
commands that begin with that letter are displayed. Pressing another letter
limits the list to commands that begin with those two letters. You can
either get a brief summary of the command, or you can get a detailed
description by choosing the command from the list. You get a detailed
description by scrolling through the list and pressing enter after the
command you want to review. Q-REF requires DOS 2.0 or higher, and the
program QREF.DOS must be located somewhere on the root directory of drives
A to D.

    VXREF (Variables Cross-Reference) is a utility that shows all lines
where a variable is in a BASIC program. VXREF works with all BASIC programs
written in GW/PC BASIC or BASICA and saved in an ASCII format. VXREF
distinguishs between variables and arrays of the same name, and ignores
type declarations and system variables as legal variables. Each occurrence
of a variable in a line is mentioned once. The list of variables can be
printed on a printer or saved to a disk file.

    CLOCK displays a full clock face on the screen, including second hand,
in real time. The time is taken from DOS upon execution. A menu-based help
function is available to allow sizing and positioning the clock on the
screen, but the default is full-screen size. The source code for the
program is included on this disk.

Usage: DOS Helper / BASIC Utility / Timekeeper

System Requirements: 128K memory, one disk drive and a CGA card for CLOCK.

How to Start: Type: QREF (press enter) to start QREF. Type: VX (press
enter) to start VXREF. Type: CLOCK (press enter) to start CLOCK.

Suggested Registration: $49.00 for QREF, $5.00 for VREF.

******  V X R E F **** Variables Cross Reference 

..the utility to show all lines where a variable is 
used; for all BASIC programs written in GW/PC Basic 
or BASICA and saved with A-Option ( i.e. as ASCII 
File); can be run on all IBM PCs and clones of low 
compatibility with DOS 2.0 or higher.

Features

VXREF is was compiled by MS Quickbasic (V 2.02), thus 
it is a fast, easy to use utility. It needs a simple 
BASIC source (in ASCII) as input, the neat list is 
created directly on printer or as a print file. 

VXREF is migthier than other programs of that kind, 
the reason why the author made up to it. It avoids 
common errors by this way:
- lines are n o t renumbered, whereas labels are 
   discarded 
- distinction between variables and arrays of same 
   name is made, e.g. A <> A(..)
- type declarations and system variables are ignored
   as legal variables (that means DEFINT A-I,X or 
   ERR, TIME$, EOF do n o t set up A,I,X or 
   ERR,TIME$,EOF in the output list) 
- each occurance of a variable inside a line is men- 
  tionned o n c e and does not blow up references


How to use 

VXREF is evoced by typing "VX", what will start the 
compiled program VXREF . Before it make sure  

- that the BASIC programm to be analysed is on disk as 
  ASCII file
- there is enough work space on standard disk drive 
  for the needed work file ( <= source in length)
- the printer is ready or in case you want a print 
  file theres enough space on disk

After starting you are prompted for the source file's 
name; you can type drive, path etc as far as your DOS 
allows that. This name is used with extension .PRN to 
create a wanted print file. Thats all to pay atten- 
tion for... 

At last one warning - dont break the running VXREF 
(with CNTRL BREAK), it leaves open files on disk !


Files on this disk

VX.EXE          executable file of VXREF
READ.ME         this instructions


********** VXREF is free software, you may copy or 
pass it as long as this remark, the instructions and 
the EXE File VX is completely transmitted. No fees or 
retail costs may be charged except pure distribution 
expenses ********************************************

If you are satisfied and VXREF had been of good use 
for you  send 5 US$ or equivalent in europeen curren- 
cy (no checks) to 
                      W. Kremer
                      Hoffnungsthaler Str 40
                      D - 5064 Roesrath
                      Fed Rep of Germany

As value you will get the latest release, the full 
basic souce code (!), more detailed instructions 
(e.g. how to enlarge VXREF for more commands), an 
example file to see how VXREF works and the autor's
helpline on request.
