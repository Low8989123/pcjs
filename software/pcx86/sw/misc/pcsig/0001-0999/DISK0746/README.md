## Information about "WILDCAT BBS 2 OF 2 (ALSO 745)"

    A full featured BBS with the easiest setup operation in the industry.
    In his review of the installation procedure John Dvorak says "...this is
    the way it's supposed to be done". A complete indexed documentation
    file is included which covers all program features. The message system
    includes private mail, forwarding, carbon copies, and return receipts.
    File transfers make use of Xmodem, Ymodem (batch), Zmodem (batch,
    Kermit, and any others as external protocols. A branching questionnaire
    allows formatted answers for order-taking or polling callers. WILDCAT!
    features specific internal support for multi-tasking operation. Baud
    rates up to 19,200 are supported. WILDCAT! lets you install an
    operational BBS and get a real feel for the power of the commercial
    multi-line/LAN release.
