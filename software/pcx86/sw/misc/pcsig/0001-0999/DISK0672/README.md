     Welcome to FREEWAY Software - a new concept introducing you to 
     a whole range of software for the business user.

     This software,  now available to you and your colleagues,has been 
     in  daily  use  in many and varied businesses for  the  last  six 
     years.  The  enhancements made  over this period are all included 
     in your version. 

     The enclosed disks contain  FREEWAY programs for Sales Ledger,    
     Purchase Ledger, Invoice Production and Payroll.

     FREEWAY SOFTWARE is available for you to use freely and there are 
     no limitations to its use other than those imposed by disk  size. 
     (Unlike  many other software companies we actively encourage  you 
     to  take copies of FREEWAY programs for other users - no  licence 
     fee is involved.)

     This  introductory leaflet will provide adequate information  for 
     you to use the system in its entirety. We feel sure that you will 
     find  the  programs  invaluable in  the  administration  of  your 
     business. 

     Should  you require a full and detailed manual to enable  you  to 
     use  the programs to full advantage telephone FREEWAY for a  copy 
     at minimal cost.

                        SALES & PURCHASE ACCOUNTING


                         INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

      
     BEFORE  PROCEEDING  FURTHER TAKE A COPY OF THE FREEWAY  DISK  AND 
     KEEP THE ORIGINAL IN A SAFE PLACE.

     If  you  are not familiar with copy routines refer to the  manual 
     accompanying your computer.

     Before  you  can  start  using  your  FREEWAY  Sales  &  Purchase 
     Accounting Software, it is necessary to configure the programs to 
     match your requirements.  This installation procedure is normally 
     performed once only. 

             IF YOUR COMPUTER CONTAINS TWO FLOPPY DISK DRIVES

     These instructions refer to a computer with two floppy drives. An 
     explanation for HARD DISK users follows on the next page.

     You will now require:

     1. A COPY (not the original) of the Master DOS Disk supplied with
        your computer. LABEL IT FREEWAY DOS DISK. Ensure that this disk 
        contains the ANSI.SYS file provided with your Master DOS disk.
      
        [Use  DISKCOPY  to  copy your Master DOS disk - refer  to  the 
        manual supplied with your computer for details.]

        Apricot & Sirius users will require instead a formatted disk 
        containing DOS.   LABEL IT FREEWAY DOS DISK.

     2. A new disk  which has been formatted ready for use.
        LABEL IT FREEWAY ACCOUNTING DATA DISK.

        [If you  are unfamiliar with the format routine refer  to  the 
        manual supplied with your computer.]


                               AWAY WE GO !

     Switch  on  the computer and Boot Up from your FREEWAY  DOS  disk 
     which should be placed in drive A.


     Place the FREEWAY ACCOUNTING PROGRAM DISK in drive B 

     Type B: and press the enter key. 

     Type INIT1 and press the enter key. 
     [ Apricot or RM Nimbus users instead type APRFD 
       then skip to the GETTING STARTED section ]

     Follow the instructions displayed on the screen until the "INIT1 
     COMPLETE" message appears on the screen. 

     Re-boot the computer OR (without removing the disks) switch off 
     the computer, wait for a few seconds and then switch on again. 



     Type B: and press the enter key. 

     Type INIT2 and press the enter key.

     Follow  the  instructions on the screen.  

     The  computer will ask you for details of your business  name and 
     address  etc.  (Have your VAT registration number and  post  code 
     handy.)

     Having created your accounting data disk, your FREEWAY Accounting
     System is ready to use. 

     General  instructions  and system conventions are shown later  in 
     this introduction. 



                IF YOUR COMPUTER CONTAINS A HARD DISK DRIVE
                ===========================================

  IF YOUR COMPUTER IS IBM COMPATIBLE :

     If ANSI.SYS was provided with the Operating System when you
     purchased your computer, ensure that it is contained in your
     root directory.

     Insert the FREEWAY ACCOUNTING PROGRAM disk in drive A

     Type A: and press the enter key. 

     Type HDINIT1 then press enter.

     Follow  the  instructions  displayed  on  the  screen  until  the        
     "HDINIT1  COMPLETE" message  appears. 

     You may then remove the FREEWAY ACCOUNTING PROGRAM disk.

     Switch  off the computer,  wait for a few seconds then switch  on 
     again. 

     Type HDINIT2 and press the enter key. 

     The  computer  will  ask you for details of your  business  name, 
     address  etc.  (Have your VAT registration number  and  post-code 
     handy.)

     This information will be permanently stored with your  accounting 
     data  and  will be used where appropriate,  on printouts such  as 
     statements of account.

     Having  created  your  accounts data on the hard  disk  (for  the 
     technically  oriented in  \FREEACC\   Subdirectory) your  FREEWAY 
     Accounting System is ready to use. 

     
  IF YOUR COMPUTER IS AN APRICOT OR SIRIUS :

     Insert the FREEWAY ACCOUNTING DATA disk in drive B

     Type B:    and press the enter key

     Type APRHD and press the enter key

     The  computer  will  ask you for details of your  business  name, 
     address  etc.  (Have your VAT registration number  and  post-code 
     handy.)

     This information will be permanently stored with your  accounting 
     data  and  will be used where appropriate,  on printouts such  as 
     statements of account.

     Having  created  your  accounts data on the hard  disk  (for  the 
     technically  oriented in  \FREEACC\   Subdirectory) your  FREEWAY 
     Accounting System is ready to use. 




               OUTLINE INSTRUCTIONS AND SYSTEM CONVENTIONS. 

     GETTING STARTED

     If your computer is a twin floppy drive system: 

     Insert the FREEWAY ACCOUNTING PROGRAM DISK in drive A 
     Insert the FREEWAY ACCOUNTING DATA DISK in drive B 

     Ensure  that  you are in CAPS lock and NUMBER lock mode. 

     For  hard disk and twin floppy systems alike all you need now  do 
     is :

     Type ACCOUNTS and press the enter key. 

     Enter the date in the following format (DDMMYY) e.g.

     Date: 210784

     Enter 21st July 1984 in the format shown above.

                         Select S for Sales Ledger 
                                P for Purchase Ledger

     SYSTEM CONVENTIONS

     The use of the system is largely self-explanatory. 

     The following rules generally apply to all modules: 


          C  (Enter)  will  CANCEL an entry  part  way  through- where 
             appropriate.

          E  (Enter) will END what you are doing.
             (Usually inserted in the date or account number field.)
      
     In  certain circumstances you will CANCEL what you are doing  and 
     then E to END.


     Having  selected Sales or Purchases print out a Sales or Purchase 
     Daybook Summary and note the "Nominal  Analysis  Headings" 

     These  should  be  amended  to  be appropriate for your own business.

     NOTE  THAT THE FIRST HEADING OF EITHER SALES OR PURCHASES  SHOULD 
     BE SET UP FOR THE MOST PREDOMINANT TYPE OF SALE OR  PURCHASE. 

     In  default  of an alternative number being entered  this  number 
     will be adopted. This speeds entry up considerably.

     CUSTOMERS  or SUPPLIER  records should be created  and  documents 
     encoded with the customer number and nominal analysis code before 
     entering a batch of invoices. 











     VAT  STATISTICS   accumulate values from both sales and  purchase 
     ledgers.  They should be printed and cleared at intervals to  co-
     incide with your VAT periods.

     The Vat Code numbers are used when entering invoices to allow for 
     correct  allocation to the Vat Statistics file and  for  charging 
     VAT at the correct rate during Invoice Production.


     CASH  POSTING  includes the facility to  automatically  discharge 
     invoices in order of entry. In addition invoices may be placed on 
     HOLD  if  in  dispute  and there is a facility  to  note  JOURNAL 
     entries.

     This introduction should enable you to become operational.

     Should  you  require a full and detailed manual to enable you  to 
     use  the  programs  to full advantage telephone  FREEWAY  at  the 
     number below for a  copy at minimal cost.

     service,  contact FREEWAY software support on:

             AN INTRODUCTION TO THE FREEWAY PAYROLL PROGRAMS.


     FREEWAY PAYROLL programs can accomodate weekly, fortnightly, four 
     weekly and monthly pay frequencies. 

     The programs provide for:

     contributions.

     Additional Voluntary Contributions.

     Up  to  99  departments each with a coin  analysis  and  cost  of 
     payroll total.

     You  may  create  your own headings for taxable and  non-taxable 
     additions to pay - and post tax deductions. 

     You  may  produce lists of amounts deducted /  paid  under  these

     to  basic  pay and hours,   any  regularly  occuring  payment  - or 
     deduction.

     pay cycle to be easily re-done should errors come to light, until 
     an  End-Processing Update is carried out.  This may be the  first

     Instructions on the use of the system now follow. 






                      HOW TO USE THE PAYROLL PROGRAMS



     If your computer contains two floppy disk drives place the prog-
     ram disk in drive A and the data disk in drive B.
     [ Apricot and Sirius users use drive A only. ]

     When  installed on a hard disk system the programs and data  will 
     be resident on the hard disk. 

     On  some computers the keyboard will have to be set to  recognise 
     U.K.  character  sets.  Refer  to  the  documentation  with  your 
     computer - or your supplier.

     Ensure that you are in CAPSLOCK mode. 

     Type PAYSTART and press the enter key.

     Enter  the password -  PAYROLL and press the enter key.

     (The password  may be changed by accessing the AMEND COMPANY 
     CONSTANTS routine - instructions follow later) 

     Insert the date  (1st June 1985 should be entered as 010685 ) 

     You will be rewarded with a menu of the available options.



                            SYSTEM CONVENTIONS

            E    followed by the enter key will END the routine. 
            C    followed  by  the  enter  key  will  CANCEL  the 
                 entry  where appropriate. 
            ?    entered  in  most  fields will reward  you  with  an 
                 explanation of valid entries. 

            @    entered in the company constants area related to the 
                 additional user defined payments and deductions, will
                 clear  the  original  description and  permit  a  new 
                 insertion.      

             EMPLOYEE REFERENCES ARE STRICTLY NUMERIC 2 - 100
                  (Number 1 is used internally by the system.)

                 HAVING INSTALLED YOUR PAYROLL WHAT NEXT ?



     You will wish to amend the Company Constants to show your name 
     and address.

     Select Option 1 - TABLES MAINTENANCE followed by sub-menu Option 
     7. Amend the details as appropriate. 

     Print all the tables and examine them. Confirm that the tax 
     bandwidths and rates and national insurance figures are those 
     currently in force. 

     Whilst   you  should  be  able  to  process  your  payroll  quite 
     routinely  from these outline instructions,  a MANUAL  obtainable 
     from FREEWAY at minimal cost also includes a list of the  current 
     bandwidths etc. 

     To  change  the  PASSWORD select TABLES MAINTENANCE  followed  by 
     AMEND COMPANY CONSTANTS and enter field number 40. 

     Now  you  can  create  your employee  records  and  proceed  with 
     processing.



                  THE NORMAL ORDER OF ROUTINE PROCESSING. 


          1       Create new Employees and do any amendments.  

          2       Enter any PAY VARIABLES. 

          3       Calculate Pay.

          4       Print Pay Advices.
                  (  Check  the result and go back to  1  if  required 
                     followed by a recalculate.) 

          5       Print the Department Summary.

          6       Print a Payroll Summary (if required)

          7       Take a backup copy of the data disk. 

          8       When you are satisfied that the paycycle is FINAL
                  do the End Processing Up-date.
