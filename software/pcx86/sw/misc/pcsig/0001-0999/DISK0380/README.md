## Information about "GLUDRAW"

    GLUDRAW offers good graphics generation software with extensive on-line
    help and sample drawings.  It is a simple easy to use program for both
    children and adults.  This software requires BASRUN.EXE which is part
    of the BASIC compiler, a commercial program.  If you need to generate
    graphics images with any regularity, this is a program worth your
    consideration.
    
    System Requirements: Color graphics; some programs require BASIC
    
    How to Start: Load DOS and type GLUDRAW.  (BASRUN.EXE must be resident
    on memory.)  To run BASIC programs consult the directions in GETTING
    STARTED for your configuration.
