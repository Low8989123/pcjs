## Information about "RECIPE INDEX"

    Recipe83(tm) is a database index to 1800 recipes that appeared in the
    1983 issues of Women's Day and Family Circle magazines.  If these
    magazines are saved in your home, this database will provide the
    advantages of computer indexing.  Note: it is necessary that you have
    saved the magazines, or have them readily available from a library.
    iRecipe83 is an INDEX ONLY, not a repeat of the recipes.

Has your spouse benefitted from your home computer???
Isn't it time the cook benefitted from computer indexing??

     iRecipe83(tm)   is   a  database  index  to   1800   recipes 
(1800,count  them,1800) that appeared in  Family Circle magazine, 
and Woman's Day magazine in 1983. If these magazines are saved in 
your home, this database will provide the advantages of computer 
indexing.   Note:  it  is  necessary  that  you  have  saved  the 
magazines,    or    have   them   readily   available   from    a 
library.  iRecipe83  is  an  INDEX not a repeat of  the  recipes.   
iRecipe83  is available on disk for three database programs  that 
run on the IBM-PC/XT,  IBM compatible micros,  and the IBM PC Jr. 
It is available for LOTUS 1-2-3, dBASEII, and PC-FILEIII (A user-  
supported database program). 
      
     This index is also user-supported software.  It may be copied 
and shared with others.  If after evaluating this  database,  you 
find it is useful, you are trusted to send in a $10. payment to:
  Learning Games, 465 Rock Road, State College, PA 16851

      With this 1800 record database, it will be possible for the 
cook in your family to look for  CHICKEN recipes (it happens that 
there  are 84),  or ORIENTAL CHICKEN recipes (there happen to  be 
2),  or any other combination that he/she might specify. If there 
is some ground beef in the refrigerator that has to be used,  you 
can  print a list of recipes in which ground beef is listed as an 
ingredient.  In all cases,  the computer will yield the magazine, 
the  date,  and  the  page number  of  the  recipe  selected.  If 
requested,  it  also can list the last step in the preparation of 
the dish,  and a more extensive list of ingredients,  so that the 
cook can see if he/she has the ingredients needed.  You may enter 
ratings of the recipes to guide your choice in the future.

     If you have never mastered a database program,  we recommend 
PC-FILEIII  as a good one that is easy to learn.  It  works  very 
well  with  only 128K of memory(RAM),  but reaches greater  speed 
with more RAM.See reviews in PC MAG.,Oct.83,p.558-9; PC MAG.,June 
12,'84,p.177; PC World,V1,#6,p.154-159; & Softalk,June 83,p.123. 
If  you  wish to secure a copy of PC-FILEIII,  you  can  probably 
obtain it from your local user's group.  If they do not have  it, 
you can secure a copy by sending a check or money order for $9 to 
Central PA IBM PC User's group,  215B,  Computer Bldg, University 
Park, PA 16802.
   
     This documentation for the PC-FILEIII versions should permit 
a  cook  to use the database even if the cook's present  computer 
knowledge is limited to how to turn on the micro, and how to load 
a disk.  Hopefully,  this documentation can stand alone,  without 
having to study the documentation for PC-FILEIII in general. 

      The people who order the iRecipe83 database for  LOTUS 1-2-
3  and dBASEII probably are already familiar with these programs.  
However,  instructions are included in each order to help a  cook 
with   little   computer   knowledge   make  effective   use   of 
iRecipe83(tm).
ORDERS
     The  following  table illustrates various  possible  orders. 
Circle  your  order,  and  enclose a check,  or money  order  for 
$20. Only  the PCFile version of iRecipe83 is available  as  user-
supported  software.  Orders are mailed directly to users only if 
accompanied by a check or money order.

DOCUMENTATION  iRecipe83:PC-FILEIII_V3.0  version for IBM  &  IBM 
compatibles.  INDEX  for  RECIPES found  in the  1983  issues  of 
Family  Circle  magazine  and   Woman's day magazine.

     This  product has no connection with Family Circle Inc.,  or 
CBS publications,  the publishers of the above two magazines, but 
is a new and copyrighted product of Learning Games, 465 Rock Road,
State College PA, 16851. Copyright 1984.All rights reserved.

      iRecipe83, PC-FILEIII VERSION, is a data base containing an 
index  to  recipes found in the above magazines.It uses the  IBM-
PC/XT  or  IBM-PC  compatible  microcomputers,    and  the  user-
supported   program,   PC-FILEIII_V3.0   to  provide   an   easy,  
convenient   method   for  locating   recipes.   There  are  1800 
recipes  in the index,   all  of which  can be easily located  by 
proper use of the IBM-PC computer or an IBM compatible. Note that 
file  storage is slightly different between  PC-FILEIII_V3.0  and 
prior  versions  of  PC-FILE.  The instructions  here  thus  hold 
exactly only for Version 3.0 (or later). 

I.<<Getting  started.>>  This section you only have to do  once.  The 
instructions vary slightly with the equipment you have.  We  will 
describe how to proceed for standard equipment.
     IA.Standard equipment includes two 360 K drives,  and Random 
Access Memory(RAM) of 128K or larger. If you don't have 128K RAM, 
go buy & install some chips- RAM is relatively cheap.  Additional 
RAM will increase processing speed. 
     You   should  have  a  floppy  disk  containing   PC-FILEIII 
version 3.0 and another labeled as iRecipe83dt.   The first thing 
to do is to make a work copy of each disk,  so the originals will  
not  be at risk if anything goes wrong.The originals  should have 
a write protect tab, leave it on as further protection.
     Turn on your computer,and after  the ROM BASIC signs  appear 
on   the screen,put your DOS2.X or DOS 3.X disk in the left  disk  
drive (drive A).   DOS2.X  refers to DOS2.0 or any later  version 
of  DOS  such as DOS2.1.    Now press three keys  simultaneously. 
Press  <Ctrl>  <Alt> <Del>  simultaneously.   The   <  >  symbols 
identify  a key   by  the labels inside them.Thus <A>  identifies 
the  A key.  Either <return> or  <enter> identifies the entry key 
found  to  the  left of the <7> and <4> keys on  the  right  hand 
numeric  key pad.The <enter> key is marked  with a left  pointing 
arrow.   This  key  usually  is  pressed when  you  have  entered 
something  on the screen and want to send it to  be  processed.If 
you  hit  the three keys <Ctrl> <Alt> and  <Del>  simultaneously, 
the  left  disk drive light should have come  on,and  the  screen 
should   now  show  A>.    (Additional  other  events  may   have 
intervened, such as a request for the date and time, depending on 
how  your  DOS  disk  is set up.)  To  make a work  copy,   enter 
"DISKCOPY  A:  B:" <ENTER>.  The left disk drive light will  come 
on,and the screen will say "ENTER THE SOURCE DISK IN DRIVE A: AND 
THE TARGET DISK IN DRIVE B: hit any key when ready " (Drive A: is 
the  left hand drive,  drive B:  is the right hand drive.) Insert 
the  original  IRECIPE83DT disk in the left drive,   and a  blank 
disk  in the right drive,   put the levers down,  then press  any 
key.  The screen  will tell you when the copying is finished  and 
the   drive lights will go out.   Remove both disks,  and put the 
original away for safe keeping.   When the screen prompts:  "Copy 
another(Y/N)?_  enter  N  <return>.The  A> symbol  should  return  
to   the   screen,  indicating  that DOS is waiting,   and the  A 
drive  is the  default drive  (where the computer will  look  for 
files). 
     ID.  Printing  the PC-FILEIII documentation.  If you have  a 
printer,it  is  a  good idea to take the time to  print  out  the 
documentation  for PC-FILEIII.Put the PC-FILEIII  disk in the  A: 
drive.  The screen should show A> meaning that the left drive  is 
the default drive.  If it does not show A>,  type <A> <:> <enter> 
and it should show A>. When your printer is turned on, and ready, 
type DOC <enter>. The printer should now print out about 41 pages 
of  documentation telling how PC-FILEIII works in general.You  do 
not  need  to  read  this documentation to  use  PC-FILEIII  with 
iRecipe83,  since  we  will try to explain this  in  the  present 
documentation.  However,  if you wish to use PC-FILEIII for other 
purposes,   the   PC-FILEIII  documentation  will  come  in  very 
handy.  Printing  will  take  some  time,   you may  wish  to  do 
something else for a while,   and come back when the printer  has 
stopped. If you have not yet mastered any other database program,  
you  should  study  the  PC-FILEIII documentation later,since  it 
can  do  many other useful tasks.  Complete printed documentation 
for PCFILEIII is available only if you become a registered  owner 
by sending $49 to: Jim Button, P.O. Box 5786, Bellevue, WA 98006.
     With the DOS disk in the left(A) drive,  hit 3 keys at once; 
the <Ctrl>, <Alt> <Del>. This is known as "rebooting" the system, 
and  will cause the screen to clear,  and the left hand  disk  to 
start reading.
     The PC-FILEIII disk, as usually received, is not in the most 
convenient working form.  Let us prepare a work disk without  all 
the  documentation,  but  with all the PC-FILEIII files  actually 
needed   for work.To do this,   leave your DOS disk in the   left 
drive.Then press <FORMAT B:/S/V> <ENTER>. Put a blank disk in the 
right  hand  drive and then press any key.  The right  hand  disk 
light  will  come on and eventually the screen will  say  "Format 
complete"  "System transferred" "Volume label(11  character,ENTER 
for none}?"
     Enter  <PC-FILEIIIW>  and this disk label will now  identify 
this  disk as your PC-FILEIII work disk.  However,  so far it has 
the  minimal  DOS  system and the label,   but no working  files.  
Type <copy  CHKDSK.COM  B:>  Now  remove the DOS disk  from   the  
left  drive,   and insert your PC-FILEIII disk and type in  <COPY 
PC*.EXE   B:><enter>.   This  should cause the screen to list  11 
file  names  as it  copies  them to the disk in  the  B:   drive,  
then to state  "11 files  copied".   Now  the PC-FILEIIIW disk is 
all ready  for  any needed work, and will have considerable blank 
space if you decide to use PC-FILEIII for any other purposes.

II. General Orientation of iRecipe83 records.
     Before  we consider any more details,  lets take an  overall 
look  at  the index records in iRecipe83.For each recipe  indexed 
there is a computer file such as the one below:
RCD.            3
NAME OF DISH APPETIZER,TOMATO MOZZARELLA +
FOOD CLASS   APPETIZERS & SANDWICHES 2

We   shall  explain  how  you  can  easily  access  these 
records.  We  hope  that we have designed them so  that  you  can 
readily   obtain   the   information  you  need.To   follow   the 
explanation, please get a copy of the "NESTED MENU OF iRecipe83". 
There should be three copies of this sheet;  one on a large sheet 
with  normal size type,  and two copies on a regular  sheet.  You 
will  often  use this menu,  so we suggest that you  either  make 
several  Xerox  copies,  or put one sheet inside  of  transparent 
plastic so that it will not become illegible. 
Note  that  this  main  MENU deals with  the  two  fields 
identified  above  as FOOD CLASS (in columns ) and TYPE  OF  DISH 
which is printed down the sides of the MENU (Corresponding to the 
dishes in the rows beneath the column headings).  The easiest way 
to locate the recipes you want is to find a TYPE OF DISH entry in 
the  MENU,  and then ask PC-FILEIII to either LISt all entries of 
that dish, or ask PC-FILEIII to FINd those entries one at a time.
     Before  we illustrate how to use PC-FILEIII to find  recipes 
for you,lets take a brief look at the record above as an  example 
of what has been stored for each recipe.
     RCD.  is  the  record number of this recipe in  the  set  of     
records.RCD  is known as the Field Name,  while 3 is the entry in 
that field.This is indeed the relative position of this record in 
the complete set of 1800 records.
     NAME  OF DISH is the field name for the first field. The name 
of this particular recipe, APPETIZER,TOMATO MOZZARELLA + , is the 
field  data for this particular recipe (#3).  This name is  often 
close  to the name of the recipe in the magazine cited.  However, 
this  is not always the case,  and in many  examples,  additional 
ingredients are listed.  Recipes are like music, there are count-
less ways of adding and combining possible  ingredients.    There 
are  also  countless possible names.  Some of these names  convey 
little  information.   For  example,   Mother`s  favorite   Merry 
Christmas  Wreaths.  This suggests the result will be round,  and 
appropriate in the Christmas season, but does not even inform the 
reader whether it is a candy,  a cookie, or some imaginative pot-
pie with a green decoration around the outside.  Many other terms 
are only status terms of no information value:  delicious, fresh, 
etc.  We'll let you judge how delicious a given recipe  is,rather 
than repeating such status words. We have also reversed the order 
of most names,  so the most useful word comes first.Thus a recipe 
in  a  magazine named "OLIVE ARTICHOKE SAUSAGE QUICHE"  has  been 
stored as "QUICHE,OLIVE ARTICHOKE SAUSAGE". This is because it is 
much  faster for you to produce a list of all 'QUICHE' recipes if 
QUICHE is first in a field.  It is a much slower process for  the 
computer to search thru the entire name.  However,  we like names 
such  as  this one that informs the reader what  ingredients  are 
needed  in  a  recipe.  In our initial tryout,  the  first  users 
reported  they wanted lists of ingredients to be as  complete  as 
possible  so  that  they would know if they had what  was  needed 
before  they took the time to pull out that particular  magazine, 
and turn to the proper page. 
     Unfortunately,  this is a trade-off problem where we can not 
make  everyone happy.  Some recipes had  20-25 ingredients if  we 
list every spice, etc. Yet others had only 3 or 4. We would waste 
lots of disk space (and RAM space) if every recipe had 20  fields 
for  ingredients.  We could have far fewer recipes available than 
we  do under the present set-up.  Thus we tried to list the  most 
important  ingredients.However,  we  hoped to  use  your  general 
cooking  knowledge  so  that we did not  waste  disk  space  with 
obvious ingredients. Most cooks know that if you are going to bake 
a  cake,  you  need flour,sugar,and butter.Thus these are  rarely 
listed.  However,  brown sugar is less common, so we would try to 
list this ingredient, particularly if the amount called for was in 
cup size (a cup, 1/2 a cup, or even 1/4 cup). 
     In  general,  we  advise you to  have  flour,  sugar,  eggs, 
onions, butter,and a good spice rack. If you do, we hope that the 
ingredients  we list will be all else that you need.If  the  list 
was  so  long  that  we  were  not  able  to  get  all  important 
ingredients  in,  we put a + at the end of the NAME OF DISH entry 
to  warn  you  that there might be one or  more  other  important 
ingredients. 
     We  also used some abbreviations,  or alternate  words.  Many 
recipes call for margarine or butter.We listed butter since it is 
shorter,  but you can take your choice. Sweet potato is listed as 
YAMS, so POTATO always refers to conventional potatoes with white 
insides.   CHOC.   is   often   used  for   chocolate,MUSHR   for 
mushrooms,VEG for vegetable, BR for brown, STUFD for stuffed, SWT 
for SWEET,UNSWT for unsweetened,SEMISWT for semisweet,etc. 
     TYPE OF DISH. This is the major field you will use to locate 
all  recipes of a given type.The first word should correspond  to 
one  of the entries beneath the column headings of  your  "NESTED 
MENU  OF  iRecipe83".  Thus  under  column  1  with  the  heading 
BEVERAGES  1  you  find  an entry  of  BUTTERMILK.  To  find  all 
buttermilk  drinks,   you  will  ask  PC_FILE  to  LIST  or  FIND 
BUTTERMILK  in  the  TYPE OF DISH field.  In the  example  record 
above,  we find the entry APPETIZER,TOMAT .  The TOMAT tells  you 
that  the main ingredient is tomato,  but we ran out of space and 
so lost the last O in tomato. We could look at all entries listed 
under APPETIZER, or we could look for only those that have tomato 
as the major ingredient by listing under APPETIZER,TOM.  More  on 
this later.
     ORIGIN  is the next field name.  The data here contains  the 
ethnic origin of the recipe,  if one is given.Most recipes do not 
give   a  specific ethnic origin so that we have listed  USA   as  
the default  field value.   That is,   USA is used if there is no 
other  specific ethnic origin given.   Thus you would not want to  
search to find recipes with an ORIGIN of USA,   because you might 
receive a list of most of the 1800 recipes. We thought this would 
be most useful if you wanted to plan a mexican dinner.  You could 
then  ask  to  see all recipes classified as  MEXI,   and  choose 
those   you liked.Major  categories  used  other than   USA   and  
MEXICO,  were  CHINA,ORIENT,SPAIN,&   ITALY,   along with a   few  
rarities such as SERBIA,JAVA,RUSSIA,  & JAPAN. If you want, it is 
possible to combine requests to LIST only dishes that are CHICKEN 
and ORIENT. More on this later.
     MEAL:  this  category  lists dishes  for  BRKFST(breakfast), 
LUNCH,DINNER,  or sometimes, LUNdin for a dish deemed appropriate 
for  either LUNch or dinner.  Some dishes like bread were  listed 
under ANY,  meaning they could be used at any meal.DINNER is  the 
default,since  most  recipes involve enough preparation  so  that 
they are likely to be used at dinner rather than LUNCH or BRKFST. 
All  CANDY was listed as a SNACK.   DINNER was used unless  there 
was  an  indication  that  another  meal  was  most  appropriate. 
Pancakes would usually be listed under BRKFST,  but CREPES  might 
be  found  under  either BRKFST or DINNER.Again,  we  advise  not 
searching under DINNER or you may receive a very long list. 
     PREPARE: The entry under prepare is usually the last step in 
making  this dish.Many recipes have several steps in preparation. 
If  you  BAKE and then let cool to an  "eatable  temperature"  we 
considered this cooling normal,  and list BAKE as the field under 
PREPARE.  However,  if the recipe called for baking, then to chill 
in  the refrigerator for over 1 hour,  we would list CHILL as the 
last  step  in the preparation.   Instructions to  place  in  the 
freezer for 10 minutes,also would be listed as CHILL.However,  in 
the freezer for 1 hour or longer would be listed as FREEZE. Major 
entries in this area are:BAKE, ROAST, BOIL, SIMMER, FRY, DEEPFRY,  
STIRFRY,  CHILL,  FREEZE,  GRILL,etc.  BROIL would be done  under 
heat,typically  in an oven.  GRILL would usually be done above  a 
charcoal fire.  Sometimes,  ingredients are just placed over heat 
until warm, in which case we said HEAT.
     FIRST  INGRED  =  first ingredient.This is the  first  major 
ingredient  that  was  not already listed in  the  NAME  OF  DISH 
field.Ingredients listed in cup size were first in priority, then 
tablespoon  size,then  teaspoon,   if space  was available.   One 
exception to this size criteria was an ingredient that the source 
of  the  recipe  felt should be included in  the  name.  Thus  if 
"GINGER"  was  in the name,  we would try to list it,  unless  we 
judged  that  other  ingredients in larger size  were  even  more 
important.The  first  ingredient  listed  above,PEPPER,SWT  R  is 
supposed  to stand for a red(R) sweet(SWT) pepper.Whether  it  is 
red  or green probably is not very important to the taste of  the 
dish.  
     SECOND INGRD =   Essentially   the   same   as   the   first 
ingredient.   This  field name may be used to illustrate a tactic 
we occasionally use to squeeze in an extra letter in a field.  In 
PC-FILEIII field names  are  limited to 12 characters.   Thus  we 
could   use  either SECOND  INGRD  or use SECONDingred where  the 
change  from all CAPS to all lower case indicates a break between 
two words.   Note that all  field names and field entries are  in 
capital letters  unless such  a  change has been made to conserve 
space.It   is good practice to use all capital letters when  you 
are asking  PC-FILEIII to find a recipe index.  Use the CAPS LOCK  
key   so  that   all   letters   are   entered  in   CAPS    when   
you    are  searching. Usually,  we  will have  used  lower  case 
letters only  at the end of a field,   or far enough to the right 
so  that  you would not  use them in a search request  (either  a 
FIND or a  LIST).   The second ingredient above, LETTUCEleave  is 
lettuce leaves.
     MAG. = magazine:  Either WOMA for Woman's Day, or FAMI for 
Family Circle.
     DATE  &  PAGE:  Oct.  4,1983,p.152i is where this recipe  is 
found.In  most cases,  this  is  straightforward.  However,  both 
magazines  sometimes  have special inserts.  This was handled  by 
marking   the  page  as  p.160i,   with  the  i  indicating   the 
insert.Sometimes,  the insert pages were numbered continuing  the 
usual sequence in the magazine,  so that a regular p.159 would be 
followed  by  160i.Other times,  the insert was not  numbered  or 
would start again with a 1,2,...  In the later case,  we numbered 
by hand so that the usual page sequence was continued,160i, 161i, 
162i, etc.
     Family  Circle often has a regional section,  that we  assume 
varies  in  different  parts of the USA.  This was  indicated  by 
p.160r.  Since PA is in the eastern USA,  you may not find  these 
recipes if you live in a different section of the country. 
     R#:  This field deliberately is left blank.We recommend that 
after you use one of the recipes, you enter a rating from 1 to 9, 
with 9 being high. If the recipe is an absolute dud, rate it a 0, 
and delete it,  so that the computer is no longer even looking at 
it during a search. You might use the following scale:
1       2       3      4       5       6       7      8       9
use     poor         average         good          excellent
only if                                                  SUPERB
cheap
     Be  sure  to enter the single digit in the R# field after  a 
blank,so  that it is entered as a single digit,  6 rather than  a 
60.PC-FILEIII  automatically sums values in this field,  and obtains 
an average, but it treats blanks as 0 so this average will not be 
very meaningful until you fill in most numerical ratings. 
     This completes a brief summary of the field names, and field 
entries.  Now let's consider how to use PC-FILEIII to obtain recipes 
of  interest.

III. Typical uses of PC-FILEIII and iRecipe83 together. 
     Using   with   two   360K disk  drives.   Insert   the   PC-
FILEIIIW   disk in the left(A:) drive and the iRecipe83  disk  in 
the right hand(B:) drive. If the computer is already running, and 
the   screen  shows  A> just type "PC-FILE   <enter>".This   will 
bring  up  the  PC-FILEIII  program with  a  graphic  display  as 
discussed below.  If  the computer is not turned on,   turn it on 
and  wait  for the  memory  check and  the ROM(read only  memory) 
BASIC   display.  Then  insert the DOS disk in the left (A:) disk  
drive,   and  the iRecipe83  disk in the right hand drive.  Press 
the  <Ctrl>  <Alt> <Del> keys simultaneously.  This is  known  as 
"booting  the  system",  and   will  enter the  DOS2.0  into  the 
system.Remove  the DOS  disk,  and   place   PC-FILEIIIW  in  the  
left   hand   disk.Type   <PC-FILE><enter>.  You will now  see  a 
nice  graphic  display,  giving the author  of   the  PC-FILEIII.  
     You have  the  IRECIP83.DTA,   IRECIP83.INX,   and the other  
pertinent iRecipe83 files on one disk,   and will have PC-FILEIII 
and  all  of its pertinent files on a  second  disk.   Note  that 
although  we  use the trademark  iRecipe83,   under MS-DOS a file 
name can have only 8 characters prior to the period,   and  three 
characters  after the period.   PC-FILE requires the DTA and  INX 
suffix  to  recognize the type of file as a data file(DTA) or  an 
index file(INX).  Also file names are stored in capital  letters. 
Thus  we must leave off the e of iRecipe83 and identify the files 
by IRECIP83.    
     Towards the bottom of the screen,  you will see the  message 
"Which  drive(A-H) for the data?"  Reply <B> <return>.  Then  you 
will   see the message "Indicate an existing or a  new  database. 
Type a name or select w cursor keys.[        ]
                                    [IRECIP83]  
     Since  IRECIP83  is  the only database on the disk (it takes 
up  most  of the  disk),  move the cursor down to [IRECIP83]  and 
press  <F10>.  This  will  produce a  message  "Loading  IRECIP83 
Index",  then eventually will produce the master menu screen.This 
looks like this: IRECIP83:1800 Records
                    (F1)ADD-add a record
                    (F2)MOD-modify a record
                    (F3)DEL-delete a record
                    (F4)DIS-display a record
                    (F5)FIN-find a record
                    (F6)LIS-list or clone
                    (F7)SOR-sort the index
                    (F8)EXP-export or other utilities
                    (F9)NAM-alter a name field or mask 
                    GLO-global update or delete
                    KEY  set up the smart KEYs
                    END or change database
Awaiting your Command[FIN] 
     Note  that  FIN is already awaiting in the command space  at 
the  bottom of the screen.  Usually,  PC-FILE will have the  most 
commonly  used command already there.  If this is what you  want, 
just press <enter>.  If you want another command, you may press a 
function key (F1 to F9) or enter 
     Usually  you  will use F5(FINd) or F6(LISt) to search for  a 
given  type of recipe.  You may use F2(MODify) to add your rating 
number(#)  to a given recipe record,  and may use  F3(DELete)  to 
remove  a recipe that you conclude is not worth saving.  We  will 
explain  how to use these functions.   Those plus the END are all 
that you normally need. The other functions are useful if you are  
creating   your  own database (such as the   addresses   of   all 
people  on your Christmas card list).   We shall leave the  other 
functions to the PC-FILEIII documentation. 
     Note  that each F# stands for one of the 10 function keys on 
the  left  of the IBM-PC keyboard.  You can call  a  function  by 
pressing one of these 10 keys. Also note that each function above 
has three capital letters,  as in F3 (DELete).  You can call this 
function  either  by  pressing  the F3 key on  the  left  of  the 
keyboard, or by entering <D><E><L><enter>. Any of the other 
functions can be called by similar methods. 

IV. Locating recipes using the F5(FINd) function
     Let us consider a typical F5(FINd) application. If you press 
F5, you will see a listing of the field names:
NAME OF DISH 
FOOD CLASS   
TYPE OF DISH
ORIGIN      
MEAL
PREPARE
FIRST INGRED
SECOND INGRD
MAG
DATE & PAGE
R#                                                                       
     The screen will ask for "Field to search"? [__________]   
The   iRecipe83 data base has been set up so that the easiest way 
to find most dishes is to use the "NESTED MENU OF  iRecipe83" and  
search   in TYPE OF DISH.   Enter <TYPE><return>  (meaning  enter  
all   four  letters T Y P & E).You will see a square appear  next 
to the field name TYPE OF FIELD[] .
     Actually,  you can enter just <T> and since TYPE OF DISH  is 
the  only  field  name starting with a "T" just  <T>  <enter>  is 
sufficient  to  identify this field.Now the screen at  the  lower 
left will show:
'>XXX  (scan  full field) ?XXX (soundex)
Look for[____________] 
     Assume you want to find a chicken recipe.  Type in <CHICKEN> 
<enter>.  Now  PC-FILE   will start searching for a  recipe  with 
CHICKEN  as  the  first letters  in  the  TYPE  OF  DISH   field.  
There   are   several  such recipes,   84 in fact.  The  F5  FINd 
command  will report them one at a  time,   showing  them  on  11 
lines,   like  the  appetizer  example given above.  Beneath  the 
record  it will say:  "Continue,Stop,Modify,or Delete [C]"  Press 
<enter> if you wish to continue, S,M,or D then <enter> otherwise. 
     If  the recipe you see is one you would like to  try,  write 
down the magazine,  date,  and page.If this one recipe is all you 
want,  then  press <S> <enter>.This would return you to the  main 
menu. 
     If  you have a printer,  and want to print this  record,just 
press   a  <shift  key>  (upward  arrow)  and  the  <PrtSc>   key 
simultaneously.This  will cause whatever is on the screen  to  be 
printed.Wait until the printer is stopped before proceeding.
     If  you would like to look at more  chicken  recipes,  press 
<enter> without proceeding it with an S.  The next chicken recipe 
entry  will  be shown.  After another <enter> ,a third record  is 
shown,   etc.  This  can  continue until you run out  of  chicken 
entries,  or  until  you press <S> <enter>.  If you  run  out  of 
chicken  recipes,  then the bottom left of the screen  will  say: 
Press (ESC) to abort.
TYPE OF DISH = CHICKEN not found. Press (ENTER) [ ]
     Then the bottom of the screen will again contain:
Field to search [____________]
     If you want to return to the main menu, just press the enter 
key  <enter>.  If  you want to locate a different dish,  you  may 
enter  TYPE  OF DISH again,  and specify another  dish  from  the 
NESTED  MENU  OF iRecipe83.  In fact,  you may search on  another 
field if you want.  We recommend searching on TYPE OF DISH because 
we have created the records so that searching is fastest on  that 
field,  and  the  entries  are  most consistent  in  that  field. 
However,  if you are not in a hurry,  you can search in any other 
field. It is legal to specify: 
Field to search:<<NAME>>  and then when you see: 
Look  for [_____________] enter CHICKEN.
      This too should find most chicken dishes, but it may miss a 
few  early  records where we entered something like EASY  CHICKEN 
before we decided to always make the major food the first term in 
the name.  We always did this in TYPE OF DISH and this is why  it 
is  both safer and faster usually to search in this field.  Since 
CHICKEN  is not the first 7 letters in the name EASY CHICKEN  the 
computer  would  not recognize it as a  match.  You  could  enter 
>CHICKEN and then it would recognize EASY CHICKEN as a match, but 
this would definitely be much slower than a search under TYPE OF 
DISH.  The  use of the >CHICKEN entry would  cause  the  computer  
to  go thru all letters in a name to see if any (even at the end) 
matched CHICKEN. This is a much slower process. 

V.<<Locating recipes using the F6(LISt) function. >>
     The  list function differs from the find function in that it 
will list several different  records at once,  rather than one at 
a  time.  It also is more flexible in that it can select on  more 
than  one field,  while the F5(FINd) function can select on  only 
one field.  Again, you probably will find it fastest to select on 
TYPE OF DISH,but you can use any of the 11 fields if you want to. 
     Let us illustrate how to find chicken recipes  again.  Press 
the F6 function key, or enter LISt [the last t is not necessary]. 
The  screen  will  say  "Loading  the index." Then  the following 
record  formats  will  be  listed  on  the   screen:   [RECSHORT] 
[RECIMEDS] [RECLONGP]
     These  are  three  different  formats that may  be  used  to 
control the output of LISt.  RECSHORT is the shortest and it  may 
be  used  either  when sending records to the screen  or  to  the 
printer. RECSHORT will give you the following:
Record #, name of dish, magazine, date & page, and the rating(R#).
     This  format should be used when you don't want to  see  the 
two ingredient fields, the prepare field, or the origin field. 
     RECIMEDS is a medium length format designed to show you most
ingredients  included in a record,  but will still appear on  the 
screen  with  the record taking only one line.This  is  desirable 
because PC-FILEIII counts records as if each record took only one 
line. Since there are 86 chicken recipes, if you use RECIMEDS PC-
FILE will list 18 of them, then pause while you look at those 18. 
When you are finished with those, press any key, and it will show 
you the next 18. When  you are finished with those, press any key 
again.  Eventually the last ones will be shown.  If you have  two 
lines per record on the screen,  the top of the list would scroll 
off the top of the screen, usually faster than you can read it. 
     Of course,  you may again print the screen using the <shift> 
<PrtSc> keys.  Or you may print the list of records from RECIMEDS 
by sending it to the printer rather than to the screen.  The S at 
the  end  is merely to remind you that this format  was  designed 
with  screen  limitations in mind.  If you are going to  print,we 
recommend you use the RECLONGP format.
     RECLONGP  is  the  longest  of the  three  formats,  and  is 
designed  to  be  used  with a matrix  printer  with  "condensed" 
characters. The IBM-PC printer, the Epson MX-80, the Epson FX-80, 
and the Epson MX-100 are all examples of such printers. There are 
probably  many others the authors are not familiar with.  If  you 
use  RECLONGP on these printers you should see the  following  on 
one line: 
RCD.,  name of dish, mag, date & page,  1st ingred., 2nd.ingred.,  
prepare, rating,origin,meal, food class.
     This  format will cause spillover problems if the output  is 
sent  to the screen (if the list is long).  Thus,  we recommend it 
primarily for use with a printer. If the record goes on two lines 
on a printer that does not have condensed character options, this 
is no problem, because you have a permanent record.
     To  return  to your actions to obtain a list,  we  have  the 
screen showing:
Which report format (blanks if new)
Type a name or select with cursor keys. 
[________]
[RECSHORT]
[RECIMEDS]  
[RECLONGP]
     Let us move the cursor to [RECIMEDS] and press <F10>
    Now the screen will ask:
List on Printer, Screen, or Disk(P,S,D) [P]
    Enter  P  if you have a printer and want a  printed  list.The 
computer will then ask:
Shall I print an alignment pattern (Y/N) [N] Enter a  Y.  If your 
printer is  on,  then you should hear it print one line.Again the 
computer will ask:  Shall  I  print  an  alignment  pattern (Y/N) 
[N]  The  second  time, answer N.
     Enter S if you want to see the records on the Screen. Do <<not>> 
enter D unless you have read the PC-FILEIII documentation,  and want 
to  make  a  revision  of iRecipe83  for  some  special  purpose. 
Remember,  iRecipe83  is copyrighted,  and making a revision  and 
selling such a revision is a violation of copyright law that  may 
cost you $10,000 and up to a year in jail. 
     The screen will now show:
Field to trigger subtotals, or press [enter} for no subtotals.
     Press <enter>.
     Next the screen asks:
List All records or Selected (A or S) [A] 
     If  you reply A you will get a listing of all 1800  records, 
which will take quite a while. Thus usually reply <S><enter>
     The screen will now list the field names:
NAME OF DISH  30 
FOOD CLASS    25 
TYPE OF DISH  15
ORIGIN         6
MEAL           6
PREPARE        7
FIRST INGRED  12 
SECOND INGRD  12
MAG            4
DATE & PAGE   18
R#             2                                                      
1. Field to Select on [____________]
     Usually,  enter TYPE or even just T if you want to search on 
TYPE OF DISH. <TYPE> The computer will respond:
Compare how? >,<,=,<> [= ]
     These  are  comparison  operators:   greater  than(>),  less 
than(<),  equal to (=) and not equal to (<>).  Since the data  in 
the IRECIP83 file is not numbers,  the one that is most useful to 
us is =. Thus respond <=> <enter>. The computer will respond:
Compared to value:( >XXX permitted ) [_______________]
     Suppose  we want a recipe for an apple pie.  Recalling  that 
the  most  important word always goes first in the TYPE  OF  DISH 
field, we would respond  <PIE,APPLE> <ENTER>
     The computer will respond:
And, Or, or End(A,O,E): [E]
     Since  you  want  to see apple pies,  and  this  is  already 
specified  merely press <enter> for End of the  search  criteria. 
Now  the  computer will start listing the apple pie  recipes.  It 
will take a while before the computer reaches the right  location 
on  the  disk.  Remember   that  there are  1800  recipes  listed  
alphabetically  by TYPE,  since  PIE,APPLE is towards the low end 
of the alphabet it takes a while to reach it.   However, once you 
do,  several recipes should come out rapidly.   Then again,   the 
recipes  will cease  as PC-FILEIII goes thru the remainder of the 
list.   However,  people are smarter than computers,  so once you 
have  concluded that the list is  complete,   you  can  stop  the 
search  by   pressing  the  <Esc> key.This  key is in  the  upper 
left  hand of the regular portion of the keyboard,  just left  of 
the <1> key. 
     You will next see:
(L)List (S)Sort (F)pc-File (Q)Quit
Enter L,S,F, or Q [L]
      It  is  a very good habit to use Quit whenever  you  finish 
with PC_FILE.  However,   for  now,lets  enter <L> and see how we 
can  list only ORIENT(al) CHICKEN dishes.  There are 84 different 
chicken  dishes in  iRecipe83,   so  if you know you  want   only  
oriental   chicken dishes,   it is easier to let the computer  do 
the  searching rather than  having you search thru this set of 84 
dishes.   The  computer  again displays:  Which format  or  Press 
(ENTER)[___________]
     Let's use the RECLONGP format. Move the cursor to [RECLONGP] 
and press <F10>. List on Printer,Screen,or Disk(P,S,D) [P]   
     Enter <P> if you have a printer,  if you don`t enter <S>. In 
this  case  the request is so specific,  there are  probably  few 
entries, so that you are not likely to see the recipes scroll off 
the top of the screen. The computer will respond:
List All records or Selected (A or S) [A]
     Respond <S>, and again you will see the list of field names, 
followed by:
Field to Select on [____________]
     Press <TYPE><enter>
Compare how? >,<,=,<> [= ]
     Respond with an  <enter>
Compared to value:( >XXX permitted ) [_______________]
     Type <CHICKEN>
And, Or, or End (A,O,E) [E]
     This  time  we  are only half way thru the  request,  so  we 
respond <A>,  meaning we want dishes that are chicken and have an 
origin in the ORIENT.We still need to enter the last part of  the 
specification.
2.Field to select on [____________]
     Enter <ORIG>
Compare how? >,<,=,<> [= ] <Enter> 
Compare to value:( >XXX permitted ) [______]
     Enter <ORIENT> or <OR> since that is enough to identify what 
is desired.
And, Or, or End (A,O,E) [E]_
     Press  <Enter> since the request is Ended.Now PC-FILEIII will start 
searching thru the disk to find a record that has both CHICKEN  and 
ORIENT.  You can make a total of 10 such terms in a  combination. 
If  you want,  you could ask for a recipe that is CHICKen in TYPE 
OF DISH, ORIENT in ORIGIN and STIRFRY in PREPARE. Of course, when 
your requests become this specific, you may find that none of the 
1800 recipes match all three conditions,  so you may end up with 
an  empty  list.When PC-FILE reads thru the entire list  of  1800 
recipes,you will see: 1800:1800 
(L)List (S)Sort (F)pc-File (Q)Quit
Enter L,S,F, or Q [L]
     Enter L if you want another list.
     The  only  numeric  field in iRecipe83 is the  Rating  field 
identified  by  the name R#.After you have used many  recipes  in 
iRecipe83,if  you  have entered rating  numbers  as  proposed,you 
could  print  out  a list of you favorite recipes  by  doing  the 
following:<F6>
     The computer shows:
Which report format (blanks if new)
Type a name or select with cursor keys. 
[________]
[RECSHORT]
[RECIMEDS]  
[RECLONGP]
     Suppose we use RECLONGP
List All records or Selected (A or S) [S]
1.Field to select on  [____________]     Enter <R#>
Compare how? >,<,=,<> [= ]
    Now  we can use the greater than operator,>,  since R#  is  a 
numeric  field.  Assume we want all recipes you rated as GOOD  or 
better(ratings 6 to 9).  We Enter >
Compare to value:( >XXX permitted ) [      Enter <05>
     Now  all recipes rated 6 or higher will be listed since  all 
have a rating greater than 5. Thus we can end the specification.
And, Or, or End (A,O,E) [E]      <Enter>
     Now PC-File will list all recipes with a rating of 6,7,8,or 
9.It is even possible to use > or < alphabetically.  PC-FILE will 
treat M  as > L,  or conversely L is < M.  Thus you could ask for 
every recipe starting with a Y or a Z by asking for >X.

VI. Entering a rating for a recipe.
     If you want to make a list of favorite recipes of iRecipe83 
you must learn how to enter a rating. There happen to be just two 
Oriental chicken recipes,  so let`s assume that you try both out 
on your family.  #895 generates enthusiasm, and you rate it an 8. 
However,  #937 is not as well received,  and you rate it a 4.  In 
the future,  if you list ORIENT & CHICKEN  dishes again, you want 
to see the ratings, so they will show you which your family liked 
better.To  do  this,  we  must go to the  main  menu,  and  press 
<F2>(MODify).Again you will see a listing of the field names:
     The screen will show:    
KEY or #n,*,+,-,++,--,\ (enter)    
[__________________]     Type #895 <enter>
Now the screen will show the field names and entries:
NAME OF DISH [CHICKEN,BEANSPROUTS SOY SAUCE]
FOOD CLASS   [MEAT & stuffing 6      ]
TYPE OF DISH [CHICKEN,BEAN SP]
ORIGIN       [ORIENT]

PREPARE      [STIRFRY]
FIRST INGRED [CHICKENbreas]
SECOND INGRD [CHESTNUTSh2o]

R#           [  ]                                                        
     Move the cursor to the [  ] after R# and enter 08 .The 0  is 
needed  to  keep  the  8  in the  right  hand  space of  the  two 
spaces.   Since   you  have no further  modifications  to  record  
#895,  just  hit <enter> and the screen will again show:  KEY  or 
#n,*,+,-,++,--,\ (enter)   [______________]
     This is a reasonable time to discuss the other  alternatives 
other  than entering #895 as we did above.  If you just press  +, 
the  screen  will display record #896,  the next higher  numbered 
record.  If you enter ++ you will get 897.  If you enter -,   the 
screen  will  display  record  #894,   the  next  lower  numbered 
record.  If  you enter \ the screen will display  record   #1800,  
the very last record in the IRECIP83 data file.If you  entered *,  
the  screen would show the last record displayed.  In  this case,  
since we want to go to the next oriental  chicken record,   #937,  
none  of  these will do us much good.    The easiest way  to  get 
there is to enter #937.
      Enter   04 in the R# field and you will have modified   the  
two records to include your rating. Since you don`t want to enter 
any  more ratings,  when the screen shows: 
KEY or #n,*,+,-,++,--,\ (enter)    
[_____________________]
     again reply <enter> and you are back at the main menu.If you 
have no further business with iRecipe83,  enter END,  then Q, and 
you   will  be  returned to the system.  You should now see   the  
A>  symbol   on  the  screen,   and can  remove  both   the   PC-
FILEIIIW diskette, and the iRecipe83DT diskette.

VII. Misc. facts you may or may not be interested in.(OPTIONAL)
     We started entering recipes from the Dec.  1983 issues,  and 
worked backwards.   This  means  that some of the procedures  we 
used  on later  recipes  as  a  result of  suggestions,  were not  
used  in Dec.issues.  We are now working on iRecipe84,  and would  
appreciate    your   suggestions   for   further    improvements. 
Unfortunately  limited time and a limited budget prevent us  from 
responding  individually  to  your suggestions,  but we  will  be 
reading them.   A  questionnaire form is included.   We  hope  you  
will  return  these  after you have used iRecipe83 for  about   a 
month or so.  You suggestions are very welcome,  they should help 
us make the database more useful in the future.
     We  included recipes from advertisements.  Several times the 
same add appeared in both magazines,  and sometimes in more  than 
one  issue of a given magazine.  We attempted to include the  add 
recipe  once  for each magazine,  figuring that some  people  may 
only  collect one of the two magazines.   However,  when the same 
add  was in several  issues of the same magazine,   we  tried  to 
list  it  only once. 
     There  is  a  lower limit of simplicity that  some  recipes 
reached that make it dubious if they are worth including. One set 
of diet recipes suggested putting lettuce leaves on a plate  with 
a few slices of tomato, and using a low-cal. salad dressing. This 
did  not  seem  worth including.  A few other similar  ones  were 
excluded.

THE USER-SUPPORTED CONCEPT
      You're  encouraged  to copy and share  this  diskette  with 
others.  If  after  evaluating  this database you find it  to  be 
useful, you're trusted to send a $10 payment to:  Learning Games, 
465 Rock Road, State College PA 16851. 
        User-supported software is an experiment in distributing computer
        software, based on these beliefs:
        1.  That the value and utility of software is best assessed by
            the user on his/her own system.
        2.  That the creation of personal computer software can and
            should be supported by the computing community.
        3.  That copying of software should be encouraged, rather than
            restricted.
        Anyone  may  legally  obtain an evaluation  copy  of  the 
database  from  a friend or computer club.   After you've  had  a 
chance  to use and evaluate the program in your own  environment, 
you're   trusted either to forward a payment to the  author,   or  
to  discontinue  use of the database. 
     Free  distribution of software and voluntary payment for its 
use   eliminates  costs  for  advertising  and  copy   protection 
schemes.  Users   obtain  quality  software at  greatly   reduced  
cost.   They can try it out before buying, and do so at their own 
pace and in  the comfort  of their own home or office.   The best  
software  will  survive,   based  purely  on  their  quality  and 
usefulness.  Please join the experiment.  If you believe in these 
ideals, your payment is solicited to help make them work. 
        WHY SHOULD I PAY?
There  are some solid reasons for sending in your  payment:1.It's 
the right thing to do. You'll feel a lot better about yourself!
2. We'll add you to our database of supporters.  Every time a new 
version comes out,  eg. iRecipe84, we'll automatically send you a 
flyer  giving   you the option of buying the new version   for  a 
reduced  charge - usually about $15.  3.  If  you find  iRecipe83 
useful,   you probably would  find iRecipe84,  & iRecipe85 useful 
also.    In   fact,    if  you  have  saved  the  magazines  only 
occasionally,  iRecipe8?  will  be  more useful if you   save   a  
complete  set.   There will  be  no  versions  after iRecipe83 if 
there is no reasonable income.

meeting your needs. After you have been using iRecipe83 for about 
a month,  please take the time to complete our questionnaire.  For 
each question,  circle a,b,c,d,e,  or f below as appropriate, and 
mail to Learning Games, 465 Rock Road, State College PA 16851.
l. Which Form of iRecipe83 did you use:
     a. PC-FILE  form  with  all  of  index  on  one  360K  floppy 
          diskette(or disk).
     b. Lotus 1-2-3 workspace diskette(360K).
     c. dBASEII form with all of index on one disk.
2. Please   indicate   how   satisfied  you  have   been   with 
iRecipe83.Circle a number from 1 to 9 below:
      1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9 
    very                   average                   very 
 dissatisfied                                      satisfied
3. Would  you prefer to have recipe names exactly the same as in 
the magazines, even when the title is not very informative?
     a.Yes,prefer exact titles as in magazine.
     b.Somewhat positive.  I like to have the major name first 
          to speed up computer searches,  but rest of name should           
          match the magazine title.
     c.Neutral- once I have the mag.,Date,  & page, I find what I 
          want, regardless of name used in iRecipe83.
     d.Somewhat  negative.   I  want  procedures  that  speed  up           
          computer  searches.  The  use  of descriptive  names  & 
          ingredients helps me.
     e.No.  I  don't want my disk cluttered up with status words, 
          and nonuseful labels.
4. Amount of ingredients.
     a.Would like to see all ingredients for each recipe, and am 
          willing to fill up disk and RAM, and slow down searches 
          to obtain this.
     b.The listings in the Jan.-April recipes is about the  right 
          mix.I don't need every spice, etc.
     c.Would prefer deleting the ingredients fields. Once I see a 
          named  dish  I like,  I will look up the  mag.,date,  & 
          page, and will take it from there. 
5. How to list more ingredients.Mark this only if you choose a or           
         b in question 4.
     a.  Would like to have just one big ingredients field, could 
          then search thru this one field, even though the search 
          would be relatively slow.
     b.  Would  like  two  ingredient fields in addition  to  any 
          ingredients listed in the name field (As at present).
     c. Would like three ingredient fields.
     d. Would like four ingredient fields.
6. Would you like an additional field with preparation time?
     a.Yes  b.Maybe  c. No 
7. Would you like an additional field to indicate when a recipe is 
     low in calories?
     a.Yes  b. Maybe  c. No
