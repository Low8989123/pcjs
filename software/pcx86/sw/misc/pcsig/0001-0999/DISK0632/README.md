## Information about "FAMILY HISTORY 2 OF 3 (ALSO 361, 2291)"

    Ever wonder who's lurking in the upper branches of your family tree?
    The FAMILY HISTORY system, a modular genealogy program, will help you
    organize and refine your search.
    
    The system stores information about individuals, including all family
    relationships.  You are not limited in the number of relationships that
    might exist for each individual, or the number of generations of
    ancestors or descendants.  Information for up to 3200 individuals may
    be stored on a diskette and up to 9999 on a hard disk.  You can produce
    ancestor, descendant, relative, and family group reports and ancestor
    (tree) charts.  You may print out blank worksheets and charts to record
    information for entry into the system.  Sample files are included for
    the descendants of Adam (as recorded in Genesis) and the family of
    Prince Charles.  A GEDCOM export/import program permits sharing
    information with other genealogy software.
    
    Research your roots and know where you came from.  A great gift for the
    next generation.
