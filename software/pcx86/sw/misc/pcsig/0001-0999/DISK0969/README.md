include new check/charge entry, deposit entry, check cancellation, deposit
cancellation, balance inquiry, screen listing of a portion or all of the
check register file, listing of all uncancelled items, editing of any item,
creation of a new register, and a means of restarting the program for a
different check register data file without needing to exit to the operating
system. A minimum of computer knowledge is assumed. PC-CHECK is a good
checking account management system. That is useful for home or even for
businesses. The program is well-documented.
