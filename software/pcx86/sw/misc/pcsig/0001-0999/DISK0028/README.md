## Information about "DISKMODF"

    A variety of BASIC and DOS tools, directory listers, machine
    tutorials, graphics and games.  Utilities are included to let you
    design your own graphics characters, generate a resident COMMAND.COM,
    or generate a large block font set from BASIC.  Some amusing games are
    here as well.  DOS utilities include directory handlers, diskette
    speed-up, one to confirm files when doing wildcard deletes, a function
    to give status info on all drives, and others.
    
    System Requirements: Programs marked "+" require color
    graphics.
    
    How to Start: To run an EXE or COM program simply type its name and
    press <ENTER>.  For instructions on running BASIC programs, please
    refer to the GETTING STARTED section in this catalog.  To read DOC
    files simply enter TYPE filename.ext and press <ENTER>.

GETTING MORE COLOUR FOR YOUR ADAPTER!
-------------------------------------

By:  Andrew Tuline & Byron Sheppard


     Are you feeling limited with 4
colour graphics? Does the hi-res
mode look a little drab? Well, there
are ways to add excitement to your
monochrome and colour graphics. Among
them are artifacting and dithertizing,
two techniques used widely on other
colour computers. 
     Unfortunately for the RGB monitor
owner, those two methods have draw-
backs. In order to understand why, we
must first examine the differences
between the various types of colour
displays used.
     The colour television is the 
most widely used and also the poorest
quality display.  This is due to the
fact that all colour and synchro-
nization signals are combined to form
a single composite video signal. This
is then mixed with a higher frequency
signal, usually channels 2 or 3, and
applied to the  T.V.'s antenna
terminals. From here the T.V. converts
it back to its original form.  This
extra (and redundant) handling 
greatly reduces picture quality.
     The composite video monitor is
a step up from the T.V. The major
difference between the two is that
the composite signal described earlier
does not have to be converted to T.V.
frequencies. This then cuts down on
one of the conversion processes, ther-
eby reducing distortion.  Unfortunate-
ly, due to the complexities of the 
composite video signal, this type
of monitor still is not very good.
     The RGB monitor, recently intro-
duced to personal computing, is the
highest quality colour display
currently available. The reason for
this is that all of the signals are
sent to the monitor on separate wires.
Since this is the way that all the 
monitors actually USE the signals,
the whole series of combining,recom-
bining, and splitting done in the
previous two colour displays is
eliminated.  This simple and straight-
forward approach effectively results
in the RGB type of monitor having a
much higher picture quality.

            Artifacting
   
     The composite monitor and T.V., 
while having lower resolution than the
RGB, are capable of displaying more 
colours by taking advantage of faults
in the composite video signal. This
process is known as artifacting, and 
is the simplest method of increasing 
the number of colours for the display.
It involves drawing lines on alternate
even or odd columns.  Magenta, for
example, appears red if drawn on even
columns and blue if drawn on odd
columns. Unfortunately, this will not
work with RGB monitors.
(See last paragraph for exception.)

Below is a table of colours available
when using this technique.

Normal      Even         Odd
colours    columns      columns
      
Green       Red'         Green'
Red         Red''        Blue
Brown       Red'         Green''
Cyan        Black        Cyan
Magenta     Red          Blue
White       Brown        Cyan

The quotation marks beside the colours
represent a slightly different shade
of the original colour.

        Dithertizing

The next step in adding more colours
to your display is to use a technique
called dithertizing. It involves
setting points in a checkerboard
pattern of different colours. You
could, for instance, set all even
columns and rows to red, all odd rows
and columns to green, and the rest to
yellow, producing some alternate
colour.  Since this technique doesn't
depend on "faults" in the video
signal, it will work on RGB type
monitors.  The main drawback of this
technique is the increased time
necessary to draw a picture. However,
with the use of assembly language 
subroutines and/or preset shape
tables, you could speed up any
graphics action.

       Some Program Examples
   
     Using artifacting, the following
short program will show lots of 
colours in the medium resolution mode.

10 SCREEN 1,0
20 FOR I=0 TO 50
30 LINE (I,0)-(I,50),RND*4
40 NEXT
50 GOTO 20

It is even possible to turn the
"hi-res" monochrome mode into a multi
coloured spectacle with a change in
line 10.
 
10 SCREEN 2:OUT 984,&HA:OUT 985,&H32

OUT 984,&HA- Selects 320x200 colour
             graphics.
OUT 985,&H32- is binary 00110010
                          ^^  ^
     selects cyan palette-!!  !
     selects intensified---!  !
     select green backgnd.----!

The last addition will allow an RGB
monitor to use the standard 3 colour
palette. Otherwise, when using the
composite video input, there are many
colours available, even in this mode.

For more information, please refer
to pages 2-57 to 2-59 of the Technical
Reference Manual. More advanced 
programmers should also refer to the
BIOS video section starting on page
A-43.

     There is a device available for 
owners of RGB monitors which will
allow the use of the techniques
previously described. It is called an
N.T.S.C. demodulator, and converts the
composite video signal to RGB format.
The demodulator is manufactured by
Electrohome (model# I-1302) and is
available from the Byte shop for about
$100. Incidentally, the N.T.S.C. 
module enables you to attach your RGB
monitor to a video recorder or T.V.
tuner. In this case, it makes an 
excellent television monitor.


     
    MEDIUM RESOLUTION GRAPHICS MODE
    -------------------------------

          By: Andrew Tuline


     It   seems  someone  has  finally
found the 160 X 100 graphics mode I've
been having so much trouble with. It's
in the Dec.  82  issue  of  Dr.  Dobbs
Journal   by  John  Seal  of  Franklin
Indiana.

     Starting in  the  80  X  25  text
mode,  the  user  must  split a single
character    into    foreground    and
background  by  poking  character  222
into the display buffer. Then the 6845
CRT controller is set to  squeeze  the
four  video  pages  onto  one  screen,
effectively  giving  100   points   of
vertical   resolution.   To   set  the
points, the user must set  either  the
foreground,  or  background attributes
depending   on  the  location  of  the
character.   Below  is  a  copy of the
program submitted by the author.

100 '

310 END

        Addenda
        -------

     An easy way to set the width to 40 while in 
screen 2 and then converting back without clearing
the screen or using get/put graphics is by typing:

def seg=&H40:poke &H49,4 'sets width 40
def seg=&H40:poke &H49,6 'sets width 80

     There is a video data area used by the BIOS
in Segment &H40 starting at address &H49 to 
address &H66. Again, refer to the technical manual
page A-3 for further information.

     An interesting mode of resolution I found
a long time ago while in screen 2 is as follows:

out 984,&H18

This is similar to the 160 X 100 mode shown above,
but unfortunately I have been unable to decode the
colour pattern.

     Also, the user could try to change the 
parameters of the 6845 Display Chip itself. There
are 19 registers in the 6845. 18 of them are 
addressed by the first one by the following. For
example, if we wanted to put a &H64 to register
6 we would type the following:

out &H3d4,6     ;set address register to point
                ;to register 6
out &H3d5,&H64  ;put &H64 into register 6 of 
                ;display chip.

Each of these registers controls different 
parameters for the display, such as the 
starting address of the display, the cursor
address, the total number of lines displayed
and so on. See page 2-56 of technical manual.

     Finally, to wrap it up, I'd like to say that
although I was initially dismayed at the resolution
of the colour graphics on the PC, I also found that
to do any reasonable animation that too many pixels
causes the speed to reduce drastically. While we may
not have 16 shades of each colour as on the Atari,
we do have enough to keep us busy. Maybe the next
version of the Flight Simulator will allow the
owners of RGB monitors to also enjoy the colour
of flight.

How to Print Screen from a Basic Program
(C) Copyright 1982, Peter Norton, author of The Norton Utilities for the IBM
PC)

When BASIC is operating on the IBM Personal Computer, the "print-screen" 
function doesn't work.  This article shows how your BASIC programs can perform
a print screen operation, and gives you an opportunity to learn more about how
the IBM PC works.

Before we explain it all, here is how to print-screen in BASIC.  First, you  
must set up a print-screen routine by executing these instructions, once:
        DEF SEG = 4095
        POKE 0, 205   :   POKE 1, 5   :   POKE 2, 203
        PRINT.SCREEN = 0
Then, your programs can print the screen contents at any time, by executing:
        CALL PRINT.SCREEN
As long as the "DEF SEG" hasn't been changed, then CALL statement will print
the current screen display.

This bit of BASIC program doesn't make the "PrtSc" key work-- it lets your
programs perform the print-screen function.  Your program must decide when to
print the screen, perhaps by acting on a special keystroke.

To understand how this works, we have to touch on some of the most fundamental
parts of the IBM PC.

Built into the IBM PC, in the read-only-memory, or ROM, are many service
routines that perform operations that are basic to the computer; among them is
the print-screen operation.  These services are activated by a mechanism known
as a "software interrupt," and print-screen is requested with interrupt number
5.

The programs that service the keyboard are also found in the ROM.  The ordinary
keyboard service program always checks for the "PrtSc" key: when this key is
pressed, the keyboard program performs an interrupt #5, and the screen is
printed.  The keyboard service routine uses interrupt #5, but doesn't own it
exclusively-- any program that knows how to request interrupts can use it.

When BASIC is running, BASIC takes charge of the keyboard, and so the regular
ROM keyboard program doesn't see the PrtSc key, and BASIC ignores this key.
This prevents us from using the PrtSc key to print the screen.

So, the print-screen operation is not available in BASIC, ordinarily.  But
BASIC has the ability to accept and perform machine language subroutines.  If
we set up a program that will request interrupt 5, then we can CALL it, and
print the screen.  That is what the BASIC program above does.  

Here's how it works.  Our machine language program consists of only two
instructions: one to request interrupt five, and the other to return to the
caller.  The "interrupt" instruction is two bytes long, and the "return" is
one, for a total of three bytes.  The three POKE statements above create those
three bytes.  The numeric values 205 and 5 are the interrupt #5 instruction,
and the value 203 is the return instruction.

There is one messy little problem that occurs whenever machine-language
programs are used in BASIC-- where to put them.  There is no one clean simple
way to deal with this problem; it has to be solved differently depending upon
the size of the computer's memory, and upon what else a BASIC program might do
with "DEF SEG" related statements.

The example above is set up for a computer with 64K of memory, and places the
print-screen program in the last 16 bytes of memory.  For another memory size,
"X" expressed in kilobytes, or "K," this formula will do the same 
        DEF SEG = X * 64 - 1
If X is 64K, then this formula works out to 4095, which is the number used in
the example above.
    
If your programs set the "DEF SEG" for any other reason, then it will have to
be coordinated with its use for the PRINT.SCREEN program, or any other such
machine language program.  When PRINT.SCREEN is called, DEF SEG must be set to
the same value used when the program was created with the POKE statements.



Printer Bit Image Graphics Demonstration 
by Dave Browning

This program demonstrates a portion of the Epson printer graphics capabilities
when the printer is connected to an IBM PC.

This program has been tested for an Epson MX-100 which comes with the
GraftraxPlus option standard.  Although not tested, the program should also 
run as is for an Epson MX-80 with the Graftrax option.  The program should 
also run as is for an Epson MX-70.  (The MX-70 has only normal density bit 
image graphics mode, as opposed to dual selectable modes on the MX-80 with 
Graftrax or the MX-100, but this program does not utilize the higher density 
mode.)

The reason for the WIDTH "LPT1:",255 statement in line 120 (use this statement
as is even if you have an 80 column printer), and for opening the printer
"LPT1:" as file #1 in line 130 is to suppress the line feed that Basic and
Basica automatically send after each carriage return (ASCII 13).  Since Basic
does not check context to distinguish between an actual carriage return and a
character with the value 13 used for other purposes, it adds a line feed (ASCII
10) after every character 13 output with a PRINT, PRINT #, PRINT USING, PRINT #
USING, or WRITE # statement.  The WIDTH #1,255 statement suppresses the
linefeed normally added to the end of lines also, so the program has to add it
where needed (the CHR$(10) at the end of line 3000).

This subject is addressed in part in several places in the IBM Basic manual. 
See the OPEN and WIDTH statements as well as the print and write statements
mentioned above.  You may test this by removing the OPEN and WIDTH statements
from the program and changing all PRINT #1 xxxxx statements to LPRINT xxxxx.

If this program still seems to be putting line feeds in strange places, you
might check your printer switches for proper setting.  Switch SW2-3 on the MX-
80 and MX-100 can be set to automatically add line feeds within the printer no
matter what the computer does.  See your printer manual for details of getting
at and setting the proper switch.

After running the program as is, you may want to experiment with different
settings of the parameters such as PRTLENGTH.  For MX-100s and MX-80s with 
GraftraxPlus, changing the 75 in line 2020 to 76 will set the printer to high 
resolution graphics (twice as many dots per inch).  Those with the MX-80 and 
MX-100 GraftraxPlus printer manual can now proceed with the excellent 
tutorials on bit graphics included in it.  Since the manual does not have a lot
of information on the IBM PC connection, this program was developed to show how
to overcome the "automatic linefeed" types of problems.

One additional note:  if you stop the program during execution with a control-
break, the printer may be in the middle of graphics mode and be waiting for
more graphics characters.  If you then try to RUN the program (with or without
changes) again, the printer may seem to do weird things until the buffer and
the program are back in synch.  Everything will be OK if the program runs to
completion, or if you turn the printer power off momentarily before reRUNning
the program.

PC Keyboarding for the Handicapped
by Mike Todd

A couple of months ago I received a letter from someone I greatly respect. 
Since he is handicapped, he is unable to press two keys on the keyboard
simultaneously. He asked if there was a way to create a CTRL, SHIFT, and/or ALT
lock through the keyboard so that he might be able to do a system reboot, use
Wordstar (or any other program that requires simultaneous pressing of multiple
keys), and whatever anyone else can do on a PC.  I mentioned the need at a
Capital PC general meeting and asked that someone with a little spare time just
take a look at how it might be done. John Black came to the rescue!  He didn't
just tell us how to do it but produced a sophisticated program and some really 
good documentation too! Thank you, John!

The program, called KEYLOC.EXE, along with the source code and documentation,
will be on the next Capital PC Software Exchange disk ($5 and stamped, self
addressed mailer to Capital PC Software Exchange, PO Box 6128, Silver Spring,
MD 20906).  The following is taken from the introduction to John's
documentation:

    Keyloc is a patch to the BIOS keyboard routine. It modifies the operation
    of the Alt, Ctrl, Left Shift and Right Shift keys. It allows one finger
    typing by locking those keys in their shifted state.

    Normally the Ctrl, Alt, Left Shift, and Right Shift keys have to be held
    down with one finger, while another finger is used to type another key. For
    example, if a program requires you to enter a ^P, you must hold down the
    Ctrl key with one finger, then depress the "P" key with another.

    When Keyloc is loaded into memory--this is done in DOS before executing the
    program--it changes the way these keys operate. To type in a ^P, you first
    type and release the Ctrl key. This locks the Ctrl key in its shifted
    state. Next the "P" key is depressed and released.  This enters a ^P.
    Depressing Ctrl again takes the key from its shifted to unshifted state.

    Keyloc gives an audio signal so the user can tell when he is shifting or
    unshifting a key. The first time the Ctrl key is depressed, a low tone
    followed by a high tone is sounded. This signals that the key has been put
    in the shifted state. The next time the Ctrl key is depressed, a low tone
    followed by a high tone is sounded. This signals that the key has been
    returned to the unshifted state.

I've tried John's program in DOS, from within Basic, with a Basic program,
right now with Volkswriter running, and with Wordstar. I haven't found a single
bug and the audible tones are separated enough to be useful, at first, but not
so much that they would become annoying after long hours at the keyboard. As a
matter of fact, some users who would just like to strike a single key at a time
may not find the new procedure too hard to accommodate.


Some Useful BASIC Function Definitions
by Harry Foxwell, SigSTAT chairman, Capital PC

Conspicuously missing from IBM Basic are predefined functions for computing the
maximum and the minimum of two numbers, and a function for converting a
character string from lowercase to uppercase.

Although it is fairly simple to code these functions with a few lines using IF
statements, using predefined functions makes the overall program more compact
and easily readable.

The maximum and minimum of two values can be computed using the following
functions:

    DEF FNMAX(X,Y) = X*ABS(X>=Y) + Y*ABS(X<Y)
    DEF FNMIN(X,Y) = X*ABS(X<=Y) + Y*ABS(X>Y)

A function that converts a lowercase letter to its uppercase equivalent is:

    DEF FNUCS$(A$) = CHR$(ASC(A$)+32*(A$>="a" AND A$<="z"))

Each of these function definitions depends upon the fact that the comparison
operators (<, >, and =) yield a value of 0 when the comparison is FALSE, and
yield -1 when the comparison is TRUE. These values, expressed simply as the  
original comparison, may be used in the same way as any other BASIC variable.

************************************************************************
  DOCUMENTATION FOR FK: A FUNCTION KEY HANDLER FOR PC-DOS 1.0 and 1.1
**********************************************************************

I.  Introduction

        This document describes the program FK, a function key handler for
use under IBM PC-DOS versions 1.0 and 1.1.  The program may not work
under other versions of DOS.

        The program was developed under a grant from Userview Corporation.


II.  Rationale

        Under standard PC-DOS, the ten function keys are not used to their
full potential.  The keys are used for simple command line editing, and
several of the functions are duplicated by other keys on the keyboard.
FK allows you to assign strings up to 24 characters in length to each
of the function keys, so you can give an entire command or file name
with a single keypress.

        For those who use the normal PC-DOS command line editing facilities,
FK moves functions not already duplicated to keys on the cursor moving pad.


III.  Using the program

        There are five different actions available with FK.  They all
begin with the command name 'FK'; of course, the FK program (FK.COM) must be
available on the selected disk drive when the command is issued.

        The actions are as follows:

        SHOWING THE DEFINITIONS:  You may display the current definitions
of the ten function keys by giving the command "FK". Control characters
imbedded in the strings are displayed as ^x (just as they are echoed
during command line input) except for carriage return (ENTER), which is
displayed as a leftward-pointing arrow.  Users with a printer may get
a hardcopy of their definitions by pressing CTRL-PRTSC before giving the
FK command.

        REDEFINING A KEY:  You may assign a string to one of the function
keys by giving the command "FK Fn <string>" where n is the number of the
key to assign (1 thru 10), and <string> is the string of characters you
wish to get when you press that key.  For example, "FK F1 DIR" would
assign the directory command "DIR" to function key F1.  You may include
a carriage return in the string by using the vertical line character (|)
wherever you want the CR; for example, "FK F1 DIR|" would do the directory
command immediately upon your pressing F1 (in the previous case, you would
have to press ENTER yourself after pressing F1).  Keys may only be assigned
strings of up to 24 characters in length; strings which are too long will
be truncated without warning.

        SAVING THE DEFINITIONS:  You may save the current definitions of
the function keys to a disk file for later use (see LOADING below).  To
do so, give the command "FK SAVE <fname>" where <fname> is the name of
the file in which to save the definitions.  For example, "FK SAVE MY.KEY"
would save all current key assignments in the file "MY.KEY".  Any valid
filename may be used, but the use of the ".KEY" extension is recommended
for clarity.

        LOADING KEY DEFINITIONS:  You may recover key definitions previously
saved with "FK SAVE" by typing "FK LOAD <fname>", where <fname> is the
name of the file containing the key definitions.  You should *only* use
this command on files which have been created by "FK SAVE"; if you don't,
FK will probably not accept the file.  The key definitions which are
automatically loaded with FK when it is first called should be available
in the file "STD.KEY" on the disk with this document.

        GETTING HELP: You can get a rundown of these command formats by
typing "FK HELP".


IV.  Notes

        Abbreviations: You can use S, L, and H as abbreviations for
"SAVE", "LOAD", and "HELP", respectively.  For example, you might type
"FK L STD.KEY" to recover those definitions.

        Warning concerning key files:  Attempting to load key files
which were not created with "FK SAVE" or which were altered with DEBUG
or some editor may result in system crashes.

        Command line editing facilities:  As mentioned, the old actions
assigned to the function keys have been moved to the cursor keypad.
F1 (copy one char from template) has always been duplicated by the cursor-
right key.  With FK active, the skip/copy function of F2 is moved to
the cursor-up key.  Copy-remaining (F3) is moved to the END key.
Skip/delete (F4) is now assigned to the down-arrow key. Move-displayed (F5)
has been reassigned to the HOME key.

        F6 was used by DOS to issue the end-of-file mark, ^Z.  The
standard key definitions leave ^Z assigned to F6, but if you need to
change this, you can always signal end-of-file by typing CTRL-Z.


V. Additions to revision 2 (28 July 1982)

        The following enhancements have been added to FK as of 28 July 1982.
Thanks to Webb Blackman, Jr. , and Michael Sullivan for suggestions and
comments.

        * QUIET MODE: To prevent extraneous output during FK processing
          (for example, the possibly unwanted listing of key definitions
          during a "load" in an autoexec file), the 'quiet mode' option
          has been added.  Preceeding any command letter with 'Q' causes
          most output to be suppressed.  Copyright notices and error
          messages will be displayed even if quiet mode is requested.
          Example: "FK QL DEV.KEY" to 'quietly' load the definition file
          "DEV.KEY".

CHANGES AND REVISIONS:

1) Carriage returns are now displayed as a vertical bar instead of
   a left arrow. This change was made since the left arrow is a character
   27 (escape), which many printers use as a "here comes a command"
   signal.

2) The file name you're using to SAVE your definitions is displayed
   at the conclusion of a successful SAVE.  No drive or extension
   spec is displayed, however.

3) The much-demanded FK RESET option is now available.  Typing FK R
   puts FK asleep until another FK command is issued, at which point
   it reawakens (unless that is another FK R, in which case FK
   is awake only a millisecond or so).  Please experiment with this
   option under several systems (EDIX and VOLKSWRITER come to mind)
   to make sure it behaves like you want it to.


            PATCHING FK FOR NONSTANDARD OPERATING SYSTEMS

     FK  is  designed to lodge itself properly in one of two different
operating systems. Standard FK can handle DOS 1.00 and DOS  1.10.  For
any given unusual system (i.e. hard disk, RAM-resident disk, etc.) the
program  may  not  operate properly and may have to be modified as per
the following instructions:

     1.  Boot the oddball operating system.

     2.  Using DEBUG, search segment 60 for the following string:

            3C 3E 3D 3D 3F

         The resulting address is the TABLE address.

     3.  Search segment 60 for the following string:

            92 B4 00 CD 16

        The resulting address is the VECTOR address.

     4.  Note that both the TABLE and VECTOR addresses are offsets in
         segment 60H.  If either of them cannot be found, FK probably
         cannot be patched to run in this environment.

     5.  DEBUG FK.COM

     6.  In the code segment at location 210 are six bytes which must be
         patched to allow for the new operating system.  At 210 and 211 are
         the two "identifier bytes" printed by FK when it signs on
         (i.e. DOS 1.xx-- xx are the ID bytes).  For example, the RAMDrive
         version of FK under DOS 1.1 has "1r" as ID bytes.

     7.  The next two bytes (locations 212-213) must contain the TABLE
         address in normal low - high order.  For example, if the search
         returned address 0B88 for the TABLE address, one might do an
         ECS:212 88 0B

     8.  The next two bytes (locations 214-215) must contain the VECTOR
         address in low - high order, much as in the previous example.

     9.  When the patches have been made, use W to save the new version
         of FK.COM.  One should, of course, back up the program first
         in case something went wrong.

     When following this patching procedure, FK will  work  under  the
desired  operating  system as well as under vanilla DOS 1.10. If it is
necessary to use something else  besides  1.10,  the  patches  may  be
performed  at  location  216  as  well, allowing two oddball operating
systems.

     The author assumes absolutely no responsibility  for  anguish  or
lost data caused by attempting to patch FK.

KNOWN PATCHES:

for DOS 1.00:                  ecs:210 30 30 18 05 C7 00
for JEL/JFORMAT:               ecs:210 31 6A 88 0B 95 00
for JEL/JFORMAT v1.62:         ecs:210 31 6A 88 0D 95 00
for Microsoft RAMDrive:        ecs:210 31 72 48 06 95 00

***************************************************************************
			DOCUMENTATION FOR 'GUMUPs':
		GARBS' UNSUPPORTED MODERATELY USEFUL PROGRAMS
***************************************************************************


I. Introduction

	GUMUPs are small but useful utility programs which have been
placed in the public domain by J. P. Garbers (me).  They may be distributed
freely, but may NOT be included in marketed software without my express
written consent.

	As the acronym implies, I cannot support the GUMUPs.  I have
tested them thoroughly and use them every day on my own system, but
I cannot be held liable for any problems they may create for you.
I am also not responsible for providing updates, fixes, or patches
for new operating system releases or nonstandard hardware configurations.

	Comments are welcome.  See the appendix for my addresses.

	The GUMUPs were developed under a grant from Userview Corporation.


II. OBTAINING GUMUPs

	The GUMUPs may be obtained from a number of sources.  First,
when Radio Free PC is on the air (as announced in POST IBM on the
Source), users of the Crosstalk communications package may call the
system at 404-294-6879 to do a direct download of the files.

	Users of the Source may also obtain the GUMUPs in HEX format
files.	These files will have to be converted to binary form before
they are used.	To do this conversion, a program called PC-HEX may
be obtained from the same account (12)CL0040.  The PC-HEX program
is in Microsoft BASIC and is self-documenting.

	Users without communications capabilities may wish to send me
a formatted diskette with a stamped, self-addressed return mailer
(I will return no diskettes without a stamped return mailer), which I
will return with the GUMUP programs.  Feel free to send along any nice
public domain software if you take this route.

	In any case, I would appreciate it if you would drop me a note
letting me know where you got the programs, and how you like them.

III. LF.COM

	LF is a program which provides a selective directory listing
sorted by extension and filename.

	INVOKING THE PROGRAM:  LF may be invoked with the same options
as DIR, i.e. 'LF', 'LF B:', 'LF *.ASM', etc.  However, if either the
filename or extension is not supplied on the command line, LF will fill
it in with wildcards; thus, 'LF .ASM' is the same as 'LF *.ASM' and
will list all the files with the extension '.ASM'.

	LIMITATIONS:  LF has been successfully used on 160K and 320K
floppy drives.	It should work equally well on any DOS-compatible
drive, and should be transportable to any MS-DOS system.


IV. VDEL.COM

	VDEL is a program which allows selective deletion of files.

	INVOKING THE PROGRAM:  VDEL may be invoked by typing
'VDEL fname.ext' at the command prompt.  Wildcards may (and usually will)
be used, i.e. 'VDEL *.ASM'.

	If any matching files are found, VDEL will display the name of
the file, and ask if it should be deleted.  Pressing 'Y' or 'y' will
delete the file. Pressing ESC stops the program.  Any other key will
leave the file alone and continue asking about other matching files.

	I strongly encourage you to use VDEL instead of DEL or ERASE
when doing wild-card deletions.  It is too easy to accidentally delete
a file you wanted to keep when using the normal DOS commands.

	LIMITATIONS: VDEL should be transportable to any MS-DOS system.


V. FK.COM

	FK is a function key handler for the IBM PC.  Full documentation
is available in the external document FK.DOC.


VI. SYSTAT.COM

	SYSTAT provides you with information about all the disks
currently accessible to your system.

	INVOKING THE PROGRAM: From DOS command level, type SYSTAT.  No
arguments are needed.  SYSTAT will report on all drives available on
your system, showing their capacities, free space, names, and comments.

	Both SYSTAT and CD (see below) make use of .NAM files for disk iden-
tification.  With EDLIN or any other editor (or with a quick COPY CON DISK.NAM),
create a file with the extension .NAM.	The file should consist of one
line describing the contents of the file (i.e. 'communications programs',
'utility packages', 'BASIC games', etc.)  SYSTAT and CD will display
the contents of the .NAM file to help you keep track of what's currently in
your system.  There should only be one .NAM file per diskette.

	LIMITATIONS:  SYSTAT and CHKDSK occasionally disagree about disk
free space.

	SYSTAT should be compatible with all hard-disk and RAM-disk systems,
and is transportable to any MS-DOS system.


VII.  CD.COM

	CD logs a new drive (or remains on the current one), displays
the drive's name and description, and presents a sorted directory.

	INVOKING THE PROGRAM:  From DOS command level, type CD x: where
x: is the drive you wish to use.  Normally, you would just type x: to
do this.  CD will connect you to the drive, display the disk's logical
name and description (see discussion of .NAM files above), and
display the disk's directory sorted by extension and file name.

	LIMITATIONS:  CD should be compatible with all MS-DOS systems.

VIII.  WAIT.COM

	WAIT is only useful in batch files.  It takes about three
seconds to count down from three before continuing.  Thus, it allows
a user to interrupt a batch file (if, perhaps, an error occurred at
one stage in the batch processing), but will not require attention
during unattended operation (unlike the standard DOS command PAUSE,
which will wait forever for a keypress).

APPENDIX

	I may be reached Source mail at CL0040, or via U.S. mail at

	Jeffrey P. Garbers
	890E Clubhouse Circle West
	Decatur, GA 30032

	Upon receiving this document, please do me a favor and
and send me a note containing your name, address, and where you got the
programs. Monetary contributions will not be refused, but are not solicited;
comments, suggestions, criticisms, and contributions of quality public-domain
software will be especially appreciated.

```
DDATE.COM makes it easy to set the date when starting up MS/DOS.
	Just include it in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and it will
	remember the last date you set on disk so that all you
	have to do is change the day with the cursor right key
	(or advance by a month with the cursor up key or from
	Friday to Monday with the (week)End key).  If you overshoot,
	use the cursor left or down keys to go back.  When the date
	is right, press ENTER.

	DDATE should reside on a writable drive, preferably the 
	default drive, for proper operation.


DISKMODF.BAS is an improved version of the disk sector modifier.
	I've added retries and sped up the interaction.

TIMING.BAS accurately times the execution of short BASIC programs
	by interval averaging over 10 seconds.  

SPEED411.COM changes the diskette drive step rate to 4 ms which has
	worked fine for me but I make no guarantees.  (Test
	it first on your drives by doing some formats and copies.)

BIGTYPE.BAS is for entertaining the children.  They especially like
	control-A's.

JUMBLE.BAS permutes jumble words when your brain gets stuck.

PALLETTE.BAS displays the colors possible in 160 by 200 color graphics
	(especially good with a composite monitor).  To exit and return
	the screen to normal, press Break then F9 then F10 (SCREEN 0,0,0).

			  RESIDENT COMMAND INTERPRETER

	DISCLAIMER

	This  modification is provided without warranty of any kind.  The
	author	assumes no liability for failure of this code to  perform
	in  any  environment.  The  user is  completely  responsible  for
	determining   the  applicability  of  this  modification   to	a
	particular environment.

	LIMITATIONS

	This modification causes the transient portion of COMMAND.COM  to
	be  made resident at system IPL.   Re-booting the system with  an
	unmodified   COMMAND.COM   is  the  only  way  to   remove   this
	modification.  This  modification  alters  the	starting  segment
	[paragraph] address available to programs, lowering the amount of
	storage  available  by 4288 bytes [for PC/DOS 1.1 with	a  normal
	load   segment	address  of  02C1].    The  starting  segment  of
	COMMAND.COM can be found at location 0000:9E,  and should display
	[debug] as	 0000:009E 2C 01

	CONTENTS

	This   modification,   supplied  as  a	BASIC	program    called
	"RESCMD.COM"  (Or  RESCMDCK.BAS  for realtime clock users)  which
	will read in an UNMODIFIED DOS 1.1 COMMAND.COM and produce a  new
	file, "COMMAND.CMD" which has all the mods installed. This set of
	modifications  alters  the  IBM  Personal  Computer  DOS  command
	interpreter  (COMMAND.COM)  to remain entirely	resident,  rather
	than  be half resident and half transient.  The whole purpose  of
	this  modification is to suppress 99% of the occurrances  of  the
	refresh   of  the  transient  portion.	 This  will  remove   the
	requirement  to  ALWAYS have a disk with a valid  COMMAND.COM  in
	drive  A.  This  change has been especially useful with  multiple
	DISKCOPY  type activities,  and with those  application  packages
	which  use all of memory,  including the top 4880 bytes where the
	transient COMMAND.COM resides.

	The  modification  merely omits the relocation of  the	transient
	portion of COMMAND.COM, and sets the first free paragraph address
	to  be	the area behind the transient routines,  rather than  the
	small "resident" portion.

	PC/DOS Initialization Overview

	The  IBM  Personal  Computer DOS is brought in from disk  by  the
	bootstrap loader read from track 0 of drive A by the ROM routines
	after the initial hardware tests are performed at  power-on,  and
	subsequently  when  ALT-CTRL-DEL re-boot is  requested.  In  both
	cases, the following sequence occurs:

	     1) The "boot" program is read from track 0.

	     2) It reads IBMBIO.COM  from  a  specific location

	     3) IBMBIO is given control and builds the environmental
		control blocks, initializes peripherals, and then
		reads IBMDOS.COM from its specific location on disk

	     4) IBMDOS is passed control. After initializing the
		remainder of the operating system, IBMDOS loads
		the COMMAND.COM file [the command interpreter], and
		passes it control

	     5) The command interpreter immediately relocates all of the
		main line code for command prompting,  parsing,  and  the
		code which supports the resident commands to the high end
		of memory, where it can be more easily destroyed by
		wandering programs.

	     6) Resident COMMAND.COM will now [pretend to] detect a
		checksum error in the transient portion of itself,
		immediately causing a Re-load from disk, thus setting
		the tone for a long and tedious interaction, interrupted
		frequently by disk I/O and requests for a DOS disk
		in the default drive.



	REAL-TIME CLOCK VERSION

	An   alternate	version  of  the  modification	is  supplied   as
	"RESCMDCK.BAS".   This version REQUIRES THE PRESENCE OF A  CLOCK.
	The  DOS  DATE	and TIME commands ARE DISABLED by  this  version,
	requiring the user to employ the software provided with the clock
	card  to access date and time.	 The space formerly used by  DATE
	and TIME is reused for three new RESIDENT commands,  BEEP,  PAGE,
	and CLS.  PAGE causes the printer (LPT1:) to skip to top-of form.
	CLS clears the active display.	BEEP causes a warbling tone to be
	produced.

	[The DOS 1.10 command  DEL  will  not  be  recognized however the
	function remains implemented under the ERASE command.]

"Squish" is a utility program for the IBM PC with 32K,
color/graphics adapter, 1 disk drive, and Basic.

(The following is condensed from SoftSide magazine, issue no. 34.)

     Programmers tend to use quite a few REMarks when
programming, add extra spaces to make listings more readable, as
well as putting only a few statements on each line.  The result
is a program that is easier to read and debug, but not very space
or memory efficient.  The ideal utility would remove extra spaces
and REMs, and combine lines, when possible without altering the
structure of the BASIC program.
     Enter the TRS-80 program Squish...if only it were translated
to the IBM PC.	We've done so, and it is presented here for the
benefit of all our IBM subscribers.

TO USE SQUISH:
     First LOAD the program you wish to pack.  After it is
loaded, SAVE it with the ASCII option to a new file.  For example:
LOAD "MYPROG.BAS" and then reSAVE it as "MYPROG.ASC",A.  After
the program has been saved with the ASCII option, LOAD in
"Squish" and type RUN.
     Answer the first question with the name of the file saved
with the ASCII option ("MYPROG.ASC" in the example above).
     You will then be given a series of options.  You can remove
extra spaces, delete REMarks, and combine lines.  The fourth
option gives you the ability to protect a line or group of lines
from being "Squished."  Lines entered under this option are
totally ignored by "Squish."
     "Squish" will then read in the program to check for lines
that are referenced and proceed to work on it.	The display will
update constantly to show, in color (or monochrome), what
"Squish" is doing, and where.
     When "Squish" is done, it will allow you to enter the
"Squished" program for examination.  I suggest you then do a
quick RENUMber and reSAVE the program under another filename.
     When you are finished, you will have a neatly renumbered
program that is not only much shorter than the original (usually
by a few K), but will execute faster.  All in all, "Squish" is
quite a useful utility.

VARIABLES;
     A: Temporary numeric storage.
     A!: Temporary numeric storage.
     A$: Current program line being Squished.
     C$: Contains lines that have been combined.
     D: Length of a reserved word being searched for.
     DS: The maximum number of user protected lines.
     DT: Set to 1 if current line contains a DATA statement.
     G1 - G6: A position in A$ at which INSTR starts searching.
     HH: Miscellaneous.

     LN: Current line number being processed.
     L$, L1$: Current character of A$ being processed.
     N$: Set to STR$(LN).
     P: Set to 1 the first time a quote is encountered in a PRINT
	       statement.  Set to 0 when second quote or end of
	       line is encountered.  While P equals 1, all
	       compression functions are cancelled.
     PJ: Points to the current line in PRO(*) being tested.
     PP: Set to 1 minus the location of the first character in a
	       program line following the line number.
     PV: Number of protected lines entered.
     PRO(*): Optional protected line numbers specified by user.
     Q$: Used in an INKEY$ loop.
     R: Number of line numbers referenced in REF(*).
     RD: Total number of REM statements deleted.
     RE: Total number of lines combined.
     REF(*): Number of program lines that can be referenced.
     S,S1: Miscellaneous.  Used in sort routine.
     SD: Total number of spaces deleted.
     SQ$: SAVE filename for Squished program.
     SV$: SAVE filename for Squished program.
     T,T1-T2: Miscellaneous.
     V$: The current program line stripped of its line number.
     X: Set equal to PP.
     XC$: Set to "Y" if lines are to be combined.
     XS$: Set to "Y" if extra spaces are to be deleted.
     XP$: Set to "Y" if user wishes to protect lines.


2/9/83 Patches, enhancements, etc. by Herb Shear

The R pointer can no longer lag behind allowing referenced REM and '
  statements to be deleted.
Trailing ' no longer added on nonnull referenced lines.
RESTORE & RETURN references to a line now protect the line.
Constructs like X=IGOTO+35 no longer protects line 35.
Indentation was preserved even when combining.
The deblanking tests were extended to close up constructs such as
  A( I ),  etc.
Goofs in naming the input file are now handled in a friendly fashion
  instead of repeating the entire input session over again.

      Users should take note of the instructions to use SAVE"-----",A
files as input.  Squish is tuned to the interpreter's output which is a
subset of valid input forms.  Lowercase, blanks preceding line numbers
and `GO TO xxx' are not handled properly by Squish.

3/7/83 Patches etc.
  Line 185:  Variable G5  corrected to G8.
  Line 210:  Added  OR L$=")"  to the IF conditions.
  Added test for ERL=
  Fixed erronous line numbers from use of VAL(A$)
  All integer variables, less time consuming display antics, compiler ready.

This program when executed from DOS will display on your
screen  the capactity of each drive and the free space
on each. Also if you have placed on each disk an ASCII
file with the extension of .NAM, will display the Name
you have given the disk and a comment about the disk...

      UNPROTECTING BASIC PROGRAMS SAVED WITH THE ,P OPTION

	 The following is a very simple anywhere, any time
method for unprotecting BASIC programs which have been saved
with the ,P option.  The principle of this method is to
force a zero byte into offset 1124 of BASIC's default
segement.  Loading a protected program disables immediate
mode pokes however the BLOAD function will do the job.	This
requires a compatable file readily generated with BSAVE.  In
turn, this requires a zero byte somewhere to save.  The best
place to get that byte is from offset 1124 before loading
the protected program.	This means that the BSAVE file
header will cause BLOAD to default to that load address.
Thus the technique is as follows:

	 BASIC[A]
	 BSAVE "unpro",1124,1
	 LOAD "filespec of protected program
	 BLOAD "unpro"

	 If you write 1124 on the back of your driver's
license you'll be able to deal with problems in protected
programs any time, any place.  There have been sporatic
cases were LISTing continues past the lines of the protected
program on into prior program residue in memory.
