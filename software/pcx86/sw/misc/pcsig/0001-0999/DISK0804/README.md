We have tried to make it simple for you to search for a program in the
PC-SIG library, all you have to do is type L and the name of the program
that you are looking for, here is an example.

To search for all of the disks that have the word GAME in the
descriptions you would type:

                              L GAME (press enter)

This will list on the screen all of the disk numbers and descriptions
for anything with the word game in it.

If you find a disk that you would like to see the whole description,
simply type L and the Disk number, Example:

1449
1449 PC-QUIZZER IS A COMPUTER TRIVIA GAME THAT USES VARIOUS SUBJECTS TO GET
1449 ITS QUESTIONS.  BEFORE ANSWERING A QUESTION, YOU ARE ASKED WHAT CATEGORY
1449 TICKLES YOUR FANCY AND THEN YOU MUST ANSWER THE QUESTION BEFORE TIME
1449 RUNS OUT.  THE CATEGORIES RANGE FROM TELEVISION TO MATHEMATICS, SPORTS
1449 TO HISTORY, AND A POTLUCK CATEGORY WHERE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT TYPE OF
1449 QUESTION WILL POP UP.  THERE ARE THREE ROUNDS OF QUESTIONS AND EACH
1449 ROUND GETS HARDER, SO THE POINTS GIVEN WHEN YOU ANSWER A QUESTION
1449 CORRECTLY GET HIGHER ALSO.  AFTER THE FIRST ROUND, YOU CAN START TO WAGE
1449 YOUR POINTS AGAINST THE COMPUTER SO HOPEFULLY BY THE END OF THE THIRD
1449 ROUND YOU HAVE ENOUGH POINTS TO BE IN THE HALL OF FAME.
1449

1450 PROGRAM: ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN COMIC
1450 AUTHOR VERSION: 3
1450 THE ADVENTURES OF CAPT.  COMIC IS A FAST-MOVING ARCADE GAME WITH
1450 HIGH-QUALITY COLOR GRAPHICS.  THE CAPTAIN'S JOB, AND YOU KNOW HE WILL
1450 ACCEPT IT, IS TO RECOVER THREE TREASURES OF THE PLANET OMSOC THAT WERE
1450 STOLEN AND HIDDEN ON THE REMOTE WORLD OF TAMBI.
1450
1450 ALONG THE WAY HE MUST FACE MANY DANGERS, INCLUDING: DIVE-BOMBING BIRDS,
1450 BUGS, FIREBALLS, BEACHBALLS, SPINNERS, GLOW GLOBES, BLIND TOADS, KILLER
1450 BEES, SPARKS, ATOMS, SAUCERS, AND THE DREADED SPACE POLLEN.
1450
1450 BUT OUR HERO IS NOT ONE TO GO INTO BATTLE UNARMED.  HE CARRIES A BLASTER
1450 TO BLOW AWAY ANY MEANIES THAT ATTACK, A SHIELD TO PROTECT HIM FROM THEIR
1450 TOUCH (TEMPORARILY), AND THE UNCANNY ABILITY TO JUMP AMAZING DISTANCES.
1450 HE ALSO FINDS MANY ITEMS THAT CAN HELP IN HIS MISSION: KEYS, LANTERNS,
1450 CORKSCREWS, BOOTS, AND CANS OF BLASTOLA COLA.
1450
1450 IF YOU DECIDE TO GO ADVENTURING WITH THE CAPTAIN, ALL YOU NEED BRING ARE
1450 QUICK REFLEXES, A GOOD EYE FOR DETAIL AND YOUR ABILITY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS
1450 ON THE FLY.  AGE LEVEL: 7-ADULT.

1451 FORTH, THE PROGRAM IS FASTER THAN THE STANDARD DOS DISKCOPY, WITH MORE

1451 DETECTS ANY WRITE ERRORS.  IT WILL ALSO TRY THREE TIMES TO READ A DISK
1451 SECTION BEFORE GIVING UP IN DISGUST.
1451
1451 BECAUSE DISKDUP LOADS THE SOURCE DISK TO BE DUPLICATED INTO ITS VIRTUAL
1451 MEMORY, IT FREES UP BOTH OF YOUR DISK DRIVES TO CRANK OUT TWO COPIES AT
1451 A TIME!  THE VOLUME NAME OF THE SOURCE DISK IS ALWAYS SHOWN ON THE
1451 SCREEN SO YOU DON'T WIND UP DUPING A BUNCH OF COPIES OF THE WRONG
1451 PROGRAM.  AN OPTIONAL SOUND SIGNAL LETS YOU DO SOMETHING ELSE WHILE
1451 DISKDUP TAKES CARE OF THE COPYING, CALLING YOU WHEN ITS TIME TO POP IN A
1451 COUPLE MORE BLANK DISKS.  A COUNTER LETS YOU KNOW HOW MANY COPIES HAVE
1451 ALREADY BEEN MADE.

1464 WITH P-CEM YOU CAN USE THE CURSOR PAD TO SELECT A FILE FROM THE
1464 DIRECTORY, AND PRESS A SINGLE KEY TO COPY, DELETE, RENAME, EXECUTE,
1464 VIEW, PRINT OR WIPE THAT FILE.  YOU MAY ALSO ENCRYPT AND DECRYPT FILES,
1464 AND CHANGE FILE ATTRIBUTES.  P-CEM CAN SWITCH BETWEEN DIRECTORIES, AND
1464 ALLOWS YOU TO CREATE AND DELETE DIRECTORIES.  FOR OTHER OPERATIONS YOU
1464 MAY TEMPORARILY SHELL TO DOS, AND IMMEDIATELY RETURN TO THE PROGRAM.
1464
1464 ADDITIONAL UTILITIES ARE INCLUDED.  COLOR IS A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS YOU
1464 TO CHANGE THE BORDER COLOR ON A CGA MONITER, AND CURSOR WILL ALLOW YOU
1464 TO CHANGE THE SIZE OF THE CURSOR SO THAT IT CAN BE LOCATED ON THE SCREEN
1464 MORE EASILY.  DISKINFO WILL STATE WHAT FREE SPACE IS AVAILABLE ON A
1464 DISK, AND MEMORY WILL DISPLAY YOUR TOTAL COMPUTER MEMORY AND CURRENTLY
1464 AVAILABLE MEMORY.  READSECT WILL ALLOW YOU TO VIEW ANY DISK SECTOR.
1464 (THIS IS USEFUL FOR LOOKING AT THE ``RAW'' DATA OF A PROGRAM OR FINDING
1464 A LOST FILE.)  SYSINFO WILL DISPLAY GENERAL SYSTEM INFORMATION OF YOUR

1495 DISK-TITLE: ALICE IN WONDERLAND TEXT ADVENTURE
1495 PC-SIG VERSION: V1
1495
1495 PROGRAM: ALICE IN WONDERLAND
1495 AUTHOR VERSION: 1
1495 ALICE IN WONDERLAND IS AN ADVENTURE GAME BASED ON LEWIS CARROLL'S
1495 NOVEL, ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND.  ALTHOUGH YOU NEED NOT BE
1495 FAMILIAR WITH THE NOVEL TO PLAY, THERE ARE OCCASIONALLY PLACES IT WOULD
1495 BE HELPFUL.
1495
1495 IN THIS NARRATIVE ADVENTURE, YOU TYPE IN DIALOGUE AND DIRECTIONS AS YOU
1495 WANDER THROUGH WONDERLAND AS ALICE, GATHERING SPECIAL OBJECTS AND
1495 TALKING WITH THE ODD CREATURES AND OTHER CHARACTERS FROM THE NOVEL.
1495
1495 YOU WILL DISCOVER THAT YOUR SIZE CAN CHANGE IN THIS GAME.  YOU START OUT
1495 YOUR NORMAL SIZE AND THEN MAY GROW OR SHRINK, DEPENDING ON YOUR
1495 ACTIONS.  AT TIMES, YOU WILL HAVE TO BE VERY SMALL TO ACCOMPLISH CERTAIN
1495 TASKS.  BUT BE AWARE THAT THE LARGER YOU ARE, THE BETTER YOUR CHANCES OF
1495 EVADING DEATH.  ALSO, WHEN YOU ARE VERY LARGE, THERE IS NO WEIGHT
1495 RESTRICTION ON WHAT YOU CAN CARRY.  WHEN YOU ARE TINY AND YOU ENCOUNTER
1495 A DANGER, YOUR CHANCES OF SURVIVAL ARE PRETTY SLIM.
1495
1495 WINNING CONSISTS OF FINDING A PARTICULAR VALUABLE OBJECT AND RETURNING
1495 HOME WITH IT.  ALONG THE WAY, THERE ARE MANY ADVENTURES TO BE HAD AND
1495 MANY PLACES TO SEE.  YOU WILL NEED TO EXPLORE EVERYTHING.  SUITABLE
1495 FOR AGES 9 THROUGH ADULT.
