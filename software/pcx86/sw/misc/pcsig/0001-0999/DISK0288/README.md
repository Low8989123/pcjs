Expressware has dramatically enhanced product flexibility by rewriting
FILE EXPRESS in C and Assembler.  Basic relational capability has been
added to make it easier and more intuitive for the user to retrieve and
place information in other databases.

Over 100 new features have been added to FILE EXPRESS.  The
functionality of nearly every aspect of data management -- screen
definition, import/export, database size, reports, form letters, sorts
-- has been expanded.  Users can now edit records while in browse mode.

Recognizing that one of the primary uses of a database is for mailing
lists, FILE EXPRESS now has word processing capabilities.  Users can
write a letter from within the program and merge data from a database.

FILE EXPRESS features:

~ Increased capacity, handling 2 billion records per database, 200
fields per record, 1000 characters per field, 4000 characters per
record, and 100 databases per directory.

~ Context sensitive help screens to assist new or occasional users.

~ File locking for network use.

~ Mouse support.

~ Custom input screen design.

~ 36 definable macro keys.

~ Enhanced screen definition with features like color, automatic
addition of field names, calculated fields, word wrap, and easy drawing
of lines and boxes.

~ Search and replace or search and delete records; can automatically
search for duplicate records within a database file or between two
databases.

~ Formats can be changed at any time; users can add new or remove
existing fields, change field lengths or field organization.

~ Query and reporting facilities as well as a report writer that can
generate reports in columnar or multi-line format.

~ Enhanced Import/Export features that let users transfer data from
eight different formats, including dBase, Lotus, and WordPerfect files.

~ Mathematical calculation capability with 14 digit numerical accuracy;
up to three levels of subtotals are available on any or all fields in
the Report Generator.

~ Sorts up to 10 fields simultaneously.

~ Support for 280 printers.

~ All printing, including mailing labels, can be in regular or condensed
mode.

What is File Express?

File Express is a database management program written for the IBM Personal 
Computer and PC-compatible computers.  Using File Express, information 
of virtually any kind can be put into the computer, printed, sorted, 
displayed and reported.  For example, a list of names and addresses can be 
entered, then they can be sorted into zip code sequence or last name 
sequence, printed out onto mailing labels, and updated as the list changes.  
The same data can be included in reports, or simply displayed on the 
computer screen when needed.  Customized form letters can also be written 
in File Express by merging names from the database file with a letter. 

File Express is very popular among first-time database users and non-
technical users.  But as File Express has continued to be improved over 
the last six years, it has also become very powerful.  Some of its early 
first-time  users have advanced to true "power users" and we have
addressed their  needs too, while maintaining the simplicity of the manual 
and the software.  


Installing File Express

The diskettes included in this package contain compressed files which
must be expanded using the File Express Installation program.  To do
this, insert the diskette labelled "Program Disk" into drive A and at
the DOS prompt A>, type INSTALL and press <Enter>.  Then follow the
instructions on the screen.
