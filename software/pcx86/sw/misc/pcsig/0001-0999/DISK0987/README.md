## Information about "APOLLO MISSION"

    The APOLLO MISSION SIMULATOR is an in-depth simulation of a manned lunar
    exploration in the year 2010. This is NOT a game, it is a simulation.
    There are no points to score; either you survive your mission or you and
    your crew are space dust!
    
    In a typical mission, you begin in the Orbiting Laboratory, circling
    150km above the lunar equator. Enter the landing vehicle, undock and
    perform several orbital maneuvers, then land on the moon. Explore the
    surface using a long-range mobile base and a short-range roving vehicle.
    A permanent fixed base is also included. Names and locations of over
    300 lunar features are listed in one of the documents, each of which is
    actually in the simulation, so you can become familiar with real lunar
    geography.
    
    The APOLLO MISSION SIMULATOR is not "just another Lunar Lander." You
    participate in practically every aspect of a manned lunar exploration
    program. Set program goals, plan specific missions, and carry out those
    missions. Enough detail is provided so you can learn a great deal about
    lunar geography, orbital mechanics and physics in general.

Program Title: APOLLO MISSION SIMULATOR version 2.1
PC-SIG version: 1.1

The APOLLO MISSION SIMULATOR is an in-depth simulation of manned lunar
exploration in the year 2010.  In a typical mission, you begin in the
Orbiting Laboratory, circling 150km above the lunar equator.  You enter
the Landing Vehicle, undock, and, after performing several orbital
maneuvers, land on the Moon.  After landing, you may explore the surface
using a long-range Mobile Base and a short-range Roving Vehicle.  A
permanent fixed Base is also included in the lunar exploration
infrastructure.  Extensive documentation (109 pages) and tutorial
lessons (over 5 hours) are provided to help you learn how to fly the
Landing Vehicle and operate the Mobile Base and Roving Vehicle.

Version 2.1 (compared with version 1.1) greatly expands the simulated
lunar exploration infrastructure and increases the mission options
available to the player.  Names and locations of over 300 lunar features
are listed in one of the documents, each of which is actually present in
the simulation, so the player can become familiar with real lunar
geography.  The program has also been rewritten so it no longer requires
a math coprocessor.

The APOLLO MISSION SIMULATOR is "not just another Lunar Lander."  It
allows a player to participate in practically every aspect of a manned
lunar exploration program.  He can set program goals, plan specific
missions, and carry out those missions in as much detail as he likes.
Enough detail is provided so the player can learn a great deal about
lunar geography, orbital mechanics, and physics in general.
