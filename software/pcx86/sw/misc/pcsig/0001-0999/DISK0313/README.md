## Information about "BUSINESS SAMPLER #3"

    Time Management is the theme of this business collection.  Highlights
    include: the PC Yearbook which is a calendar/appointment schedule
    program written in C; it also includes a notepad.  IPM.COM is a
    (Critical Path Method) project scheduler written in Turbo Pascal.
    This is a methodology for determining the critical task that, if not
    accomplished by a certain time, contributes directly to the delay of
    the whole project.  It does not have a calendar function or a project
    tracking function.
    
    UserLog is a system utility designed to maintain a disk-based file of
    computer usage, thus eliminating the need for a written log that
    monitors the business and personal use of a computer.  Program Time
    calculates the amount of computer time used.  It allows apportionment
    of the time between business and non-business use.
    
    System Requirements:  BASIC
    
    How to Start: Consult the .DOC and README files for directions and
    documentation.  To run the BASIC programs, consult the directions in
    GETTING STARTED for your configuration.  To run a program suffixed
    .COM or .EXE, just type its name, i.e., for IPM.COM, type IPM <ENTER>.

IPM.PAS & IPM.COM - Version 1.07B- November, 1986
(c) 1984, 1986 by Edward V. Dong, All Rights Reserved.


                         Programmed by:
                         Edward V.  Dong
                     12205 Alexandria Place
                         Chino, CA 91710

1.0   GENERAL

IPM.COM  is  a  Critical  Path  Method  Project  Scheduler.   The
Critical  Path  Method  is  a  methodology  for  determining  the
critical  tasks  that,  if  not  accomplished  by a certain time,
contribute  directly  to  the  delay  of  the whole project.  You
should refer to various books on the subject.

This version was prompted as a result  of  some  bug  reports  on
version  1.06a.  A version 1.07 was previously distributed;  this
version  1.07b  is  a MINOR update and bug fix.  The bug was that
SLACK was not computed properly.

1.1  RIGHT  TO  USE THIS SOFTWARE.  The software, IPM.COM, may be
used as is, by anyone  for  private  purposes  only.   Commercial
users  should contact the address above for the right to use this
software.  No claim is made for the veracity  of  this  software,
and  no warranty, guarantee or other bond is expressed or implied
about the use of this software.  No user may sell  this  software
in  any  form,  other than for the cost of materials and mailing,
without the express, written consent of Edward V.  Dong.

This  software  and  documentation is copyright (c) 1984, 1986 by
Edward V. Dong, all rights reserved.

You are encouraged to share and  copy  this  software  otherwise.
Contributions  ($15  for example) and comments should be directed
to the above address.

1.2 REQUIREMENTS.  IPM will run in a minimum of 128K,  under  DOS
2.X,  and  3.1.   Originally  written  in  Turbo Pascal 1.0 (this
version compiled, however, under Turbo 3.0), IPM requires an  IBM
PC,  XT,  PC-3270,  or AT, or a close PC compatible that supports
IBM BIOS ROM calls.  It  should  run  with  or  without  a  color
graphics board.

The  maximum  number  of  activities  that it will handle, is 100
(actually 99), determined by the constant MaxValue in the  source
code IPM.PAS.

Various calculations and plots can be printed to an  EPSON  or  a
compatible  printer,  by first outputing them to a disk file, and
then  printing  those  files.   Basic  calculation  data  can  be
exported as a .PRN file to Lotus 1-2-3.

1.3  THEORY  OF  OPERATIONS.   Briefy,  the  CPM theory is that a
project is composed of tasks or activities that are arranged in a
pattern  or  network,  where  some  tasks  may  be  performed  in
parallel.

If two tasks are being performed in parallel, then the  one  that
takes  longer  to  do,  is  termed "critical".  It is "critical",
because a delay in that task directly contributes to the delay of
the whole project.  A delay in the other task -- as long as it is
completed before the longer task -- does not.  The difference  in
completion time is called "slack".

The idea in project scheduling and management is to arrange these
tasks, and to monitor them,  so  that  the  time  for  the  whole
project is kept as short as possible, or the resources needed for
the project is "levelled".  That is, you  don't  want  to  spend,
say, 6 men for 2 weeks on one part of the project, and only use 1
man for the remaining 12 weeks of  the  project;   rather,  as  a
manager,  you want to spread your manpower (or other resource) as
evenly as possible, because it becomes easier to manage.

1.4  BACKGROUND.   IPM was originally coded because of, first, an
admiration  for  the  Harvard  Project  Scheduler,  and,  second,
certain  deficiencies  in  the  HPM.   IPM indeed stands for "Ivy
League Project Manager".  While most features found  in  HPM  are
incorporated  into  IPM,  IPM  however  does  not have a calendar
function nor a project-tracking function.   These  may  be  added
later.

IPM  is  an  evolutionary  outgrowth  of  an  earlier  scheduling
program, written  by  E.   Dong,  called  CPM.COM.   CPM.COM  was
originally  coded  18  Sept  83  by  E.  Dong, based on the BASIC
version, 'Hard Hat Management:  Two On-Site  Tools',  by  Richard
Parry,  INTERFACE  AGE,  February, 1981.  It was first translated
into CIC86 'C', and then retranslated into Turbo Pascal, with the
last update on 24-Mar-84.

The  current  program, IPM.COM, was adapted from PRACTICAL PASCAL
PROGRAMS, Osborne/McGraw-Hill, by  Greg  Davidson,  (c)  1982  by
McGraw-Hill,  Inc.   However,  this  was extensively modified, as
this book did not address the creation of GANTT or PERT charts.

The algorithm for IPM's GANTT charts is based on that created for
CPM.COM,  while  the  algorithm  for  IPM's PERT charts was newly
created (in three days of intensive development).  A  semi-screen
editor was also created for IPM.COM.

2.0   STARTING IPM

Starting IPM is, after it has  been  copied  to  the  appropriate
disk,  to  type  IPM.   When  it  pops  up on the screen, it will
display a copyright logo, a brief text indicating  the  reference
to  Greg Davidson's book, and a brief description of how to enter
commands.

IPM is arranged so that line 25 (and occasionally, also line  24)
shows the current available commands.  You execute these commands
by typing the first letter (which should be high-lighted) and  no
carriage return.

Initially,  the  only  options  you have at startup are:  F(ile),
Q(uit), and H(elp).  QUIT returns you to DOS;  in some cases,  it
will  return  you  to  a  previous  command  menu  instead.  HELP
generates a quick summary of the basic commands  only.   FILE  is
the  command  that  you must enter first, in order to do anything
with IPM.

FILE allows you to specify the method of data  entry.   That  is,
you  can enter project data interactively at the console, or from
a file.  If you're using IPM for the first time, generally  there
would  be  no  files  for  IPM  to  use,  so  you must enter data
initially at the console directly.  FILE will prompt you for your
option.

You  should  have  a  minimum of four tasks to use IPM;  anything
else, would be a waste of time with IPM.

NOTE:   CPM  theory  works best if the number of tasks is GREATER
than the number of nodes.  A start node points to a  task,  which
points  to  another node, until the end node is reached.  Between
any two nodes, there may be any number of PARALLEL tasks.

Entering  necessary  input  data  is as follows.  First, IPM will
prompt:

Input from Console? (Y/N)

    Either an upper- or lower-case "y" or "n" may be entered.  If
    you  enter  "N",  then IPM will ask for the name of the file.
    This file must be in  the  current  subdirectory,  if  you're
    using DOS 2.0 or higher;  IPM isn't smart enough (right now!)
    to access across subdirectories.

    If you answer "Y", then IPM will ask:

Enter Project Title/Description:

    You can enter a  60-character  description  of  the  project.
    This  title  or  description  will  appear  at the top of the
    screen to let you know what project IPM is working on.

    Then, IPM will prompt for the number of tasks  that  comprise
    this project:

Enter Number of Tasks on this network:

    As  was  said before, you should have a minimum of four tasks
    to use IPM;  anything else, would be a  waste  of  time  with
    IPM.   Then the screen will clear, and display something like
    the following:

PROJECT: Sample -- Editing
----------------------------------------------------------------
Task Start  End
      Node Node  Duration  Cost Name/Description
    1    0    0    0.00   0.00    Task01
    2    0    0    0.00   0.00    Task02
    3    0    0    0.00   0.00    Task03
    4    0    0    0.00   0.00    Task04

    where "Sample" here is  the  project  title/description  that
    you've entered.  IPM tells you that you are in editing  mode,
    and  will have supplied a generic task name for the number of
    tasks you've indicated, such as "Task01".

    At this point, you will see a double command line (lines 24 &
    25).  You can use the command options (remember,  enter  only
    the  first or high-lighted letter of the option) to alter and
    enter the task data.

You should do the following:

    o IPM  assumes  that the first node is numbered "1", and that
      the last possible node is a number less than  or  equal  to
      the  total  number  of  tasks.  Therefore, you must specify
      "Start" and "End" nodes for each task.

    o "Duration" refers to the expected length of time  that  the
      task  should take.  No units are used, so you can use days,
      hours, minutes, or even seconds if you want.  However,  you
      should use the SAME unit of time (days, weeks, or whatever)
      for all entries.

To edit a line in the display, you must first enter  the  Taskno.
When  you  have done so, the line in the display will high-light.
Then you can change Duration, Task title, Task description,  etc.
The Task Title, however, is limited to 8 characters only.

You  can  insert either a new Task or a new Node.  If you enter a
new Node, you MUST specify a current Task number to go with  that
new Node.

To  finish  the editing, enter the command Q(uit).  IPM will then
prompt you if you want to save it to disk, and if so,  what  name
should it give the file.  If the file exists, IPM will ask you if
you want to overwrite (reuse) the file.

3.0  OPERATING IPM

Once you have entered the task data, you then have the following
options:

    CALCSHEET:  Calculate critical path, total project  duration,
    and cost.  You MUST run this option before doing...

    GANTT:  Build a GANTT chart on the console.  If the CalcSheet
    option was not exercised, then you will be prompted to do so.
    The GANTT chart is normalized, that  is,  the  time  line  is
    scaled to fit the CRT display.  The scaling is indicated.

    PLOT:   Build  a PERT network chart of the project.  Here you
    will see the tasks going from Node to Node, in  the  sequence
    that  you've  entered.  Since many managers and professionals
    need to see a PERT chart first, this option has the suboption
    of  Editing  as  well.   Then  you  will  go through the same
    editing as before, except that the Edit screen appears in the
    lower  half  of  the  CRT display, so you can see the current
    PERT network.  When you have  finished  editing,  the  screen
    will flicker once or twice, and then paint the new PERT chart
    that is the result of your editing.

    EDIT:  Edit tasks, as described above.

    FILE:  Once you have entered data (either from the console or
    from  disk), the next time you request F(ile), it will ask if
    you want to do a N(ew project) or to O(utput to  file).   See
    Section 4.0 below.

    QUIT:   Return  to  DOS.  IPM will NOT ask you if you want to
    save the current file, so be warned.

4.0  ADVANCED IPM FILE OPTIONS

After you have first entered data via F(ile), the next time (and
thereafter) you enable F(ile), it will ask you if you want to do
a N(ew project), O(utput to file), or Q(uit to main menu).

    N(ew project):  This is the same as if you were entering data
    for the first time to IPM.

    O(utput  to File):  When you select this option, you will see
    a new command menu line of C(alcSheet), G(antt), P(lot),  and
    L(otus).  For C, G, and P, you will first be prompted for the
    filename to send the output to;  this can be "LPT1:" for  the
    printer, but this is NOT encouraged.  (Save to file first, so
    you can use your text editor to modify the file for  whatever
    purpose.)

    L(otus):   This  option  outputs  the results of calculations
    into a file, which should be called  with  extension  ".PRN".
    Then  you  can  use Lotus 1-2-3 to IMPORT the file (using the
    NUMBERS option in Lotus), and  thus  generate  a  .WKS  file.
    Once  you've  done  that,  you  can now use the full power of
    Lotus on it.

    Q(uit):  Returns you to the main menu display.

The  file/printer  output  of the G(antt) and P(lot) options will
differ from the CRT display.  The reason for this, is  to  enable
the  use of any ASCII-supported printer;  except for IBM printers
and EPSON FX printers (with the  appropriate  fonts  downloaded),
the  IBM  display characters above ASCII code 128 decimal are not
uniformly supported.

5.0  USEFUL TIPS

IPM uses a normalized time scale.  That is, IPM does not  attempt
to   allocate  tasks  to  a  calendar  schedule,  although  this,
obviously,  is  a  prime  objective.   Thus,   you   should   use
"normalized"  time  units,  such as hours, days, or minutes;  you
should use minutes, for example, if you are using  this  to  plan
activities  that will span an eight-hour day or less;  hours, for
projects under a week;  and days for longer-lived projects.

## PCYEARBK.DOC

```


PC YEARBOOK is a calendar/appointment schedule program written in C
using the De Smet C Compiler. PC Yearbook turns the PC into an
electronic appointment book. Appointments can be scheduled from
8:00 am to 6:30 pm in half-hour increments. There is also a Note Pad
to record other information.


The program as been tested on a PC with 128K, color monitor, and 
with both DOS 1.1 and 2.0. The program should run on a 64K PC 
with DOS 1.1 but may not run under 2.0 due to the operating system
overhead. I have not tested the program on a monochrome display 
except very briefly but the program makes no use of special color
commands and should have no difficulity with the monochrome display.


You are encouraged to copy and distribute this program. If you find
this program useful, a contribution of $15 would be appreaciated. I
am especially interested in suggested improvements,bugs,comments,etc.

Running the program:

Before running PC Yearbook, you should check the system date. Be sure 
that it is the current date as the program utliizes that date to display
the initial calendar and to store the appointment data files. If you
forget, you should exit the program and start over again. 

To run the program, type PCYEARBK and press <Return>.



Calendar Function:


Each time the program is run, it will dispaly a calendar of the month
contained in the system date. Thus if you initialize the program and
have entered a date of 04-23-84, a calendar for April 1984 will be 
displayed at the top left of the screen with the 23rd highlighted in
reverse video. The date will also be printed to the right of the calendar
as Monday April 23, 1984. The appointment times will be displayed below
the calendar and a lightbar will indicate the first appointment at 8:00
am.

The keys used to manipulate the calendar are:


<Cursor> keys are used to move the highlighted day on the calendar. The
         Right/Left arrow keys move the date one day. The Up/Down arrow
         keys move to the same day in the previous or next week. The
         appointment schedule will be updated as the date is moved.


<F1>     displays the month previous to the month currently displayed.
         All appointment data from the currently displayed month will be
         saved to disk and the data from the previous month (if any) will
         be loaded into memory from disk.


<F2>     displays the next month after the month currently displayed.
         All appointment data from the currently displayed month will be
         saved to disk and the data from the previous month (if any) will
         be loaded into memory from disk. 


<F3>     will display the month and highlight the day/date that first
         appeared when the program was run during the current session.
         This allows you to return to the current date from any other 
         month. All appointment data from the currently displayed month
         will be saved to disk and the data from the previous month (if
         any) will be loaded into memory from disk.


<F4>     printout appointments - See Appointment function.


<F5>     accesses the Note Pad - See Note Pad function.


<F10>    to exit PC Yearbook and return to DOS. All appointment data
         from the currently displayed month and notes in the Note Pad
         will be saved to disk.


                  
PC Yearbook                                                          Page 3.

Appointment Schedule Function:


The appointment schedule allows appointments from 8:00 am to 6:30 pm
for each day. Each appointment may be up to 32 characters of text and
is active whenever the calendar is displayed.

The keys to use the appointment function are:


<Spacebar> moves the highlighted bar beginning at 8:00 am to the next
         appointment. The highlighted bar indicates the current cursor
         position for adding or deleting an appointment.


<Ins>    opens an appointment time at the current position of the
         highlighted bar for input of appointment text. The text is
         limited to a maximum of 32 characters. If you use all 32
         characters, the program will generate an automatic carriage
         return and will turn off the cursor otherwise you must press
         <Return> to terminate the entry of the text.


<Del>    deletes any appointment text at the current position of the
         highlighted bar.


<Return> terminates the entry of appointment text if the text is less
         than 32 characters.


<Backspace> or the left arrow key will delete the previous character
         of text during entry of appointment text.


<F4>     allows you to printout a specific date or the entire month of     
         the appointment schedule. When this key is pressed, the days
         of the current month will be displayed over the appointment
         schedule in three columns. Use the <Spacebar> to move the 
         cursor. Pressing the <Return> will select the day for printing.   
         A small graphic block will appear in place of the cursor 
         indicating that the day has been selected. If the day has 
         already been slected, pressing <Return> will erase the 
         selection. Pressing the <Spacebar> on a day will not alter the    
         selection. When your selections have been made, press <Esc> to    
         printout the appointment schedule for the days selected. If no    
         days are selected, the program returns to the calendar/schedule   
         function. The printout will contain a maximum of four days per    
         page in date order regardless of the order of selection.



Appointment Data Files:


Appointment data is stored on the disk in the default drive. A file is 
created for each month using the naming format of MMMYYAPT.DAT with the 
first three characters being the first three in the name of the month and 
the next two the last two digits of the year. Thus data for April 1984 
would be stored in a file named APR84APT.DAT.



PC Yearbook                                                          Page 4.

The amount of disk space required to store a month's data is dependent 
upon the number of appointments scheduled. The maximum size is about 23K 
which would represent an appointment scheduled for each half-hour for the 
entire month. A 320K diskette should have no problems containing an 
entire year of data.



Note Pad Function:

The Note Pad provides four pages of fifteen lines to store notes and 
other textual information that you do not wish to put on the appointment 
schedule. Each line can be up to 70 characters long.

The Note Pad is always resident and available. It is not date dependent.
         
The keys to use the Note Pad function are:

         
<PgUp>   displays the previous page in the Note Pad. If you are on page 
         1, it will wrap around to page 4.


<PgDn>   displays the next page in the Note Pad. If you are on page 4, it 
         will wrap around to page 1.


<Spacebar> moves the lighlighted bar on the Note Pad. It indicates the 
         cursor position for adding or deleting a note.


<Ins>    opens a Note Pad line at the current position of the highlighted
         bar for input of note text. The text is limited to a maximum of 
         70 characters. If you use all 70 characters, the program will 
         generate an automatic carriage return and will turn off the cursor
         otherwise you must press <Return> to terminate the entry of the
         text.


<Del>    deletes a line of text on the Note Pad at the current position
         of the highlighted bar.


<Return> terminates the entry of Note Pad text if the text is less than
         70 characters.


<Backspace> or the left arrow key will delete the previous character
         of text during entry of Note Pad text.


<Esc>    exits the Note Pad and returns to the calendar/appointment 
         functions.


<F5>     printouts out the Note Pad. On the printout, the notes are 
         printed from 1 to 60 without page indications as they are 
         displayed on the screen.

	   PRGTIM.BAS / PRGTIM.HEX / TMSTRT.BAS / TMSTRT.HEX / RPTUSE.BAS

    The first four programs are UTILITIES, to be included in a BATCH file.
They calculate the amount of time spent by someone using the computer, and they
permit apportionment of the time between BUSINESS and NON-BUSINESS use.

    "RPTUSE.BAS" provides a PRINT-OUT of data saved by PRGTIM in "PRGTIM.DTA."

    "PRGTIM.HEX" and "TMSTRT.HEX" can be converted into "PRGTIM.EXE" and
"TMSTRT.EXE", respectively, using the utility, HC.COM (found in one of the PC
SIG'S XA files).  The .EXE format permits faster access by the BATCH file, and
does NOT require one to load BASIC.  I therefore recommend this method, and I
have only included the BASIC programs so one can study and modify the source
listings.

 The programs are used as follows:

    1. The program, `TMSTRT' is first invoked by the BATCH file. This records
the starting time in a file, "TMSTRT.DTA"

    2. You then run whatever application programs you wish.   When  you exit
from the application program, the BATCH file then invokes `PRGTIM.'

    3. `PRGTIM' asks the user for his name (or initials), for  the name of the
application program just used, and permits up to  twenty-four characters of
comments.

    4. `PRGTIM' then calculates the elapsed time, and asks the user to indicate
how much of that use time was for business purposes.

    5. The program then writes, to the file "PRGTIM.DTA", the date, the user's
name, the name of the application program, the starting time, and the number of
hours & minutes of business and of non-business use.  This file is constantly
appended, providing  a continuous record of use.

    6. The data in the file "PRGTIM.DTA" can easily be printed out as a report,
using a simple BASIC program. (Please see the program, "RPTUSE.BAS" which can
do this.)

    In writing the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, it is important for `PRGTIM' to be able
to find "TMSTRT.DTA". In a two drive system, making B: the default, and putting
PRGTIM and TMSTRT in B: accomplishes this end.

    The AUTOEXEC.BAT would look  something like this:

ECHO off
PAUSE	 Be sure that disk with PRGTIM and TMSTRT is in DRIVE B:
B:
TMSTRT
....	    '(application program goes here, such as ` WS ')
PAUSE	 Be sure that disk with PRGTIM and TMSTRT.DTA is in DRIVE B:
PRGTIM
A:

    If one were to use the BASIC form of the programs, then one would need to
have BASIC.COM available on the disk, and the BATCH file  would need to contain
the command, `BASIC' preceding `TMSTRT' and also preceding `PRGTIM'.

    To print out a report, just load BASIC, and  RUN "RPTUSE" .

       PRGTIM.EXE/(BAS)  //   TMSTRT.EXE/(BAS)   //    RPTUSE.BAS

    The first two programs are UTILITIES, to be included in a BATCH file. 
They calculate the amount of time spent by someone using the computer, and
they permit apportionment of the time between BUSINESS and NON-BUSINESS use.

    The .EXE format permits faster access by the BATCH file, then the .BAS
programs, and does NOT require one to load BASIC.  I therefore recommend this
method, and I have only included the BASIC programs so one can study and
modify the source listings.

    "RPTUSE.BAS" provides a PRINT-OUT of data saved by PRGTIM in "PRGTIM.DTA." 
It can be modified to sort the data, or data can first be sorted using
a data-base program, such as PC-FILE.

    The programs are used as follows:

         1. The program, `TMSTRT' is first invoked by the BATCH file. This 
records the starting time in a file, "TMSTRT.DTA"

         2. You then run whatever application programs you wish.   When you 
exit from the application program, the BATCH file then invokes `PRGTIM.'

         3. `PRGTIM' asks the user for his name (or initials), for the name 
of the application program just used, and permits up to twenty-four characters 
of comments (which can be skipped).
		  
         4. `PRGTIM' then calculates the elapsed time, and asks the user to
indicate how much of that use time was for non-business purposes.  Hitting
<enter> twice will mark ALL of the use for BUSINESS.

         5. The program then writes, to the file "PRGTIM.DTA", the date, the 
user's name, the name of the application program, the starting time, and the 
number of hours & minutes of business and of non-business use.  This file is
constantly appended, providing  a continuous record of use.  

         6. The data in the file "PRGTIM.DTA" can easily be printed out as a
report, using a simple BASIC program. (Please see the program, "RPTUSE.BAS"
which can do this.)

    In writing the batch (.BAT) file, it is important for `PRGTIM' to be able
to find "TMSTRT.DTA". In a two drive system, making B: the default, and
putting PRGTIM and TMSTRT in B: accomplishes this end.

    Assuming a two drive system, with floppy diskettes, the AUTOEXEC.BAT or
(PRG.BAT) would look  something like this:

PAUSE    Be sure that disk with PRGTIM and TMSTRT is in DRIVE B:
B:    
TMSTRT
....           '  (application program goes here, such as ` WS ')
PAUSE    Be sure that disk with PRGTIM and TMSTRT.DTA is in DRIVE B:
B:             '  B: is the default drive now so the data files can be found.
PRGTIM
A:

    If one were to use the BASIC form of the programs, then one would need to
have BASIC.COM available on the disk, and the BATCH file  would need to
contain the command, `BASIC' preceding `TMSTRT' and also preceding `PRGTIM'.

    To print out a report, just load BASIC, and  RUN "RPTUSE" .

                  INTRODUCTION TO USERLOG
   
   USERLOG is a system utility designed to maintain a 
   disk-based file of computer usage.  As such, it may
   be used in lieu of a written log to record and monitor
   the business and personal use for which your personal
   computer is being used.
   
   The main features of USERLOG are:
   
        -  the utility is simple to use
        -  it is invoked directly from the PC-DOS command
           level.
        -  it can be used in batch files or with keyboard
           enhancement programs.
        -  all entries are automatically time and date
           stamped using your system's clock/calendar.
        -  elapsed times for each entry are calculated
           automatically and stored with each log entry
        -  the browsing and listing features permit you
           to selectively display or print log entries
        -  listings of log entries show the number of
           hours the computer was used for personal and for
           business use.

                   SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
   
   USERLOG has the following minimal system requirements
   
        -  IBM Personal Computer PC/XT/AT
        -  64K RAM
        -  One floppy disk drive
        -  Monochrome or color monitor
        -  printer port configured as LPT1
        -  printer
        -  PC-DOS version 1.0 or greater
   
   While optional, the use of a battery-powered clock/
   calendar that automatically sets your system clock and
   calendar is highly recommended.

   -------------------------------------------------------
   
   
                      BEFORE YOU BEGIN
   
   Before you put USERLOG to work for you, it is a good
   idea to create a working copy of your USERLOG program
   file.  First, you will need a blank, formatted diskette.
   Place your DOS diskette into drive A and next to the
   DOS prompt type
   
   FORMAT A:
   
   Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the
   diskette formatting process.
   
   Once the formatting process has been completed, a 
   working copy of USERLOG can be made by entering next 
   to the DOS prompt
   
   DISKCOPY A: A:    (if you have  1 disk drive)
   
     or
   
   DISKCOPY A: B:    (if you have 2 disk drives)
   
   Again, follow the directions on the screen to complete
   the copying process.
   
   Once a working copy of USERLOG has been made, store the
   original USERLOG diskette in a safe place.  Use the
   working copy of USERLOG to transfer the program file or
   maintain the log data file.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   -------------------------------------------------------
   
                             -3-
   
                                            U s e r L o g
   -------------------------------------------------------
   
   
                     INSTALLING USERLOG
   
   Floppy Drive Systems
   
   USERLOG.COM should be transferred to a blank and
   formatted diskette (See BEFORE YOU BEGIN and USING
   USERLOG IN BATCH FILES).  Because USERLOG records
   log entries in the same directory in which USERLOG.COM
   resides, the log file will be maintained on the same
   diskette.  The number of log entries that can be
   written to a diskette depends on the free space
   available.  A blank double-sided, double-density
   diskette formatted at 9 tracks per inch containing
   USERLOG.COM will have approximately 336 kilobytes of
   free storage available.  Since each log entry consumes
   63 bytes of storage, approximately 5300 log entries
   can be stored on the diskette.  This means you can
   record approximately 14 log entries per day.
   
   Hard Disk Systems
   
   USERLOG maintains the log file in the same directory
   in which USERLOG.COM resides.  As a result, USERLOG.COM
   can be installed in any directory or subdirectory on
   a hard disk.  However, unless you make extensive use
   of batch files or keyboard enhancement programs (e.g.
   PROKEY) to run applications, we recommend that
   USERLOG.COM reside in the root directory.

   -------------------------------------------------------
   
   
                       USING USERLOG
   
   USERLOG is a system utility that is invoked at the
   DOS command level i.e. next to the DOS prompt.  To
   run USERLOG, the following syntax must be used
   
   d:USERLOG/[p]
   
   where "d" designates the physical drive in which 
   USERLOG resides and "p" (short for parameter) instructs
   USERLOG which function to perform.  The following
   table lists the parameters that USERLOG recognizes,
   their functions and the page number of this manual
   where each function is described in greater detail.
   
   PARAMETER           FUNCTION               PAGE
   ---------   -------------------------     ------
      /N       Create a new log file            9
      /I       Log in                          10
      /O       Log out                         11
      /B       Browse log entries              12
      /L       List log entries                13
   
   NOTE:  USERLOG will accept a parameter in either upper-
   case or lowercase letters.
   
   For example, suppose you are going to begin analyzing
   last year's sales figures with your favorite spread-
   sheet program and wish to enter the activity into your
   log file.  To "log in", next to the DOS prompt you
   would type
   
   USERLOG /I
   
   
   
   -------------------------------------------------------
   
                             -5-
   
                                            U s e r L o g
   -------------------------------------------------------
   
   
   If USERLOG resides on a drive other than the default
   drive, you would type
   
   d:USERLOG /I
   
   where "d:" specifies the physical drive in which
   USERLOG exists.
   
   For systems equipped with a hard disk drive, a path
   name must be specified if USERLOG.COM is not in the
   current directory.  For example, if USERLOG.COM resides
   in a directory named MYLOG, to log in you would enter
   next to the DOS prompt
   
   \MYLOG\USERLOG /I
   
   All parameters are invoked in an identical fashion.
   If no parameters are specified or the parameter is not
   recognized, USERLOG will inform you that an error has
   occurred and give you the option of selecting the 
   correct parameter or returning to DOS.  Thus, USERLOG
   can be invoked at the DOS command level by including
   the parameter, or by entering USERLOG next to the
   command prompt and selecting an option.
   
   With the exception of logging an entry out (/O), you
   may escape from USERLOG at any time simply by pressing
   the [ESC] key.
   
   To insure the integrity of the log file and, therefore,
   your records, no means for editing log entries have
   been provided.  Attempts to edit the log file with a
   text editor will probably cause irreparable damage to
   the contents of the file.

                         IMPORTANT
                   ---------------------
   
   If your computer is not equipped with a battery-

                THE USERLOG LOG ENTRY SCREEN
   
   When USERLOG is invoked correctly, your display screen
   will clear and the log entry data screen will appear.
   The purpose and contents of each field in the screen
   are described below.
   
         FIELD              DESCRIPTION

                CREATING A NEW LOG FILE (/N)
   
   When first installing USERLOG, or at the beginning of
   each new calendar year, a new log file must be created
   before any entries can be made.
   
   To create a new log file, next to the DOS prompt type
   
   USERLOG /N
   
   USERLOG will ask you to enter the serial number of
   your system unit in the status area of the USERLOG
   log entry screen.  Once you have supplied the serial
   number, USERLOG will record the current system date
   and create a data file in the current directory with
   the name "USERLOG.yy" where the extension "yy" corre-
   sponds to the last two digits of the year held by the
   system clock/calendar (e.g. USERLOG.85).
   
   If you attempt to use USERLOG before a log file has
   been created, or if the calendar year changes, USERLOG
   will indicate that USERLOG.yy cannot be found and
   should be created by using the /N parameter.
   
   USERLOG will not create a new log file if one already
   exists in the current directory that corresponds to
   the current settings of your system's clock/calendar.

   -------------------------------------------------------
   
   
                      LOGGING IN (/I)
   
   Each time you begin a new activity on your computer,
   you should create a new log entry in your file using
   the /I parameter.  Invoking USERLOG with the /I
   parameter causes the USERLOG log entry screen to
   appear on your display.  To create the new entry,
   USERLOG requires that you fill three field with the
   following information 
   
   FIELD                    YOU ENTER
   -------    ------------------------------------------
   USER        1 to 3 characters that identifies the
               user(e.g. your initials)
   CAT         Enter "1" if the activity is business
               related or "2" if it is for personal use.
   TASK        Up to 24 characters may be entered in
               this field to describe the activity.
   
   Once you filled in the three field with the appropriate
   information, USERLOG time and date stamps the entry
   with the current settings of your system clock/calendar
   then exits to DOS.
   
   If the last log entry is still open, USERLOG will auto-
   matically close that entry and display its contents
   before creating a new log entry (See LOGGING OUT (/O)).
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   -------------------------------------------------------
   
                             -10-

   -------------------------------------------------------
   
   
                      LOGGING OUT (/O)
   
   After logging in and completing an activity on your
   computer, you must "log out" the entry using the /O
   parameter.  Invoking USERLOG with the /O parameter
   causes the USERLOG log entry screen to appear contain-
   ing the information from the last open entry.  Logging
   out is automatic feature of USERLOG.  Therefore, the
   "Out" field is automatically stamped with your system's
   current time, the hours that have elapsed since logging
   in are calculated and displayed in the field marked
   "E. Hours", the log file is updated, and control is
   returned to DOS.
   
   If the last log entry has already been logged out,
   USERLOG will inform you of such and will exit to DOS.
   
   If you are moving from one application to another
   and wish to enter each activity into your log file,
   you may "shortcut" the process of logging in and out
   by using only the /I parameter between activities.
   Invoking the /I parameter with the last entry still
   open causes USERLOG to automatically log out and
   display the contents of the last entry before creating
   a new entry (See LOGGING IN (/I)).

                 BROWSING LOG ENTRIES (/B)
   
   A facility for browsing forwards and backwards through
   your log file one entry at a time has been provided
   for in USERLOG.  When USERLOG is invoked with the /B
   parameter, USERLOG will ask for the beginning date in
   the status area of the log entry screen.  Once the
   date has been entered in a mm/dd format, USERLOG will
   scan the log file and display on the screen the first
   log entry whose date is greater than or equal to the
   date you supplied.  If the dates of all the log entries
   fall before the date you specified, then the last log
   entry is displayed.
   
   After a log entry has been displayed, certain keys on
   the keyboard can be used to browse through the log
   file.  The following table lists the keys and their
   respective functions:
   
             KEY             FUNCTION
           --------   -------------------------
            [->]       Show next log entry
            [<-]       Show prior log entry
            [Home]     Show first log entry
            [End]      Show last log entry
            [Esc]      Exit USERLOG

   -------------------------------------------------------
   
   
                  LISTING LOG ENTRIES (/L)
   
   USERLOG can provide you with a listing of all or
   selected log entries through the use of the /L para-
   meter.  When USERLOG is invoked with the /L parameter,
   you will be asked to supply a beginning date in a
   mm/dd format and whether you want only (1) business,
   (2) personal, or (3) both types of log entries listed.
   USERLOG will scan your entire log file searching for
   the first log entry that satisfies the criteria you
   specified.  If no matches are found, USERLOG will
   inform you of such and exit to DOS.  Otherwise USERLOG
   will ask which device to list the log entries to.
   Pressing the [S] key causes the output to be printed
   on the display screen whereas pressing the [P] key
   causes it to be listed on the printer attached to
   your computer.  You may exit USERLOG at this time by
   pressing the [Esc] key.  If the log entries are to be
   listed on the printer, be sure the printer is turned
   on and that the printer top-of-form has been set.
   
   The log entries are listed in detail in the order in
   which they were made.  As each log entry is printed,
   the number of hours the computer was used for business
   and for personal purposes are accumulated and printed
   on the bottom of each page.  The percentage of time
   your computer has been used for business-related 
   activities is calculated and printed also.

                USING USERLOG IN BATCH FILES
   
   In order to keep accurate records of computer usage,
   users should be 'forced' to log in and out between
   applications.  Fortunately, the batch language facil-
   ities of PC-DOS provides a very convenient means for
   doing so.  The following example shows how to create
   a batch file that will log a user in, run a program
   named MYPROGRAM and log the user out after exiting
   the program.
   
   
   A>COPY CON: MYPROGRAM.BAT
   CLS
   PAUSE -----> INSERT LOG FILE DISKETTE INTO DRIVE A
   USERLOG /I
   PAUSE -----> INSERT MYPROGRAM DISKETTE INTO DRIVE A
   MYPROGRAM
   PAUSE -----> INSERT LOG FILE DISKETTE INTO DRIVE A
   USERLOG /O
   ^Z                   (press the F6 key)
   1 file copied
   
   
   If your system has a hard disk drive, then the PAUSE
   statements can be eliminated.  However, the path to
   the directory containing USERLOG.COM must be named.
   For example, if USERLOG.COM resides in the directory
   named MYLOG, then then following batch program will
   log a user in and out.
   
   
   
   
   
   
   -------------------------------------------------------
   
                             -14-
   
                                            U s e r L o g

   C>COPY CON: MYPROGRAM.BAT
   CLS
   PATH \MYLOG 
   USERLOG /I
   MYPROGRAM
   PATH \MYLOG
   USERLOG /O
   ^Z                   (press the F6 key)
   1 file copied
   
   
   Programs written in interpretive BASIC can be executed
   from batch files as well by either including BASIC.COM
   in the directory which contains the BASIC program or
   by extending the search path to include the directory
   that contains BASIC.COM.
