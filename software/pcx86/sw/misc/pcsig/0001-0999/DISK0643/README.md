## Information about "TASM"

    TASM is an assembler that runs on an IBM-PC/XT/AT or compatible and
    creates codes for any of the following processors: 8048, 8051, 8085,
    Z80, 6805, 6502, TMS7000, TMS32010, or 6801/6803.
    
    Features of TASM include: 17 operators for expression parsing, support
    of a subset of C preprocessor commands, macros, multiple statements per
    line, support of three object file formats, only absolute code
    generation, uniform syntax across versions, and support for PROM
    programming.  The source code is available.  Customize TASM to produce
    codes for other processors by creating a proper instruction definition
    table for the target chip.

INTRODUCTION


TASM is a table driven  cross assembler for the MS-DOS  environment.
Assembly source code, written in the appropriate dialect  (generally
very close to the manufacturers assembly language), can be assembled
with TASM, and the resulting  object code transferred to the  target
microprocessor system via PROM or other mechanisms.

The current microprocessor families supported by TASM are:

        6502                       8048
        6800/6801                  8051
        6805                       8080/8085
        TMS32010                   Z80
        TMS7000

The user so inclined may build tables for other microprocessors. The
descriptions of  the various  existing  tables and  instructions  on
building new tables are not in this document but can be found in the
TASMTABS.DOC file on the TASM distribution disk.

TASM characteristics include:

  1.  Powerful expression parsing (17 operators).
  2.  Supports a subset of the 'C' preprocessor commands.
  3.  Macro capability (through use of DEFINE directive).
  4.  Multiple statements per line.
  5.  Four object file formats:
          Intel hex, MOS Technology hex, Motorola hex, binary.
  6.  Absolute code generation only.
  7.  Source code available (in C).
  8.  Uniform syntax  across  versions  for  different  target machines.
  9.  Features in support of PROM programming (preset memory,
          contiguous block).
  10. Supports extended instructions for many of the supported
          microprocessor families.
  11. Tables read at run time - single TASM executable for all
          table versions.
  12. Symbol table export for inclusion in subsequent assemblies
          (.EXP format).
  13. Symbol table export file compatible with the Avocet 8051
          simulator (.SYM format).

SHAREWARE

TASM is distributed as shareware.   TASM is not public domain.   The
TASM distribution files may be  freely copied (excluding the  source
code files)  and  freely used  for  the purpose  of  evaluating  the
suitability of  TASM for  a given  purpose.   Use of  TASM beyond  a
reasonable evaluation period requires registration.   Prolonged  use
without registration is unethical.

INVOCATION

TASM can be invoked as  follows (optional fields shown in  brackets,
symbolic fields in <>):

    tasm -<pn> [-<option_flag ...>] <src_file> [<obj_file>
                               [<lst_file> [<exp_file> [<sym_file>]]]]

    Where  <option_flag> can be one or more of the following:

    -<table>        Specify version (<table> = table designation)
    -t<table>       Table (alternate form of above)
    -a<amask>       Assembly control (optional error checking)
    -b              Produce object in binary (.COM) format
    -c              Object file written as a contiguous block
    -d<macro>       Define a macro (or just a macro label)
    -e              Show source lines after macro expansion
    -f<fillbyte>    Fill entire memory space with <fillbyte> (hex)
    -g<objtype>     Object file (0=Intel, 1=MOS Tech, 2=Motorola, 3=binary)
    -h              Produce hex table of the assembled code (in list file)
    -i              Ignore case for labels
    -l              Produce a label table in the listing
    -m              Produce object in MOS Technology format
    -o<obytes>      Bytes per object record (for hex obj formats)
    -p[<lines>]     Page the listing file (<lines per page>. default=60)
    -q              Quiet, disable the listing file
    -r<kb>          Set read buffer size in Kbytes (default 2 Kbytes)
    -s              Write a symbol table file
    -x[<xmask>]     Enable extended instruction set (if any)
    -y              Time the assembly

The file parameters are defined as follows:

<src_file>  Source file name
<obj_file>  Object code file name
<lst_file>  Listing file name
<exp_file>  Symbol export file (only if the EXPORT directive is used).
<sym_file>  Symbol table file  (only if the "-s"
                option or the SYM/AVSYM directives are used).

The source file must be specified.   If not, some usage  information
is displayed.   Default  file  names for  all  the other  files  are
generated if  they are  not explicitly  provided.   The filename  is
formed by taking the source  filename and changing the extension  to
one of the following:

Extension           File type
________________________________________________________
.OBJ                Object file
.LST                Listing file
.EXP                Symbol export file
.SYM                Symbol table  file

TASM has  no  built-in  instruction set  tables.    Instruction  set
definition files are read at run time.  TASM determines which  table
to use based  on the '-table'  field shown above.   For example,  to
TASM - Table Driven Assembler Version 2.8                     Page 6

assemble the code in a file called source.asm, one would enter:

        tasm -48  source.asm            for an 8048 assembly
        tasm -65  source.asm            for a  6502 assembly
        tasm -51  source.asm            for an 8051 assembly.
        tasm -85  source.asm            for an 8085 assembly.
        tasm -80  source.asm            for a  Z80  assembly.
        tasm -05  source.asm            for a  6805 assembly.
        tasm -68  source.asm            for a  6800/6801 assembly.
        tasm -70  source.asm            for a  TMS7000  assembly.
        tasm -32  source.asm            for a  TMS32010 assembly.

The file name that the tables are read from is formed by taking  the
digits specified  after the  '-'  and appending  it to  'TASM'  then
appending the '.TAB' extension.   Thus, the  '-48' flag would  cause
the tables to be read from the file 'TASM48.TAB'.

It is possible to  designate tables by non  numeric part numbers  if
the '-t' flag is used.  For example, if a user built a table  called
TASMF8.TAB then TASM could be invoked as follows:

        tasm -tf8 source.asm

Each option  flag must  be preceded  by a  dash.   Options need  not
precede the file names, however.  The various options are  described
below:

a - Assembly Control. TASM can provide additional error checking  by
specifying the '-a' option at the time of execution.  If the '-a' is
provided without a  digit following,  then all  the available  error
checking is done.  If a digit follows, then it is used as a mask  to
determine the error checks  to be made.   The bits  of the mask  are
defined as follows:

Bit   Option   Description
__________________________________________________________________
0     -a1      Check for apparent illegal use of indirection
1     -a2      Check for unused data in the arguments
2     -a4      Check for duplicate labels
3     -a8      Check for non-unary operators at start of expression.
4     -a10     Check for off-page jumps for 8051 ACALL/AJMP.

Combinations of the above bits can also be used.  For example, '-a5'
would enable  the checking  for  illegal indirection  and  duplicate
labels.

Illegal indirection applies to micros that use parenthesis around an
argument to indicate indirection.  Since  it is always legal to  put
an extra pair of  parenthesis around any expression  (as far as  the
expression parser is concerned), the  user may think that he/she  is
indicating indirection for  an instruction that  has no  indirection
and TASM would not complain.  Enabling this checking will result  in
an error message (warning) whenever an outer pair of parenthesis  is
used and the  instruction set definition  table does not  explicitly
indicate that to be a valid form of addressing.

TASM - Table Driven Assembler Version 2.8                     Page 7

Unused data in  arguments applies to  cases where a  single byte  of
data is needed from an argument, but the argument contains more than
one byte of data.  If a full sixteen bit address is used in a  'Load
Immediate' type  instruction  that needs  only  a single  byte,  for
example, an error message  would be generated.   Here is an  example
(6502 code):

0001   1234                    .org $1234
tasm: Unused data in MS byte of argument.  Line 0002 in test.asm
0002   1234 A9 34       start  lda  #start

To make the above  checks occur whenever you  do an assembly, add  a
line like this to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

        SET TASMOPTS=-a


b  -  Binary Object Format. This option causes the object file to be
written in binary - one byte for each byte of code/data.  Note  that
no address  information  is included  in  the object  file  in  this
format.  The contiguous block (-c)  output mode is forced when  this
option is invoked.  This flag is equivalent to '-g3'.

c - Contiguous Block Output. If  this option is specified, then  all
bytes in the range from the lowest used byte to the highest will  be
defined in the object  file.  Normally, with  the default Intel  Hex
object format enabled,  if the  Program Counter  (PC) jumps  forward
because of an .ORG directive, the  bytes skipped over will not  have
any value  assigned them  in  the object  file.   With  this  option
enabled, no output to  the object file occurs  until the end of  the
assembly at which time the whole  block is written.  This is  useful
when using TASM to  generate code that  will be put  into a PROM  so
that all locations will  have a known value.   This option is  often
used in conjunction with  the -f option to  ensure all unused  bytes
will have a known value.

d - Define a Macro. Macros are defined on the command line generally
to control the assembly  of various IFDEF's that  are in the  source
file.  This  is a  convenient way  to generate  various versions  of
object code from a single source file.

e - Expand  Source. Normally TASM  shows lines in  the listing  file
just as they are in the source file.  If macros are in use (via  the
DEFINE directive) it is sometimes desirable to see the source  lines
after expansion.  Use the '-e' flag to accomplish this.

f  -  Fill  Memory.  This  option  causes the memory image that TASM
maintains to be initialized  to the value specified  by the two  hex
characters immediately following the 'f'.   TASM maintains a  memory
image that is a full 64K bytes in size (even if the target processor
cannot   utilize that  memory  space).   Invocation of  this  option
introduces a delay at start up of up to 2 seconds (time required  to
initialize all 64K bytes).

g -  Object File  Format.  TASM can  generate  object code  in  four
different formats as indicated below:
TASM - Table Driven Assembler Version 2.8                     Page 8

        -g0    for Intel hex (default)
        -g1    for MOS Technology hex (same as -m)
        -g2    for Motorola hex
        -g3    for binary (same as -b)

The '-m' and '-b' flags may also be used, as indicated above.

See the section on OBJECT FILE  FORMATS for descriptions of each  of
the above.


h - Hex Object  Code Table. This  option causes a  hex table of  the
produced object code to  appear in the listing  file.  Each line  of
the table shows sixteen bytes of code.


i - Ignore  Case in Labels.   TASM is  normally case sensitive  when
dealing with labels.  For those that prefer case insensitivity,  the
'-i' command line option can be employed.

l - Label Table.  This option causes a label table to appear in  the
listing file.   Each label  is shown with  its corresponding  value.
Macro labels  (as  established via  the  DEFINE directives)  do  not
appear.

m - MOS Technology Object Format. This option causes the object file
to be written in MOS Technology  hex format rather than the  default
Intel hex  format.    See  section on  OBJECT  FILE  FORMATS  for  a
description of the format.

o - Set Number of Bytes per Object Record.  When  generating  object
code in either the MOS Technology format or the Intel hex format,  a
default of 24 (decimal) bytes of object are defined on each  record.
This can be altered by invoking the '-o' option immediately followed
by  two  hex digits defining the number of bytes per record desired.
For example,  if 32 bytes per record are desired,  one might  invoke
TASM as:

        TASM -48 -o20 source.asm

p - Page Listing File. This  option causes the listing file to  have
top of page headers and form feeds inserted at appropriate intervals
(every sixty lines  of output).   To override the  default of  sixty
lines per page, indicate the desired  number of lines per page as  a
decimal number immediatly following the '-p'.  Here is an example:

        TASM -48 -p56 source.asm

q - Disable  Listing File.   This option  causes all  output to  the
listing file  to  be    suppressed,  unless  a  .LIST  directive  is
encountered in the source file (see LIST/NOLIST directives).

r - Set  Read Buffer Size.  This option overrides  the default  read
buffer size of 2  Kbytes.  The  first hexadecimal digit  immediately
after the 'r' is taken as the number of K bytes to allocate for  the
read  buffer  (.e.g.  '-r8'  indicates  an  8K  byte  buffer,  '-rf'
TASM - Table Driven Assembler Version 2.8                     Page 9

indicates a 15K byte buffer).  Note that that read buffers are taken
from the same  memory pool  as labels  and macro  storage, and  that
additional read buffers are  needed if "includes"  are used.   Thus,
using 8K  byte buffers  may  be suitable  for most  assemblies,  but
programs with large numbers of symbols  may not allow such a  value.
Also, reducing the buffer  size to 1 Kbyte  can increase the  memory
pool available for label storage, if such is needed.

s - Enable Symbol File Generation.    If this flag is set, a  symbol
file is generated at  the end of  the assembly.   The format of  the
file is one line  per label, each label  starts in the first  column
and is  followed by  white space  and then  four hexadecimal  digits
representing the value of the label.   The following illustrates the
format:

        label1         FFFE
        label2         FFFF
        label3         1000

The symbol file name can be provided  as the fifth file name on  the
the command line, or the name will be generated from the source file
name with a  '.SYM' extension.   The symbol table  file can also  be
generated by invoking the SYM  directive.  The AVSYM directive  also
generates the symbol file but in a different format (see section  on
ASSEMBLER DIRECTIVES).

t - Table Name.  As an alternative to specifying the instruction set
table as two decimal digits,  the table indication may be  preceeded
by the '-t' option.  This is useful if the desired table name starts
with a non-numeric.  Thus, a table for an F8 might be selected as:

        TASM -tf8 source.asm

TASM would expect to read the instruction set definition tables from
a file named TASMF8.TAB.

TASM - Table Driven Assembler Version 2.8                    Page 10

x -  Enable Extended  Instruction  Set. If  a processor  family  has
instructions that are  valid for only  certain members, this  option
can be used to  enable those beyond  the basic standard  instruction
set.  A hex digit may follow  the 'x' to indicate a mask value  used
in selecting the  appropriate instruction set.   Bit 0  of the  mask
selects the  basic  instruction set,  thus  a '-x1'  would  have  no
effect.    A  '-x3'  would  enable  the  basic  set  plus   whatever
instructions have bit 1 set in their  class mask.  A '-x' without  a
digit following is equivalent to a '-xf' which sets all four of  the
mask bits.  The  following  table  indicates  the  current  extended
instruction sets available in the TASM tables:

              Base          Extension 1     Extension 2  Extension 3
Base Table    Family        (-x3)           (-x5)        (-x9)

TASM70.TAB    TMS7000       

The above table  does not  attempt to show  the many  microprocessor
family members that may apply under a given column.

y - Enable  Assembly Timing.   If this option  is enabled TASM  will
generate a statement of elapsed time and assembled lines per  second
at the end of the assembly.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The TASM  environment  can be  customized  by using  the  enviroment
variables listed below:

TASMTABS. This variable specifies the  path to be searched for  TASM
instruction set definition tables.   If it is  not defined then  the
table(s) must exist  in the current  working directory.   If it  was
desired to put the instruction set definition tables in a  directory
called 'TASM' on a drive called 'C:', the following statement  would
be appropriate in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

        set TASMTABS=C:\TASM

TASMOPTS. This variable specifies TASM command line options that are
to be invoked every time TASM is executed.  For example, if TASM  is
being used  for  8048  assemblies with  binary  object  file  output
desired,  the  following  statement  would  be  appropriate  in  the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

        set TASMOPTS=-48 -b


EXIT CODES

When TASM  terminates, it  will  return to  DOS the  following  exit
codes:

Exit Code      Meaning
___________________________________________________________
0              Normal completion, no assembly errors
1              Normal completion, with assembly errors
2              Abnormal completion, insufficient memory
3              Abnormal completion, file access error
4              Abnormal completion, general error


Exit codes 2 and above will  also be accompanied by messages to  the
console concerning the error.

TASM - Table Driven Assembler Version 2.8                    Page 12

SOURCE FILE FORMAT

Statements in the source  file must conform to  a format as  follows
(except  for assembler directive statements which are described in a
subsequent section):

        label  operation    operand       comment

All of the fields are optional, under appropriate circumstances.  An
arbitrary amount of white space  (space and tabs) can separate  each
field (as long as the maximum  line length of 255 characters is  not
exceeded).  Each of the fields are described below:

Label Field. If the first character of the line is alphabetic, it is
assumed to  be the  start of  a label.   Subsequent  characters  are
accepted as  part  of that  label  until a  space,  tab, or  ':'  is
encountered.    The   assembler  assigns  a   value  to  the   label
corresponding to  the current  location counter.   Labels  can be  a
maximum of 13 characters long.   Labels can contain upper and  lower
case letters, digits, underscores, and periods (the first  character
must be alphabetic).  Labels are case sensitive - the label  'START'
is a different label  from 'start' - unless  the '-i' (ignore  case)
option is enabled.

Operation  Field.  The  operation  field  contains  an   instruction
mnemonic which specifies the action to be carried out by the  target
processor when this instruction is executed.  The interpretation  of
each  mnemonic  is  dependent  on  the  target  microprocessor   (as
indicated by  the selected  TASM table).   The  operation field  may
begin in any column except the  first.  The operation field is  case
insensitive.

Operand Field. The operand field  specifies the data to be  operated
on by the instruction.   It may  include expressions and/or  special
symbols describing  the addressing  mode  to be  used.   The  actual
format and interpretation is dependent on the target processor.  For
a description of the format for currently supported processors,  see
the TASMTABS.DOC file on the TASM distribution disk.

Comment Field.  The  comment field always  begins with a  semicolon.
The rest of the line  from the semicolon to the  end of the line  is
ignored by TASM, but  passed on to the  listing file for  annotation
purposes.  The comment field must be  the last field on a line,  but
it may be the only field, starting in column one, if desired.

Multiple    Statement  Lines.     If  the  backslash  character   is
encountered on a  source line,   it is  treated as a  newline.   The
remainder of the line  following  the  backslash  will be  processed
as an  independent line  of source  code.   This allows  one to  put
multiple statements  on a line.   This facility is not so useful  of
itself,  but  when coupled  with the  capability   of   the   DEFINE
directive,    powerful    multiple  statement    macros    can    be
constructed  (see   section   on ASSEMBLER DIRECTIVES).   Note  that
when  using  the  statement  separator,  the character   immediately
following  it  should be  considered the  first character  of a  new
line,  and thus must  either be a start of  a label or  white  space
TASM - Table Driven Assembler Version 2.8                    Page 13

(not an instruction).  As the examples show, a space is put  between
the backslash and the start of the next instruction.


Some  examples  of  valid  source  statements follow (6502 mnemonics
shown):

label1   lda      byte1   ;get the first byte
         dec      byte1
         jne      label1
                  
;                 
label2            
         sta      byte2,X
         ;        a multiple statement line follows
         lda      byte1\ sta byte1+4\ lda byte2\ sta byte2+4



EXPRESSIONS

Expressions are  made  up  of various  syntactic  elements  (tokens)
combined according to a  set of syntactical rules.   The tokens  are
summarized as follows:

        1.  Labels
        2.  Constants
        3.  Location Counter Symbol
        4.  Operators
        5.  Parenthesis

Labels. Labels are strings of  characters that have a numeric  value
associated with them, generally representing an address.  Labels can
contain upper  and  lower  case letters,  digits,  underscores,  and
periods.  The first  character must be a  letter (to distinguish  it
from a numeric constant).  The value of a label is limited to 32 bit
precision.  Labels can contain up to 13 characters, all of which are
significant (none are ignored when looking at a label's value, as in
some assemblers).   Case is significant unless the '-i' command line
option is invoked.

Numeric Constants.  Numeric  constants  must  always  begin  with  a
decimal digit (thus hexadecimal constants  that start with a  letter
must be prefixed by a '0' unless the '$' prefix is used).  The radix
is determined by  a letter  immediately following  the digit  string
according to the following table:

       Radix          Suffix                   Prefix
       ______________________________________________________
       2              B or b                   %
       8              O or o                   @
       10             D or d (or nothing)      
       16             H or h                   $

Decimal is the default radix, so decimal constants need no suffix or
prefix.
TASM - Table Driven Assembler Version 2.8                    Page 14

The following representations are equivalent:

       1234H          or     $1234
       100d           or     100
       177400O        or     @177400
       01011000b      or     %01011000

The prefixes are provided for  compatibility with some other  source
code formats but introduce a problem of ambiguity.  Both '%' and '$'
have alternate  uses  ('%'  for modulo,  '$'  for  location  counter
symbol).  The ambiguity is resolved  by examining the context.   The
'%' character is interpreted as the modulo operator only if it is in
a postion suitable for  a binary operator.  Similarly, if the  first
character following  a  '$' is  a  valid hexadecimal  digit,  it  is
assumed to be a radix specifier and not the location counter.

Character  Constants.  Character  constants  are  single  characters
surrounded by  single quotes  (following quote  is optional).    The
ASCII value of the character in  the quotes is returned.  No  escape
provision exists to  represent non-printable  characters within  the
quotes, but this is not necessary since these can be just as  easily
represented as numeric constants (or using the TEXT directive  which
does allow escapes).

String Constants.  String  constants  are  one  or  more  characters
surrounded by double  quotes.   Note that string  constants are  not
allowed in expressions. They are only allowable following the TITLE,
BYTE and  TEXT assembler  directives. The  quoted strings  may  also
contain  escape  sequences  to  put  in  unprintable  values.    The
following escape sequences are supported:

        Escape
        Sequence       Description
        ___________________________________________________________
        \n             Line Feed
        \r             Carriage return
        \b             Backspace
        \t             Tab
        \f             Formfeed
        \\             Backslash

Location   Counter   Symbol.    The  current value  of the  location
counter (PC) can  be used  in expressions by  placing a  '$' in  the
desired place.  The Location Counter Symbol is allowable anywhere  a
numeric constant is.  (Note that if the '$' is followed by a decimal
digit then  it is    taken to  be  the hexadecimal  radix  indicator
instead of the Location  Counter symbol, as  mentioned above).   The
'*' may also be used to represent the location counter, but is  less
preferred because of its ambiguity with the multiplicative operator.

Operators. Expressions can optionally  contain operators to  perform
some alterations  or  calculations  on  particular  values.      The
operators are summarized as follows:

       !=                          not equal
       <                           less than
       >                           greater than
       <=                          less than or equal
       >=                          greater than or equal
                                   
       &           Binary          binary 'and'
       |                           binary 'or'
       ^                           binary 'exclusive or'

The syntax is much the same as in 'C' with the following notes:

1.  No operator precedence is in effect.  Evaluation is from left to
right unless grouped by  parenthesis (see example below).

2.  All evaluations are done with 32 bit signed precision.

3.  Both  '=' and  '==' are allowable  equality checkers.   This  is
allowed since the syntax does not provide assignment capability  (as
'=' would normally imply).

The relational operators return a value of 1 if the relation is true
and 0 if it is false.  Thirtytwo bit signed arithmetic is used.

It is always a good idea to explicitly indicate the desired order of
evaluation with  parenthesis,  especially  to  maintain  portability
since  TASM does not evaluate expressions in the same manner as many
other assemblers.  To understand how it does arrive  at  the  values
for expressions, consider the following example:

        1 + 2*3 + 4

TASM would evaluate this as:

       (((1 + 2) * 3) + 4) = 13

Typical rules of precedence  would cause the  (2*3) to be  evaluated
first, such as:

        1 + (2*3) + 4      = 11
TASM - Table Driven Assembler Version 2.8                    Page 16

To  make  sure  you  get  the  desired  order  of  evaluation,   use
parenthesis liberally.

Note that  TASM  versions earlier  than  2.7.8 employed  a  somewhat
different method of evaluating expressions (also without precedence)
that essentially resulted in a right to left evaluation.

Here are some examples of valid expressions:

        (0f800H + tab)
        (label_2 >> 8)
        (label_3 << 8) & $f000
        $ + 4
        010010000100100b + 'a'
        (base + ((label_4 >> 5) & (mask << 2))

ASSEMBLER DIRECTIVES

Most of  the  assembler directives  have  a format  similar  to  the
machine  instruction  format.     However,  instead  of   specifying
operations for the processor to carry out, the directives cause  the
assembler to perform some function related to the assembly  process.
TASM has two types  of assembler directives -  those that mimic  the
'C'  preprocessor  functions,  and  those  that  resemble  the  more
traditional assembler directive  functions.  Each  of these will  be
discussed.

The 'C' preprocessor style directives are invoked with a '#' as  the
first character of  the line followed  by the appropriate  directive
(just as  in 'C').    Thus, these  directives  cannot have  a  label
preceding them  (on the  same  line).   Note  that in  the  examples
directives are shown in upper  case, however, either upper or  lower
case is acceptable.

ADDINSTR.  This  directive   can  be  used   to  define   additional
instructions for TASM to use in this assembly.  The format is:

[<label>]  .ADDINSTR inst args opcode nbytes modop class shift binor

The fields are separated by white space just as they would appear in
an instruction definition  file. See  the TASMTABS.DOC  file on  the
TASM distribution disk for more detail.

AVSYM.  See SYM/AVSYM.

BLOCK. This directive causes the Instruction Pointer to advance  the
specified number of  bytes without assigning  values to the  skipped
over locations.  The format is:

        [label] .BLOCK        expr

Some valid examples are:

        word1   .BLOCK     2
        byte1   .block     1
        buffer  .block     80

BSEG/CSEG/DSEG/NSEG/XSEG.  These  directives   can  be  invoked   to
indicate the  appropriate  address  space  for  symbols  and  labels
defined in the subsequent code.  The invocation of these  directives
in no way affects the code generated, only provides more information
in the  symbol  table  file  if the  AVSYM  directive  is  employed.
Segment control directives such as these are generally supported  by
assemblers that generate  relocatable object  code.   TASM does  not
generate relocatable object code and does not support a link  phase,
so these directives have  no direct effect  on the resulting  object
code. The segments are defined as follows:

TASM - Table Driven Assembler Version 2.8                    Page 18

        Directive       Segment Description
        _________________________________________________________
        BSEG            Bit  address
        CSEG            Code address
        DSEG            Data address (internal RAM)
        NSEG            Number or constant (EQU)
        XSEG            External data address (external RAM)


BYTE.  This directive allows a value assignment to the byte  pointed
to by the current Instruction Pointer.  The format is:

        [label] .BYTE   expr [, expr ...]

Only the lower eight bits of expr  are used.  Multiple bytes may  be
assigned by separating them with  commas or (for printable  strings)
enclosed in double quotes. Here are some examples:


      label1   .BYTE     10010110B
               .byte     'a'
               .byte     0
               .byte     100010110b,'a',0
               .byte     "Hello", 10, 13, "World"


CODES/NOCODES. These directives can be  used to alternately turn  on
or off the generation of formatted listing output with line numbers,
opcodes, data, etc.   With NOCODES in effect,  the source lines  are
sent to the listing file untouched.  This is useful around blocks of
comments that need a full 80 columns of width for clarity.

DB.  This is alternate form of the BYTE directive.

DW.  This is alternate form of the WORD directive.

DEFINE. The DEFINE  directive is  one of  the most  powerful of  the
directives and allows  string substitution  with optional  arguments
(macros).  The format is as follows:

        #DEFINE  <macro_label>[(<arg_list>)]  [<macro_def>]

        <macro_label> := character string to be expanded when found in
                           the source file.
                      
        <arg_list>    := optional argument list for variable
                         substitution in macro expansion.
                      
        <macro_def>   := character string to replace the occurrences
                         of macro_label in the source file.

The simplest form of the DEFINE directive might look like this:

        #DEFINE         MLABEL

Notice that no substitutionary string is specified.  The purpose  of
TASM - Table Driven Assembler Version 2.8                    Page 19

a statement like this would typically  be to define a label for  the
purpose of controlling some  subsequent conditional assembly  (IFDEF
or IFNDEF).

A more complicated  example, performing  simple substitution,  might
look like this:

        #DEFINE         VAR1_LO         (VAR1 & 255)

This statement would cause all occurrences of the  string  'VAR1_LO'
in the source to be substituted with '(VAR1 & 255)'.

As  a  more  complicated  example,   using  the  argument  expansion
capability, consider this:

        #DEFINE         ADD(xx,yy)      clc\ lda xx\ adc yy\ sta xx

If the source file then contained a line like this:

        ADD(VARX,VARY)

It would be expanded to:

        clc\ lda VARX\ adc VARY\ sta VARX

The above example shows the use of the backslash ('\') character  as
a  multiple  instruction  statement delimiter.  This approach allows
the definition of fairly powerful,  multiple statement  macros.  The
example shown generates 6502 instructions to add one memory location
to another.

Some rules associated with the argument list:

1.  Use a maximum of 10 arguments.

2.  Each argument should be a maximum of 15 characters.

Note that macros can be defined on the TASM command line, also, with
the '-d' option flag.

DEFCONT. This directive can be used to add to the last macro started
with a DEFINE directive.  This  provides a convenient way to  define
long macros without running off the edge of the page. The ADD  macro
shown above could be defined as follows:

        #DEFINE         ADD(xx,yy)     clc
        #DEFCONT                     \ lda xx
        #DEFCONT                     \ adc yy
        #DEFCONT                     \ sta xx

EJECT.  This  directive  can  be used to force a top of form and the
generation of a page header on the list file.  It has no  effect  if
the paging mode is off (see PAGE/NOPAGE).  The format is:

        .EJECT

TASM - Table Driven Assembler Version 2.8                    Page 20

ELSE.  This directive can optionally be used with IFDEF, IFNDEF  and
IF to delineate an  alternate block of code  to be assembled if  the
block  immediately  following  the  IFDEF,  IFNDEF  or  IF  is   not
assembled.

Here are some examples of the use of IFDEF, IFNDEF,  IF,  ELSE,  and
ENDIF:

        #IFDEF   label1
        lda      byte1
        sta      byte2
        #ENDIF   
                 
        #ifdef   label1
        lda      byte1
        #else    
        lda      byte2
        #endif   
                 
        #ifndef  label1
        lda      byte2
        #else    
        lda      byte1
        #endif   

        #if ($ >= 1000h)
        ; generate an invalid statement to cause an error
        ;  when we go over the 4K boundary.
         !!! PROM bounds exceeded.
        #endif

END.     This  directive  should  follow  all  code/data  generating
statements in the  source file.   It forces  the last  record to  be
written to the object file.  The format is:

        [<label>]       .END

ENDIF. This directive  must always  follow an IFDEF,  IFNDEF, or  IF
directive and signifies the end of the conditional block.

EQU. This directive  can be used  to assign values  to labels.   The
labels can  then be  used in  expressions in  place of  the  literal
constant.  The format is:

        <label>   .EQU    <expr>

Here is an example:

        MASK   .EQU   0F0H
        ;             
               lda    IN_BYTE
               and    MASK
               sta    OUT_BYTE

An alternate  form  of 'EQU'  is   '='.    The previous  example  is
equivalent to:
TASM - Table Driven Assembler Version 2.8                    Page 21

        MASK    =   0F0H

or

        MASK    =0FOH
        MASK    =$FO

White space must exist after the label,  but none is required  after
the '='.

EXPORT. This directive can be  used to define labels (symbols)  that
are to  be written  to the  export  symbol file.   The  symbols  are
written as equates (using the .EQU directive) so that the  resulting
file can be  included in a  subsequent assembly.   This feature  can
help overcome some of the deficiencies of TASM due to its lack of  a
relocating linker. The format is:

[<label>]  .EXPORT      <label >

The following example  illustrates the use  of the EXPORT  directive
and the format of the resulting export file:

Source file:

        .EXPORT        read_byte
        .EXPORT        write_byte
        .EXPORT        open_file

Resulting export file:

read_byte      .EQU   $1243
write_byte     .EQU   $12AF
open_file      .EQU   $1301


IFDEF. This directive can be used to optionally assemble a block  of
code.  It has the following form:

        #IFDEF  <macro_label>

When invoked,  the  list of  macro  labels (established  via  DEFINE
directives) is searched.  If the label is found, the following lines
of code are  assembled.   If not found,  the input  file is  skipped
until an ENDIF or ELSE directive is found.

Lines that are skipped over still appear in the listing file, but  a
'~' will appear immediately after the current PC and no object  code
will be generated (this is applicable to IFDEF, IFNDEF, and IF).

IFNDEF. This directive is the opposite of the IFDEF directive.   The
block  of  code  following  is  assembled  only  if  the   specified
macro_label is undefined.  It has the following form:

        #IFNDEF  <macro_label>

When invoked,  the  list of  macro  labels (established  via  DEFINE
TASM - Table Driven Assembler Version 2.8                    Page 22

directives) is searched.  If the  label is not found, the  following
lines of code  are assembled.   If it  is found, the  input file  is
skipped until an ENDIF or ELSE directive is found.

IF.  This directive  can be used to  optionally assemble a block  of
code dependent on the value of a given expression.  The format is as
follows:

        #IF     <expr>

If the expression <expr> evaluates to non-zero, the following  block
of code is assembled (until an ENDIF or ELSE is encountered).

INCLUDE.  The INCLUDE directive reads in and assembles the indicated
source file.  INCLUDEs can be nested up to six levels.  This  allows
a convenient  means to  keep  common definitions,  declarations,  or
subroutines in files  to be included  as needed.   The format is  as
follows:

        #INCLUDE        "<filename>"

The <filename> must  be enclosed in  double quotes.   Here are  some
examples:

        #INCLUDE       "macros.h"
        #include       "equates"
        #include       "subs.asm"

LIST/NOLIST.  These directives can  be used to alternately turn  the
output to the list file on (LIST) or off (NOLIST).  The format is:

        .LIST
        .NOLIST

LSFIRST/MSFIRST. These directives determine  the byte order rule  to
be employed for the WORD directive.  The default (whether correct or
not) for  all TASM  versions  is the  least significant  byte  first
(LSFIRST).  The following illustrates its effect:

        0000  34 12    .word $1234
        0002           .msfirst
        0002  12 34    .word $1234
        0004           .lsfirst
        0004  34 12    .word $1234


ORG. This  directive  provides  the means  to  set  the  Instruction
Pointer (a.k.a. Program Counter) to  the desired value.  The  format
is:

        [<label>] .ORG    <expr>

The <label> is optional.   The Instruction  pointer is assigned  the
value of  the expression,  <expr>.   For example,  to generate  code
starting at address 1000H, the following could be done:

TASM - Table Driven Assembler Version 2.8                    Page 23

        start   .ORG    1000H

The expression  (<expr>)  may  contain  references  to  the  current
Instruction Pointer, thus allowing various manipulations to be done.
For example, to align the Instruction  Pointer on the next 256  byte
boundary, the following could be done:

                .ORG  (($ + 0FFH) & 0FF00H)

ORG can also be used to reserve space without assigning values:

               .ORG    $+8

An alternate form of ORG  is '*=' or '$='.   Thus the following  two
examples are exactly equivalent to the previous example:

                *=*+8
                $=$+8

PAGE/NOPAGE.  These directives can  be used to alternately turn  the
paging mode on (PAGE) or off (NOPAGE).  If paging is in effect, then
every sixty  lines of  output will  be  followed by  a Top  of  Form
character and a  two line header  containing page number,  filename,
and the title.  The format is:

        .PAGE
        .NOPAGE

The number of lines per page can  be set with the '-p' command  line
option.


SET. This directive  allows the  value of  an existing  label to  be
changed.  The format is:

        <label>   .SET    <expr>

The use of the  SET directive should be  avoided since changing  the
value of a label can sometimes cause phase errors between pass 1 and
pass 2 of the assembly.

SYM/AVSYM. These directives can be used to cause a symbol table file
to be generated.  The format is:

        .SYM    ["<symbol_filename>"]
        .AVSYM  ["<symbol_filename>"]

For example:

        .SYM       "symbol.map"
        .SYM       
        .AVSYM     "prog.sym"
        .AVSYM

The two directives are similar, but result in a different format  of
the symbol table file.  The format  of the SYM file is one line  per
TASM - Table Driven Assembler Version 2.8                    Page 24

symbol, each symbol starts  in the first column  and is followed  by
white space and then four hexadecimal digits representing the  value
of the symbol.  The following illustrates the format:

       label1         FFFE
       label2         FFFF
       label3         1000

The AVSYM is provided to generate symbol tables compatible with  the
Avocet 8051 simulator.   The  format is  similar, but  each line  is
prefixed by an 'AS' and each  symbol value is prefixed by a  segment
indicator:

        AS     start          C:1000
        AS     read_byte      C:1243
        AS     write_byte     C:1280
        AS     low_nib_mask   N:000F
        AS     buffer         X:0080

The segment  prefixes  are determined  by  the most  recent  segment
directive invoked (see BSEG/CSEG/DSEG/NSEG/XSEG directives).

TEXT. This directive  allows an ASCII  string to be  used to  assign
values  to  a  sequence  of   locations  starting  at  the   current
Instruction Pointer.  The format is:

        [<label>] .TEXT   "<string>"

The ASCII value of each character in string is taken and assigned to
the next sequential location.   Some escape sequences are  supported
as follows:

        Escape
        Sequence       Description
        ___________________________________________________
        \n             Line Feed
        \r             Carriage return

TITLE.  This directive allows the user to define a title string that
appears at the top of each page of the list file (assuming the  PAGE
mode is on).  The format is:

TASM - Table Driven Assembler Version 2.8                    Page 25

                .TITLE  "<string>"

The string should not exceed 80 characters.  Here are some examples:

                .TITLE  "Controller version 1.1"
                .title  "This is the title of the assembly"
                .title  ""

WORD. This directive allows a value assignment to the next two bytes
pointed to by the current Instruction Pointer.  The format is:

        [<label>] .WORD  <expr> [, <expr> ...]

The  least  significant  byte  of  <expr>  is  put  at  the  current
Instruction Pointer  with  the most  significant  byte at  the  next
sequential location (unless the MSFIRST directive has been invoked).
Here are some examples:

        data_table     .WORD   (data_table + 1)
                       .word   $1234
                       .Word   (('x' - 'a')  << 2)
                       .Word   12, 55, 32

OBJECT FILE FORMATS

TASM supports four object file formats:

        1.  Intel Hex (default).
        2.  MOS Technology Hex.
        3.  Motorola Hex.
        4.  Binary

Each are described below:

Intel Hex Object Format. This is the default format.  This format is
line oriented and  uses only printable  ASCII characters except  for
the carriage return/line feed at the end of each line.  Each line in
the file assumes the following format:

:NNAAAARRHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHCCTT

Where:

All fields marked  'hex' consist  of two or  four ASCII  hexadecimal
digits (0-9, A-F).  A maximum  of 24 data bytes will be  represented
on each line  (override the 24  byte default with  the '-o'  command
line option).

:      = Record Start Character
NN     = Byte Count (hex)
AAAA   = Address of first byte (hex)
RR     = Record Type (hex, 00 except for last record which is 01)
HH     = Data Bytes (hex)
CC     = Check Sum (hex)
TT     = Line Terminator (carriage return, line feed)

The last line of the file will  be a record conforming to the  above
format with a byte count of zero:

         :00000001FF

The checksum is defined as:

sum = byte_cnt+addr_hi+addr_lo+rec_type + (sum of all data bytes)
checksum =  ((-sum) & ffh)
TASM - Table Driven Assembler Version 2.8                    Page 27

MOS Technology Hex Object Format.  This format is line oriented  and
uses  only  printable  ASCII  characters  except  for  the  carriage
return/line feed at the  end of each  line.  Each  line in the  file
assumes the following format:

;NNAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHCCCCTT

All fields marked  'hex' consist  of two or  four ASCII  hexadecimal
digits (0-9, A-F).  A maximum  of 24 data bytes will be  represented
on each line  (override the 24  byte default with  the '-o'  command
line option).

;      = Record Start Character
NN     = Byte Count (hex)
AAAA   = Address of first byte (hex)
HH     = Data Bytes (hex)
CCCC   = Check Sum (hex)
TT     = Line Terminator (carriage return, line feed)

The last line of the file will be a record with a byte count of zero
(';00').

The checksum is defined as:

sum = byte_cnt+addr_hi+addr_lo+rec_type + (sum of all data bytes)
checksum =  (sum & ffffh)


Motorola Hex Object Format.  This format is  line oriented and  uses
only printable ASCII characters except for the carriage  return/line
feed at the end  of each line.   Each line in  the file assumes  the
following format:

S1NNAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHCCCCTT

All fields marked  'hex' consist  of two or  four ASCII  hexadecimal
digits (0-9, A-F).  A maximum  of 24 data bytes will be  represented
on each line  (override the 24  byte default with  the '-o'  command
line option).

S1     = Record Start Prefix
NN     = Byte Count (hex) (data byte count + 3)
AAAA   = Address of first byte (hex)
HH     = Data Bytes (hex)
CC     = Check Sum (hex)
TT     = Line Terminator (carriage return, line feed)

The last line of the file will be a record with a byte count of zero
('S903AAAACCTT'). The checksum is defined as:

sum = byte_cnt+addr_hi+addr_lo+rec_type + (sum of all data bytes)
checksum =  (~sum & ffh)


Binary  Object  Format.   This  file  format   has  only  a   binary
representation of each data byte with no address, checksum or format

description, whatsoever.  It is often a convenient format to use  to
pass the data to other programs  on your PC (like a PROM  programmer
package) but because  of the  non-printability and  lack of  address
information, it is  not often  used to  transmit the  code to  other
systems.

Note that when this  object format is selected  (-b option), the  -c
option is forced.   This is done  so that no  ambiguity arises as  a
result of the lack of address information in the file.  Without  the
-c  option,  discontinuous  blocks  of  object  code  would   appear
contiguous.

LISTING FILE FORMAT

Each line of source code generates one (or more) lines of output  in
the listing file.  The fields of the output line are as follows:

1.  Current  source  file  line  number  (4 decimal digits).

2.  An optional '+'  appears if this is   an  'INCLUDE'  file.  (One
'+' for each level of INCLUDE invoked).

3.  Current  Instruction Pointer (4  hex digits).   An optional  '~'
follows the Instruction Pointer  if the line of  source code is  not
being assembled because of an IFDEF, IFNDEF, or IF directive.

4.  Resulting  code/data generated  from this source  line (two  hex
digits per byte, each byte separated by a space, up to six bytes per
line).

5.  The source line exactly as it appears in the source file.

If  paging  is  enabled (by either the '-p' option flag or the .PAGE
directive) some additional fields will be inserted into the  listing
file every 60 lines.  These fields are:

        1.  Top of Form (form feed).
        2.  Assembler identifier (e.g. "TASM 6502 Assembler").
        3.  Initial source file name.
        4.  Page number.
        5.  Title.

PROM PROGRAMMING

A wide variety of PROM  programming equipment is available that  can
use object code in one or more  of the formats TASM supports.   Here
are some notes concerning the generation of code to be put in PROMs:

1.  PRESET MEMORY.  It is often  desirable to have all bytes in  the
PROM programmed  even if  not  explicitly assigned  a value  in  the
source  code  (e.g.    the  bytes  are  skipped  over  with  a  .ORG
statement).  This can  be accomplished by  using the -c  (contiguous
block) and the  -f (fill) command  line option flags.   The -c  will
ensure that every byte from the lowest byte assigned a value to  the
the highest byte assigned a value will be in the object file with no
gaps.  The  -f flag  will assign the  specified value  to all  bytes
before the assembly begins so that when the object file is  written,
all bytes not assigned a value in the source code will have a  known
value.   As an  example, the  following command  line will  generate
object code  in the  default Intel  Hex format  with all  bytes  not
assigned a value in the source set to EA (hex, 6502 NOP):

                tasm -65 -c -fEA test.asm

2.  CONTIGUOUS BLOCKS.  To ensure that TASM generates object code to
cover the  full  address  range  of the  target  PROM,  put  a  .ORG
statement at the  end of  the source file  set to  the last  address
desired.  For example, to generate code to be put in a 2716 EPROM (2
Kbytes) from hex address $1000 to  $17ff, do something like this  in
the source file:

                         ;start of the file
                         .ORG    $1000
                         ;rest of the source code follows
 
                         <source code>
 
                         ;end of the source code
                         .ORG    $17ff
                         .BYTE   0
                         .END

Now, to invoke TASM to generate  the code in the binary format  with
all unassigned bytes set to 00 (6502 BRK), do the following:

                tasm -65 -b -f00 test.asm

Note that -b forces the -c option.

Heap overflow on label definition.        TASM was  unable to  allocate
                                          memory to store the label.

No such label yet defined.                A    SET    directive     was

Binary operator where value expected.     Two binary operators in a row
                                          indicate a missing value.

Invalid token where value expected.       Two binary operators in a row
                                          are not allowed.

Duplicate label.                          Duplicate  label  checks  are

                                          a' option.

Label must pre-exist for SET.             The SET directive can only be
                                          applied to an existing label.

Unused data in MS byte of argument.       An instruction  or  directive
                                          used  the  least  significant

Bugs

1.  The 8048 version of TASM does not check for use of memory beyond
any reasonable bounds (e.g.  an 8048 has a maximum address space  of
4 Kbytes but TASM will let you pretend that you have 64 Kbytes).

2.  Expression evaluation has no operator precedence in effect which
can  make   for  unexpected results  if not explicitly grouped  with
parenthesis.

3.  First page of  listing file will not  show a user defined  title
(defined via TITLE directive).

4.  TASM sometimes does not generate error messages  for  improperly
formed expressions.

5.  TASM does not generate an error message when a EQU directive has
an undefined label on the right hand side.

Addressing  modes  are denoted as follows:

        ABS               Absolute
        ZP                Zero Page
        ABS,X             Absolute X
        ZP,X              Zero Page X
        ABS,Y             Absolute Y
        ZP,Y              Zero Page Y
        A                 Accumulator
        (IND,X)           Indirect X
        (IND),Y           Indirect Y
        (IND)             Indirect
        #IMM              Immediate
        REL               Relative (Branch instructions only)
        ZP,REL            Zero Page, Relative
        Implied           Implied

Note  that Zero Page addressing can not be explicitly requested.  It
is used if the value of the operand is  representable  in  a  single
byte for the applicable statements.

The '-x' command line option can be  used  to  enable  the  extended
instructions.  A  '-x'  with  no  digit  following  will  enable the
standard set plus both extended sets.  The 6502 version of TASM uses
three bits in the instruction class  mask  to  determine  whether  a
TASM TABLES  Version 2.8                                      Page 3

given  instruction  is enabled or not.  Bit 0 enables the basic set,
bit 1 enables set A (R65C02) and bit 2 enables  set  B  (R65C00/21).
The following table shows various options:


        Class Mask        Enabled Instructions
                        BASIC   R65C02  R65C00/21
        --------------------------------------------
        1               yes     no      no
        2               no      yes     no
        3               yes     yes     no
        4               no      no      yes
        5               yes     no      yes
        6               no      yes     yes
        7               yes     yes     yes

Thus,  to enable the basic set plus the R65C02 instructions,  invoke
the '-x3' command line option.

See manufacturer's data for  a  more  complete  description  of  the
meaning    of     the     mnemonics    and     addressing     modes.

8048 INSTRUCTIONS AND ADDRESSING MODES

The following list shows the acceptable opcode mnemonics  and  their
corresponding  operand  formats for the 8048 version of TASM.  Where
'Rn' is seen,  R0 through R7  may  be  substituted.  Other  symbolic
fields are as follows:

        SYMBOLIC            DESCRIPTION
        -----------------------------------------------
        <addr8>             Absolute address (8 bits)
        <addr11>            Absolute address (11 bits)
        <immed>             Immediate data

Any valid TASM expression can appear in the  place  of  any  of  the
above symbolics.

The lines that are marked with an (8041),  (8022),  or (8021) on the
far  right are extended instructions that are available only if a -x
option has  been  invoked  on  the  command  line.  The  classes  of
instructions  (and their bit assignment in the class mask) are shown
below:

        BIT     PROCESSOR
        -------------------------------
        0       8X48, 8035, 8039, 8049
        1       8X41A
        2       8022
        3       8021

Thus, to enable the basic 8048 set plus the 8022 set, a -x5 could be
used on the command line.

Note that some of the base instructions should be disabled  for  the
8041, 8022, and 8021, but are not.

TMS7000 INSTRUCTIONS AND ADDRESSING MODES

The following list shows the acceptable opcode mnemonics  and  their
corresponding  operand   formats  for the TMS7000  version of  TASM.
The following symbolic fields used in the table:

    SYMBOLIC        DESCRIPTION
    -------------------------------------------
    <iop>           Immediate data (8 bits)
    <Rn>            Register file (memory locations 0 to 127 or
                       0 to 255 depending on on-chip RAM)
    <Pn>            Peripheral file (0-255)

    <addr>          Program address (16 bit)
    <trap>          Trap number (0-23)

Any valid TASM expression can appear in the  place  of  any  of  the
above symbolics.

Note  that   TASM  allows   an  alternate   syntax  for   expressing
indirection.  Parenthesis can be  replaced with brackets (which  are
less ambiguous because they do not occur in expressions).  Thus, the
following are equivalent:

    BR      @addr1(B)
    BR      @addr1[B]

BUILDING TASM FROM THE SOURCE CODE

TASM  can  be built using the provided 'make'  file,  assuming   the
Microsoft C compiler (version 5.0) is available.  The can be done as
follows:

        make tasm.mak


For UNIX, try this:

        %cc -DUNIX tasm.c macro.c parse.c str.c -o tasm

The header file tasm.h should also be available.

Note  that the UNIX flag is being defined on the command line.  This
causes the following things to happen:

        1.  Tasm.h includes somewhat different system include files
                appropriate for the UNIX environment.

        2.  TASM declares a 64 Kbyte array  in  which  to  hold  the
                assembled    opcodes    and    data  in  a  slightly
                different way.   MS C must use the 'far' keyword for
                such  an  array  to give it a segment  all  its  own
                (assuming use of the small memory model).  Most UNIX
                environments do not have need for such syntax.

TASM TABLES  Version 2.8                                     Page 38

TASM INSTRUCTION SET TABLE DEFINITION

The tables that control TASM's interpretation of the source file are
read from a file at run time.  The table file name is determined  by
taking  the  numeric option field specified on the TASM command line
and appending it to the string "TASM", then a  ".TAB"  extension  is
added.  Thus, if the following command line is entered:

        tasm -51  test.asm

then TASM would read the table file named "TASM51.TAB".


The following rules apply to the structure of the table file:

        1.  The  first  line  of  the  file  should contain a string
                surrounded by double quotes that should identify the
                version of the assembler  table.  This  string  will
                appear at the top of each page in the list file.  It
                should be limited to 24 characters.
        2.  Any line that starts with a '.' is considered a directive.
                The following directives are available:

                DIRECTIVE       MEANING
                ----------------------------------------------------
                MSFIRST         Generate opcodes MS byte first.
                ALTWILD         Use '@' instead of '*' as the
                                wild card in the table.

        3.  Any   line  whose  first  character  is not a '.' and is
                not  alphabetic is considered to be a comment and is
                discarded.

        4.  Any  line  that has an alphabetic character as the first
                character is assumed to be an instruction definition
                record  and  is  parsed  to   build   the   internal
                representation   of   the  instruction  set  tables.
                Eight  fields   (separated  by  white  space)    are
                expected,  as follows:

                Field Name      Description
                --------------------------------------------
                INSTRUCTION     Instruction Mnemonic
                ARGS            Argument definition
                OPCODE          Opcode value
                NBYTES          Number of bytes
                MODOP           Modifier operation
                CLASS           Instruction class
                SHIFT           Argument left shift count
                OR              Argument bitwise OR mask

                INSTRUCTION.  The  INSTRUCTION  field should contain
                the string to be  used  as  the  mnemonic  for  this
                instruction.  Upper case letters should be used (the
                source statements are converted to upper case before
                comparison).
TASM TABLES  Version 2.8                                     Page 39

                ARGS.   The  ARGS  field  should  contain  a  string
                describing  the  format  of  the operand field.  All
                characters are taken literally except the '*'  which
                denotes  the  presence  of  a valid TASM expression.
                Multiple '*'s can be used,  but all but the last one
                must  be  followed  by  a  comma.  If  a  single '*'
                appears in the ARGS field,  then the default  action
                of  TASM  will  be  to  determine  the  value of the
                expression that matches the field and insert one  or
                two  bytes  of  it into the object file depending on
                the NBYTES field.  If multiple '*'s are  used,  then
                special  operators  (MODOP)  must  be  used  to take
                advantage of them (see the examples below).  An ARGS
                field of a pair  of  double  quotes  means  that  no
                arguments are expected.


                OPCODE.  The OPCODE field should contain the  opcode
                value    (two  to  six  hex   digits)   for   this
                instruction  and  address mode.   Each pair  of  hex
                digits  represent  a  single  byte  of  the  opcode,
                ordered with the right most pair being placed in the
                lowest memory location.


                NBYTES.  The NBYTES field should specify the  number
                of  bytes  this  instruction  is to occupy (a single
                decimal  digit).   This number includes both  opcode
                bytes and argument bytes, thus,  the number of bytes
                of argument is computed by subtracting the number of
                bytes  of  opcode  (dictated by the  length  of  the
                OPCODE field) from NBYTES.


                MODOP.  The MODOP field determines  if  any  special
                operations   need   to  be  performed  on  the  code
                generated for this  instruction.  For  example,  the
                zero-page  addressing  mode of the 6502 is a special
                case of the absolute addressing mode, and is handled
                by a special MODOP code (see appendix B).  The  list
                of operators is as follows:

                            according to SHIFT and mask with OR and
                            OR into opcode.  If a second arg exists
                            assume it is an <arp> and OR into   LSB
                            of opcode.
                TDMA        TMS320 instruction with first arg <dma>.
                            Second arg gets shift/and/or  treatment
                            as with T1.
                TAR         TMS320 instruction with first arg <ar>.
                            Second arg gets shift/and/or  treatment
                            as with T1.

                Note  that the reason for the combining of arguments
                (COMBINE and CSWAP) is that TASM  assumes  that  all
                object  bytes  to be inserted in the object file are
                derived from a variable representing  the  value  of
                the  first  argument (argval).  If two arguments are
                in the  ARGS  field,  then  one  of  the  previously
                mentioned  MODOP`s  must  be  used.  They  have  the
                effect of combining the low bytes of the  first  two
                arguments  into the variable (argval) from which the
                object  code  will  be  generated.  TASM`s  argument
                parsing   routine  can  handle  a  large  number  of
                arguments,  but the code that generates  the  object
                code is less capable.

                CLASS.  The  CLASS  field is used to specify whether
                this instruction is part of the standard instruction
                set or a member of a set of  extended  instructions.
                Bit 0 of this field should be set to denote a member
                of  the standard instruction set.  Other bits can be
                used as needed  to  establish  several  classes  (or
                sets)   of  instructions  that  can  be  enabled  or
                disabled via  the  '-x'  command  line  option  (see
                section on 6502 INSTRUCTIONS AND ADDRESSING MODES).
TASM TABLES  Version 2.8                                     Page 41

                SHIFT (optional).   The SHIFT field is used to cause
                the  first  argument of the given instruction to  be
                shifted left the specified number of bits.   (Except
                T1, TDMA, TAR MODOPS as noted below).

                OR  (optional).   The OR field is used to perform  a
                bitwise  OR  with  the first argument of  the  given
                instruction.  Specified as hex digits.  (Except  T1,
                TDMA, TAR MODOPS as noted below).

Note that the SHIFT/OR fields are used somewhat differently for  T1,
TDMA,  and TAR MODOPS.  In those cases,  the SHIFT and OR fields are
used  but the OR field is really an AND mask and the result is  OR'd
with the opcode.

The   following  table   shows   possible    instruction  definition
records,  followed  by  possible  source statements that would match
it,    followed by the resulting object code that would be generated

The  order  of  the  entries for various addressing modes of a given
instruction is important.  Since the wild card matches anything,  it
is  important to specify the ARGS for the addressing modes that have
the  most  qualifying  characters  first.   For   example,   if   an
instruction  had  two  addressing  modes,   one  that  accepted  any
expression,  and another that required a pound sign in front  of  an
expression,  the  pound  sign  entry  should  go first otherwise all
occurrences of the instruction would match  the  more  general  ARGS
expression   that  it  encountered  first.   The  following  entries
illustrate the proper sequencing:

        ADD #*  12 3 NOTOUCH 1
        ADD *   13 3 NOTOUCH 1
