## Information about "UPDATED ALL FILES ON #2321"

    QUBECALC is a spreadsheet with many advanced features.  However, the
    special power of this package is in its being a TRUE three-dimensional
    spreadsheet.  It can be thought of as a large cube, with 64 rows, 64
    columns and 64 pages.  Formulas can reference any cell on any page, or
    even ranges of cells which span multiple pages.  Plus, QUBECALC'S 3D
    worksheet can be rotated to allow you to view, enter, or manipulate your
    data from any of its six faces.  PC Magazine made it an Editor's Choice
    among low cost spreadsheets.

Special Requirements: Two floppy drives.                                
                                                                        
QUBECALC is a spreadsheet with many advanced features.  However, the    
special power of this package is in its being a TRUE three-dimensional  
spreadsheet, as opposed to some two-dimensional spreadsheets which let  
you link cells of multiple spreadsheets together.                       
                                                                        
QUBECALC can be thought of as a large cube -- the workqube -- with      
262,144 cells arranged into 64 rows, 64 columns, and 64 pages, named X, 
Y, and Z. It is configured so there are six faces on the workqube, named
A through F. Here is the power of this spreadsheet: you can view, enter,
or manipulate your data from ANY of the six faces -- providing a        
different perspective of the data stored within the workqube.
