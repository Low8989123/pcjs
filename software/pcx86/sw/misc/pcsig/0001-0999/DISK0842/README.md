## Information about "BOX (PROGRAMMERS UTILITY)"

    BOX is a screen-designing tool that lets you quickly create entry
    screens, help screens and menus.
    
    You start with a blank screen, and using simple commands, you can draw
    lines, boxes, enter text, and change foreground and background colors.
    You can repeat an entry, paint an area, copy or move portions of the
    screen and select special characters from an ASCII table.  Boxes are
    incredibly easy to design, and several different border lines are
    provided to create them.
    
    Any screen can be saved in any of three formats, (ASCII, memory, or
    packed), depending on the use of the screen.  ASCII format lets you save
    your screen so it can be edited by a word processor.
    
    Memory or packed format screens can be loaded directly and popped
    instantly on the monitor from a Pascal or C program.  This disk also
    contains all the source code routines that you need to incorporate BOX
    in your Turbo Pascal programs.

                         A Screen Capturing Utility
                          Hit ALT-PrtSc to activate


       GRAB.COM is a TSR screen-capturing utility that saves a copy of
       the current screen image in a BOX Memory format file.  GRAB is
       quite useful for creating demonstrations and training programs
       by capturing screens from operating programs.

       To use GRAB first load the program into memory by typing GRAB
       at the DOS prompt.  The program will write a short message on
       the screen confirming that it has been loaded.  After GRAB has
       been loaded into memory it will go to sleep and return you to
       the DOS prompt so that you may run any other program you wish.

       When you see a screen image that you want to capture, GRAB may
       be activated by hitting:

                            CTRL + ALT + G

       simultaneously.  GRAB will wake up, take a snapshot of the
       screen, and then write the screen image to the current disk
       drive and directory in a BOX Memory format.  The first file
       created by GRAB will be assigned the name BOX000.MEM.
       Subsequent files will named BOX001.MEM, BOX002.MEM and so on.

       Later you can load the screen images which have been saved with
       GRAB into the BOX editor and further modified.  Although GRAB
       only writes files in a Memory format you can easily modify the
       format by loading the file into BOX with a Memory format and
       saving the file with a ASCII or Packed format.
