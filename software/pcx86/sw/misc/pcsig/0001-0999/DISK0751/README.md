## Information about "ASEASYAS"

    ASEASYAS is an enhanced and refined spreadsheet program that supports
    256 columns and 8,192 rows.  It has a high degree of command
    compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3, lets you use Lotus files and includes a
    broad range of formulas and functions.
    
    Unlike many other spreadsheet programs, however, ASEASYAS can plot 11
    different types of graphs from within the program.  ASEASYAS is very
    easy to use because you enter commands through on-screen menus, unlike
    Lotus.  Other unique features include direct dBase III import/export,
    spreadsheet auditing, search and replace, macro record and playback,
    goalseeking, spreadsheet linking, and a full complement of macro
    commands.  There is also a linked calculation sequence that saves
    considerable time when recalculating.

         Published by TRIUS, Inc., P.O. BOX 249, N. Andover, MA 01845-
         1639, USA, Tel. (508) 794-9377. 
   
         This file provides information for the distribution of 
         shareware copies of AS-EASY-AS by Disk Vendors.   Please note 
         that our policy on distribution of AS-EASY-AS is the same for 
         both commercial vendors, non-profit user group libraries, and 
         educational institutions. 

         We require that you obtain written permission from us before 
         placing AS-EASY-AS in any user group or commercial library, 
         unless you have been approved by the Association of Shareware 
         Professionals and have notified us that you wish to distribute 
         AS-EASY-AS.  

         Please note that before we can send you a copy of AS-EASY-AS 
         and give you permission to distribute it, we require that you 
         meet one of the following two conditions: 

         1. Send us a copy of your standard written materials 
            (catalogs, flyers, ads, etc.) which clearly explain the 
            shareware concept, the need for users to register shareware 
            products they use, and the fact that the price of your 
            disks, that the user pays to you, is a copying fee ONLY and 
            does not constitute payment for the product.  The material 
            must also clearly differentiate between Shareware and 
            Public Domain software. 

            Note that it is not sufficient to tell us that you explain 
            these issues to customers in person, it must be clearly 
            reflected in your written materials. 


         2. Become an Approved Vendor of the Association of Shareware 
            Professionals (ASP).  For more information on the ASP 
            vendor program, contact the ASP at: 

                     Association of Shareware Professionals
                     Vendor Certification Committee
                     P.O. Box 5786
                     Bellevue, WA  98006


         If you have not already done so, we strongly recommend that 
         you become an ASP approved vendor.  The ASP vendor program 
         provides an important service for both authors and vendors, 
         and gives customers confidence that reasonable standards are 
         met in the distribution of shareware products. 

         We find it necessary to insist on meeting one of the two 
         conditions, stated above, in order to qualify for shareware 
         distribution of AS-EASY-AS, due to widespread confusion about 
         shareware in the marketplace, and the occasionally troublesome 
         practices of some vendors. We look forward to working with you 
         in the future.  Please feel free to contact us if you have any 
         questions or comments on our product or our policies. 

         You can contact us at any of the addresses below.  Please mail 
         materials to us at the P.O. Box address.
