fascinating. Some of these poems have actually been published in a national
magazine! Advanced version has larger vocabulary, creates poems up to 12
lines, includes haikus, and has options for personalized poems and printouts.

SIMPLE MONTHLY BILLING: ** COMING SOON **  This is a billing program
specifically designed for the small business with customers who are billed
for the same amount every month, such as gardeners, piano teachers, pool
services, membership organizations, etc. The program keeps track of the
monthly charge for each client, for up to three separate services, and also
allows insertion of "extra" charges outside the normal monthly fees. Designed
for the non-accountant, this simple, single-entry system posts the charges
each month, keeps track of each client's balance, prints statements and
simple reports. We plan to release this program in late 1990. Registration
fee and system requirements not yet determined.

NEWSLETTER: First-time registration includes a four-issue subscription to our
newsletter. Unregistered users or renewing readers may subscribe for $5/four

                             IMPORTANT INFORMATION

   All our "Unusual Software" products are sold as shareware. This is a "try
before you buy" system; you may use the trial version of a program for a
limited period (usually 2 to 3 weeks) to evaluate it. If you like the pro-
gram, you are expected to register your use by paying the registration fee.
As a registered user, you receive the most advanced version of the program.
Trial versions of our programs are distributed by most shareware disk
vendors, who generally charge between $1 and $8 per disk. (This fee is for
the distribution service only; it is not paid to us, and is not part of the
registration fee.) You may also obtain the trial version of any of our pro-
ducts by sending a double-sided, double-density 5 1/4" diskette in a sturdy,
reusable mailer with sufficient return postage (enough postage for a 4-ounce,
first-class letter for the first 1 or 2 disks; an additional first class
stamp for each subsequent disk. Send 3 disks for Creativity Package). If you
don't want to bother with disks and postage, send $5 for the trial version of
1 disk, $7 for 2, $8 for 3, and $1 for each additional disk. The trial
version is a fully-functioning program, but in some cases may lack some of
the extra features of the registered version. If you don't like the program,
you are free to erase it, or pass it on to someone else to try. Otherwise,
you can send in the fee and get the registered version. Of course, you may
register a program without going through the trial version first. In a few
cases, there are no additional features in the registered version, but you
still must register if you like and use the program. Registered users receive
support by mail, a newsletter with upgrade notifications, as well as special
discount and bonus offers.
   We distribute a limited selection of shareware and public domain programs
from other authors. The fee paid to us for these "Bonus Disks" is for our
copying and distribution service. It is not paid to the authors and is not
part of the registration fee. See the Bonus Disk section for details.
   Note that some programs are "ARCed". This means that in order to fit
several large files on a single disk, a special archiving (compressing)
process has been used. The files must be un-arced before use. We provide the
un-arcing program.
   Before ordering software, read the description carefully, and pay special
attention to the system requirements. Some programs require a hard disk,
graphics capability, or additional memory. As far as we know, our software
will run on most "IBM compatible" personal computers. However, since equip-
ment configurations vary greatly, we cannot guarantee correct results for
everyone. If you have a problem, please let us know.

                                   HOW TO ORDER:

REGISTRATION is $6 for Penname, $10 for Cliche Finder or Curses, $19 for
Crystal Ball. Registration for M-LABEL is $10 if you are a registered user of
MAILLIST, $39 if you are not. WORKBASE registration is $49. All other
programs are $29 each. MAILLIST and THUNDER THOUGHT (part of Creativity
Package) registrations include source code. Source code is NOT provided for
other programs. CURSES! registration includes a free bonus disk.

Take $5 off your registration if you send a double-sided, double-density
5 1/4" diskette in a sturdy, reusable mailer with sufficient return postage.
(For POETRY GENERATOR, send 2 disks.) Postage should be the same amount
needed for a 4-ounce, first-class letter for the first 1 or 2 disks, and an
additional first-class stamp for each subsequent disk. This discount does NOT
apply to CREATIVITY PACKAGE, MAILLIST, or programs with registration fees
less than $20, and is not to be combined with other discounts. If you want
the discount, don't skimp on the stamps! The disk mailer you send is the one
we will return to you.

If you are already a registered user of one or more products from our
"Unusual Software" catalog (not Bonus Disks), take $5 off your registration
of any new program. (Discount does not apply TO MAILLIST, CREATIVITY PACKAGE,
or programs with registration under $18, and may not be combined with any
other discount offer.)

BONUS DISKS: $3 for each disk. Add a $3 shipping fee to your total order.
(Shipping fee applies only when Bonus Disks are ordered.) This is not
registration, just a copying fee. Registration should be paid to the authors
of the programs.

FOREIGN ORDERS: Countries other than Canada, please add $4 for special
postage and handling. Unfortunately, we are unable to handle foreign funds.
Payment must be in U.S. dollars, payable through a U.S. bank. Canadian postal
money orders in U.S. funds are also acceptable.

RUSH ORDERS: We usually fill orders within 2 working days of receipt. How
long it takes the mail to travel between you and us is out of our hands. If
you feel that you MUST have your order right away, you can add $10 for
overnight mail (U.S.A. only).

3 1/5" DISKS: We normally provide 5 1/4" disks. If you must have 3 1/5"
disks, please include an extra $1.00 per disk. Under no circumstances will we
ship unregistered versions on 3 1/5" disks.

NOTE: Some users have reported compatibility problems with the utility used
to un-arc large files (this is rare). If you prefer to receive un-arced
programs, please include an extra $3 per disk to cover special handling and
materials.

All prices and discounts listed in this bulletin expire 6/30/90. We reserve
the right to change product descriptions, system requirements and other
information without notice.                                BONUS DISKS

We are not the authors of these programs, nor are we associated with the
authors in any way other than as a distributor of the programs in accordance
with the authors' terms of distribution. Some of these programs require a
shareware registration fee from satisfied users. Our $3.00 fee per disk is a
payment for copying and distributing the disks; it is not the registration
fee. Please direct shareware registration payments and specific questions
about these programs to the authors whose names appear in the documentation.

Most of the files on these disks have been archived in order to fit more
files on a single disk. Archiving creates a file with the extension ARC. The
ARC file may contain several related files. To use these files, you must
un-arc them. An un-archiving utility is included on each disk for your
convenience.

These programs have been tested, but due to the many possible hardware and
software configurations, we cannot guarantee that any program will run on any
particular system. We do not warrant these programs in any way. If we provide
you with an unreadable disk, you may return it for a replacement copy of the
same disk. Read the file descriptions carefully; some of these programs have
special requirements.

                              IMPORTANT NOTICE


The method of providing documentation and instructions for this program has
changed.

Instead of a text file which can be displayed and printed using DOS commands
or a word processor, the documentation is now in a special program file.

You can recognize the documentation program by its name, which includes the
extension COM. For example, if you have the program BY THE NUMBERS, the
documentation program is named NUMDOC.COM. To read the manual, you would
simply enter the command:    NUMDOC

When you are reading the documentation on screen, you can scroll through the
text using the up and down arrows or the page up and page down keys. You can
search for a word or phrase by pressing F and then entering the text you want
to find. You can print the document press pressing ALT-H.

ORACLE is useful both for people learning to use the ``I Ching'' or     
``Tarot'' cards, or for those who use them frequently and would like to 
spend less time counting sticks or shuffling oversized cards.  TAROT    
automatically goes through the procedure for ``Tarot'' card

procedures with the coin-toss and yarrow stick techniques.              
                                                                        
Both methods have an interactive and an automatic mode. See what the

Remarks:
      The drive and path names are optional. If omitted, the  current
      drive and path name is used.
      The filename must be  supplied. The extension defaults  to ARC.
      All files matching the supplied filename are processed. The ARC
      filename may contain the * and ? wildcard characters.
      If  no  filespecs  are   supplied,  all  files  are   extracted.
      Otherwise, only those ARC members  which match one of the  up to
      16 filespecs are extracted.
      The extracted files  may be placed  on another drive,  and/or in
      another subdirectory by following the optional filespecs with  a
      drive designator and/or path name.
      If  the  file  being  extracted  already  exists,  you are asked
      whether or not you want to over-write it. You may use the |  /R
      option to bypass this prompt. Use a Y followed by the |  return
      key to over-write the file.
      Use the /Q option to suppress alarm sounds, beeps, and bells.
      Use  the  /P  option  to  write  the  extracted files to the DOS
      standard output  file. With  /P, you  may pipe  or redirect the
      output. An initial line feed  is added to the beginning  of the
      output file.
      Use the /T option to test the archive's integrity. No files will
      be extracted.
      If the file was encrypted, use the /G option to supply the  same
      password as was used to create the file, e.g. /GSECRET.

                      Examples
                      --------
      o  Extract all file from TEST.ARC onto the current drive:
            ARCE TEST
      o  Extract only file with  an extension of .ASM from the archive
         SOURCE.ARC on drive B and in subdirectory SAVE:
            ARCE B:\SAVE\SOURCE *.ASM
      o  Extract  all  files  from  all  ARC files in the subdirectory
         called TEST on drive C:
            ARCE C:\TEST\*
      o  Extract  all  files  from  PROGA.ARC  and  place the files in
         subdirectory OLD on drive B:
            ARCE PROGA.ARC B:\OLD
      o  Extract all files with an extension of .COM and .EXE from the
         archive PROGS.ARC in directory NEW\WORK on drive B, and place
         the  them  in  subdirectory  SAVE\TEST  on  drive  A; replace
         existing file:
            ARCE B:\NEW\WORK\PROGS *.COM *.EXE A:\SAVE\TEST /R
      o  Extract  the  file  READ.ME  from  the  archive GIZMO.ARC and
         display it on the console instead of writing it to a file:
            ARCE GIZMO READ.ME /P
      o  Same as above, except  pass the extracted READ.ME file to the
         LIST file viewer:
            ARCE GIZMO READ.ME /P | LIST /S
                      Error Messages
                      --------------
    'filename - premature EOF reading '
      Data  is  missing  from  the  archive  file.  The  program   is
      terminated.
    'filename - unable to set file datestamp'
      The file datestamp is set to the current date and time, and  the
      next archive member is processed.
    'filename - WARNING: file CRC does not match!'
      The extracted member  is left on  the output disk,  and the next
      archive member is processed.  The file is probably  invalid but
      is left on the disk for your examination.
    'Invalid filespec(s)'
      The filespec syntax is incorrect. The filename part may be from
      1  to  eight  characters,  and  may  include the ? or * wildcard
      characters. The extension may be none to three characters,  and
      may  include  wildcards.  There  is  a  maximum of 16 filespecs
      allowed. The program terminates.
    'filename - file already exists. Overwrite it? (y/N) '
      The member being extracted already  exists. If you are using  a
      data  path  utility,  the  file  may  not  actually  be  in  the
      subdirectory be used for output.  Respond with the letter Y  to
      over-write the existing  file, or respond  with the letter  N to
      skip this member and continue to the next.
    'Abort: Stack overflow'
      The member  being extracted  has invalid  data. The  program is
      terminated.
    'filename - invalid decode tree count'
      The member  being extracted  has invalid  data. The  program is
      terminated.
    'filename - new archive format 7 not yet supported'
      Format 7 is a special file compression method used internally by
      SEA,  the  authors  of  ARC. Processing continues with the next
      archive member.
    'Unable to open archive > arcname'
      The  specified  ARC   archive  file  was   not  found,  or   was
      inaccessible. The program terminates.
    'CREATE failed > filename'
      There was insufficient directory  space, or a failure  accessing
      the output disk. The program terminates.
      'Invalid archive format!'
      The archive file data is invalid. The program terminates.
    'Incorrect DOS version'
      Version  2.0  or  later  of  PC  DOS  must be used. The program
      terminates
    'Not enough memory.'
      A minimum  of 112k  bytes of  memory is  required. The  program
      terminates.
    'I/O error reading from arcname'
      An incorrectable error occurred attempting to read data from the
      archive file. The program terminates.
    'I/O error writing or disk full > filename'
      There was not  enough disk space  to write the  complete archive
      member.  The  partially  extracted  file  is  scratched and the
      program terminates.
    'No matching file(s) found'
      No archive files were  found that matched the  supplied filename
      specifications. The program terminates.
    'filename - ERROR: invalid file codes'
      An error was detected while attempting to decode a crunched
      file. Either some data bytes are invalid, there are extra
      bytes, or there are bytes missing. The archive is invalid.

## FIX.DOC

{% raw %}
```
In some cases, when you try to run a program, you may see
an error message something like this:

Proc TAROT line 0, Open Error DESC3.NTX (4)

This is NOT caused by a bug in the program! If you see a
message with the words "open error" and the number 4, it
is DOS's cryptic way of telling you that you need to make
an adjustment in the CONFIG.SYS file in your root directory.

The CONFIG.SYS file should contain the following two lines:

     files=20
     buffers=20

(Some programs may require even larger numbers, which is
okay.)

If you aren't familiar with the CONFIG.SYS file, your DOS
manual should contain an explanation.
