## Information about "SOAR 1 OF 2 (ALSO 813)"

    SOAR (Service-Oriented Accounts Receivables) helps you simplify
    customer billing, generate meaningful management reports, and quickly
    get a snapshot of your business income and its sources. The program is
    menu-driven and easy to operate. Some of SOAR's major features include:
    
    ~  Simplified billing for businesses that provide services as well as
    products; three billing formats are supported -- two industry-standard
    general-purpose forms, as well as a "generic" form.
    
    ~  Charges based on fixed-item (inventory item), services, hourly
    rates, fixed-cost, or variable-cost.
    
    ~  Customers assigned a late-charge rate so you can give special
    treatment to good customers; automatic billing of customers with
    fixed-rate service or support contracts; customer inquiries are
    rapid and provide an instant history of the customer's activities.
    ~  Mailing lists are generated from the customer database and labels can
    be prepared for customers billed, all customers, active
    customers, inactive customers or customers with past-due balances.
    ~  A tax-exempt status for dealing with government agencies or
    wholesale transactions; taxable and non-taxable sales are automatically
    stored and reported.
    
    ~  22 categories to summarize your business activity.
    
    ~  Powerful reporting of specific areas of income; data files can be
    merged to have your business reported in quarters or other increments.
    ~  Easy identification of items or services that are profitable for your
    business.
    
    ~  Reports sorted by up to five keys to give you the specific
    information you need for your business and directing your areas of
    effort.
    
    SOAR does not teach accounting rules and assumes a certain level of
    expertise in accepted accounting procedures and protocols.
