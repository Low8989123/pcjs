## Information about "HANGMAN"

    HANGMAN is a game that enhances spelling and vocabulary. The program
    picks problems for you to solve from a diversified collection of data
    files.  The vocabulary of words and phrases is extensive, keeping things
    from getting boring through repetition.  You play against
    yourself, so at least you know the quality of the competition, although
    some players have been known to be surprised even then.

                            INSTRUCTIONS FOR "HANGMAN"
                            ------------ --- ---------


        SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

        HANGMAN requires a 128K or larger IBM Personal Computer with one
        disk drive and an 80-column display.


        STARTING THE GAME

        To begin playing the game, place your backup copy of HANGMAN into
        Drive A, then type HANGMAN to start the game.  The first
        message you will see on your screen describes how you can make a
        voluntary contribution to the author of the HANGMAN game.  If you
        have purchased this game directly from Norland Software or if you
        have already made a contribution to the author, please disregard
        this message.

        Now, press any key to begin the game.


        HOW TO USE THE MAIN MENU

        The main menu actually consists of two menus:  an 'Options Menu'
        and a 'Games Menu.'  As soon as these menus are displayed on your
        screen you can begin selecting the options you desire by pressing
        the letter which is shown in parentheses next to the option.  THE
        COMPUTER WILL NOT PROMPT YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE.

             Options Menu

             The menu on the bottom half of the screen lists various
             options for controlling musical sounds and the difficulty of
             the HANGMAN game:

                           (L) Level of Play - Amateur
                           (O) Orchestra is On Duty
                           (S) Sounds are Ready
                           (T) Time is Unimportant

             Press "L" to switch from Amateur to Expert or from Expert to
                       Amateur.
             Press "O" to turn the music on or off.
             Press "S" to turn other beeps and clicks on or off.
             Press "T" to turn the internal timer on or off.  With the
                       timer on ("Time is Running Out") you are only
                       allowed a short period of time to guess the hidden
                       word or phrase. The amount of time allowed is
                       constantly adjusted to match your skill at playing
                       the game.

             If you have not played HANGMAN before you should be sure to
             play at the "Amateur" skill level with the timer off ("Time is
             Unimportant"). In this mode the HANGMAN game will provide you
             with additional playing instructions at the beginning of each
             game.
             Games Menu

             The menu on the top half of the screen lists the various
             HANGMAN games available to you:

                           (A) Basic Hangman
                           (B) Educational Hangman
                           (C) Literate Hangman
                           (D) Personalized Hangman
                           (E) General Instructions

             To begin playing any of these games, press the letter which is
             shown in parentheses next to the name of the game.  If you
             have not played HANGMAN before, you should start by selecting
             the "General Instructions."


        PLAYING THE GAME

        Once you have selected one of the HANGMAN games the computer will
        set up the scaffolding for the Hangman and will display a blank
        line for the hidden word or phrase.  As soon as this blank line is
        displayed you can begin guessing the letters in the word or
        phrase:  Simply press the letter corresponding to your guess.  THE
        COMPUTER WILL NOT PROMPT YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE.

        Note that the following function keys (located on the left-hand
        side of your keyboard) are active at all times during the game:

             Press "F1"  to select a new word or phrase.
             Press "F2"  to display the hidden word or phrase.
             Press "F10" to exit to the main menu.


        NOTE:  HANGMAN uses files on the HANGMAN disk throughout the game.
               DO NOT remove the HANGMAN disk or open the door to the disk
               drive at any time while playing HANGMAN.


        On some computers the HANGMAN screens are difficult to read.  If 
        you encounter this problem, press 'M' at the Main Menu to switch 
        to a monochrome display.  If this procedure corrects the problem,
        press 'Ctrl-S' at the Main Menu to store monochrome as your
        display type.


        NOTICE

        Users may copy HANGMAN and distribute it for trial use by others on
        a private, non-commercial basis.  The following conditions apply:

          1.  The programs and data files are not modified in any way.
          2.  Programs and data files are not distributed separately.
          3.  No fee is charged for copying or distribution.

        If you have any questions, suggestions or criticisms, send your
        comments to NORLAND SOFTWARE.

 SLEUTH is an interactive murder mystery.  As a game of SLEUTH begins, a murder
 has just been committed.  It is your job to explore the house (which is
 displayed on the screen), to question the houseguests for their alibis, and to
 locate both the murder weapon and the scene of the murder.  The challenge of
 SLEUTH is to solve the crime, gather all of the suspects together, and accuse
 the guilty party before the killer gets suspicious of your investigation and
 eliminates you from the game.  Each game of SLEUTH is different from the last,
 so you must always explore the house fully before you can solve the murder.
 Also, to make things more interesting, you can choose a 'Personalized' option
 which allows you to populate the house with your friends and acquaintances.
 Price: $15.


 HANGMAN for the SUPERINTELLIGENT.  The traditional Hangman game with a few
 twists.  This game provides four levels of play:
 1) Basic Hangman provides you with a secret word which you must guess by
    selecting letters of the alphabet.  Your only clue is that you know in
    advance how many letters are in the word.
 2) Educational Hangman.  In this variation of Hangman you no longer know the
    number of letters in the word.  Your only clue is a brief definition of the
    word which is displayed on the screen.  Ideal for building your vocabulary.
 3) Literate Hangman is stocked with famous sayings and quotations from
    throughout the ages.  Your only clue is the author of the phrase.
 4) Personalized Hangman.  If you are playing Hangman with two or more players
    you can select your own words and phrases to try to stump your friends.
 HANGMAN for the SUPERINTELLIGENT is stocked with over 1000 words and phrases
 selected to provide a challenge for accomplished players.  This game is
 definitely not for children.  Price: $15.


 FOREIGN LANGUAGE HANGMAN.  This version of HANGMAN allows you to practice
 your knowledge of a foreign language.  Words and phrases can be presented
 either in English or in foreign translation (with clues provided in the
 opposite language).  Currently available with Spanish and French vocabularies.
 Be sure to specify the language desired when ordering. Price: $15.


 CUSTOMIZED HANGMAN.  You can create your own customized version of HANGMAN by
 using this utility program which allows you to enter your own words or phrases
 for use by the HANGMAN program.  Please specify whether you need the utility
 program for English Language Hangman (HANGMAN for the SUPERINTELLIGENT;
 BASIC HANGMAN) or the utility program for Foreign Language Hangman (FRENCH
 HANGMAN; SPANISH HANGMAN).  Price: $15.


 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL GAMES:  80-column display, one disk drive, 
 128K of memory.
