## Information about "WALMYR PROGRAMS 1 OF 2 (ALSO 649)"

    This disk has three demonstration programs. The WALMYR DISK PROTECTOR
    can prevent unauthorized peolple from gaining access to your computer.
    Upon boot-up, the program will ask for the password. After three
    incorrect attempts, the program sounds an alarm and prompts the user to
    turn off the computer. The program is not fool-proof, but is designed
    to keep out casual intruders. This demo of the program lists the
    password on the opening screen, but it is removed upon registration.
    WALMYR PEN PAL lets you conduct private communications with another
    person. It can administer questionnaires and interviews, as well as
    handle letters. The full version encrypts all correspondence, but in
    this demo any person can read all the text files. WALMYR BOOK
    MAKER lets you integrate separate ASCII text files into one formatted
    and consistently-paged document. In the full version of the program,
    the size of the printed document is unlimited. The demo version of this
    program is limited to 25 pages.
    
    The WALMYR TEACHING ASSISTANT is for teachers, designed to automate
    test taking and grading, and thus reduce the amount of time it takes to
    prepare a course. It can prepare random quizzes from a pool of
    questions, administer quizzes, and grade each quiz for each student.
    You only need write the quiz once, and after that the program takes
    over. You can specify the number of times the students may retake a
    quiz. The program can prepare final grade reports, let students check
    their grades, and print graphs of test scores. It can also display and
    print text files, such as lecture notes, course syllabuses, notices,
    etc. The teacher has a master disk from which the course format is
    designed, while each student's record is kept on his own individual
    disk. Grades are collected by having the students turn in their disk
    after a number of exams or quizzes are completed. The master disk takes
    all data and updates the teacher's records. All records are password-
    protected, so a student's records can only be examined by the
    teacher and that student.
    
    The WALMYR INDEX OF TEACHING ABILITY analyzes a group of students'
    evaluations of the teacher's performance, based upon a questionnaire
    that comes with the program. It produces both an actual and adjusted
    report. The adjusted report is produced after the program eliminates
    students who scored lower or higher than the class average, both on an
    item as well as on a total-score basis. The program provides a report
    that shows the mean, range, and standard deviation, a count of students
    who graded higher or lower than normal, a count of total students who
    rated the course, and an estimate of how consistent the data is.
    
    System Requirements: A modem is required for WALMYR PEN PAL and a
    printer is optional for WALMYR BOOK MAKER.
    
    How to Start: Type README (press enter).
    
    Suggested Registration: $25.00 for DISK PROTECTOR, $30.00 for PEN PAL,
    and $50.00 for BOOK MAKER.

                   MAKE A DEMONSTRATION VERSION


  If you would like a friend or colleague to have a demonstration 
version of the program, you can prepare one very easily.   First,
format a blank floppy diskette.  Then copy your entire Book Maker
diskette  onto  the blank floppy.  Put away your copy of the Book
Maker diskette and put the copy for your friend in Drive A.  Once
you do that, issue the commands,

     A: <cr>
     MAKEDEMO <cr>

and  you will instantly have a demonstration copy of the program. 
Please DO NOT issue the MAKEDEMO command when using your copy  of
the  program.   If  you do, you will turn it into a demonstration
copy of the program!

                           CHAPTER  5

                      A BOOK MAKER EXAMPLE 


  This chapter of the User's Manual provides a  complete  example
to  show  you how to produce a document.  The example consists of 
the program's own User's Manual.  The MANAGER file, as  explained
earlier,  contains  the  names  of all the files that you want to 
print and lists them in the order that they are  to  be  printed.
The  following  lines  contain the entire contents of the MANAGER
file that is used to print the User's Manual.


THE MANAGER FILE FOR THE USER'S MANUAL

     titlepg.txt
     contents.txt
     preface.txt
     intro.txt
     format.txt
     pages.txt
     manager.txt
     example.txt
     demo_ver.txt

  Each of the files shown above are the ordinary ASCII text files
that comprise the separate chapters of the User's Manual.  If you 
wish, you may use your own word processor  to  pull  them  up  on
screen and examine them.


PRINTING YOUR OWN USER'S MANUAL

  If  you would like to print a copy of the User's Manual, choose 
Option B from the main menu of the program.  When you  are  asked
to  indicate  the  DRIVE\PATH  where your MANAGER file is stored, 
indicate the default DRIVE\PATH that you are using.  Here  are  a
couple of examples. 

  If you are logged onto Drive A while  running  the  Book  Maker
program,  you  should  enter  the  following command when you are
asked to enter the DRIVE\PATH for the MANAGER file. 

     A: <cr>

  If you have created a hard disk directory for the  program  and
you have defined it as C:\BM, then you should enter the following
command  when  you  are  asked  to  enter  the DRIVE\PATH for the
MANAGER file. 

     \BM <cr>

  When  you  are  asked  for  the beginning page number, enter 0. 
Also, please use a left margin of 8 spaces.  That's all there  is
to it.  You may print your own User's Manual any time you wish.

                             CHAPTER 2

                  FORMATTING YOUR ASCII TEXT FILES


  There  are  some  specific formatting rules that the Book Maker 
program follows.  They are rigid  but  quite  tolerable,  so  you
should  make sure that your text files conform to them.  The Book
Maker formatting rules are explained as follows.

  The  first  thing  you  should know is that Book Maker does not
format or modify any of your text.  It formats pages only.  Thus, 
the ASCII text image on your disk medium is the text  image  that
will be printed.  If your text is stored on disk as single-spaced
lines,  for  example,  then Book Maker will print a single-spaced
document.


PAGINATION

  When  you  print  an  ASCII  text  file using this program, you 
should know that every file begins on a new page.  The file  that
you wish to print can be any length but it will always begin on a
new page.


LINE LENGTH  

  The  Book  Maker  program will print up to 90 characters on any 
line.  However, it also provides a left margin that you  specify.
Thus,  your  lines could run off the page if you do not attend to
this matter.   

  We suggest that you use a left margin of eight  characters  and
make  sure  your  text  files  contain lines that never exceed 69 
characters if your printer is configured to print  10  characters
per  inch  (Pica).   That  way,  you  will have a nicely centered 
document that will have an eight character margin on  each  side.
Of  course, if you use lines of 70 characters you'll still have a
really neat document.  

  If your printer is configured to print 12 characters  per  inch
(Elite),  we  suggest that you use a left margin of 10 characters 
and that your text files  contain  lines  that  never  exceed  82
characters.   One  or two characters, more or less, won't matter,
but these figures are the ones used by the Book Maker. 

  The thing to remember is that Book Maker  ALWAYS  uses  a  left
margin  that your specify and it ALWAYS prints the characters per 
inch that is  dictated  by  the  way  you  have  configured  your
printer.


NUMBER OF LINES PER PAGE 

  The  Book  Maker  has two options for determining the number of 
text lines that will be printed per page.  If you  indicate  that
your printer is configured to print 6 lines per inch (Pica), then
Book Maker will print no more than 50 lines of text per page.  If
you indicate that your printer is configured to print 8 lines per
inch  (Elite),  then  Book Maker will print no more than 67 lines 
per page.  The program will ask you to indicate whether  you  are
using Pica or Elite when you begin to print a document.

                            CHAPTER 1

                      THE WALMYR BOOK MAKER


  The  WALMYR  Book  Maker  is  a  powerful  utility program that 
enables you to print small, large,  very  large,  or  truly  huge
manuals,  monographs,  or  books  by  collecting and printing any
number of ASCII text files as a single integrated volume.  If you 
have ever had a number of different ASCII  text  files  that  you
wanted  to  gather  together  and then merge into a single nicely 
formatted and consistently paginated document,  then  the  WALMYR
Book Maker may be the solution to your problems. 

  Book Maker is truly powerful.  The size of volume that you  may
produce  is  limited  only  by  the  physical  capacity  of  your
equipment and you can even overcome that limitation!  Thus, there 
is no theoretical limit to the size of a single printed  book  or
volume that you can produce with the program.

  If  you  have  a hard disk system, you can easily store a large 
number of ASCII text files on your hard disk and then  print  all
of  them  as  a  single job.  If you prefer, you can simply store
truly huge jobs on separate floppy diskettes and print the entire
job in separate runs.  And, you can have as many diskettes as you
like!  There is no limit! 



                  USING THE BOOK MAKER PROGRAM

  In  order  to use the Book Maker program, you need only put the 
program diskette in Drive A, log onto that drive and  then  issue
the  command,  BM <cr>.  When you do that, the program configures 
itself automatically to your computer  system.   If  you  have  a
color/graphics  board  in  your  computer,  it  will  ask  you to
indicate whether you are using a color monitor. 

  After your computer whirrs  and  chugs  a  little,  the  Master
Screen  for  the program will appear and you will see the program 
menu.  At that point you may choose Option  A  to  examine  these
instructions, or you may choose Option B to print a document.

  If  you  choose  Option B, the program will ask you to indicate 
whether your printer is configured for Pica  or  Elite  printing,
and  it  will  then ask you to indicate the DRIVE\PATH where your 
files are stored.  Once you have provided that  information,  the
program will ask you to indicate whether you are using continuous
or single-feed paper.  It will then begin printing your document,
and that's all there is to actually running the program.

  However,  you  do  have  to  perform  some  setup chores before 
actually printing a  document.   The  remainder  of  this  User's
Manual explains each one of them and describes how you can manage
your text files to get the most out of the program.

  Actually,  the  manual is much larger that it needs to be (it's 
not very large either), but we extended it a little to use it  as
an  example.   The  program  prints its own manual and the User's
Manual is treated as an example for using the program.

                           CHAPTER 4

                        THE FILE MANAGER


  In  order  to  use  this  program, you must create a file named 
MANAGER which will contain the names of the files that  you  want
printed.   The  MANAGER file and all the files to be printed must
reside on the same DRIVE\PATH. 


HEADER INFORMATION

  When  you  prepare your MANAGER file you must reserve the first 
two lines for header information that you may wish to  use.   The
two  header  lines may contain 60 or fewer characters or they may 
be left blank.  If you do not want to use a header, be  sure  the
first two lines each contain at least one blank character.

  Your  two header lines will be printed at the top of every page
in a 'header space' of your document.


LISTING FILE NAMES

  Once you have created your header lines, you must then list all
the  files  that  you want printed. YOUR FILES WILL BE PRINTED IN 
THE ORDER LISTED.

  You can get pretty slick about this.  For  example,  you  could
prepare  a file named TITLEPG.TXT and show that as the first file 
in your MANAGER  file.   You  could  then  create  a  file  named
CONTENTS.TXT  and  place  it  as  the second file in your MANAGER 
file.  By doing that, your document will have a  title  page  and
table of contents designed to suit your needs or purposes.

```




                            CHAPTER 3

                      HANDLING PAGE NUMBERS


  When  you  execute  the  program,  it will ask you to enter the 
beginning page number.  You may enter a 0 if you do not want  the
first page to have a page number.  All subsequent pages will then
be  numbered  from 1 to N.  If you enter any other beginning page
number, k, all pages will be numbered from k to N. 

  This feature makes it possible to run truly large  jobs  during
separate  computer  sessions.   You could, for example, print the
first part of a volume containing pages 0 to 537.  Then you could 
later print the remainder of  the  job  by  beginning  with  page
number 538.

                   MAKE A DEMONSTRATION VERSION


  If you would like a friend or colleague to have a demonstration 
version of the program, you can prepare one very easily.   First,
format a blank floppy diskette.  Then copy your entire Book Maker
diskette  onto  the blank floppy.  Put away your copy of the Book
Maker diskette and put the copy for your friend in Drive A.  Once
you do that, issue the commands,

     A: <cr>
     MAKEDEMO <cr>

and  you will instantly have a demonstration copy of the program. 
Please DO NOT issue the MAKEDEMO command when using your copy  of
the  program.   If  you do, you will turn it into a demonstration
copy of the program!

                      A BOOK MAKER EXAMPLE 


  This chapter of the User's Manual provides a  complete  example
to  show  you how to produce a document.  The example consists of 
the program's own User's Manual.  The MANAGER file, as  explained
earlier,  contains  the  names  of all the files that you want to 
print and lists them in the order that they are  to  be  printed.
The  following  lines  contain the entire contents of the MANAGER
file that is used to print the User's Manual.


THE MANAGER FILE FOR THE USER'S MANUAL

     titlepg.txt
     contents.txt
     preface.txt
     intro.txt
     format.txt
     pages.txt
     manager.txt
     example.txt
     demo_ver.txt

  Each of the files shown above are the ordinary ASCII text files
that comprise the separate chapters of the User's Manual.  If you 
wish, you may use your own word processor  to  pull  them  up  on
screen and examine them.


PRINTING YOUR OWN USER'S MANUAL

  If  you would like to print a copy of the User's Manual, choose 
Option B from the main menu of the program.  When you  are  asked
to  indicate  the  DRIVE\PATH  where your MANAGER file is stored, 
indicate the default DRIVE\PATH that you are using.  Here  are  a
couple of examples. 

  If you are logged onto Drive A while  running  the  Book  Maker
program,  you  should  enter  the  following command when you are
asked to enter the DRIVE\PATH for the MANAGER file. 

     A: <cr>

  If you have created a hard disk directory for the  program  and
you have defined it as C:\BM, then you should enter the following
command  when  you  are  asked  to  enter  the DRIVE\PATH for the
MANAGER file. 

     \BM <cr>

  When  you  are  asked  for  the beginning page number, enter 0. 
Also, please use a left margin of 8 spaces.  That's all there  is
to it.  You may print your own User's Manual any time you wish.

the ASCII text image on your disk medium is the text  image  that
will be printed.  If your text is stored on disk as single-spaced
lines,  for  example,  then Book Maker will print a single-spaced
document.


PAGINATION

  When  you  print  an  ASCII  text  file using this program, you 
should know that every file begins on a new page.  The file  that
you wish to print can be any length but it will always begin on a
new page.


LINE LENGTH  

  The  Book  Maker  program will print up to 90 characters on any 
line.  However, it also provides a left margin that you  specify.
Thus,  your  lines could run off the page if you do not attend to
this matter.   

  We suggest that you use a left margin of eight  characters  and
make  sure  your  text  files  contain lines that never exceed 69 
characters if your printer is configured to print  10  characters
per  inch  (Pica).   That  way,  you  will have a nicely centered 
document that will have an eight character margin on  each  side.
Of  course, if you use lines of 70 characters you'll still have a
really neat document.  

  If your printer is configured to print 12 characters  per  inch
(Elite),  we  suggest that you use a left margin of 10 characters 
and that your text files  contain  lines  that  never  exceed  82
characters.   One  or two characters, more or less, won't matter,
but these figures are the ones used by the Book Maker. 

  The thing to remember is that Book Maker  ALWAYS  uses  a  left
margin  that your specify and it ALWAYS prints the characters per 
inch that is  dictated  by  the  way  you  have  configured  your
printer.


NUMBER OF LINES PER PAGE 

  The  Book  Maker  has two options for determining the number of 
text lines that will be printed per page.  If you  indicate  that
your printer is configured to print 6 lines per inch (Pica), then
Book Maker will print no more than 50 lines of text per page.  If
you indicate that your printer is configured to print 8 lines per
inch  (Elite),  then  Book Maker will print no more than 67 lines 
per page.  The program will ask you to indicate whether  you  are
using Pica or Elite when you begin to print a document.

                            CHAPTER 1

                      THE WALMYR BOOK MAKER


  The  WALMYR  Book  Maker  is  a  powerful  utility program that 
enables you to print small, large,  very  large,  or  truly  huge
manuals,  monographs,  or  books  by  collecting and printing any
number of ASCII text files as a single integrated volume.  If you 
have ever had a number of different ASCII  text  files  that  you
wanted  to  gather  together  and then merge into a single nicely 
formatted and consistently paginated document,  then  the  WALMYR
Book Maker may be the solution to your problems. 

  Book Maker is truly powerful.  The size of volume that you  may
produce  is  limited  only  by  the  physical  capacity  of  your
equipment and you can even overcome that limitation!  Thus, there 
is no theoretical limit to the size of a single printed  book  or
volume that you can produce with the program.

  If  you  have  a hard disk system, you can easily store a large 
number of ASCII text files on your hard disk and then  print  all
of  them  as  a  single job.  If you prefer, you can simply store
truly huge jobs on separate floppy diskettes and print the entire
job in separate runs.  And, you can have as many diskettes as you
like!  There is no limit! 



                  USING THE BOOK MAKER PROGRAM

  In  order  to use the Book Maker program, you need only put the 
program diskette in Drive A, log onto that drive and  then  issue
the  command,  BM <cr>.  When you do that, the program configures 
itself automatically to your computer  system.   If  you  have  a
color/graphics  board  in  your  computer,  it  will  ask  you to
indicate whether you are using a color monitor. 

  After your computer whirrs  and  chugs  a  little,  the  Master
Screen  for  the program will appear and you will see the program 
menu.  At that point you may choose Option  A  to  examine  these
instructions, or you may choose Option B to print a document.

  If  you  choose  Option B, the program will ask you to indicate 
whether your printer is configured for Pica  or  Elite  printing,
and  it  will  then ask you to indicate the DRIVE\PATH where your 
files are stored.  Once you have provided that  information,  the
program will ask you to indicate whether you are using continuous
or single-feed paper.  It will then begin printing your document,
and that's all there is to actually running the program.

  However,  you  do  have  to  perform  some  setup chores before 
actually printing a  document.   The  remainder  of  this  User's
Manual explains each one of them and describes how you can manage
your text files to get the most out of the program.

  Actually,  the  manual is much larger that it needs to be (it's 
not very large either), but we extended it a little to use it  as
an  example.   The  program  prints its own manual and the User's
Manual is treated as an example for using the program.

                           CHAPTER 4

                        THE FILE MANAGER


  In  order  to  use  this  program, you must create a file named 
MANAGER which will contain the names of the files that  you  want
printed.   The  MANAGER file and all the files to be printed must
reside on the same DRIVE\PATH. 


HEADER INFORMATION

  When  you  prepare your MANAGER file you must reserve the first 
two lines for header information that you may wish to  use.   The
two  header  lines may contain 60 or fewer characters or they may 
be left blank.  If you do not want to use a header, be  sure  the
first two lines each contain at least one blank character.

  Your  two header lines will be printed at the top of every page
in a 'header space' of your document.


LISTING FILE NAMES

  Once you have created your header lines, you must then list all
the  files  that  you want printed. YOUR FILES WILL BE PRINTED IN 
THE ORDER LISTED.

  You can get pretty slick about this.  For  example,  you  could
prepare  a file named TITLEPG.TXT and show that as the first file 
in your MANAGER  file.   You  could  then  create  a  file  named
CONTENTS.TXT  and  place  it  as  the second file in your MANAGER 
file.  By doing that, your document will have a  title  page  and
table of contents designed to suit your needs or purposes.

                            CHAPTER 3

                      HANDLING PAGE NUMBERS


  When  you  execute  the  program,  it will ask you to enter the 
beginning page number.  You may enter a 0 if you do not want  the
first page to have a page number.  All subsequent pages will then
be  numbered  from 1 to N.  If you enter any other beginning page
number, k, all pages will be numbered from k to N. 

  This feature makes it possible to run truly large  jobs  during
separate  computer  sessions.   You could, for example, print the
first part of a volume containing pages 0 to 537.  Then you could 
later print the remainder of  the  job  by  beginning  with  page
number 538.
