## Information about "PROGRAMMING INTRO"

    This is a handy and interesting tool for getting acquainted with the
    world of microcomputers and programming.
    
    It has an easily-understood tutorial on computers and does a good job on
    BASIC -- introducing the beginner to the elemental concepts of the
    language.  A big plus is a series of practice sessions so you can
    actually see the programs operate!
    
    A set of simple games are included that will engage you in a lot of
    keyboard practice.  They include a simple word processor and several
    number games as well as varying levels of anagrams.

230 PRINT "                          2.  To count numbers, forward or backwards
240 PRINT "                          3.  To PRINT mulitple STRING data
250 PRINT
260 PRINT "             We'll look at all of these individually and show how FOR/NEXT
270 PRINT "             can be used to 'dress up' a program and save programming
280 PRINT "             time.
290 PRINT
300 PRINT "             But first, how it works.....  FOR/NEXT is actually two
310 PRINT "             statements (on their own lines).  We use FOR/NEXT
320 PRINT "             to create a controlled loop.  A controlled loop consists
330 PRINT "             of a starting point and specified goal (the FOR part of
340 PRINT "             the statement), and the signal to continue and ultimately
350 PRINT "             end the loop (the NEXT part of the statement).  And,
360 PRINT "             depending on the particular use, there can be another
370 PRINT "             statement in between FOR and NEXT that is executed as
380 PRINT "             many times as is indicated in the FOR part. 
390 PRINT
400 PRINT "             Before total confusion sets in, let's have a look at how
410 PRINT "             FOR/NEXT is set up for each of the three uses listed above.

470 PRINT
480 PRINT "          What is meant by DELAY is a pause or interuption in the
490 PRINT "          program where evrything comes to a complete halt.  This is
500 PRINT "          the purest form of FOR/NEXT where the computer is instructed
510 PRINT "          to cease operation while it counts to itself to a specified

570 PRINT "          In line 10, the computer sets the scene to count from 1 to
580 PRINT "          2000.  Notice that we have a modified use of LET, where 'A'
590 PRINT "          is being used to store the numbers 1 through 2000.
600 PRINT
610 PRINT "          In line 20, the computer is instructed to get the NEXT 'A'
620 PRINT "          to be found back in line 10.  Thus, the loop begins.
630 PRINT
640 PRINT "          When the computer has registered all of the numbers (counted
650 PRINT "          to 2000), there is no 'NEXT A', as they have all been used up.
660 PRINT "          So, the computer moves on to the next line in the program or

390 PRINT "       write a program that would allow the user to look at the
400 PRINT "       instructions at any time and from any point in the program.
410 PRINT

300 PRINT "             But first, how it works.....  FOR/NEXT is actually two
310 PRINT "             statements (on their own lines).  We use FOR/NEXT
320 PRINT "             to create a controlled loop.  A controlled loop consists
330 PRINT "             of a starting point and specified goal (the FOR part of
340 PRINT "             the statement), and the signal to continue and ultimately
350 PRINT "             end the loop (the NEXT part of the statement).  And,
360 PRINT "             depending on the particular use, there can be another
370 PRINT "             statement in between FOR and NEXT that is executed as
380 PRINT "             many times as is indicated in the FOR part.

500 PRINT "          the purest form of FOR/NEXT where the computer is instructed

610 PRINT "          In line 20, the computer is instructed to get the NEXT 'A'
620 PRINT "          to be found back in line 10.  Thus, the loop begins.
630 PRINT
640 PRINT "          When the computer has registered all of the numbers (counted
650 PRINT "          to 2000), there is no 'NEXT A', as they have all been used up.

390 PRINT "       write a program that would allow the user to look at the
400 PRINT "       instructions at any time and from any point in the program.
410 PRINT
