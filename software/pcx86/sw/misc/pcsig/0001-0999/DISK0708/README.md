## Information about "BACKGAMMON AND MORE"

    Norsoft FOREIGN LANGUAGE HANGMAN is an excellent educational program for
    learning Spanish, or for learning English for people who speak Spanish.
    While being educational, this program is very entertaining.  It includes
    three variations on the basic Hangman game.  The first is guessing what
    the secret word is, while in the second version you must guess an entire
    phrase.  The last is Personalized Hangman, which can be played by two to
    nine players who enter a word or phrase to try to stump the others.
    This program is quite useful for building up your vocabulary or for
    learning basic grammar.
    
    BACKGAMMON is finally here for your PC!  Now you can play against a
    strong opponent on your own computer.  If you've never played before, or
    you're the champion of your local club, BACKGAMMON will fill the role of
    instant opponent.  For the true afficionado, the program keeps track of
    points, games, gammons, and backgammons.

WHAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING ABOUT BACKGAMMON

"The backgammon game is the best one we've seen in years.  The playing
style is straightforward..."
   -- PC-SIG Magazine, Sunnyvale, California

"Backgammon is currently leading our ongoing struggle 176 games to 138
games.  His prowness seems largely due to his expert handling of the
doubles cube."
   -- Rancho La Costa, California

"...The author warns you to expect to get crushed, but in a test game,
we won by a roll or two and we are not experts by any means..."
   -- Nelson Ford, The Public (Software) Library, Houston, Texas

"All in all, the program makes a fierce competitor."
   -- Glasgow, Kentucky

                     NEW FEATURES WITH BACKGAMMON V3.00
                             Software Creations


Software Creations would like to extend thanks again to all you users
who have made financial contributions and have made Backgammon Version
3.00 possible.  We would also like to thank all of you users who have
sent in your suggestions for improvements to Backgammon.  Remember, if
you write to us, include a stamped, self-addressed envelope as we'd like
the opportunity to respond to your suggestions and questions. 

With this release we want to show off our new Backgammon board, which is
more colorful draws the pieces more neatly.

This release also fixes a deeply hidden bug in our white move generator. 
Believe us, we got lots of mail about our Backgammon cheating when
moving 6's in the endgame!!  Thanks to those alert users who caught us
sonambulating and completed those really clear Software Problem Reports. 

Tenkey pad users, accountants especially, will be very pleased to know
that when moving pieces the delimiter character for moves can now be a
decimal point as well as a space.  This allows for faster input for
those who are fast at tenkey pad entry.  The space also works as with
previous versions. 

This release also features a complete internal restructuring in the
program itself.  Software Creations has thus laid the foundation for a
Championship-strength Backgammon game in the future.  We'd like to know,
however, is there any interest out there for an even stronger version of
Backgammon?  We have the capabilities of doing so, but currently it
keeps blowing us away!

     Wheel of Fortune is a simulation of the popular television game show of
the same name.

Getting Started:
1. Load both DOS and Cartridge BASIC.
2. Press ENTER twice for the date and time.
3. Type BASIC and press ENTER.
4. Type RUN "WHEEL" and press ENTER.

Object:  To solve the puzzle and obtain the maximum amount of money while doing
         so.

There are 3 rounds in Wheel of Fortune (not including the Bonus Round).  Each
player takes a turn in order from the smallest to largest number which they are
assigned to by all the players.  In each turn a player may do one of the 
following:
    1. solve the puzzle
    2. buy a vowel
    3. spin the wheel and guess a letter
You can always tell whose turn it is by looking at the top of the scoreboard
which is just above the puzzle.

The Puzzle:  is composed of a series of dashes which represent the unknown 
             letters.  The players may guess what a letter in the puzzle may be
             on their turn after they've spun the wheel.  They can do this by
             simply pressing the letter they want on the keyboard (only after
             they spin the wheel!).  The money value on the wheel is only
             given to the player if the player guesses a letter correctly.  The
             category of each puzzle is given underneath the puzzle.  If the 
             letter is correct the letter appears in the puzzle, the money is
             added to the player's score, and the player gets another turn.  If
             the player is incorrect the player receives no money, loses his or
             her turn, and the incorrect letter is displayed at the top of the 
             screen.

The Wheel:  is spun each turn unless the player buys a vowel or solves the 
            puzzle.  This is done by pressing the number 2.  There are only 
            three places on the wheel that do not contain money values.  These
            three spaces could be any one of the following:
                  1. Free Spin
                  2. Loose A Turn
                  3. Bankrupt
            Free spin gives the player an extra spin in case the player guesses
            a wrong letter, gets Bankrupt, or gets Loose A Turn.  A player may
            see how many free spins each player has by pressing the number 3.
            Loose a Turn ends the player's turn but does not effect the player's
            money in any way.
            Bankrupt ends the player's turn and also takes all the money the 
            player has won that round.

Buying A Vowel:  this is done by pressing the vowel on the keyboard before
                 spinning the wheel.  You must have $250 to buy a vowel.

Solving The Puzzle:  you must press the number 1 before spinning the wheel to do
                     this.  Then you can enter the answer.  If it is correct,
                     the player gets all the money he won that round added to
                     his overall winnings.  If it is incorrect, the round 
                     continues and the player looses his or her turn.

The Bonus Round:  the winner of the three rounds goes on to this and a chance of
                  winning $25,000.  He must choose five consonants and a vowel.
                  These letters show up in the puzzle and the person must guess
                  the puzzle immediatley.  If you get it right you win $25,000
                  and are asked if you want to play again.  If not, better luck
                  next time!
