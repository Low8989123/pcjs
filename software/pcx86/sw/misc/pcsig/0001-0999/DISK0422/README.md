## Information about "SCREENWRIGHT PROFESSIONAL"

    SCREENWRIGHT PROFESSIONAL is a complete word processing program
    specifically designed for the creation of screenplays and teleplays.
    Special care has been taken to keep SCREENWRIGHT PROFESSIONAL simple to
    use, so you can concentrate on your writing instead of on a stack of
    computer manuals.  SCREENWRIGHT PROFESSIONAL is the first complete word
    processor for film and television writers. It includes both a complete
    text editor and formatter, so no other software is needed. If you have
    ever tried to use a regular word processing program to generate this
    very complex format, you'll really appreciate this one.
    
    Other programs on this disk include TURBO SCRIPT, a word processor
    designed specifically for the 128K PCjr, along with a host of assorted
    text-processing utilities that can count words, help create indexes,
    and convert Displaywrite files to ASCII text format.
    
    Special Requirements: None.
    
    How to Start:  Type GO (press enter).
    
    Suggested Registration: $10.00 for every piece you get published using
    ScreenWright!

macro is called the "scrap". Whenever a new macro
is recorded, it writes over the scrap macro. The
current scrap macro can be played back once or
many times using other macro commands.

&GET INFORMATION

    Keystroke sequence:   104
)    Alternate keystrokes: 104

Various facts about ScreenWright and the current
file are displayed. Information shown includes
the complete path name of the current file; its
size in bytes, words, lines, and pages; whether
it has been modified since last disk save; the
time and date; available RAM and disk space; the
current directory; and the DOS and ScreenWright
version numbers.

Some of the statistics that ScreenWright presents
take a while to compute. By pressing any key while
the Get Info window is being updated, you can
"short-circuit" the computation of some items.
@106

&TOGGLE INSERT MODE

    Keystroke sequence:   106
)    Alternate keystrokes: 106

When insert mode is active, newly typed text is
inserted into the current text line, pushing
characters to the right of the cursor aside to
make room. When insert mode is off, newly typed
text overwrites existing text. Many commands,
such as block copy and insert line, operate in
insert mode independent of the setting of this
toggle.
@107

&TOGGLE AUTOINDENT MODE

    Keystroke sequence:   107
)    Alternate keystrokes: 107

When autoindent mode is active and the <Enter>
key is pressed, the new line of text will be
indented the same number of spaces as the line
immediately above it. The setting of this toggle
also affects the operation of the paragraph
reformatting command.
@108

&TOGGLE CASE

    Keystroke sequence:   108
)    Alternate keystrokes: 108

The case of the character at the cursor location
will be toggled from upper to lower, or from
lower to upper. If a block is marked and visible,
and the cursor is anywhere within the marked
block, the command will toggle the case of the
entire block.
@109

&LOWER CASE

    Keystroke sequence:   109
)    Alternate keystrokes: 109

The case of the character at the cursor location
will be set to lower-case. If a block is marked
and visible, and the cursor is anywhere within
the marked block, the command will change the
case of the entire block.
@110

&UPPER CASE

    Keystroke sequence:   110
)    Alternate keystrokes: 110

The case of the character at the cursor location
will be set to upper-case. If a block is marked
and visible, and the cursor is somewhere within
the marked block, the command will change the
case of the entire block.
@111

&SET RIGHT MARGIN

    Keystroke sequence:   111
)    Alternate keystrokes: 111

A prompt box will ask for a new value for the
right margin. Entering an empty prompt string will
set the right margin to the current cursor column.
The right margin is used only when Word Wrap mode
is active. When that is so, text entered in a
column beyond the right margin will automatically
be wrapped to the next line. Paragraph formatting
will move words so that lines are as full as
possible within, but not exceeding, the right
margin.
@112

&FORMAT PARAGRAPH

    Keystroke sequence:   112
)    Alternate keystrokes: 112

Format paragraph is available only when Word
Wrap mode is active. Paragraph reformatting will
move words so that lines are as full as possible
within, but not exceeding, the current left and
right margins. If Justify mode is active, the
lines will also be evenly filled with spaces so
that the rightmost word ends on the right margin.

The paragraph reformat is terminated when a blank
line, or a line beginning with a format character
(.), is reached.
@113

&TOGGLE WORD WRAP

    Keystroke sequence:   113
)    Alternate keystrokes: 113

When Word Wrap mode is active, paragraph
reformatting and automatic word wrap are
available. Otherwise, left and right margin
settings are ignored, and text may be entered in
any column up to the maximum line length.
@114

&SET LEFT MARGIN

    Keystroke sequence:   114
)    Alternate keystrokes: 114

A prompt box will ask for a new value for the
left margin. Entering an empty prompt string will
set the left margin to the current cursor column.

When Word Wrap mode is active, the left margin
controls the leftmost position where text may be
entered. The left margin also controls the
operation of the paragraph formatting command.

The left and right margins can be made visible by
toggling the Tab Line Display.

Print formatting commands require that the
format character (.) be located in column 1 even
if the left margin is set to a number greater
than one. To achieve this, enter the format
command starting at the left margin, move the
cursor to column 1 with the Left of Line command,
and delete the intervening spaces via Delete
Word. Alternatively, activate the Margin Release
command while the format command is entered.
@115

&DISPLAY TABS

    Keystroke sequence:   115
)    Alternate keystrokes: 115

Toggling Display Tabs ON reserves one line of the
current window for display of tab settings and
margins. The tabs and margins can be active
whether or not the tab line is visible.
@116

&INSERT UNDO BUFFER

    Keystroke sequence:   116
)    Alternate keystrokes: 116

The entire contents of the undo buffer are
inserted into the current text stream, prior to
the current line. This empties the undo buffer,
that is, the operation can be used only once for
any set of deletions.
@117

&TOGGLE JUSTIFY

    Keystroke sequence:   117
)    Alternate keystrokes: 117

When Justify is active, word wrap and paragraph
reformat operations will cause each line to be
filled in with spaces such that the rightmost
non-blank character is exactly on the right
margin.
]

By toggling Justify off, and reformatting lines
or paragraphs, the additional blanks will be
automatically removed from the text. Note that
blanks manually inserted (via the Tab command,
etc.) will also be removed, unless the Compress
Wrap mode is turned off.

ScreenWright does not differentiate between "soft"
blanks added during justification and "hard"
blanks manually entered. However, the character
<CtrlO> may be used in place of a normal blank
when non-changing spaces are desired. The <CtrlO>
will be printed as a normal space. To enter a
<CtrlO> in the text stream, press 25<CtrlO>.
@118

&TOGGLE PAGE BREAKS

    Keystroke sequence:   118
)    Alternate keystrokes: 118

When pagination is activated, the left two
columns of the text window will be devoted to
showing page breaks. The characters »» in those
columns indicate that the corresponding line is
the first printing text line on its page.

In addition, the status line for the window will
indicate what page number the cursor is on. The
Jump to Page command is available only when
pagination is activated.
]

ScreenWright calculates page numbers while it is
waiting for you to enter keystrokes. As a result,
if you enter new text it may take a short period
of time before the page break markers are redrawn
at their new positions.

Although the page breaks displayed on screen
correspond to those in a printout of the
document, ScreenWright does not store any special
characters in the disk file. Page breaks are
recomputed each time the file is read into
ScreenWright.

Pagination can be precisely controlled via the
formatting commands. See the help section for
File Print Formatting.
@119

&TOGGLE FONT DISPLAY

    Keystroke sequence:   119
)    Alternate keystrokes: 119

When Font Display is enabled, print formatting
commands that control font selections will not
be displayed on-screen. Instead the marked text
will be displayed in a color or attribute
corresponding to the font. This "what you see is
what you get" mode allows more accurate alignment
of tables, and avoids multiple print cycles to
correct formatting commands.

The screen colors for each font may be adjusted on
the Options Colors menu.

When font display is enabled, the control
characters that select the fonts are not visible.
However, the cursor can be positioned over the
control character, and it can be deleted if
desired. The ScreenWright hardware cursor grows to a
large block when it is positioned over the
control character. The value of the control
character will be displayed at the right hand
edge of the window status line when the cursor is
positioned over it.

ScreenWright computes the display of on-screen fonts
while it is waiting for you to enter keystrokes.
As a result, if you enter new text it may take a
short period of time before control characters
disappear and fonts are drawn in their final
colors.
@120

&CENTER LINE

    Keystroke sequence:   120

your liking. Independent color settings are
available for normal text, block marked text,
window status lines, the prompt line at the top
of the screen, text in menus and prompt boxes,
menu frames, the highlighted character by which
each menu item may be selected, the currently
selected menu item, the block cursor (when
active), and each of the five selectable fonts.
]

The colors that you select are saved with
ScreenWright when you execute the Options Save
setup command.
@122

&SAVE SETUP

    Keystroke sequence:   122

the target page number. Enter any positive integer
value. If the value is preceded by a plus (+) or
minus (-) sign, the target page number will be
calculated relative to the current page.
@130

&SET TOP MARGIN

    Keystroke sequence:   130
)    Alternate keystrokes: 130

This specifies the number of lines to leave blank
at the top of each page during printing or
pagination of the file in the current window. The
top margin is a default value that will be
overridden by ScreenWright format (.) commands

characters, newly entered text will be in the
selected typeface.
@161

&SELECT SUPERSCRIPT

    Keystroke sequence:   161
)    Alternate keystrokes: 161

If a block is marked and visible, ScreenWright will
convert the block to superscript typeface. It
does so by automatically placing the Toggle
Superscript control character (<CtrlT>) at the
beginning and end of the block.

If no block is marked, ScreenWright will place a pair
of print control characters at the current cursor
position, and position the cursor between the two.
Thus, while the cursor remains between the control
characters, newly entered text will be in the
selected typeface.
@162

&SELECT SUBSCRIPT

    Keystroke sequence:   162
)    Alternate keystrokes: 162

If a block is marked and visible, ScreenWright will
convert the block to subscript typeface. It
does so by automatically placing the Toggle
Subscript control character (<CtrlV>) at the
beginning and end of the block.

If no block is marked, ScreenWright will place a pair
of print control characters at the current cursor
position, and position the cursor between the two.
Thus, while the cursor remains between the control
characters, newly entered text will be in the
selected typeface.
@163

&SELECT COMPRESSED

    Keystroke sequence:   163
)    Alternate keystrokes: 163

If a block is marked and visible, ScreenWright will
convert the block to compressed typeface. It does
so by automatically placing the Toggle Alternate 1
control character (<CtrlA>) at the beginning and
end of the block. For most printer definition
files, the Alternate 1 typeface is defined as
compressed print.

If no block is marked, ScreenWright will place a pair
of print control characters at the current cursor
position, and position the cursor between the two.
Thus, while the cursor remains between the control
characters, newly entered text will be in the
selected typeface.
@164

&SELECT ITALICS

    Keystroke sequence:   164
)    Alternate keystrokes: 164

If a block is marked and visible, ScreenWright will
convert the block to italic typeface. It does so
by automatically placing the Toggle Alternate 2
control character (<CtrlN>) at the beginning and
end of the block. For most printer definition
files, the Alternate 2 typeface is defined as
italic print.

If no block is marked, ScreenWright will place a pair
of print control characters at the current cursor
position, and position the cursor between the two.
Thus, while the cursor remains between the control
characters, newly entered text will be in the
selected typeface.
@165

&TOGGLE SNOW CONTROL

    Keystroke sequence:   165
)    Alternate keystrokes: 165

When Snow Control is ON, ScreenWright avoids the
screen interference patterns called "snow" that
are produced by certain display adapters, notably
the IBM Color Graphics Adapter. For other color
adapters, the Snow Control can be turned off. This
improves screen updating performance considerably.
@166

&TOGGLE BLOCK CURSOR

display is desired.
@168

&MARGIN RELEASE

    Keystroke sequence:   168
)    Alternate keystrokes: 168

Setting Margin Release ON allows you to type
beyond the left and right margins while Word Wrap

also be toggled off at any time.
@169

&SPELL CHECK

    Keystroke sequence:   169
)    Alternate keystrokes: 169

In combination with Turbo Lightning, the RAM resident spelling
checker and thesaurus from Borland International, ScreenWright
will spell-check any of your documents.

)Turbo Lightning is available from:
)               Borland International
)               4585 Scotts Valley Drive
)               Scotts Valley, CA  95066

Lightning must be installed, or an error will occur. With
Lightning installed, ScreenWright checks the document in the
current screen window. By default, checking proceeds from the
current cursor position to the end of the file. If a block is
marked and visible, only that block will be checked. ]

ScreenWright contains a small built-in dictionary of
the 500 most commonly used English words. This
dictionary is kept in memory at all times in order
to accelerate the checking process.

Once the operation begins, ScreenWright keeps you
advised of its progress on the status line. The
line and column counters tell you what part of the
document is being checked, as does the percentage
indicator. These are updated each time a new word
is checked.
]

When Lightning finds a word that it does not recognize, the
screen will be updated to highlight the word, and a popup menu
will ask you to select an option. Select by moving the bar and
pressing <Enter> or by pressing the first character of any of
the options:

)  Skip once
)    Ignore the spelling of this word in only this
)    one instance.

)    you finish editing it.
]

)  Mark with "~"
)    Place a tilde in front of the word. After
)    the document has been checked, you can use
)    the Find Pattern command to locate the marked
)    words.

to stop. Press Y to stop, N to continue.
@171

&TOGGLE TAB WRITING

    Keystroke sequence:   171
)    Alternate keystrokes: 171

By default, ScreenWright does not write tab
characters in files saved from the editor. If Tab
Writing is activated, ScreenWright will translate
sequences of spaces to tabs in order to save disk
space for the output file. Tabs are computed using
the fixed spacing currently set for fixed tabs.
Multiple spaces found within pairs of single or
double quotes (as used in Pascal or C source code)
will not be converted to tabs.

Tab writing is saved as a ScreenWright default.
@172

&TOGGLE WRAP COMPRESSION

    Keystroke sequence:   172
)    Alternate keystrokes: 172

By default, ScreenWright compresses extra spaces out
of any line before it is wrapped. This feature is
required in order to "unjustify" text that has
previously been right justified. However, in some
cases the compression will remove desired spaces,
as in the case of aligned columns of figures.

When this toggle is OFF, extra spaces will not be
removed from lines being wrapped. Wrap
compression is saved as a ScreenWright default.
@173

&TOGGLE INITIAL ZOOM STATE

    Keystroke sequence:   173
)    Alternate keystrokes: 173

The state of this toggle determines ScreenWright's
default behavior when more than one window is on
the screen. When Initial Zoom State is OFF,
multiple windows will appear simultaneously on
the screen, that is, they will not be zoomed.

When Initial Zoom State is ON, multiple windows
will be zoomed. The last file opened will be
visible on the screen, and others will be hidden
behind it.

Initial Zoom State is saved as a ScreenWright
default.

The normal zoom window command may be used at any
time, regardless of Initial Zoom State.
@174
