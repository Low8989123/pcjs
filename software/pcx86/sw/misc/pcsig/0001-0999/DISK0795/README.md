## Information about "BULLET SIMULATOR DEMO VERSION"

    If you are into high-performance shooting, BULLET SIMULATOR is a program
    you can't afford to be without.  BULLET SIMULATOR helps you understand,
    predict and optimize the ballistic performance of your rifles.  This
    program is based on a mathematical model of bullet flight which accounts
    for just about any variable you can imagine.
    
    The following variables are included: bullet make, diameter, weight,
    shape, ballistic coefficient, powder charge, muzzle velocity, rifle
    weight, sight line height, rifle and your accuracy, temperature,
    elevation above sea level, wind conditions, hill slope, vital target
    height, target running speed and zero range.  The model is evaluated
    over a range of distances that you specify in either yards or meters.
    
    Once you run a simulation, you can view as a table or graph the
    following results: Remaining velocity, kinetic energy, sustained lead,
    wind drift and trajectory.  Recoil, maximum effective range and
    point-blank range are also calculated.  You can perform an optimal zero
    range analysis to maximize the point-blank range and reduce the chance
    of missing targets.
    
    Use the field simulation option to understand your load like the back of
    your hand.  With your choice of range, hill slope and wind conditions,
    you position crosshairs on game and silhouette graphics images where you
    think the shot should be taken.  The bullet's impact is shown along with
    the ideal crosshair hold.  BULLET SIMULATOR also plays a game, creating
    random situations and keeping score of your hits and misses.  A great
    training tool!
    
    A pop-up help system is available throughout the program.  This version
    of BULLET SIMULATOR is a working demo version.  It provides all the
    features of the registered version, but with a single bullet to give you
    a complete idea of its capabilities.  The registeUred version uses the
    library of over 500 bullets that you can edit to add any new bullets,
    complete with a ballistic coefficient calculator.
    
    System Requirements:  320K memory.

INTRODUCTION

Welcome to Bullet Simulator!  The purpose of this program is to help you
understand, predict and optimize your rifle's ballistic performance.  By using
this program, you can take advantage of several key benefits:

*  Perform a custom analysis tailored to your rifle, bullet and shooting
   conditions.  No more guessing where your rifle shoots!

*  Design a bullet path with the flexibility to handle most shooting conditions
   without aiming adjustments.

*  Be aware of aiming adjustments necessary for unusually long or windy
   shooting situations.

*  Sight in your rifle at any available facility, knowing where your bullets
   should strike there so that they will also strike at point-of-aim at your
   hunting zero range and conditions.

*  Get to know your load like the back of your hand, by simulating field firing
   conditions with your choice of target, range, hill slope and wind situation.

*  Compare the performance of over 500 bullets from .17 to .45 caliber from
   eight major bulletmakers.  Add your favorite new bullets of any diameter,
   make, weight and shape to the library.



STARTING UP

1.  Start up your computer as usual.

2.  Place the Bullet Simulator diskette in Drive A.

3.  Start the program by typing the following command:

    A>  GO            ... and press [ENTER]

The program will start with a banner panel, then advance to the Menu Panel,
discussed below.



THE MENU PANEL

You control the program through the menu panel, selecting options in either of
two ways:

1.  Press the left or right arrow keys to move the cursor bar over the desired
    option, then press [ENTER].  As each option is highlighted, a message
    explaining it appears underneath.

2.  Press the highlighted (first) letter of the desired option.

Some options have sub-menus of sub-options.  In that case the sub-options
appear, and you select one in the same way.  All sub-menus have a RETURN option,
which returns to the "parent" menu level.  The "parent" option is shown at the
top right corner of the panel.  All menus also have a HELP option, which pops up
a list of help topics for you to choose from.  Use the arrow keys to move the
cursor bar over the desired help topic and press [ENTER].  An explanation panel
for that topic will appear.  One of the help panels, "Navigating through the


.
                                      - 4 -

menus" provides a roadmap for navigating through the menu and sub-menu options.



DESCRIBING YOUR SITUATION

The DESCRIBE option collects information about your situation and then predicts
ballistic performance for your load.  At first, an empty fill-in-the-blank
panel will appear.  Although the details are covered later, let's get a quick
start by bringing up an example situation file.  Press [F3] (File) and [ENTER]
to "Retrieve a file".  Press the [Down-arrow] key to slide the cursor over the
"30-06" filename and press [ENTER] to select it.  The screen should look as
follows:

                            Describing Your Situation

                   Enter cartridge name to appear on results
 F1=Help   F2=Calculate   F3=Files   F4=Library   F5=Optimize-info   ESC=Cancel
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The cursor bar appears over the first information blank (cartridge).  You can
move this cursor around to the different information blanks by pressing the
arrow keys.  To enter a value in an information blank, just type the value and
press [ENTER].  Helpful guidelines for each information blank appear near the
bottom of the screen.  If the value you enter is not valid, the previous value
will be recovered.

The bottom line of the screen identifies function keys that you use to control
the description process:

[F1]  Provides specific help for the current information blank, as well as
      describing these function keys.

[F2]  Calculates ballistics based on the current situation.  If there is a
      conflict between the situation values, a message will pop up, give you a
      correction hint and place the cursor at the relevant information blank.

[F3]  Manages your situation description files.  Rather than enter data for each
      description fresh as it's needed, use the file management capabilities
      built into the program:

.
                                      - 5 -

        Retrieve a file     (that was previously saved)
        Save to a file      (creating a new file or overwriting an old file)
        Erase a file        (that was previously saved)
        Cancel              (cancel and return to the Situation Description)

      Choosing a file option displays a scrollable list of situation filenames.
      To select a file, either use the arrow keys to highlight its name and
      press [ENTER], or simply type a filename, filling in the blank at the top
      of the list.  The selected option will be performed if the filename is
      valid (and also available, for Retrieve/Erase options).

      Valid filenames have 1 to 8 of the following characters without any spaces
      between them:  A..Z, a..z, 0..9, !, @, #, $, %, &, (, ), -, or _.  Use
      filenames that represent your rifle or load, such as 22-250, VARMINT,
      100-GR, SOLID-PT, or MONTANA.  You'll be able to recognize them
      quickly from the list.

[F4]  Selects a bullet of your choice from the bullet library.  This pops up a
      window of bullet diameters for you to choose from.  Use the arrow keys to
      move the cursor over your desired diameter and press [ENTER] to select it.
      A list of all bullets of that diameter in the library will appear for you
      to choose from in the same way.  After selecting a bullet, the screen
      returns to the situation description panel.  The bullet's diameter, make,
      weight, shape and ballistic coefficient will automatically be filled in.
      You can always override any of these values.

      NOTE:  If you don't know the bullet diameter for your cartridge, press
      [F1] (Help) and select the related help panel.

[F5]  Shows the results from the last time you found the optimal zero range
      (described later).  It's a handy reminder as you're filling in the zero
      range information blank.

[ESC] Cancels the situation description and returns to the Menu Panel.  All
      information blanks are cleared.


Let's look at the example situation above in more detail, defining each
information blank and the range of valid values:

 1.  Cartridge                         (Anything)

The name of the cartridge to appear on the ballistics table.

 2.  Bullet diameter                   (0.001 - 1.000 inches)

The nominal caliber of the cartridge, eg: .243 for the 6mm Remington, .277 for
the 270 Winchester or .308 for the 30-06 Springfield.  A table of diameters for
popular cartridges is available as a Help panel.  Enter your own value or press
[F4] to select a bullet from the library.

 3.  Bullet make                       (Anything)

The bullet manufacturer's name.  Enter your own label or press [F4] to select a
bullet from the library.

 4.  Bullet weight                     (1 - 1000 grains)

The bullet's weight.  Enter your own value or press [F4] to select a bullet from
the library.



.
                                      - 6 -

 5.  Bullet shape                      (Anything)

The bullet's shape or style.  Enter your own label or press [F4] to select a
bullet from the library.

 6.  Ballistic coefficient             (0.050 - 1.000)

The bullet's ballistic coefficient.  Enter your own value or press [F4] to
select a bullet from the library.  Estimate the coefficient for new bullets with
the LIBRARY..COEFFICIENT menu option.

 7.  Powder charge weight              (0.1 - 200.0 grains)

The powder charge weight is used to calculate the load's recoil.  For handloads,
use the actual charge weight.  For factory loads, use an approximate weight as
shown in the related Help panel.

 8.  Muzzle velocity                   (500 - 4500 feet per second)

The load's muzzle velocity, found in ammunition catalogs or handloading manuals,
or measured directly with a chronograph instrument. If taken from a catalog or
manual, adjust the muzzle velocity as shown in the related Help panel.

 9.  Muzzle velocity temperature       (-20 - +120 degrees F)

The air temperature when the muzzle velocity was measured.  Most ammunition and
handloading sources report velocities normalized to 59 degrees F.  Enter the air
temperature if you measured the velocity with a chronograph instrument.

10.  Gun weight                        (0.1 - 20.0 pounds)

The gun's weight is used to calculate recoil energy.  Weigh the gun with sights,
sling and a full magazine's worth of rounds (keeping the chamber empty!).

11.  Sight height above bore           (0.01 - 4.00 inches)

If you have scope sights, measure between the bore center and the horizontal
crosshair (usually about 1.5").  If you have iron sights, measure between the
bore center and the top of the front sight blade (usually about 0.9").

12.  Bench group diameter              (0.00 - 20.00 inches)

This measures your rifle/load's ability to hit a well-defined target.  Since no
load shoots one-hole groups, this puts some conservatism into selecting the best
zero range for your situation.

13.  Bench group range                 (5 - 1000 yards/meters)

The range associated with the bench group diameter.  Usually it is fairly short
(no more than 100 yd/m), so that you can clearly see the target.

14.  Field group diameter              (0.00 - 40.00 inches)

This measures your ability to hit a target from a typical field position
(offhand, sitting, over a tree limb, off a bipod, etc).  It is used in the FIELD
simulation to randomly disperse your aimed shots.

15.  Field group range                 (5 - 1000 yards/meters)

The range associated with the field group diameter.

                                      - 7 -

16.  Field air temperature             (-20 - +120 degrees F)

This temperature is used to calculate actual bullet drag.

17.  Field elevation above sea level   (0 - 15000 feet)

This elevation is used to calculate actual bullet drag.

18.  Wind velocity                     (0 - 100 miles per hour)

Used to calculate lateral wind drift.

19.  Wind direction                    (1 - 12 o'clock)

The direction the wind is coming from.  12 o'clock is a headwind, 6 o'clock a
tailwind, 3 o'clock a right crosswind and 9 o'clock a left crosswind.

20.  Hill slope                        (0 - 45 degrees)

Specify the (uphill or downhill) slope in degrees, where 0 degrees is flat
ground.

21.  Vital target height               (0.02 - 20.00 inches)

This is the height of the target that you want to hit while aiming dead-center.
It is used to help select the best zero range for your conditions.

22.  Target running speed              (0 - 100 miles per hour)

The target running speed is used to calculate sustained leads at various ranges.

23.  Target running angle              (0 - 90 degrees)

This angle is from your shooting perspective.  0 degrees is running straight at
or away from you.  90 degrees is a crossing shot.  45 degrees is quartering.

24.  Zero range                        (5 - 1000 yards/meters)

The zero range is where the bullet will hit your point-of-aim on its downward
curve.  If this is the first analysis for this situation, choose a zero range of
100 or 200 yds/m to get started.  Later, the OPTIMIZE option will help you
select the best zero range for your specific situation.

25.  Simulation distance               (50 - 1000 yards/meters)

This is the maximum distance for ballistics to be tracked, as long as the
velocity remains above 300 feet per second.

26.  Distance step                     (5 - 1000 yards/meters)

This is how often to report ballistics on the results table.  Ballistics can be
shown for up to 51 steps, eg:  0 to 1000 yd/m in steps of 20, or 0 to 500 yd/m
in steps of 10.

27.  Remarks                           (Anything)

Any notes that are helpful to you (load details, game type, trip, etc).

After all values have been entered, press [F2] to start the analysis.  A graphic
display charts the downrange calculation progress.

Note the point-blank range results in the table header.  These are the longest
continuous ranges that you can aim dead-center at the vital target area and
expect to hit it.  The first point-blank range is based on all bullets within
the bench group accuracy.  The second point-blank range is based on the average
bullet only, as if your load shot one-hole groups.

The table body shows performance from the muzzle to the maximum distance, by the
specified step size.  Use the arrow keys to scroll up or down to view all of the
table.

For each distance step, five performance measures are shown:

1. Remaining velocity in feet per second.  Higher velocities cause faster
   velocity loss, due to increased air resistance.

2. Remaining kinetic energy in foot-pounds.  Use this to assess the effective
   range for your bullet and intended game.  Common guidelines are at least
   1000 ft-lbs for deer-sized game and 2000 ft-lbs for elk-sized game.

3. Sustained lead in feet for running targets.  Individual shooting styles will
   vary, but this provides a first guess of required leads.

4. Lateral wind drift in inches from the specified wind velocity and direction.
   Crosswinds (3 or 9 o'clock) result in maximum drift, proportional to the wind
   velocity.

.
                                      - 9 -

5. Trajectory in inches from line-of-sight.  This is shown for the center and
   vertical extremes of the bullet group.  The amount of spread from the group
   center depends on the rifle's accuracy, measured by the bench group size.


PRINT:  Prints the above table on your printer.  An additional feature on the
printout is a "Gunstock Quick Reference" table.  This is an ultra-compact,
simple chart that you can waterproof and carry as a field reference for range
and wind doping.


GRAPHS:  The VELOCITY, ENERGY, LEAD, DRIFT and TRAJECTORY sub-options each
display an automatically-scaled graph of results across the simulation distance.
The ENERGY graph asks for the minimum required energy level for your target.  It
then indicates the maximum effective range of the load.  The TRAJECTORY graph
shows the vital target height in a shaded pattern.  This gives you a clear
picture of the point-blank range concept.



DESIGNING A USEFUL TRAJECTORY

Reviewing the ballistics results, you may ask, "Which zero range is best for my
rifle and conditions?".  Experimenting with different zero ranges identifies the
classic risk tradeoff between long-range estimation and holdover vs mid-range
overshooting.  The most useful trajectory is one that you don't worry about in a
variety of shooting situations.  Small deviations from line-of-sight are not
going to make any practical difference in a field situation.  Bullet Simulator
analyzes the zero range's trajectory to determine the point-blank range for your
target size and rifle accuracy.  This is the maximum continuous distance that
you can hold dead-center on your target's vital area and expect to hit within
it, and depends on three factors:

1. Trajectory:  Flatter trajectories allow the bullet to hit the target out to
   longer ranges.

2. Vital target height:  Larger targets can be hit out to longer ranges.

3. Rifle accuracy:  Rifles with smaller bench group diameters can hit the target
   out to longer ranges.

Use the OPTIMIZE menu option to find the zero range that maximizes the
point-blank range for your situation.  A graph shows the point-blank ranges for
several alternative zero ranges, and highlights the optimal zero range.

For example, if your target's vital height is 8 inches, the bullet's trajectory
should stay within 4 inches of line-of-sight to make a hit while aiming at the
target's center.  A zero range of 230 yards allows a maximum point-blank range
of 255 yards.

Now return to the DESCRIBE option and change the zero range from 200 to 230
yards.  Press [F2] to recalculate the ballistics.  After viewing the ballistics
table, use the RESULTS..GRAPH..TRAJECTORY option to graph the new trajectory.
You'll see that the upper bullets in the trajectory band just touch the upper
edge of the vitals zone.  This squeezes every bit of performance from your load.



SIGHTING IN YOUR RIFLE

With Bullet Simulator you can sight in your rifle before a hunt in a different
temperature or elevation, so that bullets perform as you expect.  Use the

.
                                     - 10 -

SIGHT-IN option to get the procedure to achieve your desired hunting trajectory
from the latest situation description.  Suppose you are planning a mountain elk
hunt at 8000 feet elevation and 60 degrees F with your 30-06 Springfield.  For a
hunting trajectory with a 230-yard zero range, how should you sight in the rifle
at your 100-yard facility on the coast?  The table below shows the SIGHT-IN
results, with your information provided in the top two blanks.

     +----------------- Local Facility Sight-In Procedure -----------------+

     |                  40                            +2.3                 |
     |                  60                            +2.3                 |
     |                  80                            +2.4                 |
     |                 100                            +2.5                 |
     |                 120                            +2.6                 |
     |                                                                     |
     |     Sight in by centering your bullet group at the impact point     |
     |     shown above that matches your local facility temperature.       |
     |                                                                     |
     +---------------------------------------------------------------------+

In this example you might sight in at your local 100-yard facility with, say,
80-degree temperatures.  Adjust the sights to print the group center 2.4 inches
above line-of-sight.  You are now sighted in for 230 yards on the hunt, your
desired trajectory.



SIMULATING FIELD FIRING CONDITIONS

The FIELD option simulates a field firing situation using the information from
the most recent situation description.  The object is to get more familiar with
your load as you encounter a wide variety of field conditions.  Your target's
vital area is shown with crosshairs on it.  Look at the current situation box
and decide where you think the crosshairs should be held to make a direct hit.
Use the arrow keys to move the crosshairs to that position and press "F" to fire
a round.

The bullet impact and ideal crosshair hold are shown on the picture.  Note that
repeated fired rounds do not hit in the same place, just as in a real situation.
The rifle's accuracy as you specify in your field group diameter is used to
randomly disperse bullet impacts.  If you fire several rounds, a definite
pattern begins to form.  This helps you see the chances of hitting the target
under these simulated conditions.

To adjust any of the field conditions, press the highlighted menu letter.  Then
use the arrow keys to adjust the shown value up or down to the desired level.
Press [ENTER] to register the change and continue the simulation.

The Game option is your chance to pit your range and wind doping skills against
the computer.  As you enter the Game mode, the program asks what maximum range
it can select random situations from (the default is 400 yd/m).

.
                                     - 11 -

Two things happen as you play the game:

1. The computer selects a random situation.  If the target is not a silhouette,
   the range, hill slope and wind velocity and direction are selected.  If the
   target is a silhouette, ranges and hill slope (flat) are fixed; the wind
   velocity and direction are selected.

2. You move the crosshairs and fire a single round.  The bullet impact and ideal
   crosshair hold are shown on the picture.  Your score is shown in two ways:

   a. The "correct aims" score is updated.  If your aim would have placed the
      average bullet in the vitals (or hit silhouette metal), the tally and
      percent scores increase.

   b. The "hits scored" score is updated.  If the random bullet hit the vital
      zone (or silhouette metal), the tally and percent scores increase.

As a result of this "next-best" training, you improve your inner sense of your
load's performance under varying field conditions.  Challenge your shooting
buddies to a competition!  When you think your scores are good enough, make that
vitals zone smaller!



MANAGING THE BULLET LIBRARY

The bullet library keeps track of over 500 bullets for you to use while
describing your situations.  Several of the LIBRARY menu sub-options display a
scrollable bar menu with all bullet diameters currently in the library.  Press
the arrow keys to move the cursor over your choice; press [ENTER] to select it.
Bullets matching that diameter are then listed; select a particular bullet with
the cursor bar and arrow keys in the same way.

The following LIBRARY sub-options are available:

LIST-CHANGE lists and changes any desired bullet's information.  The library
            will always be sorted in alphabetical and numerical order.

ADD         adds any new bullet of your choice.  A fill-in-the-blank panel
            collects the bullet information that you provide.

DELETE      deletes a bullet of your choice.

PRINT       prints the library contents for your choice of either ONE-DIAMETER
            of your selection or ALL-DIAMETERS.

COEFFICIENT estimates a ballistic coefficient for any bullet.  All you need are
            the muzzle velocity and a remaining velocity at a single range,
            available from ammunition catalogs or reloading manuals.

Various bullet manufacturers make different assumptions when they quote a
ballistic coefficient.  Bullet Simulator assumes a G1 drag model using the
Siacci method, appropriate for the wide variety of sporting bullets used today.
Ballistics are calculated relative to U.S. Army standard atmospheric conditions:


                      Elevation:              Sea level
                      Temperature:            59 degrees F
                      Barometric pressure:    29.53 inches Hg
                      Relative humidity:      78 percent



.
                                     - 12 -

Although a manufacturer's published remaining velocities may depend on slightly
different atmospheric assumptions, the results obtained with this method will
agree very closely.  There will be no practical difference in calculated bullet
performance.  It provides a consistent approach using bullets from a wide range
of manufacturers.



CONFIGURING THE PROGRAM TO YOUR NEEDS

Use the CONFIGURE menu option to set up Bullet Simulator for your specific
needs:  range units and graph printing details.  The STATUS sub-option shows
the current configuration values.  All changes are recorded on a disk file, so
you won't have to set them each time you run the program.

The UNITS sub-option selects either YARDS or METERS for distance units.  If you
change from one distance unit to another, you'll need to re-describe your
situation before continuing with the program.

The GRAPH-PRINT sub-option selects either of two modes for printing graphs,
depending on your specific equipment:

1. EPSON-MODE:  If your printer is fully IBM/Epson-compatible, this mode will
   give the highest-quality print image.  If you have a CGA graphics adapter,
   the graph will cover only a part of the page.  Since this is the initial
   default mode, try it out --- if you get only random "garbage" printed, then
   try...

2. OTHER-MODE:  If your printer is "nearly" IBM/Epson-compatible, this mode will
   give you a medium-quality print image.  This mode will work only if you have
   a CGA graphics adapter.  To use it, make sure you run the DOS GRAPHICS.COM
   utility before running Bullet Simulator.  Do this by having the DOS files
   available and typing

        GRAPHICS  ... and press [ENTER]

   at the DOS prompt.  You'll only need to run the utility once after starting
   up your computer.



CONCLUSION

The purpose of this program is to help you understand, predict and optimize your
rifle's ballistic performance.  As you use it, you should be able to make good
decisions about the design of your rifle's trajectory for your purposes.  You'll
also have some fun getting to know your load's performance better.
