## Information about "GANTT PAC 1 OF 2 (ALSO 1198)"

    This is a group of project management aids that produce presentation-
    quality Gantt charts -- graphic displays of schedules -- from a list of
    projects, dates and times.
    
    Four primary applications are provided: Gantt chart transparencies for
    meeting displays, the ability to directly drive a video projector from a
    PC for meeting displays, Gantt charts for insertion into the
    text files of word processors, and direct use to view project status.
    These types of displays are commonly used throughout industry for
    management presentations of project status and resource use.

Disk No  593
Program Title: GANTT & SCHEDULING version 1.3 (Disk 1 of 2)
PC-SIG version 1.4

GANTT is a group of project management aids that produce presentation-
quality Gantt charts from a list of projects, dates and times.  The 
types of displays provided are commonly used throughout industry for 
management presentations of project status and resource usage.  In this 
way GANTT charts are used as a graphic means of displaying schedules. 

This program has four primary applications: it produces GANTT chart
transparencies for meeting displays, directly drives a video projector
from a PC for meeting displays, creates GANTT charts to be inserted into
the text files of word processors, and is used directly to view project
status.

To get you going, this disk has a DEMO, a TUTOR, and a "sister" program,
SCHEDULE, a limited working model of another sophisticated project
management tool.

Usage:  Critical Task Tracking/Project Management/Scheduling.

Special Requirements:  A printer for hard copy.

How to Start:  Type GO (press enter).

Suggested Registration:  None for GANTT, but SCHEDULE is $295.00 for the
full version.

This diskette contains the files listed in "DISKETTE.FLS"
Place the diskette in the A: diskette drive and enter "A:M".

PCSIG diskette # 593 named "GANTT" contains the program GANTT and
a limited demonstration version of "SCHEDULE".

This diskette contains updates to GANTT (now version 1.3) along with a new
BIG GANTT function which can be used in conjunction with a sideways printing
program (not included). Double high print is now supported for printers which
support the double high function (IBM Pro-Printer II or beyond).

SCHEDULE is no longer crippled. It is version 1.2 and is equivalent to the
commercial version except that the capacity is limited and the support files
are setup for a diskette rather than a hard disk. The license provides for
free distribution for educational use but not for commercial use.
The commercial version is available from HITT Personal Software at $295 per
single system license.

Our intent is to provide a free (distribution cost) package which can be
freely copied for students in the academic environment and at the same time
provide a commercial version with direct commercial level support.
