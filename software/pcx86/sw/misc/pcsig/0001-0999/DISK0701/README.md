## Information about "DANCAD 3D 1 OF 4 (ALSO 702,703,704)"

    DANCAD3D is an excellent and versatile drawing program that lets you do
    very complex things like stereoscopic 3D wire-frame drawing, or very
    simple things like designing letterheads. Draw in two and three
    dimensions. Separate groups of lines into "elements" that can be
    saved, loaded, magnified, rotated, flipped, offset (moved), and used
    over and over again. Keep them as a file on a disk (give them names
    like cube, sphere, and cylinder).
    
    DANCAD3D prints surprisingly sharp, crisp lines on Epson/IBM-compatible
    dot-matrix printers. Use it for many different
    applications, including the following:
    
    ~ Mechanical drawings and technical illustrations
    
    ~ Business forms of many kinds
    
    ~ Page layouts which combine text and drawings
    
    ~ Automatic computer slide shows
    
    ~ Engineering simulation to verify the fit of three-dimensional shapes
    
    DANCAD3D also supports many plotters, PostScript laser printers, and
    image setters such as the Linotronic 300. It works with a mouse, 3-D
    track ball, or cursor keys.
    
    DANCAD3D includes the DANMOVIE program, a full demonstration, and its
    documentation. DANMOVIE is a very useful engineering tool. With it,
    you can program DANCAD3D to make an animated close-up of parts in a
    layout drawing. Use this close-up to confirm the fit of moving parts.
    Produce an animated perspective view of the entire assembly with all of
    the parts in motion.

Program Title: DANCAD3D version 2.0E (Disk 1 of 4)
PC-SIG version 2.3

DANCAD3D lets you do complex tasks like stereoscopic 3D wire-frame
animation or simple things like a letterhead. It lets you draw with
lines that can be in a plane, like drawing on a piece of paper (2D
drawing), and can go any direction in space (3D drawing).
Three-dimensional drawings made of lines are called wire-frame drawings.
You can separate groups of lines into "elements" that can be saved,
loaded, magnified, rotated, flipped, offset (moved), and used over and
over again, by keeping them as a file on a disk (give them names like
cube, sphere, and cylinder).

DANCAD3D prints out very sharp lines and is useful for line drawings,
mechanical drawings, technical illustrations, wire-frame animation,
engineering simulation to verify the fit of three-dimensional shapes,
business forms, page-layouts combining text and drawings, and automatic
computer slide-shows.
