## Information about "GRAPHTIME II 2 OF 2 (HERCULES) ALSO 833"

    GRAPHTIME II is a business-presentation graphics program.  GRAPHTIME II
    does various line, column and pie charts.  The charts can be printed or
    plotted, viewed individually, or set up to run as an unattended "slide
    show" on the monitor.  It accepts data from dBase II/III, Multiplan,
    and Lotus 1-2-3, or you can enter data directly.  It has a font editor,
    macro editor and math functions including moving averages.  There is
    even an "undo" function. A Microsoft mouse (or compatible) is
    recommended for the draw program.
    
    This version will plot 24 data points and will print "paint" files or
    save them to disk.

    Finally, GRAPHTIME is available to HERCULES graphics users!  This
version offers HERCULES graphics owners all the features of the original
GRAPHTIME II.
 
    This two-disk demo set contains a business-presentation graphics
program. GRAPHTIME II does various line, column and pie charts. The charts
can be printed or plotted, viewed individually, or set up to run as an
unattended "slide show" on the monitor.
 
    GRAPHTIME accepts data from dBase II/III, Multiplan, and LOTUS, or you
can enter data directly into GRAPHTIME. There is a font editor and macro
editor. There are math functions including moving averages. There is even
an "undo" function. A Microsoft mouse (or compatible) is recommended.
 
    This demo version does not have the pen-plot driver and supports only
color graphics adapters. This version will plot only 24 data points. The
commercial version can handle 365 data points. This demo version will not
save "Paint" files, but will print them.
