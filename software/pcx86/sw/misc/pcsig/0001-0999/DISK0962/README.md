## Information about "PDVIM, INDENT, AND SXU"

    INDENT is a C program formatter that reformats any C program in the
    input file according to the switches or command options.  Make your
    source code more readable and appear in an acceptable format.  The C
    source code for the main program is included so you can modify it to fit
    your exact needs.
    
    Programmers -- A utility for you called THE SELECT XTRAC UTILITY (SXU).
    SXU extracts selected sections of data files according to your
    specifications.  It accepts any standard ASCII sequential files composed
    of character or numerical data.
    
    The input file to SXU cannot have embedded control characters, except
    for normal print-control characters.  SXU reads the input data file and
    creates an output extract file with the data between your specified
    start and end strings in the input data file.
    
    SXU can extract data and append it to an already-existing extract file,
    and allows up to 32 different extracts from a single file at one time.
    On-line help and directions are included.
    File Descriptions:
    
    SXU      DAT  Test data.
    SXU      HLP  Help file.
    SXU      COM  Main program.
    
    PDVIM, is the shareware version of VIM (VIrtual Machine), an
    interpreter/debugger that can simulate and/or allow access to the
    hardware of an XT or AT in an addressing space independent of the normal
    hardware.
    
    This debugger can stop execution at any point, examine or alter memory
    or registers, examine the program, determine where the program has been,
    and much more.  Unlike DOS DEBUG and other debuggers, these functions
    are accomplished by a program outside the addressing space of the
    program or system under test, so VIM can never be altered or destroyed
    by the errant program.
    
    VIM also can trace DOS itself, or the ROMs, and set breakpoints within
    ROM or on data.  When a faulty interrupt code is reached, the breakpoint
    stops VIM, so the code can be traced and variables examined.  VIM's
    virtual approach allows it to debug programs that others can't,
    including terminate-and-stay-resident programs and device drivers.

Program Title: INDENT, SELECT XTRAC UTILITY (SXU), PDVIM
PC-SIG version 1
 
    INDENT comes from the University of Illinois via some distribution
tapes from the PDP-11 Unix. It is a C program formatter that reformats any
C program in the input file according to the switches (or command options).
INDENT helps your C source code to be more readable and in a format you
want it to appear. The source code for the main program is included and is
written in C.
 
    SELECT XTRAC UTILITY (SXU) extracts selected sections of data files.
SXU accepts any standard ASCII sequential file, composed of character or
numerical data. The input file to SXU cannot contain imbedded control
characters, except for normal print-control characters. SXU reads the input
data file and creates an output extract file containing the data between
user-specified start and end strings in the input data file. SXU can of
extract data and append it to an already-existing extract file. On-line
help and directions are contained within the program.
 
    PDVIM is the public domain version of VIM (VIrtual Machine), an
interpreter that can simulate and/or allow access to the hardware of an XT
or AT in an addressing space independent of the normal hardware. This
debugger can stop execution at any point, examine or alter memory or
registers, examine the program, determine where the program has been, and
much more. Unlike DOS DEBUG and other debuggers, these functions are
accomplished by a program outside the addressing space of the program or
system under test, so VIM can never be altered or destroyed by the errant
program. VIM also can trace DOS itself, or the ROMs, and set breakpoints
within ROM or on data. In fact, any location or I/O port may be used as a
breakpoint. When a faulty interrupt code is reached, the breakpoint stops
VIM, so the code can be traced and variables examined. VIM's virtual
approach allows it to debug programs that others can't, including terminate
and stay-resident programs and device drivers.
 
Usage: C Program Formatter, Data Retrieval, Debugger
 
System Requirements: 320K memory and one disk drive. (640K memory is
recommended).
 
How to start: Type: COPY INDENT.MAN LPT1: (press enter) to print INDENT
manual, SXU (press enter) to start SELECT XTRAC, and PDVIM (press enter) to
start PDVIM.
 
Suggested Registration: $15.00 for SELECT XTRAC, and $49.00 for PDVIM.
