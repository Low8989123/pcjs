## Information about "DBS-KAT FILE LIBRARIAN PACKAGE"

    DBS-KAT is a menu-driven file cataloger for hard drive users who want
    information about their diskettes in one compact database. It
    accommodates 9,999 floppies and/or up to 16 million filenames. No data
    entry is required!
    
    Features include: inquiry by diskette ID, filename (or part of it),
    directory or comment (or part of it), location, or date range; backup
    and disk cleanup operations; file manager; programmer's print
    formatter (with special features for C programmers); menu-creator;
    on-line manual; file-viewing utility (supports mouse or keyboard); ASCII
    file-split utility (via the print utility); and batch file
    menu-maker program.
    
    Source code is available. DBS-KAT is an internationally liked diskette
    cataloger for power users since 1986 and one of the "Best-Rated
    Shareware Programs, Honorably Mentioned Within the Computing Community
    Media" by DON'S DIRECTORY.
    
    Now you can start using your disks to contain critically needed files
    and put off upgrading the hard drive capacity of your computer. You
    can start thinking of your disks as being as hard disk subdirectories,
    for you will be able to find out directory information about any file
    you have worked on.

Special Requirements: 384K RAM and DOS 2.1 or greater.                  
                                                                        
The purpose of the DBS-KAT software is to maintain a master catalog of  
all disk filenames that can be inquired against quickly to inform       
you which disk(s) contains the filename(s) you are looking for.         
                                                                        
Simply put, DBS-KAT requires that you physically label all your disks   
starting with the label 0001 up through 9999 and that you stack your    
disks sequentially in numeric order.  Now insert all of your disks      
into your disk drive and let DBS-KAT ``look'' at each one of your       
diskettes.  Its records each files vital inforamtion. By doing this,    
DBS-KAT can always tell you quickly where something is you want.
