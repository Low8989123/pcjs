## Information about "NEW FIG FORTH"

    For fans of FORTH, here is the latest version of this unusual
    programming language.  This version of FIG-FORTH incorporates a number
    of significant changes to the FIG version.  The Following is a partial
    list:
    
    ~  Written for Microsoft's MACRO-86 assembler
    ~  Full MS-DOS file interaction, as well as usual FORTH disk access
    ~  All I/O is vectored and may be re-directed within FORTH
    ~  Command line interpretation
    
    The accompanying documentation includes a user's guide, a technical
    reference manual, and a FORTH glossary (a list and explanation of each
    FORTH word which has been changed or added to this version).
    
    Special Requirements:  2 disk drives and a printer is optional.
    
    How to Start:  Type GO (press enter).
    
    Suggested Registration:  None.

          2.0  Quick Reference

          This is a summary of information necessary to use  FIG-FORTH
          and its documentation. 


          2.1  System Requirements

          FORTH requires the following system resources:

                * an 8086 or 8088 CPU running MS-DOS version  1.10  or
                  1.25

                * 64K of available RAM, or about 100K total

                * one or two disk drives



          2.2  Invocation

          FORTH is started by typing the following in response to  the
          COMMAND prompt. 

                   FORTH <commands>

          Where <commands> is an optional list of FORTH  words  to  be
          executed. 

          FORTH normally uses a special disk.  To  use  MS-DOS  files,
          the following commands are available:

                   A:                      selects drive A
                   B:                      selects drive B
                   DIR" <filename>"        lists matching file information
                   FILES" <filename>"      lists matching file names
                   USING" <filename>"      selects <filename> for screen access
                   EOF                     closes current screen file
                   LOAD" <filename>"       loads the screens in <filename>
                   ERASE" <filename>"      erases any matching files


          Note:   NEVER change any disk while  FORTH  is  using  a
                  file on that  disk!   Study  the  section  below
                  regarding disk operations.

          3.0  Introduction

          This document describes changes and additions  to  FIG-FORTH
          v1.0 which is distributed by the

                   FORTH Interest Group

          as modified to run under MS-DOS by

                   Joe Smith

          This  software  and  the   accompanying   documentation   is
          available from

                   SIG/86
                   c/o Joseph Boykin

                   Shrewsbury, MA  01545

          This  version  of  FIG-FORTH  incorporates   a   number   of
          significant changes to the FIG version.  The following is  a
          partial list:

                * written for Microsoft's MACRO-86 assembler

                * full MS-DOS file interaction, as well as usual FORTH
                  disk access

                * all i/o is vectored and may  be  re-directed  within
                  FORTH

                * command line interpretation


          Modifications   to   the   FIG-FORTH   implementation   were
          undertaken to alleviate several problems.   First,  the  FIG
          version is  for  CP/M-86.   Once  FORTH  was  running  under
          MS-DOS,  the  lack  of  a   file   interface   soon   became
          intolerable.   Also,  the  assembly   source   for   Seattle
          Computer's assembler was not transportable to  other  MS-DOS
          systems.  The translation to Microsoft's MACRO-86 was  begun
          in January  of  1983  and  the  file  system  interface  was
          completed the following June. 

          My original goal was to install a language for my  own  use.
          That is still my primary concern.  Accordingly, this version
          of the language is recommended for people who  are  familiar

          8086/8088 FIG-FORTH User's Guide                      Page 5



          with  their  computer,  and  (somewhat   less   importantly)
          familiar with FORTH.  If you are new to FORTH, you will have
          to dig for some of the  basic  information.   (some  helpful
          references are listed at the end of this guide).  If you are
          a person who enjoys understanding  and  tinkering  with  the
          mechanisms (read 'hacker') you should feel  right  at  home.
          If you are an experienced FORTH wizard, you can tell me  all
          the things I did wrong! 

          The  author (J.E.S.) gratefully acknowledges the efforts  of 
          the  FORTH  Interest Group (FIG) in providing  FORTH  source  
          code.   FORTH  owes much of its popularity  to the  work  of  
          this organization, it was the first significant software  to 
          run  on my system (even before I had disks) and without them 
          this implementation would certainly not exist. 

          Also, special  thanks  to  Joseph  Boykin,  whose  TOP  text
          processor formatted this document.

          4.0  User's Guide

          This documentation presents specific  details  necessary  to
          use this version of FORTH under MS-DOS.  It is not a  user's
          guide to FORTH in general.  Several introductory  references
          are given at the end of this guide


          4.1  System Requirements

          The FORTH interpreter/compiler as distributed requires:

                * an 8086/8088 computer running MS-DOS version 1.10 or
                  1.25

                * 64K of RAM, or 96K total,  including  the  operating
                  system

                * one or more disk drives

          These  requirements   may   be   changed   to   almost   any
          configuration by changing options in the assembly source and
          re-assembling.  This process requires:

                * All of the above requirements, plus another  64K  of
                  RAM, or 128K total (for MACRO-86)

                * the MACRO-86 macro assembler, or its equivalent

                * the LINK-86 linker, or its equivalent

                * the EXE2BIN program to convert the linker output  to
                  a .COM file

          See the section below, "Modifying FORTH", and the  technical
          reference for further information.

          4.2  FORTH, Calculator Style

          The simplest mode of interaction with FORTH is  through  the
          system console.  You type commands,  FORTH  interprets  them
          and carries out your  orders;  much  the  same  as  using  a
          powerful, programmable calculator. 


          4.2.1  Getting Started

          FORTH is invoked from MS-DOS by typing:

                   FORTH <optional command list>

          in response to COMMAND's prompt.  This will load and execute
          the FORTH interpreter.  FORTH  will  initialize  itself  and
          print a banner something like

                   8086 FIG-FORTH Version 1.1A

          Then, FORTH begins executing any commands you give  it.   If
          there  was  anything  else  on  the   command   line,   i.e.
          <command list> was present, FORTH attempts to interpret  it.
          Thus, if you wanted to find out what 8086  is  in  hex,  you
          could type:

                   A:FORTH 8086 HEX . BYE

          and FORTH would reply:

                   8086 FIG-FORTH Version 1.1A

                   1F96
                   A:

          If nothing was passed on  the  command  line,  FORTH  simply
          types a carriage return and waits for you.  The command list
          is limited to a total of  80  characters.   If  you  type  a
          carriage return at this point, FORTH should  respond:  "ok".
          If it doesn't, you have a problem. 


          4.2.2  Communicating With FORTH

          Keyboard entries are  handled  by  the  FORTH  word  EXPECT.
          EXPECT only recognizes two special keys: <DELETE> and  <CR>.
          Any other key is presumed  to  be  a  valid  character.   No
          MS-DOS editing functions are available.  The exact key which
          FORTH recognizes as <DELETE> defaults to  ASCII  DEL.   This
          may be easily changed to any other key.  The  section  below
          on  modifying  FORTH  tells  how  to  change  the  backspace
          character.  If you type <DELETE>,  EXPECT  will  delete  the
          last character entered.  If you try to go past the beginning

          8086/8088 FIG-FORTH User's Guide                      Page 8



          of the line, the terminal should beep and leave  the  cursor
          in the first column. 


          4.2.3  Special Functions

          While no editing functions are provided, MS-DOS does respond
          to some other special  keys.   Any  console  output  may  be
          paused by typing ^S.  Printer output is toggled using ^P/^N.
          Because MS-DOS intercepts these keys, FORTH will  never  see
          them.  Another function, the interrupt key ^C, has  variable
          effects.   Normally,  pressing  ^C  causes   the   currently
          executing FORTH word to be interrupted.  Control  is  passed
          to the FORTH word (ABORT) which usually aborts  the  current
          word and  resets  the  interpreter.   This  process  may  be
          changed to  provide  more  intelligent  interrupt  handling.
          Refer to the last part of the technical reference section on
          "Modifying FORTH" for more information. 

          There are a number of assembly options which may affect  the
          exact  way  these  keys  are  handled.   See  the  technical
          reference section entitled "installation dependent code" for
          further information. 


          4.2.4  New Definitions

          One command FORTH accepts is the  colon  ":".   Colon  is  a
          command to begin compiling  the  following  text  as  a  new
          definition.  No "ok" will appear until you have successfully
          completed your definition and ended it with a semicolon ";".
          The definition may be spread out over as many lines  as  you
          need, up to 80 characters on each line.   Until  you  end  a
          line by typing <CR>, you may back up and  change  it.   Once
          you go on to the next line, no editing is  possible.   FORTH
          will make you aware of any errors in the definition.  If you
          make a mistake, the whole definition must be entered again. 

          Try the following definition:

               : STAR 42 EMIT ;

          FORTH should respond "ok" after you hit  return.   Now  test
          STAR by typing: STAR<CR>.  FORTH  should  print  "*ok".   If
          that worked, try this one:

               : MILKY-WAY
                 BEGIN
                    STAR SPACE SPACE
                    ?TERMINAL
                 UNTIL ;

          Remember, no "ok" will  be  printed  until  you  finish  the
          definition with  the  semicolon.   Any  leading  spaces  are
          ignored.  Test MILKY-WAY as with STAR.  When you  get  tired

          8086/8088 FIG-FORTH User's Guide                      Page 9



          of star-gazing, stop the program by hitting  any  key.   The
          stars  should  stop,  and  FORTH  should  inform  you   that
          everything is "ok".  You can also  pause  the  execution  of
          MILKY-WAY using ^S, or abort it using ^C. 

          You can experiment with other definitions, but having no way
          of modifying  the  functions  without  re-typing  them  soon
          becomes a serious problem.  The next section  tells  how  to
          edit and load definitions stored on your  disk.   Don't  try
          any disk operations until you have read the next section. 


          4.2.5  Exiting FORTH

          To return to MS-DOS, say "BYE" to FORTH.

          8086/8088 FIG-FORTH User's Guide                     Page 10





          4.3  Using the Disk

          Standard FORTH supports only  the  most  primitive  of  file
          structures.  FORTH views the  disk  as  a  linear  array  of
          blocks which may be accessed in any  order.   A  disk  block
          formatted as 16 lines of 64 characters is called  a  screen.
          In  the  standard  configuration,  FIG-FORTH  bypasses   the
          operating system file structure.  This means that FORTH must
          have a disk all to itself.  While there  are  advantages  to
          this  arrangement  (no  directory  overhead,   simple   disk
          interface,  portability  across   operating   systems,   for
          instance),  it  is  often  inconvenient  that  FORTH  should
          totally ignore its host operating system's files. 

          To deal with this conflict, and yet  maintain  compatibility
          with standard FORTH disk access,  the  FIG-FORTH  model  was
          changed.  The words which do all disk access, BLOCK-READ and
          BLOCK-WRITE, can now be assigned to any function.  Thus,  by
          telling BLOCK-READ/WRITE to use a file instead of  the  disk
          directly, all of the standard FORTH disk words will refer to
          blocks of that file.  The user can easily switch between the
          two modes, or use one exclusively.  Also, all of  the  usual
          disk words will work on a file as  well  as  the  old  FORTH
          disk. 


          4.3.1  Creating and Editing Definitions

          There  are  three  editors  distributed  with  the  package.
          Unfortunately, there isn't time or space to  describe  their
          use  here.   All  are  described  elsewhere,  however.   The
          editors provided include:

                * two line-oriented editors: the  FORTH  Inc.   editor
                  described in Leo Brodie's "STARTING FORTH"  and  the
                  FIG   portable   editor   described   in   the   FIG
                  installation manual. 

                * a screen editor described  in  Dr.   Dobb's  Journal
                  No. 59.  This editor is configured for the Televideo
                  950 terminal, and must be  modified  for  any  other
                  terminal. 

          Any of these may be used with either screen files  or  FORTH
          disks.  All examples in this guide will refer to the  editor
          described by Brodie, which has been compiled and included in
          the FORTH.COM file. 

          8086/8088 FIG-FORTH User's Guide                     Page 11



          4.3.2  FORTH Disk Access

          After a COLD start, any disk words will access a FORTH disk.
          If you start FORTH and type "4 LIST",  it  assumes  you  are
          asking to see the fourth disk block.  In this mode, all disk
          transfers bypass the file system.  The user  has  access  to
          all blocks on the  disk,  and  if  more  than  one  disk  is
          available, FORTH will treat them as one disk  of  twice  the
          capacity. 

          Once you use a screen file, you must execute SWITCH  to  get
          back to the FORTH disk.  This should remind you to  "switch"
          your FIG-FORTH disk for the MS-DOS disk. 

          The disk interface allows you to use only one  format  at  a
          time.   That  is,  FORTH  cannot  automatically   adapt   to
          different  FORTH  disk  formats  the  way  MS-DOS  can.   By
          changing the constants  that  describe  the  disk,  you  can
          manually change formats to any supported by your i/o system. 

          To find what format FORTH expects, type

                   B/BUF REC/BLK / . 

          This gives the sector  size  in  bytes.   To  determine  the
          capacity of the disk FORTH expects,  display  the  constants
          BLK/DRIVE, MAXDRIVE, and MAXBLOCK. 

          The 8-inch format is 128 bytes/sector, 52 sectors/track,  77
          tracks per disk.  The 5-inch disks are 512  bytes/sector,  8
          sectors/track, 40 tracks per disk. 



          4.3.3  Screen File Access

          This version of FORTH includes an interface  to  the  MS-DOS
          file system.  The assembly source includes a low level  file
          interface, but the higher level functions must  be  compiled
          from a  FORTH  disk.   See  the  following  section  in  the
          technical reference on "Modifying FORTH"  for  details.   In
          order to switch from the FORTH disk to a screen file, type

                   USING" <filename>"

          where <filename> is any legal, unambiguous MS-DOS  filename.
          FORTH will attempt to open the file and determine if it is a
          file of FORTH screens.  If all goes well,  FORTH  will  tell
          you how many blocks are available in that  file.   The  file
          will look just like the disk to FORTH,  except its  capacity
          will be smaller.  Screen files may not span disks.   If  the
          specified file doesn't exist, FORTH will create it but  will
          not  allocate  any  space  to  it.   The  following  example
          demonstrates the screen file access words. 

          8086/8088 FIG-FORTH User's Guide                     Page 12



          Start FORTH, and type

                   USING" TRYIT"

          FORTH will create a file named TRYIT.SCR and tell  you  that
          the file is empty.  To use the file, you must allocate  some
          space to it.  This is done by entering

                   2 EXTEND

          EXTEND takes the number on the  stack  and  adds  that  many
          blocks to the end of the screen file.   In  this  case,  the
          file is now 0+2 or 2 screens long (screens 0 and 1).  If you
          were to try and list screen 2, you would get an error.  Note
          that EXTEND does not put anything in the screens  allocated;
          they contain whatever the disk held previously, but now they
          belong to your current screen file.  Clear a working  screen
          by entering the editor and filling screen one with blanks:

                   1 SCR ! 
                   EDITOR
                   WIPE

          List the screen, select line 0, and enter some text:

                   L
                   0 T
                   P ( this is screen 0 line 1 in file TRYIT.SCR )
                   L

          Use FLUSH to save the changes, then  type  "L"  again.   The
          screen should be just as  you  left  it.   Try  editing  the
          definitions for STAR and MILKY-WAY onto this  screen.   When
          you finish editing, save it by typing

                   EOF

          (End Of File) to close the file.  EOF displays the directory
          entry of your file to verify that  everything  is  allright.
          If the file is empty, EOF will notify you and then erase the
          file. 

          You are now in limbo as far as the disk  is  concerned.   If
          you try to access the disk, FORTH will remind you to specify
          which kind of disk access you want  to  do:  file  or  FORTH
          disk.  To list the screen again, tell FORTH to use TRYIT.SCR
          (USING" TRYIT").  Now FORTH should find a file with 2 blocks
          in it.  And  if  you  list  screen  1,  you  will  see  your
          definitions, just as  you  left  them.   If  you  need  more
          screens, use  EXTEND  as  before  to  allocate  more  space.
          Remember to WIPE the screen as it will probably be  full  of
          nasty control characters for your terminal to choke on! 

          Why not use screen 0?  Well, FORTH can list  screen  0,  and
          you can edit text there, but if you try "0 LOAD", FORTH will

          8086/8088 FIG-FORTH User's Guide                     Page 13



          get very confused.  When FORTH compiles block 0, it actually
          compiles input from the console.   Thus,  block  0  of  each
          screen file cannot be loaded (but, see the following section
          for one use for screen 0). 



          4.3.4  Compiling Definitions


          As with editing, once you have opened a screen file, you can
          proceed exactly as you would with a FORTH disk.  If you have 
          edited  some  definitions  onto Screen 1,  compile  them  by 
          typing 1 LOAD.  If FORTH says "ok", test them as before.  If 
          there is an error, edit the definitions and try again.

          There is only one new word with  regard  to  loading  screen
          files.  To make the process of selecting a screen  file  and
          loading it more convenient, use. 

                   LOAD" <filename>"

          LOAD" opens  the  specified  file,  and  loads  the  screens
          starting with screen one.  Since screen zero is just sitting
          there with nothing to do, LOAD" lists  it  before  beginning
          the load with screen one.  This is  a  good  place  for  any
          special  messages,  advertisements,  secret  messages,  etc.
          LOAD" is defined as simply:

                   : LOAD"
                        USING"
                        ( code to list screen 0 )
                        1 LOAD
                        EOF ;

          If an error is encountered during the LOAD, that  file  will
          be the current screen file.

          4.3.5  Other Functions

          There are several utility functions defined which make FORTH
          more convenient to use with the file  system.   These  words
          apply only to MS-DOS disks and not to FORTH disks. 


          4.3.5.1  Changing the Default Drive

          As in COMMAND, typing

                   A:
          or
                   B:

          will change the default drive for all file access. 


          4.3.5.2  Directory Information

          Several utilities are available for using MS-DOS disks.  Two
          words which list the disk directory are defined:

                   DIR"   <filename>"
                   FILES" <filename>"

          DIR" gives a complete directory  listing  of  each  matching
          filename, similar to the MS-DOS DIR command.   FILES"  lists
          only filenames, five  per  line,  much  as  the  MS-DOS  DIR
          command with the "/W" option.  The exact  interpretation  of
          ambiguous filenames differs from  COMMAND's.   The  filename
          must not be blank,  and  any  part  of  the  name  left  out
          defaults to "*".  Thus,

                   DIR" .SCR"     = DIR *.SCR
                   DIR" *"        = DIR *
                   DIR" ALL."     = DIR ALL.*

          The trailing quote may be replaced with the carriage return,
          and in fact, must be replaced to list  files  with  a  blank
          extension:

                   DIR" .<CR>     =DIR *. 
                   DIR" INDEX.<CR>=DIR INDEX. 


          4.3.5.3  Erasing Files

          A function is provided to erase files:

                   ERASE" <filename>"

          The use of this command is similar to  the  directory  words

          8086/8088 FIG-FORTH User's Guide                     Page 15



          above, except that no  part  of  <filename>  has  a  default
          value.  ERASE"  will  accept  ambiguous  filenames,  and  it
          displays the name of each file it  erases.   No  warning  is
          issued when the filename is "*.*", so beware! 


          4.3.5.4  Screen Transfer

          To assist in copying screens between FORTH disks and  MS-DOS
          files, two utilities are provided: COPY>FILE  and  COPY>SCR.
          These function very simply.   COPY>FILE  directs  all  block
          reads to the FIG-FORTH disk, and  all  disk  writes  to  the
          current screen file.  COPY>SCR does the reverse.   Then  all
          you need is the usual words for moving screens  around,  and
          magically they appear at the destination.  The  actual  copy
          operation is provided by the word #SCRCOPY, which takes  the
          starting source screen, the starting destination screen  and
          the number of screens to copy off the stack.  Thus,

                   USING" NEW"
                   COPY>FILE ... 
                   100 1 14 #SCRCOPY
                   EOF

          would copy screens 100-113 on the FORTH disk to screens 1-14
          in the file NEW.SCR.  Note that after you type  COPY>SCR  or
          COPY>FILE, you can still LIST or INDEX the  source  disk  if
          you forget which screens you want to copy. 


          4.3.5.5  Screen File Status

          To check on the status of the current screen file,  you  can
          use

                   SCREENS /? 

          If the screen file is in use, a display similar to the  DIR"
          information is printed; for example,

                   A:FORTH   .SCR r w s     10240  06-28-1983  19:59

          If the EOF command is given and then /?   is  repeated,  the
          following would be printed:

                   A:FORTH   .SCR r w s

          showing that the file is not in use.  The  "r w s"  indicate
          that this is a screen or random access file (s),  which  may
          be both read from (r) and written to (w). 

          An interesting discrepancy may arise between the DIR" report
          and the /?  information.

          8086/8088 FIG-FORTH User's Guide                     Page 16



          Examine the following session:

                   USING" NEW" empty file
                   5 EXTEND ok
                   DIR" NEW.SCR" 
                   B:NEW     .SCR          0  06-29-1983   0:26   1 file ok
                   SCREENS /? 
                   B:NEW     .SCR r w s       5120  06-29-1983   0:27    ok
                   EOF ok
                   B:NEW     .SCR       5120  06-29-1983   0:27   1 file ok
                   SCREENS /? 
                   B:NEW     .SCR r w s   ok

          The differences in the file size and time fields reflect the
          operating system buffering the physical disk output.  The /?
          display is taken from the  file  control  block  in  memory,
          which is immediately updated,  while  the  DIR"  display  is
          taken from the directory and is not updated  until  data  is
          written to the disk when the file is closed by EOF.

          4.3.5.6  Notes

          A  few  features  of  the  above  discussion  bear   further
          emphasis. 

                * NEVER change the disk FORTH  is  using  for  screens
                  while the file is open.  Changing disks  haphazardly
                  is a bad practice in almost all cases, not just  for
                  FORTH.  As can be seen above, the  information  kept
                  on the disk is not always accurate.  If the disk  is
                  changed, the file parameters kept in memory will  be
                  separated from the directory entry for the file, and
                  disaster is almost certain to result. 

                * In light of the above comments, note  that  you  may
                  FLUSH FORTH's disk buffers, but  not  MS-DOS's  disk
                  buffers.  Thus your disk buffers are not  guaranteed
                  to be on the disk until you  close  the  file  using
                  EOF.  If  the  file  interface  is  loaded,  BYE  is
                  redefined to execute EOF before  exiting,  to  force
                  any updated buffers to be saved. 

                * Only one screen file may be active at  once.   FORTH
                  checks this and will not allow another USING"  while
                  the SCREENS file is in use.  This  restriction  only
                  applies to screen files. 

                * The FORTH disk is the default state after COLD,  but
                  before an EOF.  You must specifically request access
                  to a screen file.  Once you use a screen file, FORTH
                  blocks any FORTH disk access until  you  request  it
                  using SWITCH.  Accessing an MS-DOS disk as  a  FORTH
                  disk probably won't destroy it, however, FORTH  will
                  probably get upset and quit talking to  you.   FORTH
                  tries to remind you to pay attention, but it doesn't
                  try to protect you: the burden is  on  YOU  to  keep
                  track of what you are doing! 

                * There is a convention for  the  names  of  the  disk
                  functions.  Since there are two names for each  file
                  (see below) there are two ways to refer to  a  file.
                  Names which begin with a "/" expect  an  address  on
                  the stack.  Names which end in a double-quote expect
                  a  filename,  delimited  by  a  trailing  quote,  to
                  follow.  The  function  that  assigns  filenames  to
                  files, therefore, has both: /IS".

          4.4  Modifying FORTH

          FORTH is an extremely  flexible  language.   With  a  little
          effort you can make it your own  personal  environment.   In
          addition, since you have the assembly source you can  change
          the inner workings, making it more efficient.  The following
          discussion  is  not  complete,  but  serves   only   as   an
          introduction.  Exploring the territory is half the fun! 


          4.4.1  FORTH Extensions


          One of the nice things about FORTH is the ability to  extend
          the language.  To complement  this  extensibility,  you  can
          save the new FORTH in an executable file and the  extensions
          become immediately available.  Only two things are necessary
          to accomplish this: first,  FORTH's  cold  start  parameters
          must be  updated;  and  second,  the  memory  image  of  the
          modified FORTH must be saved in a file.   This  is  how  the
          FORTH.COM file was constructed for distribution. 

          Updating the cold start parameters is  accomplished  by  the
          FORTH word NEW.  Saving the new version can be done  in  two
          ways:  first,  using  DEBUG  and  second,  the  FORTH   word
          SAVE-FORTH" <filename>".  The FORTH word  SIZE?   will  tell
          you the size of the FORTH kernel for writing from DEBUG.  To
          use SAVE-FORTH, first execute NEW to lock the changes.  Make
          sure no files are open before executing NEW, otherwise  they
          will appear to be open when the new  FORTH  executes.   Then
          define an output file and use SAVE-FORTH to write itself  to
          the file.  Since the file was defined after NEW, it will not
          appear in the new version.  Study the following hypothetical
          example:

                   9 LOAD 100 LOAD 108 LOAD ok
                   NEW ok
                   current version is A
                   new version (A-Z)? Bok
                   >FILE S4 ok
                   S4 /SAVE-FORTH" X4TH.COM"
                   B:X4TH    .COM      12521  06-29-1983   0:27 ok

          Note that because the FIG-FORTH disk is the  default  state,
          you must always modify and load the file definitions from  a
          FORTH disk.  If you FORGET the file words, you can only  use
          the FORTH disk! 


          4.4.2  Patching

          Many of the parameters which affect the operation  of  FORTH
          are placed in the boot parameter area  at  the  low  end  of
          FORTH.  These may be freely modified using  DEBUG,  or  from
          within FORTH.  On execution of COLD, these  parameters  will

          8086/8088 FIG-FORTH User's Guide                     Page 19



          be used to initialize the interpreter.  The patches can then
          be made permanent as  described  above.   For  example,  the
          following will change the FORTH backspace key:

                   KEY 14 +ORIGIN ! 

          After you type this and hit return, FORTH will wait for  you
          to hit a key.  The key you type will be placed in  the  boot
          parameters and will be recognized as  your  backspace.   The
          other parameters in this area are clearly commented  in  the
          assembly source, should you want to patch any of them. 


          4.4.3  Assembly Source Modifications

          Re-assembly  of  FORTH  is  the  least  desirable  form   of
          modification.  It is slow and can  be  difficult  to  debug.
          However, there are modifications which are only possible  in
          this way.  A  great  deal  of  time  has  gone  into  adding
          comments to the assembly source so that you  can  understand
          the way FORTH works.  Almost all of the  comments  appearing
          in the FIG listing are in the new listing, along  with  some
          additional comments.   There  is  more  information  on  the
          assembly source in the technical reference portion  of  this
          documentation. 

          Be aware of two problems here: first, it  is  very  easy  to
          lose track of the changes you make.  so document and comment
          each modification.  Second, more changes make  your  version
          of FORTH  more  unique  (or  maybe  just  strange)  and  any
          definitions using that feature  less  portable.   Don't  add
          bells and whistles just to be different.

          5.0  Technical Reference

          FIG-FORTH model.  It is not an explanation of the FIG model,
          nor of how FORTH works.  The user should refer  to  the  FIG

          5.1  Assembly Source

          The FIG assembly listing on which this version is based  was
          written for the CPM/86 8086 assembler.  For MS-DOS, the  FIG
          listing was translated  into  source  for  Seattle  Computer
          Products 8086 assembler.   Since  the  latter  assembler  is
          peculiar to SCP systems, the code was translated again  into
          source for  Microsoft's  MACRO-86  macro  assembler,  to  be
          portable to any MS-DOS environment. 

          Several features of MACRO-86 were used  to  provide  greater
          flexibility.  First, macros were written to build dictionary
          headers for each definition.  These macros make  setting  up
          the dictionary entries  convenient,  but  more  importantly,
          they calculate the link fields.  Because the  links  are  no
          longer  based  on  specific  labels  in  the   source,   the
          dictionary can be split into several files  which  are  then
          INCLUDED at  the  appropriate  points.   This  allows  great
          flexibility and modularity in assembling FORTH. 


          5.1.1  Source File Organization

          The source is now broken into several separate files:

                * 4TH-MAIN.ASM
                  This is the primary file which INCLUDES  the  others
                  during assembly.  It contains the inner interpreter,
                  code-level kernel, and most of the FORTH vocabulary. 

                * 4TH-SYSD.ASM
                  This file contains (almost) all of the code which is
                  operating system  or  hardware  dependent.   If  you
                  wanted to transport FORTH  to  a  different  system,
                  most of the changes would be in this file. 

                * 4TH-DISK.ASM
                  This file is INCLUDED by 4TH-SYSD and  contains  the
                  actual  disk  interface  for  reading/writing   disk
                  sectors. 

                * 4TH-FILE.ASM
                  Also (optionally) INCLUDED by SYSD,  this  file  has
                  all of  the  words  that  deal  with  files  at  the
                  operating system level.  This code is only assembled

          8086/8088 FIG-FORTH User's Guide                     Page 21



                  if the FILES option is set to TRUE. 

                * 4TH-XTNS.ASM
                  These definitions are code-level extensions  of  the
                  FORTH dictionary.  These  include  array  addressing
                  primitives, long fetch and store operators  and  the
                  port i/o words.  MATCH is also in this  file.   This
                  file is only assembled if the EXTEND option is TRUE. 

                * 4TH-OPTS.H
                  The assembly options  are  located  in  this  header
                  file,  and  are  symbols  which   begin   with   the
                  underscore character.  These are  global  parameters
                  and are used by other modules.   All  other  equates
                  and variables should be local to  the  module  where
                  they are defined. 

                  It  is  unfortunate  that  the  modules  cannot   be
                  separately assembled and linked.  The present system
                  requires a lot of memory  and  about  5  minutes  to
                  assemble (on an 8MHz  8086  using  8"  ssdd  disks).
                  This is really tedious for making small changes! 


          5.1.2  Macros

                  The macros necessary to assemble FORTH  are  in  the
                  file 4TH-LIB.MAC.  Comments in this file explain the
                  function  of  each  macro.   Beside  the  dictionary
                  macros, there are two macros to do branches  in  the
                  threaded definitions.  The  actions  of  the  macros
                  should be clear after studying their definitions and
                  the manner in which they are used in the code. 


          5.1.3  Comments

                  The  SCP  assembler  source  was   rather   sparsely
                  commented.  This  omission  has  been  rectified  by
                  copying all of the FIG listing comments,  plus  some
                  additional comments, into  the  MACRO-86  code.   In
                  addition, each entry in the dictionary has a comment
                  in the following form:

                  ;=AB  <name>   <description>   <stack effects>

                  where  A  is  a  letter  indicating  the   type   of
                  dictionary entry, and B is  a  character  indicating
                  whether the function has  been  added  or  modified.
                  This scheme  allows  automatic  glossary  generation
                  using a text editor or search utility.

          8086/8088 FIG-FORTH User's Guide                     Page 22



                  The dictionary entry types are:

                           C = code-level definition
                           : = colon definition
                           # = constant
                           ? = variable
                           U = user variable

                  The B character is either a blank,  a  plus,  or  an
                  asterisk;  indicating   that   the   definition   is
                  unmodified, added, or modified, respectively. 


          5.2  Modifications

                  The changes to the FIG listing fall  basically  into
                  two  categories:  changes  to  clean  up  the   disk
                  interface and manage buffers more  efficiently,  and
                  changes to route the i/o functions through execution
                  vectors.   The  sections  below  describe   specific
                  changes to the FIG model.  Each section  corresponds
                  to one in the FIG-FORTH  installation  manual.   Any
                  changes to that part of the model are listed there. 


          5.2.1  Boot Parameters

                       BSIN was changed to 127 - ASCII DEL. 


          5.2.2  Machine Code Definitions

                       Code added to  (FIND)  to  handle  word-aligned
                  definitions.  May be disabled by setting the  option
                  ALIGN to FALSE. 


          5.2.3  High-Level Utility Definitions

                       1+ and 2+ were changed to code definitions. 
                       TRAVERSE was modified  to  handle  word-aligned
                  LFA's. 
                       PFA was changed to handle word-aligned PFA's. 
                       EXPECT backspace was made destructive. 
                       ID.   was  modified  to  reset  MSB   of   last
                  character. 
                       CREATE  can  compile  dictionary  headers  with
                  word-aligned LFA's.  If DP is  odd  after  compiling
                  the name field, DP is incremented so that  the  rest
                  of the definition lies is word addressable.  If byte
                  values such as character  strings  are  subsequently
                  compiled into the definition, the alignment  may  be
                  lost.  Note that the length byte at NFA still  gives
                  the exact length of the name,  but  not  necessarily
                  the displacement to the LFA.  The alignment  may  be

          8086/8088 FIG-FORTH User's Guide                     Page 23



                  disabled by setting the ALIGN  option  to  FALSE  at
                  assembly time to save space. 
                       QUIT prints lower case "ok". 
                       ABORT prints the user version as well. 
                       COLD sets execution vectors. 
                       All system dependent  initialization  is  in  a
                  subroutine called SYSINIT, located in  4TH-SYSD.ASM,
                  which is called just prior  to  starting  the  inner
                  interpreter. 


          5.2.4  Installation Dependent Code



          5.2.4.1  Console I/O

                       KEY, EMIT, and  CR  were  changed  to  use  the
                  execution vectors @KEY, @EMIT, and @CR respectively.
                  These vectors are initialized to the CFA's of (KEY),
                  (EMIT) and (CR); but may be changed by  storing  new
                  CFA's in the vectors. 
                       Two options in 4TH-OPTS.H affect  console  i/o:
                  DIRECTCON and IOBITS.  If DIRECTCON is TRUE, console
                  i/o is performed by MS-DOS function six  and  seven,
                  which ignore all special characters.  Thus,  if  you
                  have an application which has to respond to ^P,  for
                  example, you should re-assemble with  DIRECTCON  set
                  to TRUE.  IOBITS is an equate which  determines  how
                  many bits to send/receive.  Normal  ASCII  terminals
                  don't use  the  MSB,  so  IOBITS  should  be  seven.
                  However, the IBM-PC uses all eight bits,  so  IOBITS
                  should  be  eight.   DIRECTCON  also   disables   ^C
                  interrupts, except during printer output. 


          5.2.4.2  Printer I/O

                       The variable  controlling  printer  output  was
                  changed to PRINTER.  If PRINTER is zero, no  printer
                  output occurs.  If PRINTER is positive, all  console
                  output also goes to  the  printer.   If  PRINTER  is
                  negative, output normally going to  the  console  is
                  sent only to the printer. 


          5.2.4.3  Disk I/O

                       The code to interface to the disk was  factored
                  into two parts.  All functions that  know  something
                  about the physical characteristics of the  disk  are
                  in the  4TH-DISK.ASM  file.   Every  other  function
                  knows only that disk blocks  are  1024  bytes  long.
                  This means that BLOCK-READ/WRITE must always deliver
                  1024 bytes and not one physical sector. 

          8086/8088 FIG-FORTH User's Guide                     Page 24



                       The  disk  read/write   routines   (BLOCK-READ,
                  BLOCK-WRITE)  were  changed  to  use  the  execution
                  vectors @BLKRD and @BLKWRT.  For normal  FORTH  disk
                  i/o, @BLKRD and @BLKWRT point to BLKRD  and  BLKWRT.
                  For screen file access, these  vectors  are  set  to
                  /BLOCK-READ and /BLOCK-WRITE. 
                       The variables DRIVE, RECORD,  REC/BLK  and  DTA
                  are set to the parameters used for each disk  access
                  and  may  be  examined  if  an  error  occurs.   The
                  variable DISK-ERROR is set to indicate  the  success
                  or failure of each disk operation.  If DISK-ERROR is
                  zero,  the  operation  was  successful.    Otherwise
                  DISK-ERROR has the MS-DOS error code as described in
                  its documentation,  except  that  write  errors  are
                  converted to negative numbers. 
                       The  buffer   management   was   also   changed
                  slightly.  When BUFFER has to flush a dirty block to
                  the disk, it checks and flushes ALL  dirty  buffers.
                  This requires very little additional  overhead,  and
                  it is  much  more  efficient  for  copying  multiple
                  blocks.

          5.2.7  RAM Workspace


          5.2.8  Memory Map

                       The memory map was  extended  to  use  all  64K
                  (LIMIT=0), and 8 1K byte block buffers.

                       COLD  sets  the  ^C  interrupt  vector  to  the
                  address of  a  code  fragment  which,  on  receiving
                  control after you  hit  ^C,  examines  the  variable
                  @BREAK.  If @BREAK is zero,  the  interrupt  handler
                  simply returns  from  the  interrupt  and  execution
                  continues.  Unfortunately, a "^C" is always sent  to
                  the console, and the key is not passed to FORTH.  If
                  @BREAK is non-zero, the  interrupt  handler  vectors
                  the inner interpreter to the (presumed CFA)  address
                  in @BREAK.  @BREAK is set at assembly  time  to  the
                  CFA of (ABORT), it is not initialized by  COLD.   If
                  the DIRECTCON option  is  selected,  almost  all  ^C
                  processing  is  disabled.   The  only  time   a   ^C
                  interrupt can occur is during printer output. 
                       BYE exits via INT 20H

          5.3  Additions

                  Two new features have been added in this version  of
                  FIG FORTH.   Command  line  argument  interpretation
                  allows  you  to  pass  instructions  to  FORTH  from
                  COMMAND.  Thus, you can run FORTH from a batch  file
                  if the program doesn't require any  terminal  input.
                  The file interface allows FORTH to share information
                  with other MS-DOS programs and utilities. 


          5.3.1  Command Line Interpretation

                  When FORTH starts execution, it copys any string  of
                  text on the  command  line  to  the  terminal  input
                  buffer, and interprets it just as if you  had  typed
                  it. 


          5.3.2  File Interface

                  The goal in developing the  file  interface  was  to
                  allow FORTH  useful  access  to  MS-DOS  files,  not
                  simply the random access  screens.   The  constraint
                  was that it had to be accomplished with a minimum of
                  change to the FIG model.  This discussion is not  as
                  complete as it could be.  The  reason  for  this  is
                  that the details will probably  change.   While  the
                  overall design is (hopefully) sound, the fine points
                  are not completely worked out.  As they are applied,
                  they will certainly be improved. 

                  There are two parts to the file interface:  the  low
                  level functions defined in 4TH-FILE.ASM and the high
                  level words in FILES.SCR.  The  low-level  functions
                  are little more  than  MS-DOS  function  calls  with
                  FORTH headers.  The high-level definitions  do  most
                  of  the  work,  making  it  easier  to  modify   the
                  interface. 

                  The words defined in FILES.SCR allow you  to  define
                  files in much the same  way  you  define  variables.
                  After a file has been defined, the name is  used  to
                  refer to it.  The name acts just  like  a  variable,
                  returning an address.  The  address  returned  is  a
                  pointer to the file header and file  control  block,
                  or FCB.  The header is a  word  of  data  where  the
                  file's attributes are kept, this header  address  is
                  referred to as the file descriptor,  or  FD.   These
                  attributes are only used by FORTH, MS-DOS never sees
                  them.  At present, the only  attributes  are:  read,
                  write, sequential/random access and open.  Following
                  the header is the FCB which MS-DOS  uses  while  the
                  file is open.

                  The first part of the FCB is the filespec.  This  is
                  the drive, filename and extension for the file,  and
                  is the name by which  MS-DOS  refers  to  the  file.
                  Before opening a file, these fields must  be  filled
                  in.  Assigning the filename is accomplished  by  two
                  methods, one for interactive use  and  one  for  use
                  inside definitions.  The word FNAME takes  a  target
                  address and a mode number on  the  stack.   It  then
                  parses the string at PAD (actually PAD+1, PAD  holds
                  the count byte), and returns a flag which is true if
                  the filename was ambiguous.  If FNAME finds that the
                  given filename is illegal (or  null)  it  prints  an
                  error and aborts. 

                  To assign a filename to a file  from  the  terminal,
                  the word /IS" is provided.  This function  takes  an
                  fd off the stack and assigns the following  word  in
                  the input stream as the filename.  The /IS" function
                  can be used in a definition, but it can't be used to
                  assign a filename to a file without console input. 

                  Once the file has been defined, and has a  name,  it
                  can be opened or created using  /OPEN,  or  /CREATE.
                  The file can be closed using /CLOSE. 

                  For character files, /GETC and /PUTC are provided to
                  read/write  one  character;  and  /READ  and  /WRITE
                  transfer a number of bytes at  once.   Screen  files
                  use /BLOCK-READ and /BLOCK-WRITE.   These  functions
                  are  called   indirectly   through   BLOCK-READ   or
                  BLOCK-WRITE.

          6.0  Glossary

                  This  section  is  a  glossary  of  words  added  or
                  changed, relative to FIG-FORTH v1.0.   The  name  of
                  the word is given,  then its stack effects, then the
                  type of definition, where the letter  indicates  the
                  type of definition:

                           C = code-level definition
                           : = colon definition
                           # = constant
                           ? = variable
                           U = user variable

                  and  the  second  letter   indicates   whether   the
                  definition was added  (+)  or  modified  (*).   And,
                  finally, the file where the word is defined.

          6.1  Assembly Listing Definitions

                  (2ARR)           n1 n2 PFA -- addr               C+ XTNS
                                  Two dimensional word array primitive
                  compiled  by  2ARRAY.   The  address  of  the  array
                  element at row n1, column n2, of an array  beginning
                  at addr+4 is left on the stack.  It is assumed  that
                  the number  of  columns  is  stored  at  addr.   The
                  contents of addr+2 could hold  the  number  of  rows
                  (perhaps for error checking), but it isn't  used  in
                  the calculation. 

                  (2CARR)          n1 n2 PFA -- addr2              C+ XTNS
                                  Two dimensional byte array primitive
                  compiled by  STRINGS.   The  address  of  the  array
                  element at row n1, column n2 of an  array  beginning
                  at PFA+4 is left on the stack.  It is  assumed  that
                  the row size is at PFA.  The contents of PFA+2 could
                  hold the number of rows, but it isn't  used  in  the
                  calculations. 

                  (ARRAY)          n PFA -- addr                   C+ XTNS
                                  Integer  array  primitive  used   by
                  ARRAY.  The address of the nth element of the  array
                  beginning at PFA+2 is calculated  and  left  on  the
                  stack.  The length of the array is stored at PFA. 

                  (BLKRD)          --                              C+ DISK
                                  Block  read  primitive   called   by
                  BLKRD.  This function calls the absolute  disk  read
                  function (INT 25) to access the disk.  This function
                  transfers REC/BLK records,  starting  at  RECORD  on
                  DRIVE to DTA.  The code returned by the interrupt is
                  placed in DISK-ERROR, zero indicating success. 

                  (BLKWRT)         --                              C+ DISK
                                  Block  write  primitive  called   by
                  BLKWRT.  This function transfers REC/BLK records  on
                  DRIVE starting at RECORD to DTA.   The  return  code
                  from INT 26H is negated and  placed  in  DISK-ERROR,
                  zero means success. 

                  (CARR)           n PFA -- addr                   C+ XTNS
                                  Byte  array  primitive  compiled  by
                  CARRAY.  The address of the  nth  character  in  the
                  array beginning at PFA+2 is calculated and  left  on
                  the stack.  The length of the array or  the  current
                  length of the string may be left at PFA.

                  (CLOSE)          FCB -- f                        C+ FILE
                                  Primitive  function  to  close   FCB
                  using  DOS  function  10H.   The  flag  is  zero  if
                  successful, 0FFH if not. 

                  (CREATE)         FCB -- f                        C+ FILE
                                  Create and open a file as  specified
                  in FCB using DOS function 16H.  The flag returned is
                  zero if successful, 0FFH if not. 

                  (FBLKRD)         FCB n -- f                      C+ FILE
                                  File  block  read  primitive.   This
                  function reads n  blocks  from  an  open  FCB.   The
                  blocks read are the size  specified  in  the  record
                  size field of the FCB.  For normal screen  files,  n
                  is always 1 and the  record  size  is  set  to  1024
                  bytes. 

                  (FBLKWRT)        FCB n -- f                      C+ FILE
                                  Write n blocks to the file specified
                  by FCB.  See (FBLKRD) above. 

                  (FIND)           a1 NFA -- [PFA b] f             C* MAIN
                                  (FIND)  was   modified   to   handle
                  aligned  dictionary  headers  (only  when  ALIGN  is
                  true).  The address list  following  the  header  is
                  aligned by inserting a  NOP  (90H)  after  the  last
                  character of the name field.  (FIND) must take  this
                  into account when looking up a name. 

                  (FNAME)          FCB addr1 n -- addr2 f          C+ FILE
                                  Parse  the  string  at  addr1  as  a
                  filename using mode n, and assign it  to  FCB.   The
                  first character not parsed and an ambiguous filename
                  are left on  the  stack.   This  function  uses  DOS
                  function 29H, which defines the modes. 

                  (OPEN)           FCB -- f                        C+ FILE
                                  Open the specified  FCB.   The  flag
                  returns the success or  failure  of  the  operation:
                  zero if successful, 0FFH otherwise. 

                  (READ)           FCB addr -- f                   C+ FILE
                                  Sequential      read      primitive.
                  Transfers the next record in the file  specified  by
                  FCB  to  addr.   The  status  of  the  operation  is
                  returned in  the  flag  f.   The  flag  is  zero  if
                  successful, 0FF if not. 

                  (WRITE)          FCB addr -- f                   C+ FILE
                                  Sequential write primitive.   Writes
                  the next record of the file specified  by  FCB  from
                  addr.  The flag returned by DOS function 15H is left
                  on the stack.

                  (XOF)                    n1 n2 -- [n1]           C+ XTNS
                                  Control structure primitive compiled
                  by OF.  If the case being scanned for  (n1)  matches
                  the current case (n2), the tag n1 is dropped and the
                  FORTH words following the branch compiled by OF  are
                  executed.  If the case tags don't match, n1 is  left
                  on the stack and the branch is executed to check the
                  next case. 

                  +BUF             addr1 -- addr2                  :* MAIN
                                  Advance the buffer pointer addr1  to
                  the next buffer at addr2.

                                  Subtract one from the item on top of
                  the stack.

                                  Subtract two from the item on top of
                  the stack. 

                  ?FIRST           FCB addr -- f                   C+ FILE
                                  Search the disk  directory  for  the
                  first occurance of FCB.  The flag returned  is  zero
                  if none are found, 0FF otherwise.   If  a  match  is
                  found, its directory entry is placed at addr. 

                  ?NEXT            addr FCB -- f                   C+ FILE
                                  Search for  the  next  occurance  of
                  FCB.  The search FCB must previously have  been  set
                  up by ?FIRST.  If a match is found, f will  be  0FFH
                  and the matching directory entry  will  be  left  at
                  addr. 

                  @BLKRD           - addr                          U+ MAIN
                                  Execution vector holding the CFA  of
                  a function to read one block from  the  disk.   This
                  vector is either BLKRD  for  FORTH  disk  access  or
                  FBLKRD for screen file access.  BLOCK-READ uses this
                  vector. 

                  @BLKWRT          - addr                          U+ MAIN
                                  Execution vector holding the CFA  of
                  a function to write one block  to  the  disk.   This
                  vector is either BLKWRT for  FORTH  disk  access  or
                  FBLKWRT for screen file  access.   BLOCK-WRITE  uses
                  this vector. 

                  @BREAK           -- addr                                 ?+ SYSD
                                  Execution vector holding the CFA  of
                  the function to be executed on input if  a  ^C.   If
                  @BREAK  is  zero,  the  interrupt   handler   simply
                  returns, effectively ignoring the interrupt.

                  BLK/DRIVE        -- n                            #+ DISK
                                  Constant returning the number of  1K
                  disk blocks per drive. 

                  BLKRD            addr blk --                     :+ DISK
                                  This function  reads  block  blk  to
                  addr.  This is basically an  interface  between  the
                  BLOCK-READ function and the (BLKRD) functions. 

                  BLKWRT           addr blk --                     :+ DISK
                                  This function writes block blk  from
                  addr.  This is basically an  interface  between  the
                  BLOCK-WRITE function and the (BLKWRT) functions. 

                  BLOCK            n -- addr                       :* MAIN
                                  BLOCK was modified to  check  for  a
                  disk error. 

                  BLOCK-READ       addr blk --                     :+ MAIN
                                  Read one block to addr.   Calls  the
                  function whose CFA is in @BLKRD  to  do  the  actual
                  transfer. 

                  BLOCK-WRITE      addr blk --                     :+ MAIN
                                  Write one block  from  addr.   Calls
                  the function whose CFA  is  in  @BLKWRT  to  do  the
                  actual transfer. 

                  BUFFER           n -- addr                       :* MAIN
                                  This function was modified to  flush
                  all dirty buffers when one is found. 

                  COLD             --                              :* MAIN

                  next word in the input stream.  CREATE was  modified
                  to align the address list.  The ALIGN option must be

                  are  n1=month,  n2=day,  n3=year.   If  any  of  the
                  parameters are out of range, no change is made. 

                  DATE@            -- n1 n2 n3                     C+ XTNS
                                  Date fetch operator.  The parameters
                  are  n1=month,  n2=day,  n3=year.   If  any  of  the
                  parameters are out of range, no change is made.

                                  Variable holding the address of  the
                  last disk transfer operation.  This variable is  set
                  by R/W for use by the transfer functions. 

                  EMIT             c --                            :* MAIN
                                  Function  to  do  character  output.
                  Calls the function whose CFA is in @EMIT to  do  the
                  actual output. 

                  EMPTY-BUFFERS    --                              :* MAIN
                                  This function was  modified  to  set
                  emptied buffers to block 32767.  FIG-FORTH set  them
                  to zero.

                  FDEL             FCB -- f                        C+ FILE
                                  Delete the file  specified  by  FCB.
                  The  flag  returned  is  zero  if  successful,  0FFH
                  otherwise. 

                  FREN             addr -- f                       C+ FILE

                                  Character input function.  KEY calls
                  the function  whose  CFA  is  in  @KEY  to  get  the
                  character.

                  LC@              seg off -- b                    C+ XTNS
                                  Intersegment fetch/store  operators.
                  These are similar to  the  usual  FORTH  fetch/store
                  words, except they use a double-word address.   Note
                  that   the    absolute    location    accessed    is
                  seg*16+offset. 

                  MAXBLOCK         -- n                            #+ DISK
                                  Constant returning the highest legal
                  block number.  That is, BLK/DRIVE*(MAXDRIVE+1)-1. 

                  MAXDRIVE         -- n                            #+ DISK

                  drive number. 

                  MYSEG            -- seg                          C+ MYSEG
                                  This  word  returns  the  value   of
                  FORTH's  current  segment.   This  allows  the  long
                  fetch/store operators  to  access  locations  inside
                  FORTH easily.

                                  These  functions  can   adjust   for
                  aligned definitions, if  ALIGN  is  selected  during

                                  Flag controlling printer output.  If
                  PRINTER is zero, nothing is sent to the printer.  If
                  PRINTER is positive, output to the console also goes
                  to the printer.   If  PRINTER  is  negative,  output
                  normally going to the console will be  sent  to  the
                  printer only.  Note that this is independent of  the
                  ^P/^N printer echo!

                                  This function was modified to simply
                  pass the addr  and  blk  on  to  the  BLOCK-READ  or
                  BLOCK-WRITE functions. 

                  REC/BLK          -- n                            #+ DISK
                                  Constant  returning  the  number  of
                  disk records required to fill one 1024 byte  buffer.
                  All disk accesses look to FORTH like  they  transfer
                  1K of data.

                                  Variable  holding  the  disk  record
                  number where the last block  accessed  began.   That
                  is, if the last block accessed was  2,  then  record
                  would contain 2*REC/BLK.  This variable  is  set  by
                  D&RCALC for use by (BLKRD)/(BLKWRT).

                                  This function saves  the  buffer  at
                  addr if it has been updated.  The buffer is  flushed
                  but not emptied. 

                  SAVE-BUFFERS     --                              :+ MAIN
                                  This  function   flushes   all   the
                  buffers but doesn't  empty  them.   SAVE-BUFFERS  is
                  called by BUFFER when it finds a dirty buffer.

                  TIME@            -- n1 n2                        C+ XTNS
                                  Set/fetch  the  system  time.    The
                  parameters  are  n1=[sec/csec],  n2=[hr/min];   each
                  quantity is a byte, but the four are packed  into  2
                  words.  Note that the low byte of the top stack item
                  has the minutes, the high byte holds the hours,  and
                  so on.  If any of the parameters are out  of  range,
                  there is no effect.

                                  This word displays the  contents  of
                  memory from addr1 to addr2-1.  The address  left  on
                  the stack can be used to  continue  dumping  without
                  having to keep track of the address.   The  dump  is
                  given in the current number base.  A variable  named
                  SEGMENT is used as the base, with addr1  then  being
                  an offset in that segment.  SEGMENT  is  initialized
                  to MYSEG. 

                  NEW              --                              :+ UTIL.SCR
                                  NEW updates the start-up  parameters
                  to reflect the current state of FORTH.  This  allows
                  compiled definitions to be  retained  when  COLD  is
                  executed.  Note that if you FORGET the  added  words
                  after executing NEW, the start-up parameters will be
                  wrong, and NEW must  be  run  again  before  a  cold
                  start.

          7.0  Future Extensions

                  This version includes almost all of the extensions I
                  had planned to implement in the "immediate  future".
                  It will be work enough fixing bugs  and  tuning  the
                  revisions in  this  package,  without  shooting  for
                  major revisions. 

                  But, my list for  the  questionable  future  remains
                  intact:

                           Cross/target compiler
                           Code level floating point/8087 support
                           Multisegmented > 64K
                           Multitasking
                           Tree structured vocabularies/file system
                           High-level interrupt handling

                  Should any of  these  interest  you,  or  spark  any
                  comments,  I  would  be  happy  to  talk  or  trade.
                  Specifically, I would really love to have some  kind
                  of floating point package: this is  my  last  excuse
                  for writing ANYTHING in BASIC! 

                  The MACRO-86 assembler is really cumbersome at  this
                  kind of work, and FORTH is ideally suited to writing
                  new FORTHs.  If I  can  get  metaFORTH  going,  that
                  would make a nice project.

                      Appendix A - Using Execution Vectors



          The i/o functions in this version of FORTH have been changed
          to use execution vectors.  An execution vector is  a  simple
          way to allow the user to substitute a different function for
          the function which is vectored in this way. 


          A.1  Concepts

          The way an execution vector works is quite simple.   If  you
          are familiar with the concept of pointers to data,  this  is
          nothing new, for execution  vectors  are  only  pointers  to
          functions.  The pointer may be changed to hold  the  address
          of any function, and  as  long  as  the  specified  function
          expects and returns the same parameters and result,  no  one
          knows the difference. 

          The FORTH interpreter functions on this principle: it inputs
          a word, looks it up in the dictionary, and executes it.  The
          interpreter can totally ignore the action taken by the words
          it executes.  In standard FORTH, the function which executes
          a word is called EXEC.  The address that EXEC expects on the
          stack differs between FORTHs.   In  FIG-FORTH,  the  address
          must be a Code Field Address, or CFA.  The address  returned
          by the dictionary search words ( ' and -FIND) is a Parameter
          Field Address (PFA).   Thus,  to  look  up  a  word  in  the
          dictionary, you can type

                   ' MY-WORD

          but to find and execute MY-WORD, you would type

                   ' MY-WORD CFA EXEC

          This is totally equivalent to just typing MY-WORD. 

          In  this  way,  any  function  can  be  vectored  through  a
          variable: the variable holds the CFA of the function  to  be
          executed.  Instead of executing the function  directly,  the
          variable is fetched and the CFA stored  there  is  executed.
          Now, instead of jumping  directly  to  code  which  sends  a
          character to the console, KEY fetches the variable @KEY, and
          does whatever is at that CFA.  The definition of KEY is thus

                   : KEY @KEY @ EXEC ;

          To change the function of KEY, you just  store  a  different
          CFA in @KEY.  The new function can be defined after KEY, and
          any function which uses KEY will now call the new  function.
          The  danger  here  should  be  obvious:  if  the  substitute
          8086/8088 FIG-FORTH User's Guide                     Page 41
          Appendix A - Using Execution Vectors



          function doesn't have the same stack effects as the standard
          function, FORTH is going to get really confused. 


          A.2  An Example

          Although this arrangement  is  slightly  more  complex,  the
          power and flexibility make it well worth the  extra  effort.
          The following example should make this clear. 

          Suppose you want to do all input in  capital  letters  only.
          You could write  your  own  specialized  input  routine,  or
          simply define an upper-case-only version of KEY and redirect
          KEY to that function.  Here is the definition  for  the  new
          KEY:

                   : UC-KEY
                        (KEY) DUP 96 > OVER 123 < AND
                        IF ( a-z )
                           32 -
                        THEN ;

          Now all you have  to  do  is  set  @KEY  to  point  to  your
          function:

                   ' UC-KEY CFA @KEY ! 

          and any lower case letter will be converted automatically to
          upper case.  To restore KEY to the original action,  restore
          @KEY to (KEY):

                   ' (KEY) CFA @KEY ! 

          Note that UC-KEY still calls (KEY)  to  get  the  character.
          While this is usually the case, it  is  not  necessary:  you
          could change KEY to get characters from any  source.   Also,
          be careful that you don't call the  vectored  function  from
          within your replacement.  If KEY had been  used  instead  of
          (KEY)  in  the  definition  above,  once   @KEY   had   been
          re-assigned you  would  have  a  good  example  of  infinite
          recursion!  Actually it isn't infinite - FORTH  dies  rather
          quickly... 

          This discussion applies to all  of  the  i/o  words,  except
          ?TERMINAL.  The block i/o functions are re-assigned in  this
          way to use the screen files.  There are more elegant ways of
          implementing execution vectors, which bypass  the  need  for
          separate variables, but  they  require  new  defining  words
          which  would  have  been  inconvenient  to  define  in   the
          assembler source.

                        Appendix B - Building FORTH.COM



          The following example serves several  functions.   It  is  a
          real session with FORTH, it shows how the FORTH.COM file was
          constructed, and, it demonstrates how to modify and save new
          versions of FORTH. 

          After assembling the FORTH source, you are left with a  bare
          kernel.  To add the  utilities,  editor  and  file  handling
          functions, several things have to be done:

               1) The file interface screens must be transferred to  a
                  FORTH disk.  This process involves  using  DEBUG  to
                  load the file and write it to the FORTH disk. 

               2) The file interface is LOADed from the FORTH disk. 

               3) The utilities and editor  are  /LOAD"ed  from  their
                  files. 

               4) FORTH is reset to make the additions permanent,  and
                  the version number is changed. 

               5) The utilities for saving FORTH are loaded  and  used
                  to write the new FORTH to a .COM file. 

          The following session was  copied  from  a  listing  of  the
          commands to build FORTH.COM.   An  ellipsis  indicates  that
          part of the listing has been left out. 

          This example assumes that you have a FORTH disk in drive  A,
          and your FORTH system disk with  FORTH.COM  and  the  screen
          files in drive B. 





                   B:DEBUG FILES.SCR
                   -W 100 0 64 20
                   -Q
                   B:

          Here, DEBUG has loaded the MS-DOS file interface screens  in
          FILES.SCR and then written the screens to disk A starting at
          screen 100.  This assumes that one record holds one  screen.
          You will have to adjust the record numbers if  this  is  not
          the case.

          After assembling FORTH and grabbing a snack while MASM chugs
