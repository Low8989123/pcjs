                         VENDOR.DOC file for TUTOR.COM
                                      by
                               Computer Knowledge

The copying restrictions in this file apply to any individual, organization,
user group, or business that charges ANY fee for the distribution of the
Shareware program TUTOR.COM produced by Computer Knowledge.

TUTOR.COM and its associated tutorial files is NOT a public domain program.
All program and data files are Copyright 1985-1989, Computer Knowledge with
all rights reserved.  Distribution restriction rights are claimed under that
copyright and are outlined below.

- No organization may sell the Shareware version of TUTOR.COM without prior
  written permission from Computer Knowledge.  To apply for such permission
  send a request to:
                       Computer Knowledge
                       PO Box 91176
                       Los Angeles, CA 90009

  Vendor standards expected of distributors are summarized below in this
  file.  Under no condition will permission to distribute be given to
  any organization who does not agree to follow the standards.  The vendor
  standards are based on those established for vendor associate members
  of the Association of Shareware Professionals.  ASP vendor members will
  be granted permission to distribute TUTOR.COM; if you are already a member
  of ASP, please mention that in your request for permission to distribute.
  ASP vendor members are automatically placed on our mailing list.  If you
  are not an ASP vendor member you will be charged a mailing fee of $5 for
  Computer Knowledge to provide you with a disk.

- The TUTOR.COM program or files may not be sold as part of some other more
  inclusive package without permission of Computer Knowledge.

- Under no condition will the program be "rented" or leased to others.

- Printed copies of the tutorials may not be distributed in any form without
  a license from Computer Knowledge.

- Any distribution of TUTOR.COM over bulletin boards and/or national
  telecommunication services will be limited to distributing a single
  archived file containing the contents of the entire distribution disk
  and NO charge above the standard charge for connect time will be allowed.

                            =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The following is a summary of ASP vendor standards.  This summary is just
that, a summary, and is not to be taken as a statement of the entire set
of ASP standards.

Advertising:

  All vendor advertisements and brochures must state that "Shareware programs
  require separate payment to authors if found useful."  This statement must
  immediately follow the price or be tied to the price via an asterisk.

Catalogs:

  Vendors will attempt to educate users on the nature of Shareware.  The
  following points must be covered in any catalog of disks:

  -  The fee paid to the vendor is a distribution charge and does not cover
     the cost of the program itself.

  -  If the user finds a Shareware program to be of use, he/she is expected
     to send the registration fee to the author.

  -  Registration entitles the user to various rights and benefits (depending
     on the author).  These range from the legal right to continue using
     the software, to printed documentation and/or higher levels of service.

Distribution:

  Vendors will respect the copyright and all distribution restrictions made
  by individual authors, usually found in the file VENDOR.DOC [this file] on
  the disk.

  Vendors will provide a written notice covering the three concepts above
  with all Shareware programs shipped.  If disks are pre-packaged, the
  notice must be on a visible part of the package.

  Vendors will not change or delete ANY files supplied with the program
  unless authorized by the author.  Small additions designed to assist the
  user may be added if the author does not specifically prohibit such action.

  Vendors agree to stop distributing a program, including earlier versions,
  if requested by the author.

Again, the above is a SUMMARY of the ASP vendor standards.  In order to
distribute TUTOR.COM you must agree to abide by these standards, ASP member
or not.  If you are interested in becoming an ASP-approved vendor, please
contact:
             Vendor Membership Coordinator
             Association of Shareware Professionals
             PO Box 5786
             Bellevue, WA 98006

                            =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

To those organizations given permission to distribute TUTOR.COM, Computer
Knowledge will forward a master disk keyed to that organization (a charge of
$5 will be levied on non-ASP vendors).  Automatic updates will be provided to
organizations when registrations can be traced to that organization. Updates
will be offered to other approved organizations on a fee basis to cover the
costs of distribution.

  TUTOR.COM is produced by a member of the Association of Shareware
  Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure that the Shareware principle
  works for you.  If you are unable to resolve a Shareware-related problem
  with an ASP member by contacting the member directly, ASP may be able to
  help.  The ASP Ombudsman can help you resolve a dispute or problem with
  an ASP member, but does not provide technical support for members' products.
  Please write to the ASP Ombudsman at PO Box 5786, Bellevue, WA 98006 or
  send a Compuserve message via easyplex to ASP Ombudsman 70007,3536.
