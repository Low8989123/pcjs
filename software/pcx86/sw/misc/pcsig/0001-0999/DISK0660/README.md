## Information about "EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM"

    The EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 4.3 is a highly-accurate
    personality analysis system that is designed to reduce employee
    turnover and improve management/ employee communications.  It is also
    excellent for use in personal relationships.
    
    Reducing employee turnover is a very important consideration to the
    business owner/ manager; employee turnover is extremely expensive. EMS
    works in 5 ways:
    1. It helps you to know the work personalities of your job
    applicants.
    2. It presents to you the preferred work characteristics of your
    employees.
    3. It presents motivational and demotivational factors.
    4. It shows job personality characteristics, those traits that can
    be used to strengthen the work environment.
    5. The history function helps you refer back to previous
    applicants and employees when additional information is required. EMS is
    intended to improve communications between people and
    enhance the ability of the personnel manager to interview potential
    employees, as well as improve current employee relations.  EMS is also
    valuable as a personal communications tool between friends, marriage
    mates and any other relationship where personality is a strong
    component.
