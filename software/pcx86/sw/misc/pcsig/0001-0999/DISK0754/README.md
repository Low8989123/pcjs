## Information about "PORTRAC (FORMERLY UVESTOR)"

    PORTRAC is perfect for any investor who needs a versatile and flexible
    investments tracking program.  PORTRAC keeps track of investments and
    evaluates their true return on a time-related basis.  It can handle 999
    individual investor accounts with up to 396 investments for each
    account.
    
    PORTRAC tracks all transactions of any investment, whether a stock, a
    bond, fixed dollar-denominated investment, or an appreciable
    dollar-denominated investment such as real estate.  It reads an
    individual investment report and quickly computes the internal rate of
    return.  It produces a portfolio showing the investment name, file name,
    cost, present value, and gain or loss of the portfolio.  It graphically
    and numerically presents the risk balance of the portfolio.  You can get
    the total portfolio or selected portfolios by investment type.  PORTRAC
    also produces net worth statements, amortized loan tables and provides
    six additional interest rate programs.
    
    A major feature of the program is it can read an investment file and
    quickly compute the internal rate of return of the investment.  With
    complete and accurate records of investments, along with a measure of
    the true time-related return of an investment, you can determine your
    future investment policy.  The multiple account capability lets you set
    up an account for investment studies.  With hypothetical investments,
    you can measure the internal rate of return on the forecasted
    investment.  It is very difficult to manually evaluate the true return
    of an investment that had investments at different times, cash flow at
    variable intervals and in varying amounts, and sale of the investment at
    various time intervals and prices.  PORTRAC will do this for you.
    
    PORTRAC is menu-driven and easy to use.  It has a demonstration account
    with files for quick familiarization.  You can view reports and print
    them.  These features and others make PORTRAC the perfect investment
    tracker and counselor.
