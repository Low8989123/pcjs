## Information about "ADVENTURE AND MUSIC COLLECTION"

    You are in a spaceship exploring the Orion Nebula for NASA.  Your
    mission is to explore the three closest planets to your spaceship and
    collect one animal, one vegetable, and one mineral.  How will you be
    able to tell?  If you encounter an intelligent life form, how will you
    know?  NASA has instructed you to capture it alive.  Good luck!
    
    A text adventure game that takes you to the heart of Africa. In DARK
    CONTINENT, you are on a safari expedition in search of King Solomon's
    legendary diamond. Unfortunately, your native followers have mutinied
    and left you lost in the wilderness without a map. Not only must you
    find the diamond, but also, your way back to England. (And try not to
    get eaten by wildlife on the way!)

                             HOW TO START THE GAME

         To start Nebula, use the following instructions.

              1.  Start your computer in the usual manner.
              2.  Insert the game disk into Drive A.
              3.  Type A: and press Enter.
              4.  Type NEBULA and press Enter.
              5.  Follow the instructions on the screen.

              To start Dark Continent you would use the same steps
         as shown for Nebula, only at step 4 you would type DARKCON
         instead of NEBULA.  If you are using a monochrome monitor
         or a one color graphics monitor you should add an M to the
         end of step 4, (e.g. NEBULA M).  This will allow the screen
         to be more readable on these monitors.



                                  HOW TO PLAY

              A text adventure is a fictional novel in which you
         are the main character.  You will be given a quest which you
         must successfully complete.  You may also be asked to
         collect treasures during your travels.

              Your PC will become your guide.  It will tell you what
         it sees and hears, and will obey your commands, (most of the
         time).  Although it speaks fluent English, it has trouble
         understanding long sentences.  Please limit your commands to
         not more than two words, with the verb as the first word
         (e.g.  throw ball).  If the computer does not know or
         understand a word, it will tell you so.  In that case, please
         use another word of similar meaning.

              We strongly advise you to build a map during your
         travels so that you can easily return to previously explored
         areas.

              The computer will give you the following information at
         the start of each round of play:

              1.  A description of your current location.
              2.  Items that you can see at this location.
              3.  Directions in which you can move (n-north, s-south,
                  e-east, w-west, u-up, d-down)
              4.  Treasures will be marked by an '*' before and after
                  the word.

         You must then respond by typing the action you wish to
         perform.






                                      -4-








                                 * * HINTS * *

         Most actions require two words such as:
              Light torch
              Get ruby
              Drop axe
              Examine door

         However, some actions need only one word:
              Help - for clues or advice
              Quit - to stop playing

         Others only need a single letter:
            U,D,N,S,E,W - which mean go up, go down, go north, etc.
            L - look to see where you are
            I - list your inventory.

         To save your current status so that you can resume play
         later, type SAVE GAME.

                      SO WHY PAY $15.00 TO REGISTER?



              When you pay for Nebula or Dark Continent you
         participate in User-Supported software.  That means you join
         thousands of people who get good quality software at
         affordable prices.  Here are more reasons to register by
         paying $15.00:

              - The luxury of trying out a program before you buy it
         is rare.  When you register (by sending in your money) you
         are saying, "I support buying software this way; and truly
         want to help continue this trend of keeping prices down."

              - Registering also means you will be notified about
         updates to Nebula and Dark Continent, as well as other
         adventures.

              - If you are using the product, you should pay for it.
         What it boils down to is this - it's the right thing to do.

              - As an extra incentive, you will receive a FREE COPY
         of ANY ONE of our other text adventures when you register.
         And if you register both adventures ($30), you will receive
         FREE COPIES of any TWO adventures!

              SANCTUARY -- A nuclear war has devastated the Earth.

         roam the land.  You must find a sanctuary to ensure your
         survival.  Have you ever wondered what civilization would be
         like following a nuclear war?  Would there be a SANCTUARY for
