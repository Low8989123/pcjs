Program description:
 
This diskette contains two well developed adventure games from J.
Button.  These games are Castaway and South America Trek.  Each games is
part of Button's adventure series which is advertised at the start of
each game.  In Castaway, the player is shipwrecked from the Cargo
vessel, "Katie Sue," from a sea storm.  The player must survive without
supplies or any apparent help.  This is a player interactive game for
novice adventure players.  Button gives quite a bit of help for this
one.  The next game, South American Trek, takes its player on a tour of
the South American countries.  Button says this adventure game is for
educational purposes; the players learns geography while attempting to
collect information for the United States.  In the game, the player is
deposited in South America by a US submarine and ordered to collect data
for the Federal Geographical Bureau then return to the submarine.  Each
program is well developed and easy to play; just follow the screen
instructions.  Both programs will run directly from DOS. These programs
will run with either monochrome or color monitors and do require at
least 128k to operate. Educators will especially find South America Trek
of great value for teaching students basic geography in a not so
conservative manner.
