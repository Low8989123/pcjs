## Information about "DFSTICKL"

    A menu-driven calendar/tickler program designed to display certain
    previously-entered memos on certain dates.
    
    Once the program is called, the screen immediately shows you any memos
    for that particular day.  DFSTICKL can also be executed by putting this
    file in an AUTOEXEC.BAT file so the memos for that day will be displayed
    upon start-up.  After you've read them, exit to DOS and get on with your
    business.
    
    DFSTICKL is designed to remind you of personal priorities, important
    dates, and things that need to be done for the day.  There is a ``nag''
    option that will haunt you about a certain memo five days prior to the
    date or deadline.
    
    You can add, edit, delete, and display any memos in the system.  This
    program is very useful not only for personal use, but also for leaving
    notes, memos, and reminders to the other people who use the same
    computer.
    
    Execute any program in any directory or subdirectory. Go immediately
    from application to application in different directories just by typing
    the name of the program -- or even a partial name if you have forgotten
    the whole name.  If there are several programs that match your partial
    entry, XCUTE will list each matching program individually and will ask
    you if that is the program you wish to execute. When using a hard disk
    and thousands of programs, XCUTE will do the work of finding your
    program and will even execute it for you.
