   INTRODUCTION

   "Profit/Share/Ware"tm, a concept developed by Candour Publishing Inc., is a
   market  strategy  designed  to  allow  good software developers a return on
   their  investment  while  rewarding  the  honest  user  of   shareware   an
   opportunity to "profit" through "share"ing of soft"ware" distribution.  The
   process  is  controlled by Candour Publishing Inc.  so little effort and no
   paper work is required,  but the profit sharing can be very  rewarding  for
   both the user and the developer.


   MARKET STRATEGY

   The  concept  is what we call a marketing tree,  similar to a decision tree
   matrix where a  "registered"  owner  of  a  "Profit/Share/Ware"tm  product,
   distributes copies of his registered copy,  which contain a serial # unique
   to him.  This person is now regarded as a "series 0" user,  and is asked to
   redistribute  the software with his unique serial # to others,  in the same
   ways that shareware is distributed.   The people he has distributed  to  on
   registering    their  copy will receive their own serial #,  and will cause
   part of the registration fee to be  returned  to  the  original  registered
   owner  (these people are identified on the next page as "series 1").   When
   the "series 1" users register their copies  two things occur:

        1.   They facilitate the continuation of the original "series
             0" user's marketing tree.

        2.   They become  "series  0"  users.    Starting  their  own
             marketing  tree  themselves,  this  allows  them  to  be
             rewarded as "series 0" users.


   These series continue through four  (4)  profit  sharing  levels  for  each
   "series 0" registered user.

   This  method  of compensation or profit sharing,  has been proven to be the
   fairest in rewarding the most active  people  throughout  the  distribution
   process  and  provides  the  original  developer  a means to publish and be
   rewarded for good product development - not available before.

   Please see the following pages for further information.









                                                                             4



   REGISTERED USERS:

   When you register a copy  of  a  "Profit/Share/Ware"tm  product,  you  will
   receive  a  new  copy  of  the  product along with a new serial # unique to
   yourself - for further distribution,  manuals &  associated  documentation,
   bulletins on the latest from Candour Publishing Inc., and reduced rates for
   product upgrades.

   You  should  then  distribute the software with your registered serial # to
   other interested parties, as per normal shareware procedures.

   This makes  you  a  "series  0"  user  and  entitles  you  to  10%  of  the
   registration price on all further registrations with your serial # on it.

   To you,  these new registered users, with your serial # on their copy,  are
   "series 1",  and all who register under them will entitle you to a  further
   8% of their registration price.

   To you, these new registered users under "series 1" are "series 2", and all
   who register under them will entitle you to 7% of the registration price of
   these new users.

   To  you,  these additional registered users that have registered under your
   "series 2" users, are now your "series 3" users, and all who register under
   them, become your "series 4" users, entitling you to 5% of the registration
   price.


   Note:     All  registered  users  will  receive   a   new   copy   of   the
             "Profit/Share/Ware"tm  with  there own distribution serial #.
             All registered users will then become  "series  0"  user  and
             start the marketing strategy working in their favor.























                                                                             5



   EXAMPLE  of  profit  sharing  of  a  "Profit/Share/Ware"tm  product,   with
   registration fee of $30.00:

        You   have   just   received   your   registered   copy   of   the
        "Profit/Share/Ware"tm  product,  with  it's  own  unique serial #.
        This makes you a "series 0" user.

        If you distribute the copy,  with your serial # to  5  people  who
        register their product,  via normal shareware distribution methods
        (ie. bulletin boards, user groups, schools, friends, work,  etc.),
        you will have created 5 "series 1" users under you.  This entitles
        you to the following profit sharing renumeration:

             5 x ($30.00 x 10%) or $15.00.


        If these "series 1" users distribute to 5 people each who register
        their product,  they will have created 25 "series 2" users for you
        (as well as 5 "series 1" users for themselves).  This entitles you
        to:

             5 x (5 x ($30.00 x 8%)) or $60.00.


        If these "series 2" users distribute to 5 people each who register
        their product,  they will have created 125 "series  3"  users  for
        you.  This entitles you to:

             5 x (5 x (5 x ($30.00 x 7%))) or $262.50.


        If these "series 3" users distribute to 5 people each who register
        their  product,  they  will  have created 625 "series 4" users for
        you.  This entitles you to:

             5 x (5 x (5 x (5 x ($30.00 x 5%)))) or $937.00.


   At this point you as the "series 0" user will have been  rewarded,  in  the
   form of profit sharing, $1274.50.

   As  you  can  see  the  rewards of distribution can be quite attractive and
   there are no limits set as to the number of copies a "series 0"  registered
   user  can distribute.   The more "series 1" registered users he distributes
   to, the greater the rewards.

   Caution:  If you delay to long in registering  &  distributing,  you  could
             lose potential profit sharing to someone else.

   SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

        PROMANtm  will run on an IBM PC, XT, AT, or true compatible with at
        least 256k of free memory (512k with usage tracking), a Hard Disk as
        Drive 'C:', DOS 3.XX, and the file 'COMMAND.COM' present in your ROOT
        directory, 'C:\'.


   INSTALLING PROMANtm

        -    To install PROMANtm on your system, you must have all of the
             unarchived distribution files (see Appendix A for a list of
             the files) in a directory on your hard disk drive

        -    From the DOS prompt, type "INSTALL"


        This  will  install  PROMANtm  on  you  hard   drive,   in   directory
        'C:\PROMAN'.    It also installs a file in the ROOT directory,  'C:\',
        called 'START'.   This file allows you to start PROMANtm    by  typing
        "\START" whenever you are on drive 'C:', at the DOS prompt.

        To  have  PROMANtm automatically start when you system is reset,  have
        the last line of your 'AUTOEXEC.BAT' file as '\START'.

   HELP SCREENS

        Help Screens  are  activity  sensitive  and  will  provide  sufficient
        information  in  the mode currently active.   They can be activated by
        hitting 'f1' at any time.


   MAIN MENU SCREEN

        PROMANtm allows up to four pages of menu driven  software  activities,
        referred  to as activities/programs,  located on your hard disk drive.
        (See Menu Maintenance for placement of activities on your screen.)

        Their are two ways of selecting an activity/program; you may press the
        alpha character beside the description of the activity/program desired
        or you may use combinations  of  the  cursor  keys  to  highlight  the
        activity/program desired, then hit 'RETURN'.

             Using the cursor keys:

             'PgUp/PgDn'    : Moves the selector bar to the previous/next
                              page of activities/programs
             'Left/Right'   : Moves the selector bar to the left/right or
                              to the previous/next page, depending on its
                              current position
             'Up/Down'      : Moves the selector bar up/down or to the
                              previous/next page, depending on its current
                              position
             'End'          : Moves the selector bar to the last item on
                              page 4
             'Home'         : Moves the select bar to the first item on
                              page 1


        This  simple process will immediately take you to the activity/program
        requested.   If password protection is active for the activity/program
        selected, entry of the correct password will be required before access
        to the activity/program requested will be permitted.

        It  is  recommended  that you experiment with the cursor keys,  at the
        Main Menu, to become accustomed to their functions.









                                                                            12



                              PROMANtm users manual




   A note about PASSWORDS:

        On the following pages and while  using  PROMANtm  you  will  come
        across  references  to  PASSWORDS.    PROMANtm  has two distinctly
        different type of PASSWORDS.   First,  PROMANtm has a system level
        PASSWORD  which  can only be changed or set in the CHANGE PASSWORD
        function of the SYSTEM MANAGER.   It is used to control access  to
        various PROMANtm features.  Secondly, PROMANtm allows for PASSWORD
        PROTECTION  of  each of the activities/programs listed on the MAIN
        MENU.   These PASSWORDS are set/changed from the MENU  MAINTENANCE
        function of the SYSTEM MANAGER.


        Note:     If a PASSWORD is entered in upper case,  it must be
                  typed in upper case when requested.  And similarly,
                  if a PASSWORD is entered in lower case,  it must be
                  typed in lower case when requested.   This adds one
                  more level of security.  And remember, DON'T FORGET
                  YOUR PASSWORDS!


   SYSTEM MANAGER

        To move to the SYSTEM MANAGER hit 'f10', when in the MAIN MENU.   This
        will  allow  you  to  update  and  select various utilities built into
        PROMANtm.  (To return to the MAIN MENU,  while in the SYSTEM  MANAGER,
        hit 'Esc' or 'f10').

        It  is  through  the  SYSTEM  MANAGER  that  the user accesses most of
        PROMANs'tm  built in functions/utilities.    These  function/utilities
        are:

         - MENU MAINTENANCE
         - LOG ON
         - LOG OFF
         - SHUTDOWN SYSTEM
         - SET TIME/DATE
         - USAGE TRACKING
         - RESET USER LOG
         - ENCRYPT/DECRYPT
         - EXIT TO DOS
         - CHANGE PASSWORD

        To  select  one  of the SYSTEM MANAGERs' utilities,  use the 'Up/Down'
        keys to point to the function desired, then hit 'Enter'.   When in any
        of  the utilities,  the 'Esc' key exits that utility without modifying
        anything.



                                                                            13



                              PROMANtm users manual




        The following is an introduction to  each  of  the  functions  of  the
        SYSTEM MANAGER and their operations:


        MENU MAINTENANCE

        This  function  is  where  all  of  the  information  is  entered  for
        activities/programs  to  be  accessed  from  the  MAIN  MENU.     MENU
        MAINTENANCE  requires  that  you  know the following about each of the
        activities/programs you wish to work with:

        -    DESCRIPTION
        -    PATH (precede with '\')
        -    FILE NAME (used to start the activity/application)
        -    COMMAND (This refers to  any  additional  information  necessary,
             such  as a toggle,  'DIR /W',  where '/W' would be entered as the
             command).

        Also,   you  may  specify  a   PASSWORD   and   ENCRYPTion/DESCRYPTion
        information, see notes on PASSWORDS and notes on SECURITY.

        When  entering  the  above  information  the  following  commands  are
        available:

        'Ctrl/D'       Erases  all  information  regarding   this   particular
                       activity/program
        'Del'          Erases the current input line
        'Enter'        Accepts the current input line and advances to the next
                       input line
        'Esc'          Exits  from  the  current  activity/program leaving all
                       information unchanged
        'End'          Accepts all changes and extis


        LOG ON

        Used to set/change the USER and LOG, information that is used in USAGE
        TRACKING.












                                                                            14



                              PROMANtm users manual




        LOG OFF

        Used to LOG a current user OFF and force the next user  to  perform  a
        LOG ON.


        SHUTDOWN SYSTEM

        Used  to  Shutdown  the System.   This function automatically LOGs the
        current user OFF and allows automatic  access  to  your  systems  head
        parking  utility.    (When  you  enter  the  name of your systems head
        parking utility, please include the filenames extension).


        SET TIME/DATE

        Used to set/change your systems TIME and DATE.


        USAGE TRACKING

        This feature is extremely handy for systems which have more  than  one
        user  or  for  users who wish to keep track of the time they spend per
        application.   USAGE TRACKING prints reports to the screen or printer,
        with various user specified sort options.


        RESET USER LOG

        Clears  out  the  file  used to store USAGE TRACKING information.   BE
        CAREFUL!


        ENCRYPT/DECRYPT

        This function allows for ENCRYPTion/DECRYPTion of information on  your
        hard disk.    Single files,  multiple files, or entire directories may
        be specified.   DON'T FORGET YOUR KEYS.   THE  SAME  UPPER/LOWER  CASE
        RULES OF PASSWORDS APPLY HERE (see 'a note on PASSWORDS').


        EXIT TO DOS

        This  function  allows  the  user  to EXIT TO DOS.   If a system level
        PASSWORD is specified, then the appropriate PASSWORD must be entered.





                                                                            15

        Allows changing of the system level PASSWORD.



   a note on SECURITY

        Through the use of PROMANtm, the person responsible for setting up
        PROMANtm and maintaining its usage along with the usage of all  of
        the  activities/programs  on a particular system,  can arrange for
        several different system and file security options:

        -    Access of various PROMANtm functions and entry into  DOS  can
             be  controlled  by  use of a system level PASSWORD.   This is
             controlled by the CHANGE  PASSWORD  function  of  the  SYSTEM
             MANAGER.

        -    ENCRYPTion/DECRYPTion  may  be  performed  on  single  files,
             multiple files, or entire directories.   ENCRYPT/DECRYPT is a
             function of SYSTEM MANAGER.

        -    Access  to activities/programs listed in the MAIN MENU may be
             PASSWORD protected.   This is controlled by MENU  MAINTENANCE
             of the SYSTEM MANAGER.

        -    Activities/programs  may have automatic ENCRYPTion/DECRYPTion
             set on them.   This allows for single files,  multiple files,
             or  entire  directories to be automatically DECRYPTed when an
             activity/program is executed and then automatically ENCRYPTed
             when PROMANtm is  returned.    This  is  controlled  by  MENU
             MAINTENANCE of the SYSTEM MANAGER.

   APPENDIX A - Files 


   The  "Profit/Share/Ware"tm version of PROMANtm should be distributed in one
   of two ways:

        1.   On floppy diskette or on a Bulletin Board System as  an  archived
             file called 'PROMAN.ARC'.   When unarchived the files, listed
             under #2 following, should exist.

         2.  On a floppy diskette with all of the following files:

             a. BEGIN.COM
             b. ENCRYPT.COM
             c. FILES.COM
             d. INSTALL.BAT
             e. ORDER.DOC
             f. OVERLAY.EXE
             g. PROMAN.HLP

   APPENDIX B - File Specifications


   When asked for any file specifications while within PROMANtm, the following
   syntax rules apply:

        PATH should be  preceded  with  '\'  and  the  root  directory  is
        specified  by  a  single '\'.   If a '\' is not used then PROMANtm
