## Information about "HDP ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES"

    HDP ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES manages your customer accounts and
    transactions for your business. It not only stores, organizes, and
    retrieves customer information, but also lets you edit all data or
    transaction information kept on file for each customer. With HDP
    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES you have full control over your transactions and
    invoices.
    
    The reports option lets you print and compute finance charges, print
    mailing labels, and process data at the end of the month. The system
    utilities of the program let you check data files and rebuild the
    various indexes, clear all transactions off accounts, selectively delete
    transactions on one account, and add new customer files.
    
    This version of the program is limited to about 250 customers but does
    not require you to pay a registration fee to use it. If you like it and
    want to upgrade up to the commercial version, you then need to purchase
    the program.

     Step 2  Choose what you wish to do and enter the number,
             then turn to the corresponding page number.

                        UPDATE CUSTOMER FILE            PAGE 1.

     OVERVIEW: This is where you add, change, delete, & list
               customers, define LIMITS and STATUS codes. 

     NOTE 1   It is important to note accounts only print in
     ======   ACCOUNT NUMBER sequence. If you need alpha-
              betical order then follow these instructions.

        A.  Take a piece of paper and write numbers on it
            starting with 1000 and add 1 (IE. 1001, 1002,
            & so on). Now assign these numbers to accounts
            & cross them off this list. Each account will
            have a UNIQUE 4 digit account number.

        B.  Use numbers  1 to 26 to represent the letters
            A to Z (A=1, B=2, C=3, etc.) & put this number
            IN FRONT of the 4 digit number to make the FULL
            account number 5 or 6 digits long. Accounts
            will now list in BLOCK alphabetical order.
   
        C.  System handles SUB-ACCOUNTS (or JOB #) to a
            MASTER account. The MASTER  account number is
            followed by a decimal & a number 1 to 99.
          Example. Bailey  #1005 would be  21005
                   Bailey Sub 1  would be  21005.1
                   Bailey Sub 10 would be  21005.10
                   Zinn    #1234 would be 261234

                          LIST CUSTOMERS           PAGE 1.4

     OVERVIEW: There are 2 types of customer listings
               available from this section.  You must decide
               how you will use each report. You can print
               them at anytime.

               The <S>hort  report was designed for counter
               sales people. It contains detailed information
               to identify  customers. It does not contain
               sensitive dollar figures for wandering eyes.

               The <L>ong report has everything shown on the
               screen display as seen on page 1.2

               Reports print in account # sequence ONLY.

     NOTE 1    The amounts shown on the LONG report do not
     ======    reflect any active transactions. The amounts
               represent the starting balances for the next
               period. BEST to print this report after MONTH-
               END processing & before posting transactions.

     Item 1 After set, Account # must be equal or greater.
     Item 2 After set, Account # must be equal or less
     Item 3 A 0 allows no SUB-ACCOUNTS to a master account.
            JOB ACCOUNT (sub-accounts) are created just like
            any other account. If value set to 4 then up to
            4 sub-accounts are allowed to any one master
            account. Example: Account 21005 could have sub-
            accounts 21005.1, 21005.2, 21005.3, & 21005.4 .
            Each account is unique, the master account 21005
            will get a summary statement & JOB accounts get
            individual statement.
     Item 4 After set, rate can not be exceeded.
     Item 5 Reserved for future use. NOT AVAILABLE.
     Item 6 After set, you can not exceed this limit.
     Item 7 Set to NO & you can not access the amounts shown
            on the display on page 1.2.  If set to YES the
            amounts will be given access numbers 15 to 19.
     Item 8 Status codes are simply category codes. This is
            how you can give 90 day time-payment credit to
            customers who can't pay entire balance. Assigning
            an ODD number code to an account will allow part
            payment ( 1/3 of balance) to be requested on the
            statements. EVEN numbers mean total balance due
            on statements.  Some uses may be as follows;
            1 - RETAIL pp    To = Retail With part payment
            2 - COMMERCIAL   To = Commercial type account
            3 - A1 RATEDpp   To = Excellent credit & part pay
            Define them to what you want.

             UPDATE TRANSACTION CODES               PAGE 1.6

     OVERVIEW  System has transaction codes numbered 1 to 99.
               All 99 are defined to something now.

     Note 1.   EVEN or ODD codes determine what balances to
               apply credits towards. EVEN numbers credit
               the OLDEST amounts first. ODD numbers credit
               current balances first. Normally payment codes
               are EVEN and any returns could be ODD. Use
               either odd or even for charge sales (debits).

               These code numbers have a 23 character
               description associated to each code #. Code
               number is used for faster keyboard entry while
               posting transactions & preserve disk space.
               The description, not the code number shows 
               on the statement to make transactions clearer
               to your customers. System print totals by each
               code at end of the aging status reports.

          LIST TRANSACTION CODES & SYSTEM LIMITS    PAGE 1.7

     OVERVIEW:  The system has many settings that can be
                changed to suit your needs. Whenever you make
                changes you should print a new listing of the
                system settings and codes. This report should
                be kept handy at each posting session or when
                adding new accounts into the system.



     Step 1    Press <7> to list.

               Enter date for the report and press <enter>

             ENTER/POST TRANSACTIONS                 PAGE 2.

     OVERVIEW This section is where you enter transactions
              stored in the data file "ARTRANS". This file
              holds ACCOUNT #, DATE, INVOICE #, TRANSACTION
              CODE, & AMOUNT for each line you enter. If you
              EXIT (option <4>), the ARTRANS file is posted
              to accounts & ARTRANS erased for next session.

     Note 1   RESTRICT the input session to about 150
     ======   MAXIMUM line items because you can fill a disk
              file and the HOUSEKEEPING program will need
              to be run to see if any files need to be split
              into 2 smaller files.

     OPTION A  ADD, screen pointer ==> must be located at
               first empty line & first column. The account
               number is not verified now but is verified at
               posting time. Posting report shows which ones
               are not posted.

          DATE input requires MONTH, DAY, & YEAR on 1st line.
               After 1st date, enter day as 2 digits or month
               and day as 3 or 4 digits. 01, 02 or 501 0501
  
          INVOICE # must be NUMERICAL up to 6 digits. A
               decimal point is ok. Use (.) for NO invoice #.
   
          TRANSACTION code is any number 1 to 99.
               See page 1.7 if you need a copy of the codes.

               AMOUNT can be a CREDIT or DEBIT (minus or +)
               entry. The system assumes 2 decimal places.
               Credit entries can be entered with a MINUS (-)
               sign in front of, or behind the amount. If you
               find a (.) period easier then  a (.) period
               in front of the amount is the same as (-).
               some examples;    125. = 125.00    125 = 1.25
               .125. = <125.00>  .25  = <.25>      25 =  .25
                Credit entries are always bracketed <>.

     Note 1.  The pointer ==> is moved around the screen by
              using the four cursor keys. Don't forget to
              toggle them on/off with the NUM-LOCK key.
            


     OPTION A ADD (cont.)    To terminate the add mode, press
              the <-> key & press <enter>. This will display
              the options menu at the bottom of the screen.

     OPTION C CHANGE. To make a change to any line item, move
              screen pointer using the ARROW keys to the
              desired entry and press the <C> key. Now type

              can add a transaction in the empty spot.

     OPTION L LOCATE. Press <L> key and system will ask you
              what transaction line number you wish to find.
              If you have 147 transactions entered and type
              200 the system will go to the last page that

     OPTION F FORWARD. To move forward a page of transactions
              press the <F> key and the system will display
              next page. It will not go forward if the next
              page of transactions is blank.

     OPTION B BACKWARDS. To move back to a prior page press
              the <B> key. The system will display the

              and the system returns to the transaction menu.
  

                        LIST TRANSACTIONS          PAGE 2.2

     OVERVIEW The transactions entered by the posting program
              are held in a temporary file called "ARTRANS"
              This file can be printed prior to the actual
              posting of the transactions. It is not required
              that you print them since the system
              will automatically produce an audit report when
              the transactions are posted to your accounts.
              The two reports do have different formats. The
              listing does not look at the customer disk
              where the posting report does.

              The transaction list report will summarize the
              DEBITS and CREDIT entries for you.

              You can print ALL transactions in "ARTRANS"
              file or you can print a RANGE of entries. The 
              report will print in the same order that the
              transactions were entered.

              When you enter <2> from the Transaction menu
              you will be asked;
   
     ********************************************************

     *  FIRST TRANSACTION # TO LIST PRESS <ENTER> FOR ALL   *
     *                                                      *
     ********************************************************
  
     Step 1  If you wish to list ALL transactions, simply
             press <enter>.  If you wish to list a RANGE of
             transactions, enter the FIRST transaction #. The
             system will then prompt you for the last 
             transaction number. 

     Step 2  When the report is finished the transaction menu
             is displayed. 

                    COMPUTE CHECK TOTALS           PAGE 2.3 

     OVERVIEW The system can give you a screen summary of all
              transactions entered into the TRANS file. The
              transactions are not posted to the accounts
              but simply held in a temporary file. The
              COMPUTE check total is another way to verify
              that you have entered all the transactions
              correctly.  If you were to run an adding
              machine tape of all your transactions prior
              to computer entry, you should end up with the
              same figure the computer would give you under
              this option.

      Step 1  Press <3> at the transaction menu. Compare the
              totals with your adding machine tape. They
              should agree. Fix any errors using option 1.

                   POST TRANSACTIONS            PAGE 2.4

     OVERVIEW This option should be done after option 3.

              You may have to run this option because you
              have entered 150 transactions and should post
              them to make room for more entries. The posting
              process will erase the ARTRANS file when done.

              The actual posting process is done by program
              ARPOSTAR. The system EXITS the posting entry
              program and runs ARPOSTAR. After the posting
              process, the system returns to the Main Menu.

              Transactions are sorted by account number prior
              to posting. This reduces the number of data
              file changes to a minimum.

              Report prints in account number sequence. Any
              transactions for accounts that CAN NOT BE
              FOUND will be flagged on the report.
              Find the error and Re-Enter them.

     *******************************************************

     Step 1   Press <4> at the Transaction menu to POST.

              The system will ask for the date.

     Step 2   You should enter the date you wish to have on
              the posting report.

              To exit without posting, Type: <E>

     Step 3   System will access each CUSTOMER file. If a
              file is not on-line you will be prompted to
              put it on-line or exit.

      NOTE 1   If you have a hardware or power failure, the
               ARTRANS file will still be there. If you re-
               post you will get duplicate postings up where
               the error occurred. To prevent this you should
               backup you data files FROM you last set of 
               backup files and then re-post.

                 PRINT & COMPUTE FINANCE CHARGES Page 3.2

     OVERVIEW Late charges are automatically calculated and
              posted to accounts as long as they have a
              PERCENTAGE put in their account data. See page
              1.1 item # 11 and have a past due amount.
              The A/R system looks at each account, gets the
              percent needed for the calculation, checks old
              balances for payments, & computes the finance
              charge amount.

    Note 1.   Program prints an audit trail and can be re-run
              if needed. Only 1 late charge is posted no
              matter how many times it is run.
           
    Note 2.   A minimum amount is entered for the late
              charge. If the calculated late charge is less,
              the late charge will be the minimum amount.

              only valid numbers would be 1,2,3 for file
              numbers. If you enter a 4 system can't handle
              the lie and will keep asking for file 4.

     Step 1 Enter the number 1, 2, or 3
            If you choose 1 or 2 then enter the customer file
            number that needs fixing. Program then exits to
            the housekeeping program.

          CLEARING ALL TRANSACTIONS OFF ACCOUNTS   PAGE 4.2

     OVERVIEW This utility will erase all posted transactions
              on every account in your A/R system. The
              account balances will remain what they were
              when the END-OF-MONTH update program was run.

              It will not erase un-posted transactions in the
              ARTRANS file. These can still be posted.

              This utility does not print any report to tell
              you what transactions were deleted. It simply
              deletes them all.

                   UPDATE COMPANY FILE            PAGE 4.3

     OVERVIEW The company file contains the return address
              used by the statement program.  The invoicing
              program, "ARINV" uses the company name and
              address, tax rate, and updates the invoice
              number  when an invoice is created.

     NOTE 1  IF you are using PREPRINTED forms with your
     ======  return address printed then you must leave

           INITIALIZE A NEW CUSTOMER FILE          PAGE 4.5

     OVERVIEW  System requires that you initialize each
               Customer data file before it can be used.
               The new file will fit on disk as long as you
               have 80 K free space. Even HARD DISK usres
               must do this for each 80k of data.

      *****    This procedure must NOT be done to a customer
      take     file MORE than ONCE. Doing so, will erase your
      heed     data file. Be sure you are doing this to a new
      ****     data file number that is not in user currently. 

               You must intialize a new file when any file
               becomes full and requires split in half.

     Step 1  Type: Y  to initialize disk.

     Step 2  Floppy systems mount a disk with enough free
             space on-line in drive B:

     Step 3  Type next UNUSED file number. It is important to
             use the correct number. If customer file # 1  is
             already in use then type: 2 and press <enter>.
             The above screen reflects this answer.

             If customer data files #1, #2, & #3 are in use,
             then the proper number would be 4. DO NOT use a
             number that is in use and do not skip a number.

             The new file is initialized and the housekeeping
             program is run to re-verify what files are in 
             use.

                    SET DATA FILE ID CODE       PAGE 5.

     OVERVIEW It is possible to have many companies on a
              hard disk at one time. The ID code makes this
              possible. The data files associated with any
              1 customer will have the same 3 letter ID
              code assigned to it.
       
                    ARMASTER    These file will have
                    ARTRANS     the same ID code. The
                    ARCUST1     sample data had .ABC
                    ARCUSS     
                    ARRET      

         The ID code is held in a file called ARDATA and it
         must always be on the same drive as the programs.

         Change the ID code any time you wish. Remember that
         if you do change the ID code there are not files for
         that ID code. 

       For example you have .ABC used and want a new customer
       set up using .XYZ then follow these steps.

       EXIT to DOS
       
       CREATE ARMASTER.XYZ by copying the old ARMASTER.ABC
          COPY ARMASTER.ABC to ARMASTER.XYZ
       
       Reload to the main menu.
       
       Set the ID CODE to XYZ            
       
       CREATE ARCUST1.XYZ by initializing it (see pg 4.5)
       
       The housekeeping program will run and ask if file
       number 1 is setup. Type Y for yes and No to the
       rest of the questions.

       The files ARTRANS.XYZ 
                 ARRET.XYZ
                 ARCUSS.XYZ
       will be created when needed automatically.                       

              SET HARDWARE CONFIGURATION     PAGE 6.


       OVERVIEW  The hardware configuration tells the program
                 where to look for the data files. Once set,
                 this is held in the file called ARDATA.

       FLOPPY=>  If you set it for a dual floppy system the
                 programs will look for the data files as
                 follows;
                     ARMASTER.abc   DRIVE A:
                     ARTRANS.abc    DRIVE A:
                     ARCUSS.abc     DRIVE A:
                     ARCUST1.abc    DRIVE B:
       Note 1. You can put at least 4 ARCUSTn files on 1 dual
               sided 40 track disk. It is recommended that 
               you do not try having more than 1 company set-
               up on any one set of floppy disks using 
               different ID codes.

       Note 2.  Your ID code may vary from the .abc above.

       HARDDISK/DEFAULT This setting will look for all files
               on the present logged drive. Usually the hard
               disk is drive C: but some of you may be using
               drive D: or higher on a network.


       Step 1. Set the configuration to match your hardware.
               Program returns to the main menu.

              HOUSEKEEPING PROGRAM                Page 7.

    OVERVIEW Program does the necessary housekeeping on the
             the internal data indexes. It is run auto-
             matically when needed, or manually.  A manual
             method is discussed on page 4.1

             When adding customers, system exits to this
             program whenever a disk sector becomes full.
             This starts around the 30th entry & as the file
             fills up, it becomes more frequent.  This type
             of split action is simply sorting an index at
             beginning of the data file being expanded.

             If a customer data file becomes full (at 300
             customers). System will want to SPLIT the full
             file in half. ARSPLIT will move 1/2 of the
             customers and their transactions to the next
             highest file not in use. (initialize it first
             see page 4.5). Posting transactions can also
             fill up a data file.
      --------------------------------------------------------
             If the disk does need to be split in half you
             will have to answer some screen prompts.
   
    Step 1 System asks if next higher file number is setup.
           Type: N for NO & system returns to the Main Menu.
           Initialize the new customer file. RE-RUN the
           housekeeping program & TYPE Y for YES this time.

    Step 2 System goes through the following cycle & prompts
           if it can not find a needed file on-line.
         a. Check file that NEEDED to be split.
         b. Ask if NEW file is initialized. TYPE: N for no.
            You initalize it and RE-RUN ARSPLIT program.
         c. check file that NEEDED to be split.(AGAIN)
         d. Ask if New file is initialized. TYPE: Y for Yes
         e. Copy data from full file to a temporary file .
         f. Check NEW data file and copy data to it.
         g. Check full file that NEEDED split & erase the
            copied data from it. Cycle e & f may require
            more than 1 pass to move required data.

    Step 3 RE-BUILD ARMASTER. System will re-verify what 
           files are in use starting with file #1. Be sure
           you know what files are in use. If you answer Y
           program will try to find & verify file.

             d. INVOICE STATUS:  3 Choices, pick one.
             e. MAKE CORRECTIONS: Yes or No

     Step 9  HOW MANY COPIES?    OPTIONS ARE.....
             <1>____ Print 1 invoice.
             <2>____ Print Multiple copies of invoice (1-4)
             <3>____ Post invoice without printing invoice.
             <4>____ Print packing slip (No amounts shown).
             <E>____ Start over.

             Enter choice. After printing you can print more
             copies or type N for No. At this point the 
             program writes one line in the un-posted trans
             file to be posted with other transactions if this
             was not a CASH sale.

                        EXIT A/R SYSTEM            PAGE 9.
 
     OVERVIEW You can exit the system at almost any menu.

     NOTE 1  Using the system without proper backup files is
     ======  not recommended. You have an investment in time
             and information. The cost of diskettes is very
             small by comparison. The time it takes to backup
             your files is minimal.

             We will not go into listing backup proceedures
             here. Consult your DOS manual.
   
             "RUNNING A COMPUTER PROGRAM WITHOUT BACKUP IS
              LIKE DRIVING A CAR WITHOUT A SPARE TIRE."

     Note 2  You MUST  backup ALL data files.
     ======  Consult Page A.4 for file names.

     Note 3  If running on a floppy drive system you should
     ======  backup all your floppy disks by sets like A, B,
             C. Each set will have 2 disks minimum.
             Use the newly created disks and protect the
             source disks. If you do not use the backup disks
             you will NOT KNOW if they are in fact GOOD
             backups will you.
    
     Note 4  We typically make our backups just AFTER 
     ======  processing prior to turning system off.

             We have 3 sets minimum per client (A, B,
             and C).  and  rotate them each time we backup
             data from the hard disk. We mark a POST-IT note
             on the disk jacket as to what disk was used and
             what was last done to the files on the disk.
   
     Note 5  It is also a good practice to backup just prior
     ======  to running the END OF MONTH processing. This way
             you could always re-print a statement.

     ---------- SHAREWARE VERSION 1.1 ----------------------
     Thank you for taking a look at our A/R program .

     PLEASE remember that there is a difference between the
     SHAREWARE version 1.1 and version 2.0 which is the 
     commercial version. The features missing in Version 1.1
     are in version 2.0 (see the sign-off screen). The 
     shareware version is limited to about 250 customers
     (1 data file). Instead of a Shareware program going
     commercial we are reversing the process by offering a
     limited commercial version as Shareware.

     We  think you will find the program very fast, bug-free,
     worth using, and last but not least worth upgrading.

     The entire manual is included here to give you an idea
     what the missing features do and how they do it.

     ----- USING THE MANUAL AND PROGRAMS -------------------

     Most screen displays have a page number in the upper
     right corner of the screen. This is the manual's page
     number to look for help. If you see 3.2 this means
     option 3 from the main menu and option 2 from the next
     menu.

     If you see a YES/NO prompt like (Y/*N) or (*Y/N) the *
     marks what you get if you just press <enter>

     <ENTER> means press the ENTER key or the RETURN key.

     The screen is represented in this manual by a box of *'s
  
     You can use lower case in some instances BUT for most
     prompts you will have to use CAPITAL letters like Y, E,
     N, etc.

     There are no sample reports in this manual in hopes that
     you will exercise the sample data by printing them.

     Screen sample answers are shown by _Y_ or _21005_ in
     this manual. Your answers may vary.

                 RUNNING THE SAMPLE DATA           PAGE A.4

     OVERVIEW:  A/R system is supplied with sample data
                files (about 15 accts.) using ID code ABC.
  
                If you follow the installation instructions
                you will also have the sample data installed.

                We recommend that you exercise the system
                with the sample data. This will allow you
                to become familiar with all aspects of the
                system quickly. This will save time and
                mistakes when you define and setup your own
                disks.

     Phase 1.   Start your learning process by accessing
                every Menu in the system.

     Phase 2.   Add & Edit customers, transaction codes,
                status codes, and system parameters. Print
                a long customer listing.

     Phase 3.   Enter and post transactions to accounts.

     Phase 4.   Run the finance charge report.

     Phase 5.   Print aging status report variations &
                print statements on plain paper.

     Phase 6.   Run  END-OF-MONTH program.

     Phase 7.   Print a customer list as in phase 1.

     Phase 8.   Look at all reports for one account and see
                what happened to the amounts & transactions.

             Items 2 through 8 would be about what you would
             do running the system in a 1 month cycle.

             IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO RUN THE SAMPLE DATA THEN
             SIMPLY RE-INITIALIZE CUSTOMER FILE #1 AGAIN. YOU
             CAN THEN EDIT THE TRANSACTION CODES TO YOUR NEEDS
             AND START ADDING NEW CUSTOMERS. IF YOU CHANGE ID
             CODE THEN YOU NEED TO INITIALIZE ALL FILES.

                ADDENDUMS FOR HARD DISKS           PAGE A.5

     OVERVIEW A/R system can be used on floppy or Hard disk.
              If configured for floppies then drives are
              assigned A: & B: 

              Our A/R is the only system that We know of that
              can be run on floppy disks with the SAME 
              capacity as a hard disk system because of the
              ability to span more than 1 floppy disk.

     NOTE 1 Data file references.
     Where Throughout manual.
             Hard disk systems deals with data similar to the
             floppy system. On a floppy system, if a file is
             not found on-line a screen prompt will allow
             you to mount another floppy. 
             Hard disk users should exit & search the
             directory to determine why the file is missing.

     NOTE 2 Initializing data files.
     Where Page 4.5
             The hard disk version must also have each file
             intialized like the floppy system. Each file
             is about 80k in size. This makes converting
             back and forth easier. Data stored in small
             files can be accessed faster.

             To run a floppy system on a hard drive, copy all
             programs & data files to your hard disk. Set the
             ID code & configuration for hard disk and run.
      --------------------------------------------------------
     CONVERTING from Hard disk to Floppies (they can break).

     Step 1 Install the system as shown for floppies.
     Step 2 Copy ARMASTER.abc & ARRET.abc from harddisk
            to the AR disk with the programs on it.
     Step 3 NOW make a data disk with just your customer
            data files on it. ARCUST1.abc, ARCUST2.abc, ETC.
            You can put up to 4 data files on a disk.
            At the A: prompt type: ARINDX  and press <enter>.
            Check the ID code & configuration.

           INSTALLING ON A HARD DISK SYSTEM     PAGE A.6
     ----- SHAREWARE VERSION 1.0 ----------------------------
     To keep things simple I am not going to talk about path's
     and sub-directories. It is assumed that your hard disk is
     drive C: and you have at least 1 floppy disk as A:

     Step 1. Turn on your computer and get to the C> prompt.
             Get to the Root directory, type; CD \ <enter>
     Step 2. Make a sub-directory. Type; MKDIR \AR <enter>
     Step 3. Go to that sub-directory. Type; CD \AR
     Step 4. Put disk from HDP in drive A: and 
             Type; COPY A:*.* C: <enter>
             This should copy everything off the floppy to C:
             Remove disk when done and put in safe place.
     Step 5. Type; ARINDX <enter> to load to
                   the main menu program.
     Step 6. Set your ID Code to ABC and your hardware 
             configuration for hard disk. 



             INSTALLING ON FLOPPY SYSTEM

     Step 1. Put your dos disk in drive A:
             Put a blank disk in drive B: 
             Type; FORMAT B: /S
        
     Step 2. Remove dos disk & put away. Put new disk in A:
     Step 3. Put HDP A/R disk in drive B:
             Type; COPY B:*.* A:
     Step 4. Remove disk in drive B and put up. Put a blank
             disk in drive B: now. Type; FORMAT B:
     Step 5. Copy sample data to B:
             Type; COPY A:ARCUST1.ABC B:
             Then delete it off drive A:
             Type; DEL A:ARCUST1.ABC
     Step 6. Type; ARINDX <enter> to run the main menu.
     Step 7. Set ID code to ABC and configuration
             to DUAL FLOPPY.
