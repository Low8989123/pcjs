## Information about "DECISION ANALYSIS SYSTEM"

    DECISION ANALYSIS SYSTEM, (DAS), is probably the best decision analysis
    package on the market. It utilizes a number of well established Multiple
    Criteria Decision Making algorithms in its analysis. This is not a
    "black box" program, numerical results are provided for each stage in
    the analysis, so that the user can see what is happening and have
    confidence in the results.
    
    DAS presents a scientific approach to decision making. It will replace
    intuition and speculation, while preserving such qualitative factors as
    experience and judgment. This innovative, yet remarkably easy to use
    package consists of two separate decision analysis programs: the
    Decision Matrix Method (DMM), and the Pairwise Comparison Method (PCM).
    
    DMM is designed to be used primarily with tangible and easily
    quantifiable data. Employing a matrix of criteria and alternatives, DMM
    is extremely easy to use, providing you with an unbiased ranking of
    alternatives. The program begins its analysis by highlighting
    dominated or substandard alternatives. Remaining alternatives are then
    ranked in order of preference by using a number of popular and well
    respected decision analysis techniques. Some of these techniques
    include: LAM (Linear Assignment Method), NAW (Normalized Additive
    Weighting), ELECTRE (Elimination et Choice Translating Reality), and
    TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution).
    An aggregation and synthesis procedure follows which produces the final
    preference rankings of alternatives. The user's manual includes text
    book references where these techniques and algorithms are explained in
    full detail.
    
    PCM is designed to deal specifically with subjective assessments and
    evaluations of alternatives and criteria. It is based on the well known
    Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), developed by Thomas L. Saaty at the
    Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. Here, problems are modeled
    using a hierarchial structure with elements in this hierarchy compared
    in pairs. The advantage of this is that it helps you to focus your
    attention on each part of the problem separately. Based on your inputs,
    PCM will calculate your judgment consistency, and it will quantify the
    impact of each element in the hierarchy on the overall goal. For
    example it may quantify your preference of a set of alternatives based
    on some subjective criteria. PCM is not only useful in decision making
    problems, but also in any other area where you find it difficult to
    quantify subjective factors.
    
    Applications include: location planning, cost/benefit analysis,
    strategic planning, employee selection, resource allocation, sales
    forecasting, taste  testing, new product evaluations, and many more.
