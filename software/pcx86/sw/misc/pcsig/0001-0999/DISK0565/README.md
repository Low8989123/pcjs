Program Description:

PC-PAYROLL is a complete, menu driven payroll system for moderate sized
companies, up to 40 employees for floppy based systems, up to 200 employees 
on hard disk systems.  PC-PAYROLL accepts hourly, salary and tips as well as
bonuses and commissions.  A variety of pay period options, overtime, and
after-the-fact conditions can be accommodated.

Federal, state and local taxes, FICA, withholding and user defined
deductions, 401(K) Plans and Cafeteria Plans are internally
computed.  The authors have included necessary tax computations
in the program, and an appendix accommodates taxes of several
states which have special, additional requirements.

Paychecks are printed in several standard formats.

A full range of reports are included; monthly, quarterly and
year-to-date summaries, Federal Tax reports (W2, W3, 941) and a pay
period detail.

PC-PAYROLL is well organized, and appears to have as complete a list of
facilities as commercial, remote batch processing payroll systems which
many small firms commonly use.

PC-PAYROLL requires periodic updates for internal tax tables.  A
subscription to PC-PAYROLL is available, and includes a printed manual
and periodic updates for each year.

NOTE:  A companion program, PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, is available to handle
departments, vacation or sick leave, and personnel management.  
Information on the PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT program is available on request.
