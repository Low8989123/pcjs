## Information about "SUPER BASIC PROGRAMING LANGUAGE"

    The SUPER BASIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE a.k.a. Structured Programming
    Language (SPL) is a hybrid of structured BASIC, with its easy-to-use
    commands, and a Pascal-styled architecture.
    
    This compiler takes an input source code and produces an ASCII file
    that can be executed in BASIC or compiled using the BASIC compiler. SPL
    has powerful commands that let you build of procedures, functions and
    structured programming blocks which are enclosed by BEGIN and END
    statements.  SPL has graphics ability, mathematical operators, strong
    string-manipulation commands, and the ability to handle arrays and disk
    input and output routines.
    
    It offers a way to create structured programs with a fair amount of
    ease although it is not intended for the novice computer user.  SPL
    comes with a user's manual which has an error code list as well as a
    feature index.

Program Title: STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE (SPL)
PC-SIG version 3

The STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE (SPL) compiler takes an input source
code and produces an ASCII file in BASIC that can be executed in BASICA
or compiled using the BASIC compiler. SPL is a sort of mix between BASIC
and PASCAL. It has the easy to use commands of BASIC and the structured
architecture of PASCAL. This language has powerful commands that allow
for the building of procedures, functions and structured programming
blocks which are enclosed by BEGIN and END statements.

SPL supports many IF THEN style programming codes as well as REPEAT
WHILE commands. SPL also comes with graphics ability with excellent
mathematical operators and strong string manipulation commands. In
short, almost every command available in BASIC is also available in SPL,
with a few additions. SPL handles arrays and disk input and output
routines. Those interested in a structured form of BASIC would be very
interested in SPL; it offers an excellent way to create structured
programs with a fair amount of ease and lessened toil. SPL comes
complete with a user's manual which contains an error code list as well
as feature index. This language is not intended for the novice computer
operator.

The author has also come out with a programming editor, written using
the SPL language, called PREDITOR.

Usage:  Programming.

System Requirements:  A version of BASIC and a hard disk.

How to Start:  Call the author, Dennis Baer, for the password to
uncrunch the manual: 516-694-5872.

Suggested Registration:  $50.00 -- $100.00 for SPL and $35.00 for
PREDITOR.

		The Structured Programming Language
			Picture file

To display my picture you need a pcdos computer system with EGA and an
RGB monitor of 640 x 350 which can be switched to display shades of
a monochrome.

Enter

IPICDUMP

For the row length enter 320
For the scale factor enter 2
For the file name enter PICTURE

To obtain the Structured Programming Language you can download file 
SPLLIB.ARC from one of the following systems or distribution channels.

516 334 8221 (1200 baud) 24 hours
302 655 6342 (2400 baud) 6pm-8am EST
212 980 0770 (1200 baud) 24 hours

Monday thru Friday from 10am to 6:30pm EST

or send RETURN POSTAGE,Formatted 5 1/4" disk,MAILER to get The Structured

This file expands to 359k so you should have enough space on your disk.
When you copy this file to your printer it will produce a picture of
Dennis Baer, the author of the Structured Programming Language. To
obtain the Structured Programming Language download file SPLLIB.ARC
from a bbs at 516 334 8221 (1200 baud) 25 minute download or from
516 367 9626 (1200 baud). The printer should be EPSON compatible and
it does NOT require Graphtrax. It will print many minus signs to produce
the picture that you must cut and paste together. If you have an IBM PC
with either a Thompson EGA ultra card or ATI Small Wonder EGA card you
can run the SPL processor on a program called IPICDUMP.SP and with your
Quick BASIC version 2 or 3 compile it and run it with your monochrome
monitor and see my picture on your screen. This file set is for those
who do not have the right EGA that will prduce shades of grey, or have
no EGA at all, or maybe an MSDOS machine that is not IBM compatible.
I can be reached at 516 694 5872 from Mon-Fri 10am - 6:30pm NY time.
