## Information about "TURNKEY DEMO"

    TURNKEY helps you set up your computer as a menu-driven system.  You
    construct and edit menu choices to your liking (the words you want
    displayed on the menu).  Then it lets you specify what will happen for
    each item in the menu by helping you write simple batch files that
    correspond to the menu choice.  TURNKEY can then pop up a menu with
    your choices and let you run a program simply by moving the cursor to
    your choice and pressing enter.  When you finish running your program,
    you are returned to the menu.
