Program Description:

The Stock Trader is a menu driven stock trading program for tracking
the performance of a group of stocks selected by the user. Data normally
available in the daily newspapers is used and entered on a regular basis.
It is suggested that entry for the listed stocks be done daily, or the
information the program generates will be less accurate than expected.

The performance of selected issues is plotted over a thirty day period
in x-y mode at the user's request, and plotted performance can be printed.
The performance of a selected market average, such as the DOW, may also
be plotted for comparison to portfolio performance.

The program generates buy and sell signals for the stocks listed on the
data files, and the parameters by which these decisions are reached are
accessible to the user. A certain history is needed (a learning curve)
before it can be expected that a user could do the amendments to improve
the buy/sell suggestions. It is made very clear that the program is a tool
rather than a crystal ball.

This program runs from DOS and requires a graphics screen.

Review the README file for more indepth information.
