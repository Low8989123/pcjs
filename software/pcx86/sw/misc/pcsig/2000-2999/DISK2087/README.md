## Information about "FICTIONARY & ATC"

    What is the definition of bebung?  Could be "an Indian dessert made with
    custard and honey."  Then again it might be "an alchemist's distillation
    apparatus."  Wrong again, it's "a sustained musical note having a
    pulsating effect. "  Sounds like fiction, but it's actually FICTIONARY,
    a game of strange and unusual words designed by Steve Estvanik.
    
    FICTIONARY can be played in two ways - either in a group where you try
    to fool each other into choosing the incorrect definition, or
    individually, where the game becomes a vocabulary guessing game.
    Playing with a group brings out the best playability in this program.
    You receive points for either selecting the correct definition or by
    having someone select your definition.  You decide the final number of
    points needed to finish a game.
    
    Easy-to-use menus make playing FICTIONARY a breeze.  Load
    FICTIONARY on any IBM or compatible and the fun begins.  Having a
    pencil and a piece of paper around may also come in handy.
    During each round of play, the word-giver sees the actual
    definition, then enters a paraphrase.  The others see only the word and
    make up their own definitions.  All players then vote for the
    definition they think is correct.  If this appears similar to the board
    game Haberdash, it is, plus you now have the assistance of the
    computer.
    
    A great party game, FICTIONARY will test both your intelligence and
    creativity.  Adults will appreciate the difficulty, though children may
    find the words too difficult to enjoy.  Nonetheless, hours of fun await
    those who dare to take the challenge.
    
    AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER, simulating the duties of a sector air traffic
    controller, is a game that's perfect for a few minutes or hours of fun!
    Easy to learn, but difficult to master, this game tracks best scores at
    each of 20 levels of difficulty.
    
    You must guide about 20 planes safely through your sector, symbolized
    as a 13 by 13 grid.  Two airports are shown, as are six "fixes" which
    are the only safe exits and entries to adjacent sectors.  Take off,
    change altitudes, land -- each plane is shown as a letter with arrows
    that show current direction.  Use the whole keyboard with this game
    (...if you're moonlighting as an atc, F10 allows quick escape when your
    real boss shows up!).

                                Version 1.2 
                     A game of strange and unusual words                        
                         designed by Steve Estvanik

                            Seattle, WA 98105                                   
                                                                                
          This game is copyright (c) 1984,1989 by Steve Estvanik.  It           
          is being distributed as shareware.  Under this concept all            
          users are entitled to make as many copies as they wish.               
          If you like this game, then you are requested to make a               
          contribution ($15 suggested) to the author.                           
                                                                                
     Fictionary can be played by one or more players.  Each round, the word-    
giver chooses a word -- from the file, or by entering a new one. This player    
sees the actual definition, then enters a paraphrase.  The others see only      
the word and make up their own definitions.  All players then vote for the      
definition they think correct.  Points are awarded for guessing the correct     
definition and for fooling others into voting for a false definition.           

When played by one person, the game becomes a vocabulary guessing game.  
Teachers or parents can create custom wordsets using the Fictionary utility 
program that comes with the registered version. 

Users are encouraged to submit new words to Cascoly for inclusion in the 
game.  Registered users will receive the most current word list with their 
registered copy.
