This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
700 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'GO' at the
DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy access
to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.

The Narc utility, newly instituted with the tenth edition, allows you to
look directly at all the compressed program files on the CD without
having to download the program to your hard disk.  So if you want to
look at the programmer's notes or on-line documentation before using
valuable hard disk space, you can.

The PC-SIG Encyclopedia of Shareware is included on the disk, and a
printed copy of the book is included so you can peruse the available
programs from the comfort of your favorite chair.  All the programs are
logically divided into one-hundred twenty categories making it easier to
find just the right software.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed

by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word in the program
description.  A new utility, Narc, is implemented so you can look at the
program files and the author's on-line documentation without having to
first copy the program to your hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and
Narc, you can quickly find the program you want and review it to be
sure, without ever having to run it from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

Disk Title: TheDraw and TdrawAid                                        
PC-SIG Version: S1.01

THEDRAW is a powerful screen image generator/editor for color and       
monochrome video users that makes designing and figuring out a video    
screen display child's play. The most novice computer user can make an  
Ansi text file screen with THEDRAW in only minutes. From that point on, 
you can explore and use more of the horsepower available in THEDRAW.    
                                                                        
The biggest problem facing most people when making video screens is we  
really do not know what will look good until we see it.  Manually       
editing a screen can literally take hours.  With THEDRAW, you can free  
form until you really know what is perfect.  With the picture in mind,  
you can quickly develop whatever is necessary or instruct THEDRAW to    
create a data file which can be used.  Instead of hours, making a screen
takes minutes.                                                          
                                                                        
For the curious, THEDRAW can transform your masterpiece into data files 
with the following formats:                                             
                                                                        
~ ANSI color text (useful in batch files, BBS's, etc...)                
~ ASCII text (compatible with word processors and text editors)         
~ BINARY files (generic, useful in most everything)                     
~ BSAVE (for Basic)                                                     
~ COM files (actual separate programs executable directly by Dos - Great
  for batch files and presentations)                                    
~ ASSEMBLER (for the die-hard coder)                                    
~ TURBO PASCAL (directly compilable source code)                        
~ C (format is for Turbo C specifically)                                
~ OBJECT (Intel format compatible, suitable for linking.  Four varieties
  available for Large/Small generic data model, Turbo Pascal v4.0+, and 
  QuickBasic v4.0+)                                                     
~ THEDRAW (custom storage format for FAST loading and saving)           
                                                                        
Originally intended as an improvement to a simple program named AnsiDraw
by Amrich Enterprises, THEDRAW has enhanced user interface, is          
compatible with systems that have 250k of free memory available,        
monochrome and color monitor users are supported, and a special keyboard
driver allows you to redefine keystrokes that do not operate properly or
are used by other programs (registered version).  If you have an EGA or 
VGA video display, THEDRAW permits editing 43 or 50 line screens        
respectfully.                                                           
                                                                        
Another feature THEDRAW fully supports is animation.  With this facility
you can develop quick and dirty presentations, or simply make a generic 
screen appear with pizzazz.  You can either let THEDRAW make an         
animation sequence from a static image, or one can be made from scratch,
thus letting you fully control the appearance of your work. THEDRAW     
gives you a maximum of 16000 separate animation "entries" to handle the 
most complex job.  The final result can be saved either as an ANSI file 
(Ansi Animation) or THEDRAW format file.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

TDRAWAID.DOC    08-26-1991

A Hard disk is recommended but is not required.  ANSI.SYS  should be  loaded to
correctly view  color  .ANS  files  but is not  required  for program operation.
The line DEVICE=ANSI.SYS in your CONFIG.SYS file loads the ANSI.SYS driver.

Command line options:
     /NC....forces color off.  The display  will be in black  and  white if  you
            have a color monitor.
     /CHK...performs  a  'integrity check'  on  the  data  file  $SETDATA.  This
            function  can be  used anytime  but SHOULD be used  if you get a run
            time error or if the characters or not formed properly.  It will not
            repair any  damage  so you  should  make a  backup copy of  $SETDATA
            before  running  TD.EXE.   $SETDATA  is  a  'Read Only'   file   but
            corruption could occur through normal disk usage.

The program  will look for the datafile, $SETDATA, in  the following order:
        1. In the current directory.
        2. In a directory  named  TDRAWAID.
        3. In a path set with  an  environment  variable, TDRAWAID.
           Example for  the  environment  variable where  UTILITY is the name of
           the directory and the drive is C:

                set TDRAWAID=c:\utility     (Right)
                set TDRAWAID=\utility       (Wrong)
                set TDRAWAID=utility        (Wrong)

This program will  create ASCII or ANSI  files  with text  from a list of  large
fonts(big letters). The text can be saved to be used in batch files, text files,
or THEDRAW.  Text to be used in  THEDRAW  can be saved using color.  At the Main
menu, choose  "Select Chacter Set" and then use the Up and  Down  arrows,  Home,
End, PgUp, or PgDn to  highlight the desired  character  set.  Press <Return> to
select or <Esc> to abort amd return to the menu. Next  select "Enter/Edit Text".
The  screen will show the  maximum number of characters per line, maximum number
of lines per screen, editing  keys and other data. Enter any text using  letters
and spaces (uppercase is forced on).  Press  <F5>  to  view  the  output  screen
as it will be  written to the file, <F10>  when the data is compete as you  want
it,  or  <Esc>  to  abort.  From  the  Main  menu  You  can   optionally  select
"Center/Tab Text" or  write the data to a file as is. If you  are  going  to use
the text in THEDRAW then you will not need to center or  tab it  as THEDRAW  has
its own block move.  For a  batch  file or text file you may want to choose this
option. The text  you  entered will be  retained  in memory  so you  can  select
another  character  set  to see what it will look like.  Some characters will be
lost if you go from a set with a larger  number of  chatacters per  line to  one
that is  smaller.  You can  freely choose  between the  items on the  Main menu.
When centering or tabbing text you can press  <F5>  to view  the output  screen.
If you have  any lines  centered  or tabbed  any  you go back and edit  them  or
change to another character set then the tab  values will  be returned  to zero.
The program will only allow  one size  character per line.  If you want  several
different  sizes  then write them  to the same  file using  the <A>ppend  option
at the prompt to save the file. If no working file has been set then you will be
prompted  for  a  filename.  At the  next save  you will  be given  the  options
<A>ppend, <O>verwrite  or <N>ew.  When appending text to an .ANS file for use in
THEDRAW, view the working file to determine if it  is  going to be  too long  as
THEDRAW will only edit/display the first 25 lines of a file.  The  program  does
not limit you to any set length of working file,  .ANS  or .ASC.  If you want to
make  several   screens  to  load  in  THEDRAW  then   save  them  as  different

When you choose to save the text  as format for  THEDRAW,  you will be presented
with an option box  to choose the color.  The default is white on  black and you
can press  <F10>  or  <Return>  to accept the default if  you do not want color.
If you set the color  then all subsequent  saves to a  .ANS  file will  use that
color until you change it.

The 'hot keys'  for the main menu are  highlighted in red for color monitors and
all hot keys can be viewed by pressing <F1>.

;THEDRAW IMAGE UNCRUNCHING ROUTINE
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;Compatible with MASM (Microsoft) and TASM v1.0 (Borland).  Minor format
;changes may be required for other assemblers.
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;This is the routine for displaying crunched TheDraw image files.  The
;crunched data format is a simple custom protocol for reproducing any image.
;The control codes below decimal 32 are reserved for this function.
;Characters 32 and above are written directly to the destination address.
;
;The following shows the format of a control code sequence.  Please note that
;not all functions use the optional bytes <x> or <y>.
;
;Data Structure:  <current byte>[<x>[<y>]]
;
;   0..15 = New Foreground Color
;  16..23 = New Background Color
;      24 = Go down to next line, return to same horizontal position as when
;           routine was started (akin to a c/r).
;      25 = Displays <x> number of spaces.
;      26 = Displays <x> number of <y>.  Also used to display ANY characters
;           below #32.  This function is the only way to do this although it
;           uses three bytes.  Otherwise the code would be interpreted as
;           another command.
;      27 = Toggles on/off the foreground attribute blink flag.
;  28..31 = reserved
;
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;To use the routine, call the uncrunch procedure with the DS:SI register pair
;pointing to the TheDraw output listing, the ES:DI register pair pointing to
;the destination display address, and the length of the crunched image data
;in the CX register.  All modified registers are restored upon exiting.
;
;Assume an output file of a 40 character by 10 line block.  The label
;'IMAGEDATA' has been added for referencing purposes. ie:
;
;
;     ;TheDraw Assembler Crunched Screen Image
;     IMAGEDATA_WIDTH EQU 40
;     IMAGEDATA_DEPTH EQU 10
;     IMAGEDATA_LENGTH EQU 467
;     IMAGEDATA LABEL BYTE
;                DB      ...list of image bytes here...
;
;
;The following assembly language code could then be used to display the
;40x10 block on the screen with:
;
;                MOV     SI,offset IMAGEDATA
;                MOV     AX,0B800h
;                MOV     ES,AX
;                MOV     DI,34*2 + 5*160-162
;                MOV     CX,IMAGEDATA_LENGTH
;                CALL    UNCRUNCH
;
;The data segment (DS register) is assumed to point at the segment ImageData
;resides in.   The ES:DI register pair points at position (34,5) on the color
;graphics adapter screen, calculated as an offset from the start of the screen.
;Monochrome card users, replace the 0B800h with 0B000h.
;
;The original horizontal starting offset is remembered by the uncrunch routine.
;The offset is restored upon moving down to the next line.  This permits a
;block to be displayed correctly anywhere on the screen.  ie:
;
;              ┌─ horizontal starting offset
;              V

;To display the block in the lower-right corner, change the DI assignment to:
;
;                MOV     DI,40*2 + 15*160-162
;
;The block is 40 characters wide by 10 lines deep.  To display on a 80 by 25
;screen, we must display the block at coordinates (40,15).  To display in
;the upper-left screen corner use:
;
;                MOV     SI,offset IMAGEDATA
;                MOV     AX,0B800H
;                MOV     ES,AX
;                MOV     DI,1*2 + 1*160-162       ;coordinates 1,1
;                MOV     CX,IMAGEDATA_LENGTH
;                CALL    UNCRUNCH
;
;Notice in both cases only the offset address changed.  Note the latter case
;is also used for displaying a full screen image (which in general are
;always displayed at coordinate 1,1).
;
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;That's it!  The routine was designed for easy use and understanding; however,
;for some people the best way is to experiment.  Create a program using the
;above examples, perhaps with a 40x10 block (or any size).  Good luck!
