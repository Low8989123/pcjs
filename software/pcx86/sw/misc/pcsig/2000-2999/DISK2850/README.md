Changes to Early Bird Version 1.0f
==================================

Changes from 1.0 to 1.0f (maintenance release):
  o Added bound manual to registration package.
  o Several documentation improvements/enhancements.
  o Fixed a problem with changing the Class to one that isn't current.
  o Fixed a problem with installation for Hercules Monitors.
  o Disabled CGA Snow suppression (bug) for Hercules/Monochrome Monitors.

Since there have been no other major releases of this program to the public,
there are no other changes to list here.  However, this program went through
a very extensive and time consuming BETA testing process to get all problems
resolved BEFORE the first major public release.

The "Info" pull-down menu in the Early Bird Editor describes a large number of
exciting upgrades currently being added to the program.  Please feel free
to contact Allan Computer Products if you have any ideas which you would
like to see implemented in the program.  In addition, remember to register and
pass the program along to your friends, thereby keeping the shareware concept
working.  This will allow implementation of these exciting upgrades as soon
as possible.
