Disk No: 2935
Disk Title: Data Manager  1/2 (#2936 also)
PC-SIG Version: S1.0

Program Title: DATA Manager
Author Version: 2/92
Author Registration: $23.00
Special Requirements: 384K RAM and high density drive. Hard drive
                      recommended.

This 19-in-one program will help you organize much of the day-to-day
information you need at your fingertips. Menu options for DATA MANAGER
include: Automobile, Calendar, Directory, Financial, Inventory, Library
(audio/ video), Messages, To Do Lists, Outlines, Shopping, Word
Processing (with mail-merge to Directory and Business Contacts).
Additional menu choices specifically for the office are: Business
Contacts and Training Classes. Specifically for home are: TV, Recipes,
Foreign Language Vocabulary Testing, Weight, and Exercise.

This program is extremely easy to use, yet very powerful. It is an
outstanding learning tool for novices as well as appealing and
functional for the pros. Most menu options work the same way -- once you
learn one, you have learned them all. Other features include: security
levels, the ability to add notes of information (up to 20 pages per
note, depending on disk space!) to most data entries, print report
options, on-line help, scrolling windows, and the ability to easily
change operating options from within the program.

But that's not all, folks! When you register DATA MANAGER, if you have
different menu option needs than what the program currently provides,
Software Masters will accommodate you as much as possible from its
large library of already written "modules." Yet another feature
registration brings is the addition of a computer time log, especially
helpful for the growing number of home businesses that use computers and
require a time log for tax purposes. DATA MANAGER as a package is quite
interesting, comprehensive, and fun. You'll wonder how you ever got
along without it.
