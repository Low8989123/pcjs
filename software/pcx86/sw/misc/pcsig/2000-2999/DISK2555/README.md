Special Requirements: 512K, 2 drives (1 high density). Hard drive recomm
                                                                        
Expressware has dramatically enhanced product flexibility by rewriting  
FILE EXPRESS in C and Assembler.  Basic relational capability has been  
added to make it easier and more intuitive for the user to retrieve and 
place information in other databases.                                   
                                                                        
Over 100 new features have been added to FILE EXPRESS.  The             
functionality of nearly every aspect of data management -- screen       
definition, import/export, database size, reports, form letters, sorts  
-- has been expanded.  Users can now edit records while in browse mode. 
                                                                        
Recognizing that one of the primary uses of a database is for mailing   
lists, FILE EXPRESS now has word processing capabilities.  Users can    
write a letter from within the program and merge data from a database.

What is File Express?

File Express is a database management program written for the IBM Personal 
Computer and PC-compatible computers.  Using File Express, information 
of virtually any kind can be put into the computer, printed, sorted, 
displayed and reported.  For example, a list of names and addresses can be 
entered, then they can be sorted into zip code sequence or last name 
sequence, printed out onto mailing labels, and updated as the list changes.  
The same data can be included in reports, or simply displayed on the 
computer screen when needed.  Customized form letters can also be written 
in File Express by merging names from the database file with a letter. 

File Express is very popular among first-time database users and non-
technical users.  But as File Express has continued to be improved over 
the last six years, it has also become very powerful.  Some of its early 
first-time  users have advanced to true "power users" and we have
addressed their  needs too, while maintaining the simplicity of the manual 
and the software.  


Installing File Express

The diskettes included in this package contain compressed files which
must be expanded using the File Express Installation program.  To do
this, insert the diskette labelled "Program Disk" into drive A and at
the DOS prompt A>, type INSTALL and press <Enter>.  Then follow the
instructions on the screen.
