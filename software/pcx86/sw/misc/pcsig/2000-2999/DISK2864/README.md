Program Title: Math Castle by Jennings                                  
Author Version: 1.5                                                     
Author Registration: $19.95                                             
Special Requirements: Graphics card.                                    
                                                                        
You are the wise King of the Land of Given where you and your loyal     
subjects have developed and employed the latest scientific weaponry in  
defense of your castle. You and your subjects enjoy peace and prosperity
under your reign.                                                       
                                                                        
Then one day, your minister of defense informs you that your castle is  
being approached by a large number of alien spacecraft. You rush down to
the Castle Defense Center only to find that the math co-processor chip  
on the computer that fires the Super Energy Beam is not functioning.    
There is only one thing left to do - you must enter the required        
computations by way of the keyboard.                                    
                                                                        
Only you can save your castle, but can you enter the required           
computations quickly and accurately enough?                             
                                                                        
MATH CASTLE is an educational math program that uses an exciting video  
arcade game format to teach children or adults their basic math facts.  
MATH CASTLE has two play modes and 40 levels of play. You can enter your
own problem sets, or have MATH CASTLE randomly select them for you. MATH
CASTLE can be configured so that even small children can use it, or on  
its higher levels, it can be a challenge for exceptional children or    
adults.                                                                 
                                                                        
Program Title: QuickStart                                               
Author Version: 1.10                                                    
Author Registration: $39.00                                             
Special Requirements: Mouse, hard drive, and color monitor recommended. 
                                                                        
QUICKSTART is a power Windows-like disk management utility program and  
is much faster and easier to use than Windows. QUICKSTART allows you to 
access and start any program on any drive or directory in a flash. It is
so easy to use that even small children can locate and start the        
programs that they want to use.                                         
                                                                        
QUICKSTART automatically decompresses archived files and loads them into
a temporary work area where you can run or edit any or all of the files 
contained therein. After you have finished, QUICKSTART gives you the    
option to either update the original archive file, or to leave it       
unchanged. You define the archive utility program that you want to use  
with QUICKSTART.                                                        
                                                                        
With QUICKSTART you can Copy, Move, Edit, Delete, and Run files quicker 
and easier than ever. You can also create and delete directories.       
QUICKSTART will automatically load the text file you select into your   
word processor at the press of a button. No more typing in directory or 
file names. Unlike menu programs, there is no setup required other than 
the initial installation of QUICKSTART onto your hard drive.

                                    LICENSE



     QuickStart is Copyright (c) 1991 by Ron Jennings.

     QuickStart is not, nor has ever been, public domain or free software.

     The commercial, registered version of QuickStart may not be duplicated
     other than for backup purposes. A registered copy of QuickStart must be
     treated like a book, in that the same registered copy of QuickStart may
     not be used in more than one computer at the same time, just as a book
     may not be read by more than one person at the same time (without making
     an illegal copy).

     Users are granted a limited license to use the promotional version of
     QuickStart for a limited evaluation period of up to 45 days, in order to
     determine if it suits their needs. Any other use of QuickStart or use
     past this period requires registration or the Author's prior written
     consent.

     If for any reason you cannot afford to register QuickStart at the end of
     this time, please send me a letter stating your circumstances, and in
     most cases I will grant you a license to continue using QuickStart until
     such time as your circumstances change.

     All users are granted a limited license to copy the Promotional Non-
     Registered version of QuickStart only for the purpose of allowing others
     to try it, subject to the above restrictions as well as these:

          QuickStart must be distributed in absolutely unmodified form,
          including ALL program, documentation, and other files.  Please use
          the file QS110.ZIP to do this.

          QuickStart may not be included with any other product for any
          reason whatsoever without a license from Ron Jennings.

          No charge or payment may be levied or accepted for QuickStart.

     Bulletin Board system operators may post the evaluation version of
     QuickStart on their BBS for downloading by their users without written
     permission only if the above conditions are met, and only if no special
     fee is necessary to access the QuickStart files (a general fee to access
     the BBS is ok).

     Distributors of User Supported and Public Domain software MUST obtain
     written permission from Ron Jennings before distributing QuickStart and
     must follow the above conditions.  Permission is almost always granted;
     this requirement is necessary to ensure protection for ourselves and
     QuickStart users from unscrupulous individuals.

                QuickStart Ordering/Registration Information

     Registering (buying) QuickStart allows you to use the product after the
     trial period. Registered QuickStart users get the current version of
     QuickStart on disk along with their own serial number, an optional
     printed User's Guide, mailed notification of major QuickStart updates,
     and priority when calling the QuickStart Software support BBS (we
     guarantee no support to unregistered users).  Most importantly,
     registered users know they are helping to make sure that high-quality
     software like QuickStart continues to be sold in this low-cost way.

     QuickStart registration costs $39, and includes a 'registered' copy of
     the latest version of QuickStart on disk.  A printed User's Guide is
     available for $10.  An evaluation disk with the current copy of
     QuickStart on it is also available for $10.  This is to be used to try
     out QuickStart, and does not include registration (the right to use
     QuickStart after the evaluation period).  The fee covers the cost of
     diskette(s) and handling.

     Payment may be in the form of check, money order, or UPS COD.  A $5
     processing fee is required for all COD orders.  We also accept corporate
     purchase orders for amounts of $39 and over.  All payments must me made
     in US dollars.

     To place an order, please use the order form on the following page, or
     call me at (509)-467-9481 for COD orders.

     Previously registered owners of QuickStart may obtain a new disk with
     registered version for $10, (printed User Guides are extra). Please
     specify your existing serial number when upgrading.

     Shipping is $3 per copy, to a maximum of $30 in North America, and $5
     per copy to a maximum of $50 outside of North America.
