CODE-39 BARCODE LASER FONTCreated with Fontographer<tm> Version 2.2 from Altsys Corporation.This PostScript font is used to create barcodes in Code-39 (not thesame as UPC, which you find on commercial products).  It has beenused with several different combinations of barcode readers andPostScript printers.Files-----Code39Barcode - Fontographer source file.Code3Bar - Postscript downloadable font, in Macintosh format.           This is a text file usable by any computer, but has           a resource fork attached so the Macintosh can automatically           download it.  You can probably convert it to text by           loading it into your text editor holding down the <option>           key. Code3Barcode.bmap - 24-point bitmap.  You may generate other sizes					with Fontographer and the source file.Code3Barcode.AFM  - Font Metrics.  (does any program ever use these?)Code39Barcode Documentation - What you're reading.Legal Stuff-----------This font is "militantly public domain."  This term (from WynnWagner, author of the Opus<no-tm> MS-DOS BBS system) means thatwe do not ask for money. The font may be freely distributed aslong as you do not sell it (exceptions: CompuServe and GEnietype systems, or others which charge a "fair" price for access).Rob Elliott & Ron ElliottFidoNet: 1:115/333.100 (or just 115/333)         any  link into the EchoMac echomail conferenceCompuServe: [70675,1204]UseNet and others: use a FidoNet gateway
