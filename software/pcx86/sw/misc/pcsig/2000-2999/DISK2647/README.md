Disk Title: MORAFF'S ENTRAP                                             
PC-SIG Version: S1.0                                                    
                                                                        
Program Title: Moraff's Entrap                                          
Author Version: 2.0                                                     
Author Registration: Varies.                                            
Special Requirements: Graphics card.                                    
                                                                        
Moraffware brings yet another high resolution computer game to the      
shareware world, supporting everything from hercules monochrome to super
VGA color monitors, including 1024x768 256 color graphics. Like Moraff's
Pinball (the first high-res VGA game) and Morff's Blast (the first      
800x600 16 color game), Moraff's ENTRAP reaches new video heights in    
both the shareware and retail market.                                   
                                                                        
Moraff's ENTRAP is a three dimensional game with a spectacular view of a
huge maze-like playing field littered with enemy robots programmed to   
capture you. Your objective is to reach the far end of the pathway.     
You'll have to use every ounce of your mental skill to entrap the enemy 
robots as you progress toward your objective.
