                                  SuperFly
                        Release 1.1  October 29, 1990

                                Nels Anderson
                               92 Bishop Drive

       Oh, yuck!  The flies are swarming into the house.  Armed with
       only your trusty fly swatters (in limited supply unfortunately)
       and whatever else you can find around the house you are off to
       battle the insect infestation.  Yet for every fly you swat it
       seems like more just pour in.  There's only one solution...get
       the Super Fly!

       SuperFly is an action game with multiple rounds of play.  The
       object on each round is to swat the Super Fly itself, and each
       round presents different obstacles that make it increasingly
       difficult to end the insect menace.  In addition to the main
       fly swarm you'll run into a variety of other insects that will
       also get in your way.

       SuperFly shouldn't require much instruction to play, though
       there is strategy involved especially as you get further into
       the game and the bugs get smarter.  Your main object should
       always be to swat the Super Fly which will advance you to the
       next round.  The Super Fly looks distinctly different from the
       other flies so he's not hard to find.  If you're like most
       people you'll want to jump right into the game rather than
       wading through instructions.  There's no reason not to; play a
       few games and then come back here for some tips and full
       details on the game.

       SuperFly runs in 640x350, 16 color graphics mode so an EGA or
       VGA video card and monitor is required.  Play is done with the
       keyboard so no other special equipment is required.  You can
       play with a mouse or joystick also though the keyboard seems
       to work best.

       SuperFly is distributed as Shareware -- this allows you to try
       it before you buy it, but if you continue to use the game you
       are expected to register.  When you register, please let me
       know what version you have (it's right on the title screen) and
       I'd also be interested to know where you got it from.  Please,
       make sure you put your name and address on your letter!  Or you
       can use the registration form in the file "orderfrm.txt".  Just
       copy the file to your printer, fill it out, and mail it.  If
       you're not familiar with the Shareware concept, please read the
       file "sharewre.txt".  The registration is $15, for which I will
       send you a disk with the latest version along with a set of tips
       that will help you win the game.  Or for $22 you can get the
       "deluxe" version which includes a copy of the latest version of
       the game in a binder with printed instructions.

       OBJECT:

         The final object of SuperFly is to eliminate the insect
         invasion in your house.  In shorter terms, though, the object
         is simply to make it from round to round with your swatter
         intact.  To do this you must seek out and swat the Super Fly
         before being surrounded by the bugs.

       STARTING THE GAME:

         You start SuperFly by running the file fly.exe, that is, you
         should type "fly" on the DOS command line.  SuperFly has
         several command line options.  The first allows you to
         disable sound (you can later turn sound back on using the F3
         key, Sound On/Off option).  Use the option " -s" for no
         sound.  Another other option lets you set the level of
         difficulty.  Use the option " -d#" where # is 1 for normal
         difficulty, 2 for advanced and 3 for expert.  You can also
         select difficulty levels within the game using the F5 key.

         You can also select your control device from the command
         line.  Use " -k" to select keyboard, " -m#" to use the mouse,
         and " -j" to use a joystick.  When selecting the mouse you
         can, optionally, also select the mouse sensitivity.  This is
         equivalent to setting the sensitivity with the F6 command
         during the game.  Use a number between 1 and 50 for the
         sensitivity; 24 is the default value if you don't include a
         number.  For example, using " -m50" would select the mouse
         with maximum sensitivity.

         If you don't select your control device from the command line
         you'll be prompted for your selection before the game starts.

         For example, to start the game normally you would type:

                                     fly

         at the DOS command prompt.  To start the game with sound
         disabled, you would type:

                                   fly -s

         You can use multiple command line options.  For example,
         to play the game with sound off and at expert level, you
         would type:

                                 fly -s -d3

         Command line option summary:

           -s   Sound off
           -d#  Difficulty level is #, where # is 1, 2 or 3
           -k   use Keyboard
           -j   use Joystick
           -m#  use Mouse; if # is included, set mouse sensitivity to
                #, where # is between 1 and 50

       SCORING:

         You score 10 points for each fly you swat.  Later rounds
         introduce additional types of bugs.  Roaches are worth 20
         points and spiders are worth 40 points.  A caterpillar
         appears twice during the game.  Swatting him earns no points
         but gives you an extra swatter.  When you swat the Super Fly
         you get a bonus and go on to the next round.  You can
         recognize the Super Fly because he is green whereas normal
         flies are light blue.

       HALL OF FAME:

         At the end of the game the high score hall of fame will be
         displayed along with your score.  If your score is in the
         top ten you'll be prompted to enter your name for inclusion
         in the list.  The hall of fame is in the file "flyofame.scr"
         and if you ever wish to clear the high score list all you
         have to do is delete this file.

       STRATEGY:

         At the start of the game you have a supply of three fly
         swatters.  You must use your swatter to swat the flies and
         other bugs that appear.  Use the arrow keys on your keyboard
         (or your mouse or joystick) to move your swatter around.
         You can only move in four directions (left, right, up, down)
         while the bugs can move in any direction.  This is important
         because in some rounds you'll find screens that the flies
         can go through but you can't.  To swat a bug you must get
         next to it and then hit the arrow key that would move you
         toward the bug.  The swatted bug remains on the screen as an
         obstacle which you must then avoid.

         When using a mouse you just slide the mouse in the direction
         you want to move or swat.  Using a joystick you just push the
         joystick handle in the direction you want to move.  Holding
         down either joystick button will make the swatter move at
         half speed for better control.

         It isn't necessary to swat every bug you see.  Remember, the
         goal is only to swat the Super Fly so that you can go on to the
         next round.  The Super Fly does not appear right at the
         beginning of the round, though, so you'll have to swat other
         bugs until he does finally show up.  Once the Super Fly appears
         it may actually be better not to swat other bugs, as that only
         increases the number of bugs on the screen and makes it harder
         for you to move around.

         A good strategy is to try to swat bugs so the bodies form a
         line; the idea is that the swatted bugs should limit your
         movements as little as possible.  Try to keep the center of the
         screen clear if possible.  Also make sure not to block all the
         entrances, because if the Super Fly can't get in you'll never
         be able to swat him and move on to the next round.

         Twice during the game a caterpillar will appear which you can
         swat to earn an extra swatter.  When your swatters run out the
         game is over.  You lose a swatter whenever you are completely
         surrounded, whether by bugs or by walls.  Thus it's important
         to keep from getting trapped in a corner.

         Some rounds will have additional objects that may help or
         hinder you.  Be sure to pick up any items you find.

         As soon as you swat the Super Fly you'll advance to the next
         round.  If you get yourself completely surrounded you will
         automatically restart the current round over again, assuming
         you still have swatters left.  If you get into what you
         consider an impossible position, you can abandon your swatter
         by hitting the "A" key.  This has the same effect as if the
         bugs had surrounded you.

       GENERAL:

         SuperFly has a number of options that you can use.  Most can be
         used at any time during the game.

         Help (F1):

         To get some basic information on playing the game, hit the F1
         key at any time.  A one screen help message will appear that
         explains the basics of the game.  Hit any key to clear the help
         message.

         Info (F2):

         Hitting F2 puts up a single screen that provides some
         information on the game, the author and how to register.  Hit
         any key to clear the info message.

         Sound On/Off (F3):

         Hitting F3 at any time during the game will toggle the sound on
         or off.  You can use the option whenever you wish.  You can
         also disable sound when starting up the game using a command
         line option; see the section on Starting The Game for details.

         Skip Rounds (F4):

         This option can only be used at the very start of the game,
         before you've moved your swatter.  Many experienced game
         players find that after a while the first few rounds of a game
         get tedious as they've played them so many times they are no
         longer a challenge.  Using this option you can skip up to nine
         rounds.  This will effect your final score to some extent,
         however as soon as you finish the first round you skipped to
         you will be awarded the bonus points for all the rounds you
         skipped.

         Select Difficulty Level (F5):

         The game defaults to "normal" difficulty level.  To play a
         more challenging game, use the Advanced or Expert settings.
         The higher levels will require you to swat more bugs before
         getting to the Super Fly but you will also get higher bonuses
         for finishing a level.  You can also select difficulty
         through a command line option; see the section on Starting
         The Game for details.  The level you set remains active from
         game to game until you change it and you can only change
         difficulty level at the start of a game.

         Set Mouse Sensitivity (F6):

         This command is only available if you're playing using a
         mouse.  Because each mouse is different, and each player is
         different, it's desirable to be able to control how quickly
         the mouse responds to your movements.  Setting the
         sensitivity lower will require you to move the mouse further
         in relation to how far the swatter moves on the screen.
         Raising the sensitivity will naturally do just the opposite.
         You may want to experiment with different sensitivities as
         it can greatly affect the difficulty of the game.  You can
         also set sensitivity through a command line option; see the
         section on Starting The Game for details.

         Select Keys (F7):

         This command is only available if you're playing using the
         keyboard.  Not everyone likes playing using the arrow keys.
         For example, if you're left-handed you may prefer using keys
         on the left side of the keyboard.  Whatever your reasons, if
         you don't like the default keys for swatter movement, pause,
         and abandon swatter you can change them with this option.

         Shell to DOS (F10):

         If you wish to temporarily break to DOS without quitting the
         game, just hit F10.  When you're done, type "exit" and you'll
         be back in the game right where you left off.  This command
         requires that you have sufficient extra memory.  If it doesn't
         seem to work there probably isn't enough memory available.

         Abandon Swatter (A):

         Sometimes during the game you will find yourself in a situation
         that is hopeless yet you are not quite completely surrounded by
         flies so the game will not automatically end the round.  If you
         ever get in a situation like this, hit the "A" key to abandon
         your swatter.  If you have any swatters left you will start the
         same round over again just as if you had been completely
         surrounded.

         Pause Game (Space):

         If you need to pause the game for any reason, just hit the
         space bar.  The game will remain paused until you hit a key.

         Quit Game (ESC):

         To end the game and exit to DOS at any time, hit the ESC
         (escape) key.

*                      NOTE TO USERS OF SUPERFLY V1.0                       *
*****************************************************************************

         The only consistant complaint I got about the original version
         of SuperFly was that it was "too hard".  I don't know...I
         finished the game several times during testing and I know of
         others who have finished it as well, including one seven year
         old boy who did it completely by himself without the hints file
         or anything.

         Anyway, what I've done is make the default ("normal") level of
         play easier.  Level 2 ("advanced") is equivalent to the default
         level in v1.0.  Level 3 ("expert") is now equivalent to level 2
         in v1.0.

                  file of the top ten most active message posters.
       
       GROUPERS:  A PCBoard 14.x game door.  Players gamble on the outcome
                  of the next card drawn from the deck.  The game is set up

                  scores, generates a current scores bulletin and an end of
                  month final scores bulletin.

   ABOUT SHAREWARE...
   
   Shareware (also known as user supported software and other names) is a
   concept not understood by everyone.  The authors of Shareware retain all
   rights to the software under the copyright laws while still allowing
   free distribution.  This gives the user the chance to freely obtain and
   try out software to see if it fits his needs.  Shareware should not be
   confused with Public Domain software even though they are often obtained
   from the same sources.
   
   If you continue to use Shareware after trying it out, you are expected
   to register your use with the author and pay a registration fee.  What
   you get in return depends on the author, but may include a printed
   manual, free updates, telephone support, etc.  Only by paying for the
   Shareware you use do you enable the Shareware author to continue to
   support his software and create new programs.  Considering that the
   Shareware registration fees are almost always far less than the purchase
   price of comparable commercial software it's obvious that Shareware is a
   good deal for everyone.
   
   There are real advantages to you in the Shareware system.  You get to
   try out software to make sure it is compatible with your hardware and
   that it fits your needs before you "buy" it with your registration.
   The author saves the expense of advertising, packaging and distribution
   and passes the savings on to you.  Plus, most Shareware authors are
   much more accessible than commercial software sources so that your
   questions and suggestions are much more likely to be responded to.
   

                         Thank you for your support.
