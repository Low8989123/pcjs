I am compelled to port Middleton by Jon Hodges to the Windows platform. Enclosed in this archive you will find a .wfn file for use in CorelDraw along with screen fonts and .pfb and .pfm files for use with Windows 3.0 and 2.0.  This incarnation of Middleton is a Type 1 PostScript font for use with the bundled PS driver. You will also find a PageMaker 3.01 publication which you should print to determine the mapping and  how Middleton sets. I do this is memory of a close friend I lost to cancer and hope you will find it in your heart to contribute to this worthy cause. Please respect the wishes of Jon Hodges the designer of Middleton.
For Pam with love, Steve

********************************************************************************************
 
Middleton is an unabashed knockoff of Florentine, a display face
created by R. Hunter Middleton, the former director of type
design for Ludlow. During his lifetime, Middleton created some 90
faces primarily for the advertising community, including the
popular face Radiant. As far as I have been able to determine.
Florentine is a registered trademark of T.J. Lyons, which in turn
has licensed the face to a variety of vendors such as Linotype
and VGC.

This font is being released as freeware to the typesetting
community. However, it can only be uploaded onto electronic
bulletin boards with my permission. On CompuServe, this font is
exclusively found on the DTPFORUM -- under no circumstances is
this font to be loaded onto any other CIS forum.


Middleton is released in memory of Michael DeCrescente, the
former general manager of Characters Typographical Services,
Inc., who died of cancer in 1989. A contribution to the American
Cancer Society is always appreciated.

Notification of any  problems with the font or requests for its
upload on other bulletin boards can be made to:

Jon Hodges
24-32 26th Street
Astoria, NY 11102
CIS #76276,3102

Please be aware that I am still philosophically wrestling with
the whole issue of font knockoffs, so grab the face now. If and
when Florentine is released commercially, I may decide the pull
the font off the boards.

Notes :Here is a collection of ornaments, which go along rather nicelywith Adobe's Wood Type Package. There isn't much to sayabout this font - all of the characters were digitized from anenlarged photocopy of Roy Kelly's American Wood Types,and most of ornaments, flourishes and pointers come fromHamilton's 1906 catalogue, which original I have neverseen. Interestingly enough, most of the Adobe Type can befound in Kelly's book, a not surprising fact since AmericanWood Type is the wood type bible, nearly by itself sparkinga revival of interest (and types) in Wood Type. Also, Kellywrote an introduction for Adobe, and methinks acted asa consultant of sorts as well. To be fair to Adobe, the typesseem to deserve the label "Original", not only because of thequality of digitization, which is high, but also because theAdobe design staff created characters never previouslyincluded with the face. At any rate, most of the charactershere don't appear in Adobe's Package (which was part ofthe reason why this font exists at all), and though some ofthe curves in the font are less than entirely satisfactory(which font having been coughed up over a week last month),I hope it will be of some use.Nigel Yeohzdtl123 @ uk.ac.kcl.cc.ashcompuserve : 100016,275August 1990Credits:I'd like to thank David Collier and the other folks at DecodeDesign, 1 Ashland House, Ashland Place, London, for absolutelyinvaluable spiritual guidance.
