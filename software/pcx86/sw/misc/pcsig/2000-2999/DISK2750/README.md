                   Spring/Summer 1991 (Issue #5 & #6)

ShareDebate International, a ShareWare disk magazine, formerly a

                 Debates & Articles in This Double Disk Issue

Prior to this issue there were 19 debate topics (named in issue #4).
Five new debate topics have been added. Three are related to the Gulf
War and the Palestinian problem. One is a catch-all topic, which is used
by Sysop-Attorney Paula Goldman in her coverage of recent FCC actions
that impact the computer industry. The other topic covers intellectual
property law and programming freedom. Four position papers of the League
for Programming Freeedom, including one written for ShareDebate
International, kick off this debate.

Benston and Kaufman review the history of S&Ls. Bova writes about
freedom of information over the satellite waves. General Graham writes
on the political limitations imposed on the Patriot. The 28 Americans
killed by the Scud missile didn't need to die. Pournelle discusses how
government hurts progress.  Smith assesses the National Interest Project
level Stock market proposal.  Schulman's Prometheus- winning novel,
Alongside Night, is excerpted (7 chapters). Martin writes on the Gulf
War and viruses. McAfee Associates' latest version of its virus detector
is included, SCAN76-C.
