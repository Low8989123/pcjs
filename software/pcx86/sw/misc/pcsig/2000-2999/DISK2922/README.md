Disk No: 2922
Disk Title: Mah Jongg -V-G-A-
PC-SIG Version: S1.0

Program Title: Mah Jongg -V-G-A-
Author Version: 3.0
Author Registration: $15.00
Special Requirements: 640K RAM, VGA, two floppy drives, and a Logitech-
                      compatible mouse.

MAH JONGG -V-G-A- is a high-tech simulation of the ancient Chinese game
of Mah Jongg.  Some historians date Mah Jongg back to the time of
Confucius -- over 25 centuries ago!

It's believed that sailors and fishermen played Mah Jongg as a diversion
from the monotony of their long voyages.  The game was originally played
with cards, but eventually bone and bamboo tiles were substituted since
these were less likely to be blown off the deck. The object of the game
was to match tiles, but the tiles had to first meet certain criteria.

MAH JONGG -V-G-A- recreates the beauty and addictive pleasure of Mah
Jongg, but uses modern data processing techniques and high-resolution
graphics instead of bamboo tiles.

In an attempt to make this game as elegant and as enjoyable as possible,
the author has used some of the most advanced features of today's
state-of-the-art MS-DOS computers.  Not all PC computers are able to run
MAH JONGG -V-G-A-.  But if yours can, prepare yourself for the meeting
of the past and future!!!

Attention 8514/a users!

I now have a BETA TEST version of MJ8514 available.  Look for it
at a BBS near you!  If you register the beta version, you'll get
the "official" v1.0 when it's released!

MJVGA registered users, you can get a copy of the MJ8514 BETA disk
directly form me for $3 shipping & handling.  It's available ONLY on 
5.25" high density diskette.  

Please note that MJ8514 *REQUIRES* 8514/a graphics compatibility, a 
Logitech or (I hope) compatible mouse, and probably about 2 MEG of LIM 
EMS 4.0 expanded memory.  If your hardware doesn't meet these 
requirements, MJ8514 won't even THINK of running!!!
