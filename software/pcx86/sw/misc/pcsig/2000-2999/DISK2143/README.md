## Information about "EASY FORMAT"

    The fun floppy disk formatter.  Powerful, flexible, fully customizable,
    and easy to use.  Gives you complete control over every formatting
    detail.  Supports all common diskette sizes.
    
    EASY FORMAT is designed to meet all your diskette formatting needs,
    providing four different methods of disk testing and six different
    options for marking bad spots to make floppy disks more reliable.  Or
    you can turn all disk testing off for very fast formatting.
    
    EASY FORMAT makes it possible to format two disks simultaneously in two
    different drives, even if they're different capacities.  You can place a
    volume label on each disk formatted and still make the disk bootable
    with the DOS "SYS" command.  You can even put your own custom "boot
    message" onto the disk.
    
    EASY FORMAT makes it easy to format a 360K disk in a 1.2M for use in
    other 360K drives.  It can produce diskettes with either one or two
    copies of the File Allocation Table (FAT).  It won't format hard
    disks, so there is no danger in accidentally choosing the wrong drive
    for formatting.
    
    Everything from drives and disk sizes, format options, screen colors,
    sound effects, and more can be customized.  Set up EASY FORMAT once and
    it will remember your preferences the next time it is used.  Or just
    flip a switch and EASY FORMAT changes languages.  English,
    German, and Spanish are supported.  These are all the extras you only
    get from the best.
