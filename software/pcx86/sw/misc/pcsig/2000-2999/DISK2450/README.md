## Information about "MBW, HORSE, YINGYANG AND OTHERS"

    Fractals generators are among the most popular shareware programs, and
    MBW is sure to become a hot item with Windows users.  MBW creates
    fractals from a Mandelbrot set working out of its own window.
    
    You can zoom in on any part of the image, and watch it form a new
    fractal, which you can save and use at a later time. Other options
    include color settings, iteration limits, scaling, and drawing extents.
    
    If you have Windows and would like to see some neat fractal images, MBW
    is a must.
    
    Here are more programs that look hip on your Windows display.  HORSE
    places a galloping horse in a small window.  Unlike Horse.tbk which
    appeared on a developers toolbox, HORSE does not even come close to
    putting strain the system.  An interesting side note is that the
    original drawings used to create the horse date back to the 1800's.
    YINGYAN draws a symbol, part ying-yang part floppy disk, and prints a
    koan from the book "The Zen of Programming".
    
    And these two Windows programs won't set you back financially--they are
    both free.
