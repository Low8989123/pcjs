How old was Paul Revere when he rode into history?  How many years      
separated Michelangelo and Cortez?  With CHRONOS, you can sort and      
select by individual people and events, or groups and factions; develop 
new insights and trace patterns across different eras and cultures.     
CHRONOS will be useful to history and art students, teachers,           
genealogists, writers or anyone interested in exploring historical      
relations or cultural events.                                           
                                                                        
Display time lines of history's important people and events. Sort by    
people, event, group or faction. Trace patterns across different eras an
cultures. CHRONOS comes with two sample files to demo this program's    
many features. Details on any person or event can be displayed via hot  
keys; reports can be printed on all or selected portions of the         
database. CHRONOS is very easy to learn and use, works with any graphics
card, including color and Hercules, and supports a mouse.
