## Information about "EASY-MANAGE 1 OF 2 (2349 ALSO)"

    EASY-MANAGE is a property management program to monitor your real
    estate investments.  EASY-MANAGE keeps track of all expenses by
    property and category, automatically posts rent and late charges,
    calculates rent balances due, and maintains tenant information in a
    separate file.
    
    The ledger system lets you add and delete rental units and properties,
    with rent and tenant records.  The tenant information file contains rent
    history records for each tenant, past and present.  Keep track of when a
    tenant moved in and out, each one's rent payment history, and more.  The
    size of the ledger is limited only by the available disk space.
    
    EASY-MANAGE provides the type of reports you need to fully
    manage rental properties; monthly profit/loss, annual profit/loss, rent
    records for individual properties, late rent listings, tenant status
    reports, and even a rent past due form letter.
    
    A unique feature of EASY-MANAGE is the ability to manage the smoke
    detectors installed in your properties.  You can keep track of which
    units have smoke detectors and when their batteries need to be
    changed. In some locations this is a mandatory responsibility of the
    property manager.
