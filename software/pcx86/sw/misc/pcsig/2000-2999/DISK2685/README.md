Disk Title: HyperShell 1 of 3 (#2597, #2685 also)                       
PC-SIG Version: S4.0                                                    
                                                                        
Program Title: HyperShell                                               
Author Version: 4.0                                                     
Author Registration: 20 to 100 Pounds.                                  
Special Requirements: Two floppy drives (hard drive recommended).       
                                                                        
HYPERSHELL offers a powerful yet straightforward method of linking      
different text files and graphics (.PCX files )by key words.  By placing
codes within your text you can allow others to follow their interest    
from one file to another. Maneuvering of key words creates a type of    
on-screen menu which allows users to quickly move through documents     
directly related to their interests or needs.                           
                                                                        
For example, you are reading a text file called "Personnel" searching   
for information regarding severance policies.  The document doesn't tell
you enough about severance policies so you access other documents on    
your system regarding this subject until you find the right one.  Once  
you designate reference words which link related files together, these  
links can be bridged easily by anyone.  In the example above,           
"severance" would be the reference word and would appear as a           
highlighted word in the file "Personnel."  Using cursor keys or a mouse,
move to "severance" and press return.  All text files you have tagged as
related to the topic are now at your fingertips without leaving your    
original document.                                                      
                                                                        
HYPERSHELL assists you in the initial set-up of a hypertext system by   
providing a hypertext editor, syntax checker, and formatted printer     
program, as well as several helpful utilities.
