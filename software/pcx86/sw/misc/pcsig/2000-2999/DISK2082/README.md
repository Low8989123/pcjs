                   DISK VENDOR COPYING RESTRICTIONS

Disk vendors (those who sell Shareware disks) are granted permission to copy
the ButtonWare disks only under the following conditions. Exceptions to these
conditions must be received in writing from ButtonWare.

1. You may not charge for the disks unless you are an ASP approved vendor or
   have written permission from ButtonWare. ASP approved vendors are vendors
   who have agreed to meet various standards involving presentation of the
   Shareware concept. Vendors who wish to apply for ASP approved vendor
   status may write to:

            ASP Disk Vendor Committee
            P.O. Box 5786
            Bellevue, WA  98006

2. You may only distribute PC-File if you received the master disks directly
   from ButtonWare. You may not distribute copies of PC-File disks if you
   received the master copy from some source other than ButtonWare.

3. You may only distribute the "Shareware version" disks. These disks are
   created specifically for club, disk vendor and BBS distribution. They can
   be identified by the words "Shareware version" on the initial program
   screen, and by a Shareware message on the last screen. Please note that
   these are not crippled versions of the program. The ONLY difference
   between the "Shareware version" disks and the fully registered program is
   the shareware message.

4. You may not charge more than $3 (U.S.) per diskette.

5. The files and programs on the disks may not be modified or deleted.

6. ButtonWare Shareware disks may only be sold in the United States, Canada,
   The British Isles, and Australasia.

7. The programs cannot be sold as part of some other more inclusive package.

8. The programs cannot be "rented" or "leased" to others.
