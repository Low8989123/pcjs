## FILE2714.TXT

{% raw %}
```
Disk No: 2714
Disk Title: GEdit
PC-SIG Version: S1.0

Program Title: GEdit
Author Version: 1.50
Author Registration: $50.00
Special Requirements: 320K RAM.

GEDIT is a powerful text editor designed for use by programmers and
those providing technical support to multiple computer users.  It is
useful for writing source code and batch files; word processing;
creating, maintaining, and repairing data files; recovering files from
damaged diskettes; and exploring computer memory.

GEDIT provides all of the standard word processing functions such as
formatting text; justification; automatic wordwrap; printing attributes
such as bold, underline, italics, sub/superscript; user-defined
attributes; and line drawing capabilities.

GEDIT supports an edit file size limited only by the available memory,
up to 640K.  Text files can have a preset or unlimited line length.
Split-screen editing is possible for two files.  Cut and paste columns.
``Undo'' an edit action.  Edit in either 25 or 43/50 line mode on
EGA/VGA monitors.

GEDIT differs from other word processors by keeping a running total of
available memory as well as its ability to explore and edit memory
segments and display hexdumps of files on disk and in memory.  Compare
two text files and append files in memory.

An additional feature is the ability of GEDIT to directly edit dBASE III
and WordStar files.
