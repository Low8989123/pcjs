## Information about "ULTRASEARCH"

    ULTRASEARCH is a search and editing tool that is easier to use than
    dBASE III, and gives you more capabilities than simple searches.
    
    With ULTRASEARCH you can do a fast full text search of the data in any
    .DBF format file, construct a subfile of just the data you need, and
    tailor the screen displays to meet your needs.
    
    Editing and adding records is simple. You don't even need to have
    dBASE loaded. The edit commands can be displayed on the screen for
    easy reference, and each user can adjust the editing commands with a
    couple of key strokes to fit their preferences. With full function
    editing, do any file maintenance necessary including flagging records
    for deletion.
    
    ULTRASEARCH allows you to distribute your database throughout your
    organization without obtaining multiple copies of dBASE. Since it uses
    the same file format, you can use this program to add and
    maintain records in the database.

                                 Introduction

Welcome to UltraSearch. You have just substantially improved your ability to
make inquiries on your dBASE database files. You can now search data faster,
more easily, and more effectively than you ever imagined possible. Key
features you can take advantage of include:

- Creating a small index file, which stays small even if you include every
field in your database.

- Easily designing the display screen, including only the fields you select;
use your usual word processor if you wish.

- Permitting the viewer to update data. Maintenance of the index file is
automatic and instant if an update is performed.

- Instantly finding the data you search.

- Completing complicated inquiries without complicated command syntax (just
type the character, word or phrase and press the Enter key).

As powerful as UltraSearch is, you will still find it easy to learn and easy
to use.


                                   Overview

Whether you are working with hundreds of records or tens of thousands of
records, you probably went through the effort to create the database so that
you could get useful information out of your computer later. dBase III
provided you with several features to simplify data entry, but consider what
the following UltraSearch features can do for your ability to extract
information:

	UltraFast

UltraSearch utilizes an extremely powerful and efficient indexing technology
that can index a 35,000 record file in less than 5 minutes. All the fields
you select for indexing are included in a single index file. Even though you
may elect to include all your database fields, the UltraSearch index will
occupy a maximum of only 32 bytes per record. There is no practical limit to
the data you may include in this index. This small index is the real secret
behind the lightning speed of UltraSearch.

	Free Form Searches

You know there are several entries for wire cutters in the inventory file
you've created, but SEEK, FIND, and LOCATE fail to turn up the description
you're looking for. The problem is you can't remember the exact description.
This is how UltraSearch works; your description field may look like any of
these:

      	Cutters, Wire/Cable, Electric
      	Electrical Cutters, Wire/Cable
      	Wire/Cable Cutters, Electrical

...and yet any of the following UltraSearch inquiries would locate your
record:

   	Search> wire cutters
   	Search> w cut
   	Search> electric cut
   	Search> cutter elect

   Easy to Use

Maybe you tried creating several fields to remedy the problem of the wire
cutters, described above. UltraSearch combines all of these fields in a
single index file. If your file looks like this:

   	Field #1       Field #2          Field # 3
   	Cutters Wire   Electrical Wire   Electrical Cutters

...Your UltraSearch inquiry to search across fields #1, #2 and #3 looks like
this:

   	Search> wire cutters

Note: "wire cutters," of course, could be replaced with a nearly infinite
number of free form inquiries.



   Upper/Lower Case Flexibility

UPPER/lower case, or any combination, doesn't matter to UltraSearch. This
eliminates another bit of "command syntax". The familiar:

      "LOCATE FOR UPPER(FIELDNAME)=WIRE CUTTERS"

is replaced with any of the following:

      Search> wire cutters
      Search> Wire Cutters
      Search> WIRE CUTTERS


   Partial Word Searches

Carter Building or John Cartier Building?  You want to ask dBASE to find the 
address in the "Cart- something Building".  Even

   	LOCATE FOR UPPER(SUBSTR(ADDRESS,1,4))="CART"

won't help if "John Cartier Building" was actually entered in your
database. The UltraSearch Inquiry:

      Search> cart building

But was it in the ADDRESS field or the BUILDING field? It doesn't
matter, because UltraSearch checks both--at the speed of an indexed search!


   UltraFlexible

You can use dBASE LOCATE to find information in any field, as long as you
remember at least the first few letters and remember the command syntax
exactly. But what if time is a factor? Since dBASE can handle only 7 indices
at one time, reindexing before you inquire is slow. It seems like you can't
win.

UltraSearch lets you index on every field you wish and the index file
occupies a maximum of just 32 bytes per record, regardless of the size of
your record, or the number of index fields!


   Data Security

What do you do when you want several work stations to inquire on your
database? You're not ready for the complexity of a Local Area Network, but
you don't want to buy several copies of dBASE either.

The UltraSearch solution: continue to use your dBASE programs at your
primary data entry station. Then copy the entire file or selected records
to other work stations for inquiry or maintenance using UltraSearch.
Compare the price for several copies of UltraSearch to the same for
dBASE.


   Diverse Application

It doesn't matter if you are concerned with parts and inventory files,
personnel and human resources files, mailing lists, or customer tracking
files: UltraSearch will vastly improve your inquiry capability on any
dBASE database file you create.


   Versatile Screen

You define the appearance of your UltraSearch inquiry display. When you
do, you determine not only where fields are displayed, but which fields
are displayed. In fact, you may create several different versions of the
UltraSearch display for use at various work stations.


   Update Capability

Once you have located a record with UltraSearch, you have total update
capability. You can add new records, mark records for deletion or change
records as you wish. The UltraSearch index file is updated automatically.

Getting what you need out of your computer is the most important function of
your database file. Getting information out of your computer is what
UltraSearch is all about.









About this documentation file...

This file is divided into sections, which we hope will enable you to receive
exactly the amount of help you need. Since UltraSearch is intended for
computer novices and gurus alike, this presents something of a challenge, but
here goes...

Section 1, Getting Started, will tell you how to copy UltraSearch onto your
hard disk.

Section 2, Setting Up, will introduce you to the general requirements of
UltraSearch and tell you how to prepare UltraSearch for handling your
particular database files.

Section 3, Reference, goes straight to the heart of each UltraSearch command.

Section 4, System Messages & Problem Solving, explains the meaning and the
significance of the various messages you may receive from UltraSearch.


                          Section 1, Getting Started

Installing UltraSearch. Getting UltraSearch into your computer is as easy
as copying the contents of the distribution diskette into your SEARCH
directory and adding C:\SEARCH to the PATH command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file. If you're not familiar with DOS commands, this is how it's done:


1. Before you do anything else, make a backup copy of the distribution
diskette C>DISKCOPY A: A:

The computer will ask you to place the SOURCE diskette in Drive A.
Insert the distribution diskette and press <Enter>.

After reading the disk drive for a minute, the computer will ask you to
place the TARGET diskette in Drive A. Insert your blank diskette and press
<Enter>. If it's not already formatted, the operating system will take
care of that automatically.


2. At the DOS prompt, make a directory to store your UltraSearch files:

      C>CD \        (change to the Root directory)
      C>MD SEARCH   (create SEARCH directory)
      C>CD SEARCH   (change to SEARCH directory)

Note: when you type these commands, the computer won't "do" anything,
but the current directory will then be SEARCH.


3. Copy the contents of the distribution diskette:

      C>copy a:*.*

4. Edit the PATH command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file using either EDLIN,
your own DOS text editor, or your favorite word processing program if it
has ASCII file import and export capabilities. The PATH command will look
something like this:

   	PATH C:\DOS;C:\DBASE

All you need to do is tack on our new directory as follows:

   	PATH C:\DOS;C:\DBASE;C:\SEARCH


   Text Editor

Before actually running UltraSearch on a database file, you may find it
helpful to customize a specialized file called a "template," which is a DOS
text (ASCII) file defining your UltraSearch file display layout. While we
will be describing this at some length shortly, it is worth mentioning
"text" editors. The editor you use may be any of the following:

   dBASE MODIFY COMMAND

You may be familiar with this command used to activate the dBASE text
editor. It is fine for our purposes.


   Your Word Processor

Most word processors enable you to save files in a generic text
format. They may call it an "ASCII" save or "DOS text" file, but the main
thing is that they strip away the special characters unique to that word
processor.

   Programmer's Text Editors

Most of the text editors intended for programmers produce exactly the
kind of generic text we've been talking about.

   EDLIN

If you don't have access to anything else, EDLIN will do. This is a
single-line editor provided with the DOS operating system, which is
adequate for the minimal requirements of your template file.



                               File Extensions

A DOS filename may include a 3-character "extension", which is
sometimes used by software such as dBASE and UltraSearch to identify
particular types of files. There are five file extensions with special
meaning to UltraSearch:

    .DBF (database file)

This extension is added automatically by dBASE when you create a
database file. This convention is not required by UltraSearch; dBASE
database files with any extension may be used.

    .TP (template)

This extension is required so that UltraSearch can find the template
file which corresponds to the database file you select.

    .INF (information)

Files with this extension are created by UltraSearch automatically
when you select a database file with no corresponding template (TP)
file. This file is intended for your convenience only; it is a
reference to the structure of your database to be used in creating your
template file. If you don't need this file, you can delete it at any
time. It is not required by UltraSearch.

    .IA (UltraSearch index)

The index files serve the same purpose for UltraSearch that you have
seen in dBASE; it makes finding data much faster. You may be
accustomed to having several index files for various purposes.
UltraSearch requires only one, regardless of the type of search you wish
to perform.

    .EXE (UltraSearch Program File)

   US.EXE - This is the executable UltraSearch program file.


                      Section 2, Setting up UltraSearch


   Overview to UltraSearch Setup

UltraSearch is not intended for creating new databases (but watch for
future releases which may). Therefore, we have to assume you already have
a database file in place. In addition to an existing database file, a
"template" file is required by UltraSearch. This template serves two
purposes; it

1) defines the way the display screen will appear as you use
UltraSearch, and

2) enables you to mark the fields which are to be included in the
UltraSearch index (for subsequent searches).

UltraSearch creates a template file automatically and assumes that you
would like to index all fields in the record. It is likely, however, that
you will want to customize the appearance of your record display, or
exclude one or more fields from the UltraSearch index.


   Template Files

A template file is used to tell UltraSearch exactly how you want the
display screen to look. UltraSearch creates a template file automatically,
using the file extension, ".TP". Customizing the appearance of your
UltraSearch display is simply a matter of editing this file using your text
editor or word processor like we did on the one presented here:

________________________________________________________________________

We used upper case letters to distinguish between descriptive text and actual
field names, but this is not an UltraSearch requirement.


The following points are all you need to remember in editing your template
file:

- Field names from the dBASE file are entered between backslashes (\);

- The first backslash represents the starting position for the
displayed data;

- Anything not typed between backslashes will appear exactly as typed;

- You must leave space for display of the entire field; overlapping
fields will prevent UltraSearch from running;

- Fields which are to be included in the UltraSearch index are preceded
by an asterisk (*) (in our example, we included all but one, with no
increase in the size of the index!);

- Fields which are to be displayed but not included in the UltraSearch
index are entered between backslashes (\) without an asterisk (*);

- The template file, and subsequently your display, may be a total of
21 lines in length (to leave room for UltraSearch messages and input);

- If there is not room for an entire field before the end of the
display, the field will appear truncated, but the entire field is
indexed and is searchable.


                       Section 3, UltraSearch Reference


Starting UltraSearch.

Typically, you would start UltraSearch from the directory which contains
your database and template files. UltraSearch is started at the DOS prompt
with the command:

   C>US FILENAME

FILENAME, of course, would be the name of your database file. The
extension, .DBF, is not required, but if you have changed the standard
extension to something else, you must include it.


   UltraSearch Commands.

UltraSearch commands are activated by pressing one of the cursor control
keys or the character keys described here. You may also use the light bar
menu displayed at the bottom of the UltraSearch display. Use the right and
left arrow keys, or the first letter of each command to make menu
selections.


   Creating an UltraSearch Index (I).

A database file must be indexed by UltraSearch before you can use the
Search command, but the basic browsing and editing options will work even
before the UltraSearch index is created. When you press the letter, I,
UltraSearch will check to see if an index for this file already exists. If
an index file does already exist, UltraSearch will ask you to verify (Y
or N) before continuing. The old index will be replaced, if you select Y.

CAUTION: UltraSearch index files are not updated when you add or modify
records using dBASE. Therefore, you must use Index to update your
UltraSearch index, if the file has been updated using dBASE since the last
UltraSearch index operation.


   Search (S).

The search option is the most powerful feature of UltraSearch. It is
both fast and easy to use.


   Search All Occurrences.

When you press the letter, S, UltraSearch will display a search
prompt. Simply type the word or words (up to 70 characters) that you are
looking for and press <Enter>; UltraSearch will check all indexed fields
for matching records.


If you specify more than one word, UltraSearch will assume you mean
find all records containing both (or all) specified words. Therefore,
if you specify "san francisco" you won't be retrieving "san diego". This
also means that if you search for the name "ed brown", UltraSearch will
also locate a record with a street name "twistED rock" in "BROWNsville"
if all these fields are included in the index and you don't get more
specific.


   Recalling Your Last Search.

If you want to recall the last search string entered, simply push the F1 key 
from within the search mode. This is useful when you wish to modify the last 
search slightly, or if you would like to re-invoke the last search without 
typing the search string again.


   Getting More Specific.

To limit the scope of a search to a particular field, simply add a tilde (~) 
and field number to the word (with no blank space). For example, if NAME 
(field #4) and CITY (field #8) are both included in the index:

      brown~4  will find Ed Browning
               but not Brownsville TX

      brown~8  will find Brownsville TX
               but not Ed Browning

Note: The Layout (L) option is useful as a field number reference. You can 
determine the field number and check to see if a particular field is included 
in the index. You may wish to print the layout screen (using the DOS Print 
Screen function) for future reference when building a complex search.

The vertical line (|) may be used to specify characters which occur only at 
the beginning or end of a word, for example:

      |co   will find Randy Coleman
            but not San Francisco

      co|   will find San Francisco
            but not Randy Coleman

      |San| will find San Francisco
            but not Santa Fe Browsing Options.

Do not be confused by a distinct difference between a dBASE indexed file
and an UltraSearch indexed file: after UltraSearch indexing, your database
file will still appear in its original record order.


   Top/Bottom of File

The HOME and END keys are used to advance instantly to the top of the
database file or to the end of the file respectively.


   Next Record in File

The DOWN arrow (cursor control key) or the space bar may be used to advance
to the next record in the data base file by record number sequence. This does
not interfere with the Next and Previous Find options, which enable you to
browse through records found in the current Search. When you reach the bottom
of the file, UltraSearch automatically continues with record number 1 (as if
the file were circular). Watch the record number counter in the lower right
corner.


   Previous Record in File

The UP arrow (cursor control key) is used to move to the previous record in
the database file by record number sequence. This does not interfere with
the Next and Previous Find options, which enable you to browse through
records found in the current Search. When you reach the top of the file,
UltraSearch automatically continues with the last record in the file (as if
the file were circular). Watch the record number counter in the lower right
corner.


   Next Find (N)

Press the letter, N, to advance to the next occurrence of the word(s) found
by a search. UltraSearch will continue to advance until it displays the
message, "No More".


   Previous Find (P)

Press the letter, P, to move to the previous occurrence of the word(s) found
by a search. UltraSearch will continue in this fashion until the message,
"No Previous". is displayed.


   Move to Record Number (M)

Even after indexing, your records will appear in their original record
sequence (the order in which they were added). When you press the letter, M,
UltraSearch will ask you to specify a record number. Type the record number
and press enter. It is similar to the dBASE GOTO command.


   Editing (E)

When you press the letter, E, UltraSearch enters "edit" mode. Use the
arrow keys to move to the field you wish to edit. The "current" field will
appear in reverse video. Press the Enter key to save the change and leave
edit mode or press Escape to cancel the change.


                            Keyboard Definitions

The following table lists the editing functions available when in edit
mode:

      Edit Function               Predefined Key(s)

      Delete Character                 Del

                                     Help

Help is available in several forms. There is a general UltraSearch
command reference as well as a file reference to help you determine field
numbers and identify index keys.


   General Command Reference (H)

When you press the letter, H, UltraSearch displays a one-page display
of all of the keys used to activate the various UltraSearch Commands.
You may press any key to exit this display.


   Field Names (F)

Pressing the letter, F, will produce a list of all the fields in your
database. Those which have been selected for display and indexing will
have boldfaced field numbers; those selected for display only will have
field numbers in reverse video; those not selected for display or
indexing will have field numbers displayed in normal mode. To change
these selections, you must exit UltraSearch and edit your template file.


   Layout (L)

The layout display, activated by pressing the letter, L, is similar in
function to the field name list described in the previous paragraph.
The difference is that only fields selected for display are shown. A
number indicates that the field is included in the index and may be
used in defining the scope of a search. If a one byte field is indexed
and has a double digit field number, the field will be displayed with a
letter (A-Z) and a cross- reference for that letter will be displayed at
the bottom of your screen. A field which is not included in the index
will be filled with X's.


	Write Results (W)

This option may only be used after specifying your search criteria using
option S (search). Press W and UltraSearch will ask you to type a name for
the new database file to which all records found by the search will be
copied. The name you use must be eight characters or less in length, may
not include a period or any spaces, and may not include an extension.
UltraSearch will add the extension, ".DBF". If you had customized the
original template file, you could use the DOS Copy command to create a
template for the new file.

      COPY FILENAME.TP NEWFILE.TP

where FILENAME.TP is your original template file and NEWFILE.TP is the
name of the new template file.

You will also need to Index the new file before doing any searches.


	Quit (Q)

You may exit UltraSearch at any time by simply pressing the letter, Q.
You will be asked to confirm this selection (Y, exit, or N, cancel).
Remember that if you made any changes to data which might affect your dBASE
indices, you may want to re-index your dBASE file.


                Section 4, System Messages & Problem Solving

                               System Messages

The following is an alphabetic listing of messages which you may receive
from UltraSearch from time to time. Many of these do not denote errors;
they are simply informative messages to make sure everything is in order.
Most are self-explanatory, but you may want to read these notes to
understand the full implication of these messages.


	Already indexed. Are you sure?

Each time you index the file, UltraSearch will overlay the previous
index file. This message lets you verify that this is what you wish to
do. Replacing the original index is necessary any time there is a change
made to an indexed field by software other than UltraSearch.


	Bad Command or File Name

This is actually a DOS error message indicating that the operating
system doesn't recognize the command entered. If the current directory
is not SEARCH, then SEARCH must be added to the path command (see
Installing UltraSearch). This error would also occur if you omitted the
space between USDEMO and the FILENAME.


	Creating index

This flashing message will continue until the new index is complete. A
counter in the center of the status line will indicate the number of
records indexed (in increments of 100). If you abort the index,
UltraSearch will prevent you from searching on the incomplete index
file.

CAUTION: If you exit UltraSearch after aborting indexing, you could
reactivate UltraSearch without reindexing. However, this would be
inadvisable since the index would not be complete and any search might be
inaccurate.


	Creating New .DBF file Finished. XXXXXX records written

This message flashes when you use the Write Results (W) command to
copy searched records and will continue until the new database file has
been completed. The counter will increment as each record is added to the
new file.


	File is indexed

CAUTION: This message tells you that an index exists, but does not
verify that the index is current. If changes have occurred in the
database since the last time you used UltraSearch, you must Index the file
again.


	File name for output (no extension)

When you select option W (Write), you must name the new database file.
Use only eight or fewer characters, with no spaces or periods.


	Illegal constraint field

A constraint limits the scope of a search to a particular field. The
word to be searched must be followed by a tilde (~) and field number.
Option L (Layout) will provide you with a display of valid field
numbers. This message indicates that you have selected a
non-indexed field or typed a tilde (~) without specifying a field
number.


	More than 22 lines in the template file. Please shorten to 22 lines
	or less.

The size of the display area is limited to prevent
interference with the display of file information and messages. Use
your text editor to modify the template file.


	No More

This indicates that you have reached the last record matching
your search criteria.


	No previous

This tells you that no records before the displayed record
match your search criteria.


	No search in progress

This message will appear if you select N (Next Find) or P
(Previous Find) without first specifying your search criteria. Use
option S (Search) first, then use these options to browse
through selected records. The up and down arrows (or space bar) are
used to advance through the database by record number,
regardless of search criteria.


	No search results to use

You may not use option W (Write) without first using option S
(Search) to specify which records you wish UltraSearch to copy to
another file.


    Null string after constraint field removed

This message tells you that you have typed an extra blank
space between the tilde (~) and the field number.

       Correct     Incorrect

       brown~3     brown  ~3


    Overlapping field 'MI' on line 4 of template file

In laying out your template file, you must be sure to leave
room for display of all fields. This message was produced by placing
the middle initial (MI) too close to the first name (FIRST),
which was fourteen characters in length.

NAME: \*FIRST\ \MI\ \*LAST\

This problem was corrected by repositioning the fields as
follows:

NAME: \*FIRST\ \MI\ \*LAST\


    Possible file change. Please re-index if this has occurred.

This message will only appear when you first activate
UltraSearch, indicating that the index file may not match the database
file. If you exit without indexing you will not receive this
message again when you reactivate UltraSearch.


    Record number is out of bounds

Option M (Move to Record Number) prompts you to enter a record
number between 1 and the last record number in the file, which is
displayed in parenthesis. This message indicates you entered a
number beyond this range or a letter (which equals 0).


    No template file ('DEMO.TP') found, so am creating the 
    file 'DEMO.INF' which is an information file containing 
    descriptive information about the database which can 
    be used in creating a template.  A template file 
    will also be created displaying as many of these fields 
    as can fit on the screen. Run this program again to use 
    this template or consult the documentation 
    for help in creating your own display template.

UltraSearch has created a .TP (template) file and an .INF
(information) file for your use. You should re-run USDEMO if you wish
to use these files.


    .TP file non-existent but .INF file exists. Overwrite .INF file 
    (y or n)?

While attempting to create a template file, UltraSearch found
an information file already existed. You should answer 'y' if you
would like UltraSearch to create a display template for you.


    Unable to create .DBF output file

Using the Write, W, command, you specified an illegal name for
the new file; it must be eight or fewer characters, and may not
contain spaces or a period.


    Unable to open file 'FILENAME'

This message occurs when you attempt to run UltraSearch with a
non-existent file name. Check to see if you spelled the name of the
file correctly before restarting the program. This error would
also occur if the file existed, but was not a dBASE file.


    You must create index prior to searching

Without the unique UltraSearch index, option S (Search) is not
functional. You must first select option I (Index) to create the
required index.


                               Problem Solving
 
Since UltraSearch is primarily concerned with improving a fairly
specific aspect of database management, there aren't many ways to get in
trouble; however, we found a few conditions worth mentioning:


    Cursor control keys appear to stop working

Check your Num Lock key. If you accidentally press it, there
will be no visible indication on the screen. The numeric keypad is not
included in the default configuration file.


    You have accidentally selected an option you do not wish to use.

If a message does not say, "Press any key to continue", just
press the <Enter> key. This blank entry will cancel any command.


    You have tried to start UltraSearch while dBASE is running and 
    keep returning to the dBASE dot prompt.

UltraSearch is probably displaying an error message which is
immediately overlaid by dBase. You are probably entering the filename
incorrectly. Be sure and type:

	US FILENAME

FILENAME is the name of you database file. The extension is
not necessary unless it is different from the standard .DBF.
