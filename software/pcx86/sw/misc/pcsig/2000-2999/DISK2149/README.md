     WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF COTTAGE INDUSTRY SOFTWARE!! 
 
     CRAFTY LI'L HELPER was developed for the entrepreneur like you!!

     entrepreneur in the specific Cottage Industry of 'Country
     Woodworking'.  You will find the data necessary to run your
     'cottage industry' available in this package.  

     CRAFTY LI'L HELPER does not provide all the features and function
     of the many software packages on the market today, most of which  
     provide too many 'bells and whistles' which tend to bog down the  
     user.  However, I will be more than happy to entertain custom     
     modifications for your operation.  

     CRAFTY LI'L HELPER is Shareware, therefore, if you use it in your
     business please register your copy with me for $30.00.  A single
     registration will allow you to use CRAFTY on one PC only.  If you 
     use CRAFTY on more than one PC, please purchase multiple
     registrations.  Your registration will allow you to receive
     periodic upgrades.  

     Thank you!     1.  PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

     Invoice accounting program which keeps track of Customers (retail,
     wholesale, consignment), Inventory, and Invoices.  A menu-driven  
     user interface which allows functions to Add, Delete, Change, and 
     Display your records and to produce printed Reports.  Easy to use:
     after you have entered your Customers and your Inventory, you are 
     ready to record your sales which in turn will produce Packing     
     Slips to send with the orders and Invoices for billing the        
     purchase.  If you have your product on Consignment, this program  
     will keep track of which product has been sold or returned, and   
     which items are still for sale.  A Crafty Control record keeps    
     data about your business, various UPS calculation parameters, and 
     other system information.  A varied set of printed reports allows 
     for hard-copy review of your data.  Keeps track of the number of  
     invoices not yet filled, and the inventory required to fill these 
     orders.  UPS charges are calculated automatically for up to six   
     boxes per invoice.  State tax is automatically calculated for     
     retail invoices.

           'E' WILL RETURN YOU TO THE PREVIOUS MENU.  'E' ON THE MAIN  
           MENU WILL TAKE YOU BACK TO THE DOS PROMPT.

           SET OF NUMBERS.
    C. MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION (continued)

       11. THE CUSTOMER NUMBERS ASSOCIATED WITH DELETED CUSTOMER       
           RECORDS CAN NOT BE RE-USED, AS NEW CUSTOMER NUMBERS ARE
           AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGNED BASED UPON THE NEXT AVAILABLE
           NUMBER IN THE CRAFTY CONTROL RECORD.        

       12. INVOICE NUMBERS ARE AUTOMATICALLY ASSIGNED, AND ARE A      
           COMBINATION OF THE 3-DIGIT CUSTOMER NUMBER FOLLOWED BY A   
           3-DIGIT INVOICE NUMBER TAKEN FROM A FIELD IN THE CUSTOMERS  
           RECORD.  THE INVOICE NUMBER IS UPDATED EACH TIME A NEW      
           INVOICE IS CREATED.

       13. UPS CALCULATION: THE WEIGHT OF UP TO SIX BOXES MAY BE       
           ENTERED FOR AUTOMATIC UPS CHARGE CALCULATION.

       14. INVENTORY: THE QUANTITY ONHAND OF A PARTICULAR INVENTORY
           ITEM IS DECREASED BY THE QUANTITY ENTERED WHEN A NEW INVOICE
           IS CREATED.

       15. CONSIGNMENT ACCOUNTING: 

           - ALONG WITH THE PACKING SLIP FOR A CONSIGNMENT CUSTOMER IS
             PRINTED A LIST OF THE CONSIGNMENT ITEMS. THIS REPORT MAY  
             BE USED BY THE CONSIGNOR TO INDICATE THOSE ITEMS SOLD AND 
             RETURNED, AND GIVEN BACK TO YOU WITH YOUR CHECK.
     
           - CONSIGNMENT RECORDS ARE DYNAMICALLY ADDED TO THE
             CONSIGNMENT FILE FROM THE NEW INVOICE ROUTINE AFTER AN    
             INVENTORY ITEM IS CHOSEN.  THE NUMBER OF RECORDS ADDED IS 
             EQUAL TO THE QUANTITY YOU WISH TO GIVE TO THE CONSIGNOR.  
             EACH INVENTORY ITEM ON THE INVOICE FOR WHICH CONSIGNMENT  
             RECORDS WERE ADDED TO THE CONSIGNMENT FILE WILL BE GIVEN A
             'CONSIGNMENT NUMBER'.  THIS CONSIGNMENT NUMBER IS CREATED 
             FROM TWO FIELDS IN THE CUSTOMER RECORD, AND IS A          
             COMBINATION OF A 3-DIGIT PREFIX AND A SEQUENTIAL          
             CONSIGNMENT NUMBER.

       16. THE 'ORDERS OUTSTANDING' REPORT CAN BE USED TO KEEP TRACK OF
           THE INVOICES YOUR ARE CURRENTLY WORKING TO FILL, AND        
           PARTICULARLY, THE QUANTITIES OF EACH INVENTORY ITEM REQUIRED
           TO FILL THE INVOICES-IN-PROCESS.           

       17. STATE TAX IS ONLY CALCULATED IF THE INVOICE IS A 'RETAIL'
           CUSTOMER.  STATE TAX IS CALCULATED BASED UPON THE 'STATE OF

Here's a home business system that lets you concentrate on your         
craft, not your paperwork.  Its menu system guides you painlessly       
through tracking costs, supplies, customers, and products counted.      
                                                                        
The lure of running a business, making some extra money, or helping     
with a charity, has overcome all of us at one time or another.  So      
what went wrong?  We didn't have CRAFTY LI'L HELPER doing all the hard  
work!  This is a very crafty helper, and the only thing that's          
"little" about it is its registration fee.  Among its features is an    
easy-to-use menu system that guides you painlessly through inventory    
and invoicing, sales tax, and UPS shipping rates.                       
                                                                        
CRAFTY LI'L HELPER keeps track of your inventory size and cost; tracks  
your retail, wholesale and consignment customers; and follows all       
outstanding orders and billing.  Although it can run on just one        
floppy drive, its record number is limited only by your disk storage    
size.  With CRAFTY LI'L HELPER, all of the really difficult parts of    
running your own small business have been taken care of, and you're     
left with all the fun!                                                  
                                                                        
CRAFTY LI'L HELPER is a big help for small businesses with items to     
sell.  It carefully shows where money is spent and how much has been    
made.  Plus, it is very easy to use, with clear instructions on moving  
around in the program and encouraging words when you make a sale!       
Especially if you are going into a craft business, take along CRAFTY    
LI'L HELPER.
