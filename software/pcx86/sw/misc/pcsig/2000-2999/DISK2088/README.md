## Information about "20TH CENTURY FARO"

    FARO is one of the oldest gambling card games ever to grace the casino.
    If you enjoy fast-moving casino games, you'll love this unique
    simulation called 20TH CENTURY FARO.
    
    All bets which can be placed in the casino game are available in this
    program for one player.  Even the casekeeper is displayed in the same
    way it would appear in a casino.  A "Farobank" keeps track of all money
    lost by or paid to the player, letting you know how you're doing
    against the computer opponent.  Like real Faro, it's the house that
    usually comes out ahead.  But you never know -- it could be your lucky
    day.

Play the oldest gambling card game in the world. 20TH CENTURY FARO is   
the only Faro simulation game around.  All bets which could be placed in
the casino game are emulated in this program for one player.  Play this 
game of luck against the computer without traveling to a casino or      
betting a dime.                                                         
                                                                        
The casekeeper is displayed in the same way as it would appear in a     
casino.  All bets are paid and money is tracked by the program.  A      
'Farobank' is established to give players an incentive to win. 20TH     
CENTURY FARO keeps track of all money lost by, or paid to players over  
their initial stake.  It is the house that, as usual, acquires more     
money than is paid out.  Another touch of realism.
