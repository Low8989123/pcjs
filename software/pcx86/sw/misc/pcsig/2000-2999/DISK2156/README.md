                         Templates of Doom tm

Welcome to Templates of Doom, the program that teaches spreadsheets. 
There are two separate demo versions of the program on this disk.  One
is for Lotus and the Lotus functional work-a-likes such as VP-Planner
and Quattro, and one is for PC Excel.  We also have a version for
Macintosh Excel on a different disk.

TO START:
Place this disk in your A: Drive or copy it to any appropriate directory
on you hard disk.
  
FOR LOTUS AND FUNCTIONAL WORK-A-LIKES:
Start your spreadsheet program and make sure the spreadsheet program
default drive and directory are set to the location of Templates of
Doom.  The commands in Lotus to do this are / Worksheet, Global,
Default, Directory, :Type in the name of the drive and directory that
Templates of Doom is on and press return.  For example, if Templates of
Doom is in the A: drive, type A: and press Return.  Retrieve the file
DOOMDEMO.WKS (/ F R DOOMDEMO Return).  The program will take over from
there.

FOR PC EXCEL:
Unless you have extended memory, we suggest that you temporarily remove
any memory resident programs because PC Excel uses a lot of memory.
Start PC Excel and close the blank spreadsheet that appears.  Pull down
the File menu, select Open and navigate to the  disk drive and directory
that Templates of Doom is on. When DOOMDEMO.XLM appears in the scrolling
window, select it and the program will take over from there.

TO ORDER TEMPLATES OF DOOM:
The full program cost $69.95 plus $4.00 shipping.  We accept Visa and
MasterCard orders over the phone and almost anything in the mail
including company purchase orders.  Our address and phone are:

Solar Systems Software
8105 Shelter Creek
San Bruno,CA 94066
(415)  952-2375     (Weekdays between 9:00 and 4:00 PST)
