## Information about "CREATIVITY PACKAGE 2 OF 3 (2075, 2077)"

    The CREATIVITY PACKAGE is a three disk creativity and idea generator.
    Disk one contains Thomas A. Easton's complete book, "Think Thunder! And
    Unleash Your Creativity," a straightforward explanation of the nature of
    creativity and how to develop it.  Disk two contains the program,
    THUNDER THOUGHT, a proven tool for computer-aided brainstorming,
    developing and refining ideas, particularly in the fields of creative
    writing and inventing.  Disk three contains VERSIFIER, the amazing
    poetry writing program that works with the user's word selection to
    create fascinating free verse or haiku poetry.  Considering that any one
    of these disks could be tremendously helpful in understanding and
    developing creative thinking, the effect of all three may be mind
    expanding!
    "Think Thunder!" can be read chapter by chapter on the computer screen
    or printed out.  The book can encourage creative thinking with or
    without the use of THUNDER THOUGHT.
    
    THUNDER THOUGHT works to facilitate the creative process by automating
    its initial stages.  With it, you don't need to worry about how to come
    up with novel combinations of words, images, or ideas.  THUNDER THOUGHT
    will do that for you, leaving you with the task of finding or
    recognizing sense in whatever combinations of words and ideas it
    produces.  THUNDER THOUGHT offers a variety of approaches for this
    creative process including images, topical idea chaining, and other
    innovative ways to expand your idea bank.
    
    VERSIFIER is a creativity-enhancement program for poets. The program
    combines words and phrases into several kinds of free verse and haiku,
    which you can then save and edit.  To get started, both THUNDER THOUGHT
    and VERSIFIER come with a vocabulary.  These lists can be modified or
    replaced to include your own words and thoughts.  The program puts ideas
    together in ways you might not have thought of consciously, yet they are
    still your own ideas, expressed in your own words.

                             IMPORTANT INFORMATION

   All our "Unusual Software" products are sold as shareware. This is a "try
before you buy" system; you may use the trial version of a program for a
limited period (usually 2 to 3 weeks) to evaluate it. If you like the pro-
gram, you are expected to register your use by paying the registration fee.
As a registered user, you receive the most advanced version of the program.
Trial versions of our programs are distributed by most shareware disk
vendors, who generally charge between $1 and $8 per disk. (This fee is for
the distribution service only; it is not paid to us, and is not part of the
registration fee.) You may also obtain the trial version of any of our pro-
ducts by sending a double-sided, double-density 5 1/4" diskette in a sturdy,
reusable mailer with sufficient return postage (enough postage for a 4-ounce,
first-class letter for the first 1 or 2 disks; an additional first class
stamp for each subsequent disk. Send 3 disks for Creativity Package). If you
don't want to bother with disks and postage, send $5 for the trial version of
1 disk, $7 for 2, $8 for 3, and $1 for each additional disk. The trial
version is a fully-functioning program, but in some cases may lack some of
the extra features of the registered version. If you don't like the program,
you are free to erase it, or pass it on to someone else to try. Otherwise,
you can send in the fee and get the registered version. Of course, you may
register a program without going through the trial version first. In a few
cases, there are no additional features in the registered version, but you
still must register if you like and use the program. Registered users receive
support by mail, a newsletter with upgrade notifications, as well as special
discount and bonus offers.
   We distribute a limited selection of shareware and public domain programs
from other authors. The fee paid to us for these "Bonus Disks" is for our
copying and distribution service. It is not paid to the authors and is not
part of the registration fee. See the Bonus Disk section for details.
   Note that some programs are "ARCed". This means that in order to fit
several large files on a single disk, a special archiving (compressing)
process has been used. The files must be un-arced before use. We provide the
un-arcing program.
   Before ordering software, read the description carefully, and pay special
attention to the system requirements. Some programs require a hard disk,
graphics capability, or additional memory. As far as we know, our software
will run on most "IBM compatible" personal computers. However, since equip-
ment configurations vary greatly, we cannot guarantee correct results for
everyone. If you have a problem, please let us know.

                                   HOW TO ORDER:

REGISTRATION is $6 for Penname, $10 for Cliche Finder or Curses, $19 for
Crystal Ball. Registration for M-LABEL is $10 if you are a registered user of
MAILLIST, $39 if you are not. WORKBASE registration is $49. All other
programs are $29 each. MAILLIST and THUNDER THOUGHT (part of Creativity
Package) registrations include source code. Source code is NOT provided for
other programs. CURSES! registration includes a free bonus disk.

Take $5 off your registration if you send a double-sided, double-density
5 1/4" diskette in a sturdy, reusable mailer with sufficient return postage.
(For POETRY GENERATOR, send 2 disks.) Postage should be the same amount
needed for a 4-ounce, first-class letter for the first 1 or 2 disks, and an
additional first-class stamp for each subsequent disk. This discount does NOT
apply to CREATIVITY PACKAGE, MAILLIST, or programs with registration fees
less than $20, and is not to be combined with other discounts. If you want
the discount, don't skimp on the stamps! The disk mailer you send is the one
we will return to you.

If you are already a registered user of one or more products from our
"Unusual Software" catalog (not Bonus Disks), take $5 off your registration
of any new program. (Discount does not apply TO MAILLIST, CREATIVITY PACKAGE,
or programs with registration under $18, and may not be combined with any
other discount offer.)

BONUS DISKS: $3 for each disk. Add a $3 shipping fee to your total order.
(Shipping fee applies only when Bonus Disks are ordered.) This is not
registration, just a copying fee. Registration should be paid to the authors
of the programs.

FOREIGN ORDERS: Countries other than Canada, please add $4 for special
postage and handling. Unfortunately, we are unable to handle foreign funds.
Payment must be in U.S. dollars, payable through a U.S. bank. Canadian postal
money orders in U.S. funds are also acceptable.

RUSH ORDERS: We usually fill orders within 2 working days of receipt. How
long it takes the mail to travel between you and us is out of our hands. If
you feel that you MUST have your order right away, you can add $10 for
overnight mail (U.S.A. only).

3 1/5" DISKS: We normally provide 5 1/4" disks. If you must have 3 1/5"
disks, please include an extra $1.00 per disk. Under no circumstances will we
ship unregistered versions on 3 1/5" disks.

NOTE: Some users have reported compatibility problems with the utility used
to un-arc large files (this is rare). If you prefer to receive un-arced
programs, please include an extra $3 per disk to cover special handling and
materials.

All prices and discounts listed in this bulletin expire 6/30/90. We reserve
the right to change product descriptions, system requirements and other
information without notice.                                BONUS DISKS

We are not the authors of these programs, nor are we associated with the
authors in any way other than as a distributor of the programs in accordance
with the authors' terms of distribution. Some of these programs require a
shareware registration fee from satisfied users. Our $3.00 fee per disk is a
payment for copying and distributing the disks; it is not the registration
fee. Please direct shareware registration payments and specific questions
about these programs to the authors whose names appear in the documentation.

Most of the files on these disks have been archived in order to fit more
files on a single disk. Archiving creates a file with the extension ARC. The
ARC file may contain several related files. To use these files, you must
un-arc them. An un-archiving utility is included on each disk for your
convenience.

These programs have been tested, but due to the many possible hardware and
software configurations, we cannot guarantee that any program will run on any
particular system. We do not warrant these programs in any way. If we provide
you with an unreadable disk, you may return it for a replacement copy of the
same disk. Read the file descriptions carefully; some of these programs have
special requirements.

The CREATIVITY PACKAGE is a three disk creativity and idea generator.   
Disk #1 contains Thomas A. Easton's complete book, "Think Thunder! And  
Unleash Your Creativity", a straightforward explanation of the nature of
creativity and how to develop it.  Disk #2 contains the program, THUNDER
THOUGHT, a proven tool for computer-aided brainstorming, developing and 
refining ideas, particularly in the fields of creative writing and      
inventing.  Disk #3 contains VERSIFIER, the amazing poetry writing      
program that works with the user's word selection to create fascinating 
free verse or haiku poetry. Considering that any one of these disks     
could be tremendously helpful in understanding and developing creative  
thinking, the effect of all three may be mind expanding!  Thomas        
Easton's book, "Think Thunder! And Unleash Your Creativity", is a clear,
usable, description of the creative process and how to encourage it.    
"Think Thunder!" can be read chapter by chapter on the computer screen  
or printed out.  The book can encourage creative thinking with or       
without the use of THUNDER THOUGHT.                                     
                                                                        
THUNDER THOUGHT works to facilitate the creative process by automating  
its initial stages.  With it, you don't need to worry about how to      
come up with novel combinations of words, images, or ideas.  THUNDER    
THOUGHT will do that for you, leaving you with the task of finding or   
recognizing sense in whatever combinations of words and ideas it        
produces.  THUNDER THOUGHT offers a variety of approaches for this      
creative process including images, topical idea chaining, and other     
innovative ways to expand your idea bank.                               
                                                                        
VERSIFIER is a creativity-enhancement program for poets. The program    
combines words and phrases into several kinds of free verse and haiku,  
which you can then save and edit.  To get started, both THUNDER THOUGHT 
and VERSIFIER come with a vocabulary.  These lists can be modified or

In some cases, when you try to run a program, you may see
an error message something like this:

Proc TAROT line 0, Open Error DESC3.NTX (4)

This is NOT caused by a bug in the program! If you see a
message with the words "open error" and the number 4, it
is DOS's cryptic way of telling you that you need to make
an adjustment in the CONFIG.SYS file in your root directory.

The CONFIG.SYS file should contain the following two lines:

     files=20
     buffers=20

(Some programs may require even larger numbers, which is
okay.)

If you aren't familiar with the CONFIG.SYS file, your DOS
manual should contain an explanation.
