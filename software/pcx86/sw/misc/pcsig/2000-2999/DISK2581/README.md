Special Requirements: 384K RAM and graphics card.                       
                                                                        
FIGMENT is a full development environment for adventure games or other  
type of interactive fiction.  Play roles in existing interactive        
fictions or write them yourself.  Figment does all the hard work of     
developing an interactive story so you can concentrate on the creative  
aspects.                                                                
                                                                        
You declare the objects, define the attributes, write the appropriate   
messages, and develop the games logic.  Programming is easy and quick   
with the full-screen editor and complete Help system.                   
                                                                        
One you've developed your games, you can use FIGMENT to play them and   
trade them with other FIGMENT users.  Also included is a run-time       
version of the program so that you can distribute your games to anyone. 
                                                                        
In addition to adventure games, FIGMENT can be used by writers to model 
plots, as a role-playing tool in business, and much more.  FIGMENT takes
the tedium out of fiction creation and lets you put the creativity in.
