Freemem.exe is a moveable, popup, free memory display for OS/2 1.XX.                    
                                                                                        
   - Freemem will keep itself on top of other windows so that it is always              
     visible.                                                                           
                                                                                        
   - With the left mouse button, click and drag Freemem to move it to the               
     desired location on your screen.  This position will be stored                     
     in the current OS2.INI for subsequent startups. (The default startup               
     position is the upper left corner of your screen.)                                 
                                                                                        
   - Add Freemem to your startup.cmd file.                                              
                                                                                        
   - As an OS/2 applications developer I have found freemem to be a                     
     useful tool for detecting memory managment problems within applications.           
     Since FREEMEM remains visible, tracking memory usage is simplified.                
                                                                                        
Non-mouse users.                                                                        
                                                                                        
    When Freemem has the input focus the following function keys work.                  
    (Alt+Tab to shift focus between windows, since Freemem has no caption               
    bar it is difficult to tell if it has the focus.  See the OS/2 Users Guide          
    for more information.)                                                              
                                                                                        
    F1   - Displays the about box, which contains configuration options.                
                                                                                        
    ALT+F7 - Allows you to move Freemem with the keyboard arrow keys.  Press            
                enter when done.                                                        
                                                                                        
    ALT+F4 - Closes Freemem.                                                            
                                                                                        
Mouse users.                                                                            
                                                                                        
    - Freemem can be moved with a click and drag motion of the left mouse               
      button.                                                                           
                                                                                        
    - The right mouse button clicked on Freemem will close it.

Invert Window.                                                                          
                                                                                        
    Normally Freemem displays free memory with black text on a white background.        
    Checking this option will cause free memory to be displayed with white text         
    on a black background.                                                              
                                                                                        
Beancount.                                                                              
                                                                                        
    Normally Freemem displays the size of the single largest block of memory.           
    This method is quite fast, so the display is updated every half second.             
    To display total memory available check the beancount option.   Freemem will        
    allocate memory blocks and total the sizes. Because nearly all of memory            
    is being allocated, OS/2 will discard and swap segments to disk.                    
                                                                                        
Beancount frequency.                                                                    
                                                                                        
    Enter how frequently you want beancounting to be performed.                         
                                                                                        
Minimum beancount allocation.                                                           
                                                                                        
    Freemem will allocate available segments this size or larger.   Typically,          
    the minimum size should be about 1024 bytes.  Attempting to allocate                
    smaller segments could cause OS/2 to discard or swap segments to disk,              
    resulting in poor performance.  If swapping is disabled, smaller sizes can          
    be used, such as 0, to get a more accurate reading of total physical memory         
    available.

    bar it is difficult to tell if it has the focus.  See the OS/2 Users Guide          
    for more information.)                                                              
                                                                                        
    F1   - Displays the about box, which contains configuration options.                
                                                                                        
    ALT+F7 - Allows you to move Freemem with the keyboard arrow keys.  Press            
                enter when done.

Invert Window.                                                                          
                                                                                        
    Normally Freemem displays free memory with black text on a white background.        
    Checking this option will cause free memory to be displayed with white text         
    on a black background.                                                              
                                                                                        
Beancount.                                                                              
                                                                                        
    Normally Freemem displays the size of the single largest block of memory.           
    This method is quite fast, so the display is updated every half second.             
    To display total memory available check the beancount option.   Freemem will        
    allocate memory blocks and total the sizes. Because nearly all of memory            
    is being allocated, OS/2 will discard and swap segments to disk.                    
                                                                                        
Beancount frequency.                                                                    
                                                                                        
    Enter how frequently you want beancounting to be performed.                         
                                                                                        
Minimum beancount allocation.                                                           
                                                                                        
    Freemem will allocate available segments this size or larger.   Typically,          
    the minimum size should be about 1024 bytes.  Attempting to allocate                
    smaller segments could cause OS/2 to discard or swap segments to disk,              
    resulting in poor performance.  If swapping is disabled, smaller sizes can          
    be used, such as 0, to get a more accurate reading of total physical memory         
    available.

Dear METZ Software User:

          ThreadZ Forms Alliance with METZ Software

ThreadZ Software Design Group, Inc., developers of utilities for
Microsoft Windows, and METZ Software, developers of shareware
utilities for Windows, have announced the formation of a special
alliance, the goal of which is to facilitate timely software
development and provide easy access to solution-oriented products.

The first result of this alliance is the incorporation of two
of METZ Software's shareware programs into a retail product called
ThreadZ File F/X.  ThreadZ File F/X is a group of four utilities
and a bonus of ThreadZ Task Manager, presented in an "a la carte"
manner so as to facilitate ease of use:

F/X File Manager, simplifies the create, delete, copy, rename and
move functions in Windows 3.0 using an intuitive tree directory display.

F/X File Find, a search program enabling users to locate files on
any attached hard drive, provides for the use of DOS wildcards,
specific file extensions, or even file creation dates as search
criteria.

F/X File Undelete provides a list of deleted files, states the
likelihood of a successful recovery, and, when prompted, will attempt
to undelete the chosen file.

F/X Text Search allows users to search a file, path name, directory
or an entire disk for a text string.  A list of matching files is
displayed and may be printed as a report.

The ThreadZ Task Manager, a distinctive replacement for Windows'
Task List, utilizes a menu which may be used to launch applications
and lets you arrange your windows the way that works best for you!

"A wonderful task manager and four other useful utilities makes this
a must-buy for Windows users."   PC Magazine, 1/29/91

ThreadZ File F/X retails for $129.95.  Through March 31, 1991,
however, registered users of METZ Software can order ThreadZ File F/X
for $49.95.  ThreadZ can be reached at 206-869-6292.

Visit ThreadZ at the Windows and OS/2 Conference in San Jose, CA,
March 5-7, 1991.  Also, see us at the Spring COMDEX Windows World in
Atlanta, GA, May 1991.

Sincerely,
Art Metz

The files contained on this disk are self extracting archive files.
By creating these files this way, we can provide more programs on
a diskette and you can un-archive them without any special tools.

  DLR.EXE - METZ Dialer
  DN.EXE  - METZ Desktop Navigator
  DT.EXE  - METZ Desktop Manager
  FM.EXE  - METZ Freemem
  LK.EXE  - METZ Lock
  MTM.EXE - METZ Task Manager
  PH.EXE  - METZ Phones
  RNR.EXE - METZ Runner
  TM.EXE  - METZ Time

Simply run the desired self extracting archive to extract it's contents.
For example, to extract the Phones files, copy PH.EXE to your disk then
type PH.  The contents of PH.EXE will be extracted.  PH.EXE does not
delete itself.
