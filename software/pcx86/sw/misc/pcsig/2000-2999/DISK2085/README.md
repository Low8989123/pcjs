## Information about "EXPRESSCHECK 2 OF 2 (ALSO DISK 1057)"

    EXPRESSCHECK has a simple goal: to help you manage your checking
    accounts. Without EXPRESSCHECK, you can either guess at where you spent
    all your money, or you can spend long hours with a calculator. With
    EXPRESSCHECK, you can find out in only a few seconds.
    
    How much do you spend each month on food, car payments, electricity,
    gas, and entertainment? How much have you given in tax-deductible
    donations? Every check and deposit can be recorded with various
    user-defined budget codes. This makes it possible for you to see at any
    time during the year where you stand in regard to your spending.
    
    Entering checks and deposits is fast and enjoyable. You can enter
    recurring payments with two keystrokes. The screens appear the same as
    real checks, deposit slips, and check registers, so you'll find the
    program extremely easy to learn and use. You can define budget codes on
    the fly, and windows show all currently-defined codes. EXPRESSCHECK
    even prints the checks for you on any kind of tractor-fed forms.
    
    You can print predefined reports that give you monthly or year-to-date
    totals for any or all budget codes, a check register with running
    balance, all transactions that have not yet cleared the bank, checks or
    deposits that included certain budget codes, or all checks made out to
    certain payees. Many of the figures that go on your tax return are at
    your finger tips.
