## Information about "MED#1 3 OF 3 (#2478, #2479 ALSO)"

    MED#1 is a new medical office management system that will increase
    efficiency in the daily administration of the business side of your
    medical practice.  It is designed with special features unavailable in
    other medical systems and is very 'user friendly'.  MED#1 is one of the
    easiest systems to use, especially if you are already acquainted with
    computer operations.  But even if you aren't, MED#1 will take you
    through operations with simple one-key functions that follow the logical
    progression of your normal routine.
    
    No special forms are required for printing.  All reports will be printed
    on 8 1/2" by 11" standard stock paper.  Custom statement forms, and the
    standard insurance HCFA-1500, are available through MEDshare, but the
    system will print without them.
    
    FEATURES OF MED#1:
    
    ~ Statements can be printed for all accounts with a balance due on your
    schedule.
    
    ~ Patient ledgers are automatically updated at time of transaction
    posting - no need to maintain a manual ledgers.
    
    ~ Superbill and/or Insurance claim form can be printed as patient checks
    out or any time needed.
    
    ~ Standard Insurance form HCFA-1500 can be printed automatically for
    insurance assignment with less mistakes, less manual re-input, saving
    time.
    
    ~ Instant access to account/patient ledger information to help collect
    at time of office visit.
    
    ~ Reporting to help you run your practice:
    
    A) Daily charges and receipts recap.
    B) Month-to-date summary recap.
    C) Aged accounts receivables.
    D) Statements.
    E) Recall letters.
    F) Special Recall selection that will help you keep in touch with your
    patients.
    G) Insurance claim forms.
    
    Now, more than ever, computerization is a part of every medical
    practice.  It's faster, more accurate and opens you up to the
    opportunities of future technical advances. So what are you waiting for,
    try MED#1, and launch your small medical practice into the next century.
