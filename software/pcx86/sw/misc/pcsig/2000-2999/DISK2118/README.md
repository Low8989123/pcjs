there are no funny embedded characters The files are Wordstar           
compatible, which means that you can load them into any wordprocessor   
that reads Wordstar files.  Apart from printer control strings, all     
formatting commands are by use of dot commands (. in column one) or     
embedded functions ({. }) in the text body.
