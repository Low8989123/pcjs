## Information about "WINDOWS UTILITIES"

    Want to bring some excitement, or at least variety, into the hours
    you spend staring through Windows?  This public domain program from
    Buttonware gives you a different background (.BMP) file each time
    Windows is started.
    
    SCREEN PEACE for Windows 3.0 not only blanks the monitor, but fills it
    with frills.  Instead of a blank screen, you'll see animated fish eat
    each other onscreen.  It contains 13 other graphic options, from the
    wavy lines to wobbling spheres.  Other users have written their own
    animated sequences using a C compiler.
    
    SCREEN PEACE lets users customize everything from the speed of the fish
    to the length of the delay before blanking.  It also allows immediate
    blanking by pushing the mouse arrow into a corner.  Another option tells
    Windows to boot up with fresh wallpaper each morning.
    
    With Whiskers you can assign keystrokes to the middle and right mouse
    buttons.  You could, for example, make the right button on the mouse be
    the DELETE key.  For use with Windows 3.0.
    
    Mark30 is a utility that marks old Windows applications so they will run
    under Windows 3.0 without the Windows 3.0 warning message.  This utility
    does no checking of the application being marked, except to verify that
    it is a Windows application.
    
    Many Windows 2.x application work fine under Windows 3.0, but many do
    not.  If you have a Windows 2.x application that works under Windows
    3.0, and you are tired of the annoying warning message Windows 3.0 gives
    you each time you run your program, Mark30 will save you that
    aggravation.

John Ridges' extension package for the "Screen Peace" screen saver.

Version 1.2


Contents:

AQUARIUM.SPX  -  Aquarium simulation.

EYES.SPX  -  Silly bouncing "eyecons" that watch each other.

FADE.SPX  -  A slow fade to black.

FIRE.SPX  -  Fireworks simulation.

FLASH.SPX  -  "Flashlight" spot that roams around the screen.

KLOK.SPX  -  Roaming analog clock.

PUZZLE.SPX  -  Moves the screen around like a tile puzzle.

SPHERES.SPX  -  Spheres of different colors and sizes that fill the screen.

SPACE.SPX  -  "Travelling through space" simulation.

WALL.SPX  -  Generates "wallpaper" on the screen.


Changes since version 1.1:

All screen savers are now compatible with Screen Peace version 1.2.
The PUZZLE screen saver has been added to the package.


Changes since version 1.0:

All screen savers have been made smaller (some to nearly half their
original size). Several have had minor cosmetic improvements. The CLOCK
screen saver has been renamed to KLOK to avoid conflicts with the clock
program that comes with Windows 3.0. PLEASE DELETE ANY OLD COPIES OF
"CLOCK.SPX" YOU MAY HAVE.


The screen savers are "FreeWare" and may be used without payment, but
if you want to contribute, send a few extra dollars to Anthony Andersen
(the author of Screen Peace) to give to charity.

There is no warranty either expressed or implied. Use the screen savers
at your own risk.


You can contact the author, John Ridges, at Compuserve 72000,2057.

     INTRODUCTION

        Mark30 is a Windows 3.0 utility that marks old Windows applications
        so that  they will run  under Windows  3.0 without the  Windows 3.0
        warning  message.  This utility does no checking of the application
        being marked, except to verify that it is a Windows application.

        There are  two flags  in the  header of a  Windows executable  file
        (called the  "new executable format").   The memory  flag indicates
        that the application makes clean use of memory, thus enabling it to
        run under Windows 3.0 in  protected mode.  The font flag  indicates
        whether  the application can handle the proportional system font in
        Windows  3.0.   Mark30 allows you  to set  and unset  both of these
        flags.

        Many  Windows 2.x application work fine under Windows 3.0, but many
        do not.   If you  have a Windows  2.x application that  works under
        Windows  3.0, and  you are  tired of  the annoying  warning message
        Windows 3.0 gives you each  time you run your program,  Mark30 will
        save you.

        IMPORTANT!  IMPORTANT!  IMPORTANT!

        Just  because  a  Windows  2.x application  APPEARS  to  work under
        Windows  3.0 don't assume it is completely compatible, there may be
        situations where the application will fail!!!!

        USE THIS  PROGRAM AT YOUR  OWN RISK!  Kindlco  Software Systems and
        Charles E. Kindel, Jr.  ARE NOT responsible for any  damages caused
        by the use of this program.

     USAGE

        To  use  Mark30,  simply   start  it  as  you  would   any  Windows
        application.   When it  starts up  you  are presented  with a  file
        selection list box, two check boxes, and several buttons.

        Select a file  either by typing a  name in the edit control,  or by
        clicking  on  a name  in  the  list  box.    You  may  also  change
        directories  and  drives   as  you  normally  would  in  a  Windows
        application.

        Once you  have a file selected, choose the flags you want set.  The
        font flag can only be set if the memory flag is set.

        Press the  "Mark File"  button to  mark  the application.   If  the
        application you choose is  not a Windows application a  message box
        will appear informing you of this.  If the application IS a Windows
        program a warning dialog box will appear asking you to confirm your
        choice.

        Once a file is marked, it can be "unmarked" by  reversing the check
        boxes.

        That's all there is to it!

     INTRODUCTION

        Mark30 is a Windows 3.0 utility that marks old Windows applications
        so that  they will run  under Windows  3.0 without the  Windows 3.0
        warning  message.  This utility does no checking of the application
        being marked, except to verify that it is a Windows application.

        There are  two flags  in the  header of a  Windows executable  file
        (called the  "new executable format").   The memory  flag indicates
        that the application makes clean use of memory, thus enabling it to
        run under Windows 3.0 in  protected mode.  The font flag  indicates
        whether  the application can handle the proportional system font in
        Windows  3.0.   Mark30 allows you  to set  and unset  both of these
        flags.

        Many  Windows 2.x application work fine under Windows 3.0, but many
        do not.   If you  have a Windows  2.x application that  works under
        Windows  3.0, and  you are  tired of  the annoying  warning message
        Windows 3.0 gives you each  time you run your program,  Mark30 will
        save you.

        IMPORTANT!  IMPORTANT!  IMPORTANT!

        Just  because  a  Windows  2.x application  APPEARS  to  work under
        Windows  3.0 don't assume it is completely compatible, there may be
        situations where the application will fail!!!!

        USE THIS  PROGRAM AT YOUR  OWN RISK!  Kindlco  Software Systems and
        Charles E. Kindel, Jr.  ARE NOT responsible for any  damages caused
        by the use of this program.

     USAGE

        To  use  Mark30,  simply   start  it  as  you  would   any  Windows
        application.   When it  starts up  you  are presented  with a  file
        selection list box, two check boxes, and several buttons.

        Select a file  either by typing a  name in the edit control,  or by
        clicking  on  a name  in  the  list  box.    You  may  also  change
        directories  and  drives   as  you  normally  would  in  a  Windows
        application.

        Once you  have a file selected, choose the flags you want set.  The
        font flag can only be set if the memory flag is set.

        Press the  "Mark File"  button to  mark  the application.   If  the
        application you choose is  not a Windows application a  message box
        will appear informing you of this.  If the application IS a Windows
        program a warning dialog box will appear asking you to confirm your
        choice.

        Once a file is marked, it can be "unmarked" by  reversing the check
        boxes.

        That's all there is to it!

VERSION HISTORY:

    Version 1.0  created 7/28/90
        The original
    Version 1.1  created 7/30/90
        Makes automatic choice of tiled or un-tiled wallpaper
    Version 1.1b created 8/30/90
        No changes. Decided to make the source code available.


IT'S TOTALLY FREE

    Here's a new program from Jim Button. It's the best kind. It's free! No
    obligation, and no strings attached!  I donate it to the public domain.
    I hope you like it. It sure is useful.


WHAT IT DOES

    It changes your desktop wallpaper for you each time you run windows.
    So, you can have several wallpaper files in your windows subdirectory.
    Each time you run windows, a different wallpaper will be selected.


REQUIREMENTS

    NEWPAPER requires Windows 3.0 or later and one or more BMP files
    (to use as wallpaper) in your Windows subdirectory.


HOW TO INSTALL IT

    First, copy the program NEWPAPER.EXE into your Windows subdirectory.

    Then use a text editor to change the WIN.INI file in your Windows
    subdirectory. (Make sure that your WIN.INI file gets saved back in
    ASCII format when you're finished.)

    Inside your WIN.INI file, you should find a line that looks like this:

       [windows]

    Somewhere in the next few lines that follow the [windows] section, you
    should find a line that starts out like this:

       load=

    There may be some file names following the load= text, for example

       load=eyes.exe

    If you don't find a load= line, add one.
    Add the statement NEWPAPER.EXE to the load= line.
    Here are some sample load= lines...

       load=newpaper.exe
       load=eyes.exe blanker.exe newpaper.exe

    Notice that you must have a space between each program listed on
    the load= line.


HOW TO USE IT

    This is the easy part. After you've installed NEWPAPER.EXE, just
    run windows. There's nothing else to do. Every time you run
    windows, you should get a different desktop wallpaper.

    You can fill your windows subdirectory with as many bitmap files as
    you like. (These are file names that end with the suffix ".BMP").

    NOTE: NEWPAPER doesn't actually change the wallpaper you are
    looking at. It lets Windows do that.  So, if you run NEWPAPER from
    your desktop, you will not see a change in your wallpaper.  The
    wallpaper will not get changed until the next time Windows starts
    up.


HOW IT WORKS

    NEWPAPER changes your WIN.INI file each time it runs. There is a
    line inside of WIN.INI that says "Wallpaper=", followed by the name of
    a bitmap file. NEWPAPER just looks at all the bitmap files in your
    windows subdirectory, and changes the "Wallpaper=" line to point to a
    new bitmap file. Which new bitmap file? The next one in your windows
    subdirectory. After it gets to the last one, it will start again at the
    top.

    This version (1.1) of NEWPAPER also makes a decision about whether
    to put your wallpaper up "tiled" or un-tiled.  To do this, it looks
    at the size of the BMP file.  If the BMP file is less than 100K, it
    uses tiled wallpaper. Otherwise it uses un-tiled wallpaper.

    The program only runs for a brief instant when Windows starts up. Then
    it goes away.  So it doesn't waste any memory or CPU cycles after it
    has done its work.



CAUTION

    You use this program at your own risk.  While I have tested it, I
    have not tested it formally (with a team of beta testers, etc.).
    I've tested it extensively myself. I hope it works for everyone else!
    Note (30 August 1990): there are now several thousand known users
    of NEWPAPER. No problems have yet been reported.


ADDENDUM

    Yes, I co-invented the Shareware concept.  But simple, easy to create
    utility programs like this should be donated to the public domain.
    After all, it only took me two hours to create this little gem. And
    it wasn't two hours of lost time... I learned more about Windows
    programming in the process.  So please enjoy!

    Isn't Windows fun?  Suddenly, computing in the DOS world is exciting
    again!

                  Documentation for Screen Peace 1.2
                         by Anthony Andersen
                       Compuserve [72037,2474]

                      Program and documentation
                    Copyright 1990 Anthony Andersen
                        

[1.0 Introduction]

   Screen Peace is a screen saver for Microsoft Windows 3.0. "So what?", you
   say, "I've seen lots of screen savers for Windows." Well... this one is 
   different. Screen Peace by itself is not terribly flashy - it just
   blanks the screen after a certain number of seconds, but it is extensible.
   You can add additional screen savers just by putting more screen saver
   files in the proper directory. If you have the Windows 3.0 SDK, the
   Microsoft C 6.0 compiler and the Screen Peace saver kit, you can make your
   own screen savers.

   Screen Peace screen savers are invoked in two ways: 
      1. if you don't a) move the mouse or b) click a mouse button or 
         c) hit a key during a period of time longer than the Saver Delay
         time (default is 300 seconds).
      2. if you move the mouse into the Saver Now Corner (default is the
         upper left corner).

   See the configuration options (Section 4) for information on changing
   these values.

   Screen Peace picks a saver extension randomly from the saver extensions
   in the Saver Path directory.

   Screen Peace 1.2 may be freely distributed with the following three
   conditions:
      1. This file be distributed along with the SAVER.EXE and SAVERDLL.DLL
         files.
      2. No money may be charged for the Screen Peace program.
      3. No more than $7 may be charged for the media it is shipped on.

   Screen Peace is CharityWare. Please see the note near the end of this
   file about payment (don't worry, it's a VERY easy payment plan and you
   can feel good about paying for this program). If you paid money to someone
   other than me for a disk containing Screen Peace, you have NOT paid for
   Screen Peace, but for the disk it came on.

[1.1 Screen Peace 1.1 additions]

   Screen Peace 1.1 will change the Wallpaper bitmap if you specify that it
   should. It randomly picks a bitmap from the directory you specify as the
   Bitmap Directory.

   Screen Peace 1.1 shows you which screen saver extensions are enabled. If
   an extension is enabled, you will see a small circle ("degrees" mark - as
   in temperature or portions of an angle) after the name of the saver in the
   "Configure" list box in the Options dialog.

[1.2 Screen Peace 1.2 additions]

   Lots of bugs fixed!
      1. Saver Now and Saver Never corners should now work properly in
         all cases.
      2. The problem with non-readable disks is fixed (if this happened to
         you, you probably clicked on a floppy drive icon in the program
         manager when there was no disk in the drive). This was a bad
         bug and I apologize for releasing Screen Peace with it there. I
         hope it didn't cause any major problems. The cause, in case you're
         interested was a call to the C library time() function in a bad
         place. Anyway, the DLL is about half its previous size.
      3. The cursor not blanking (which only happened on certain video
         boards) should be fixed. Let me know if you have any more problems
         with this.

   Screen Peace now recognizes Windowed DOS boxes in 386 Enhanced mode and
   allows you to choose not to blank the screen when one of the DOS boxes
   is the active window. See the Advanced options in Section 4.2 below.

   Screen Peace now realizes a color table if you have a graphics adapter
   with a 256 color driver. This should help several of the savers look 
   better. In case you're interested, it realizes a table similar to the
   Macintosh default color table for 256 color mode. This option can be
   disabled. See the Advanced options Section in 4.2 below.

   The Saver Now and Saver Never corners are now 5x5 pixels instead of
   a single pixel.

   Screen Peace now supports up to 80 saver extensions. (It also supported
   this number in 1.1 but I neglected to mention it.)

   The Options dialog has changed its "look". If you have any suggestions
   regarding the aesthetics of Screen Peace, please let me know.

   Even if you were using a previous version of Screen Peace, please read
   this whole document as several things about Screen Peace have changed.

[2.0 What you need to run Screen Peace]

   1. Microsoft Windows 3.0.
   2. Screen Peace. (you need both SAVER.EXE and SAVERDLL.DLL)
   3. Screen Peace saver extensions. (OPTIONAL - They have a .SPX extension)

[3.0 How to run and/or install Screen Peace]

   NOTE: All directions below assume that you have a mouse or other pointing
         device. If this is not so, see your Windows manual for the
         appropiate keyboard equivalents.

   3.0.0 If you already know how to run Windows applications you can 
      probably skip to the next section.

   3.1 Copy SAVER.EXE and SAVERDLL.DLL into your Windows directory
      or another directory on your path. If you don't want to put
      Screen Peace on your path, you will need to include the path
      to SAVER.EXE in each of the following directions. I recommend
      putting Screen Peace in your Windows directory if you are new
      to Windows, it's the easiest way to get things running.

   3.2 Do one of the following:

        A. (Not a very good choice) Select Run from the Program Manager File
           menu, type SAVER.EXE in the edit field, and click the OK button.
           If you choose this method, you must repeat this every time you
           want to run Screen Peace.

        B. (A better choice) Click on one of the program groups in the
           Program Manager and Select New from the Program Manager File
           menu. Make sure the Program Item radio button is checked and
           click the OK button. Type anything in the description edit field
           and type SAVER.EXE in the Command Line edit field. Then click 
           the OK button. Now to run Screen Peace, you only need to double 
           click the Screen Peace icon.

        C. (An even better choice) Insert SAVER.EXE in your WIN.INI file on
           either the "load=" or the "run=" line.

           example:
               load=SAVER.EXE 
                        or
               run=SAVER.EXE

           Just make sure to separate the file names on the line by a space.
           This will load Screen Peace each time you run Windows. By the 
           way, SYSEDIT.EXE is a good program to use for editing the Windows
           system files.

           NOTE: This procedure alone will not run Screen Peace until
                 you restart Windows.

        D. (The best choice) Do BOTH B. and C.

   3.3 Copy any screen saver extensions you may have into a directory named
      C:\SAVER. If you don't want to use the name C:\SAVER, you can change
      the name (referred to as the Saver Path). See the Configuration
      instructions below.

[4.0 How to Configure Screen Peace]

   4.1 Edit the WIN.INI file - This is the most difficult way to configure
      Screen Peace. I recommend using the Menu and Dialog method described
      in Section 4.2. Screen Peace knows about the following entries in the
      WIN.INI file. Find or create something that looks like this:

          [Screen Peace]
          Saver Now Pos=A
          Saver Never Pos=D
          Saver Delay=300
          Saver Path=C:\SAVER
          Saver Enabled=y
          Bmp Change Enab=n
          Bitmap Path=\windows
          Dos Active Disab=n
          Realize Colors=y

      Each of the values in the above example is set to the default value.

      The "Saver Now Pos" entry tells where the Saver Now Corner is located.
      The "Saver Never Pos" entry tells where the Saver Never Corner is
      located. For these entries:

          A = Upper Left
          B = Upper Right
          C = Lower Left
          D = Lower Right

      The "Saver Delay" entry is the number of seconds the mouse and keyboard
      must be idle before a screen saver is started.

      The "Saver Path" entry is the path to the screen saver extension files.

      The "Saver Enabled" entry tells whether Screen Peace is enabled. 'y'
      means Screen Peace is enabled and anything else means Screen Peace is
      disabled.

      The "Bmp Change Enab" entry tells whether Screen Peace should change
      the Wallpaper Bitmap. 'y' means Screen Peace should randomly pick a
      bitmap file from the directory specified in the "Bitmap Path" entry.
      Anything else means Screen Peace should not mess with the Wallpaper
      value in the WIN.INI file.

      The "Bitmap Path" entry tells Screen Peace where to look for bitmap
      (.BMP) files when changing the wallpaper bitmap.

      The "Dos Active Disab" entry tells Screen Peace where it should stop
      blanking the screen if a DOS box is the active window. A 'y' means
      don't ever blank the screen if a DOS box is active and anything else
      means blank the screen normally.

      The "Realize Colors" entry is only applicable to those who have 256
      color video drivers. A 'y' means realize a set of 256 colors for the
      saver programs to use and anything else means use the default 16 
      colors. If you don't have a 256 color video driver, you should ignore
      this field.

      If you have screen saver extensions, there may be other fields. For my
      own savers, there will be at least one entry similar to:

          Sticks On=y

      where 'y' means the saver is enabled and 'n' means the saver will never
      be used.

      NOTES: changes made in the WIN.INI file will not take effect until
             you restart Windows.

   4.2 The Menu and Dialog Way - Click on the Screen Peace icon. You will
      get a menu with the following items:

        Move
        Close
        Switch To...
        Corners
        Options...
        Advanced...
        About...

      The Move item is used to move the Screen Peace icon. See the Windows
      documentation for more information.

      The Close item is used to quit Screen Peace. See the Windows
      documentation for more information.

      The Switch To... item is used to switch to another application. See the
      Windows documentation for more information.

      The Corners item is used to choose the Saver Now Corner and the Saver
          Never Corner. When the mouse pointer is in the Saver Now corner,
          Screen Peace invokes a screen saver after a one to two second
          delay. When the mouse pointer is in the Saver Never corner, Screen
          Peace never invokes a screen saver.

      The Options... item is used to set the Saver Delay Time, set the Saver
          Path, and configure screen savers individually. The following 
          describes the Options dialog box.

          Below the copyright line is a check box marked "Saver Enabled". If
          the box is checked (X'ed), Screen Peace is enabled. Otherwise it
          will not function. By default, Screen Peace is enabled.

          Below the check box is an edit field marked "Delay in Seconds".
          Type the number of seconds you want Screen Peace to wait for a
          mouse or key message before blanking the screen. By default, Screen
          Peace waits 300 seconds.
          
          Below the first edit field is another edit field marked "Saver
          Path". Type the name of the directory you want Screen Peace to 
          search for screen saver extensions in this field. By default,
          Screen Peace searches a directory called C:\SAVER.

          Below the second edit is a list box marked Configure. This 
          contains the names of all the screen savers Screen Peace could
          find. Double click on the name of a screen saver and you can 
          set its configuration.

          Below the list box is a check box marked "Bitmap Changer Enabled".
          If the box is checked, the bitmap changer is enabled. By default,
          the bitmap changer is disabled.

          Below the second check box is an edit field marked "Bitmap Path".
          Type the name of the directory you want Screen Peace to search for
          bitmap files in this field. By default, Screen Peace searches the
          \WINDOWS directory.

      The Advanced... item is used to set advanced options.

          If you check the "Active DOS box disables Screen Peace" box, Screen
          Peace will not activate when a Windowed DOS box is the active
          window. The default state of this check box is disabled. You can
          invoke a saver by moving the mouse pointer to the Saver Now corner
          in any case. This should only be needed by people running Windows
          in the 386 Enhanced mode.

          (If you do not have a 256 color graphics adapter, the "Realize
          color table" section will not affect you.) If you check the
          "Realize color table" box, and you have a video driver which
          supports 256 colors (SuperVGA, 8514a, etc.), a 256 color table will
          be realized for the saver window. Currently, some of the extensions
          recognize the additional colors and some do not. In particular,
          Sticks, Blocks, and Kaleidoscope need the realized color table or
          many of the colors they choose will be black. The default state of
          this check box is enabled. For those of you working on your own
          savers, please get a copy of the updated Screen Peace developers
          kit.

      The About... item is used to get information about the programmer.

[5.0 How to preview screen savers]

   1. Select Options... from the system menu.
   2. Hilight the name of the saver you want to preview in the list box.
   3. Move the mouse into the Saver Now Corner or wait for Screen Peace
      to time out.

   After the previous three steps, the saver you have hilighted will be
   started. Sorry, but there is no way to do this without a mouse except
   to wait for the saver to time out.

[6.0 How to get in touch with me]

   1. Write to:

       Anthony Andersen
       1211 S. Quebec Wy #3-108
       Denver, CO  80231

   2. Send Compuserve mail to:

       [72037,2474]

   3. Send mail on a BBS to:

       User # /496 - Magnum BBS     (805)582-9306
       User # /74  - OS/2 Mag BBS   (805)684-0589

[7.0 How to create screen saver extensions]

   Get the file SPEXTN.ZIP from the MSWIN forum on Compuserve or send me
   $5 and I'll send you a disk (please specify format). The zip will include
   the info you need and at least one example saver (STICKS). You must have
   the Windows 3.0 SDK and Microsoft C 6.0 to write saver extensions.

[8.0 How to pay for Screen Peace]

   Screen Peace is CharityWare. A donation of whatever you think appropriate
   (I think $5 or $10 is what the others are charging) can be sent to the
   above address to make your copy of Screen Peace legal.

   ALL PROFITS (UNLESS SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED OTHERWISE) WILL GO TO SUPPORT
   GREEN PEACE, IN MY OPINION A VERY WORTHY CAUSE.

   If you don't wish to support Green Peace, specify which other charitable
   organization you wish your contribution to go to (an address would help).
   If you wish to make the contribution yourself, go ahead but PLEASE send
   me a letter or message telling me about it. I would really appreciate it.

   I hate to do this, but supporting Screen Peace has already been very 
   expensive so I am asking for a VOLUNTARY contribution of $2 to help
   pay my Compuserve bill (I've spent about 10 hours on Compuserve in the
   last five days). If you do not wish to make this contribution, please do
   not feel obligated to do so, but I will have to stop logging on to CIS
   every day and answering every message unless I can find a way to defray
   some of the expense. Any excess money collected WILL go to support Green
   Peace. Please make a note with your payment if you wish to contribute to
   the "Anthony Andersen Screen Peace Support CIS Fund" (or AASPSCISF).

[9.0 Other notes]

   9.1 If you want additional screen savers, I (and hopefully others) will be 
   uploading them to the MSWIN forum on Compuserve. If you want them on disk,
   send me $5 and I'll ship you a disk (please specify format) of no less
   than 10 savers. I would appreciate a copy of any savers you write.

   9.2 Many thanks go to John Ridges (author of the DESKPIC screen saver for
   OS/2 and a really great guy) for the FLEX screen saver and to Keith Agee 
   (another really great guy) for the KALEIDOSCOPE and BLOCKS screen savers.
   Thanks also to both of them for help with testing Screen Peace.

   9.3 Updates will be posted on Compuserve. If you want to be sure to get 
   updates, send an extra $5 and your disk format and I will mail you a copy
   of the next version with as many savers as I can fit on the disk.

   9.4 About BITMAP.SPX. If you put a Windows 3.0 device independent bitmap
   file or an OS/2 1.x bitmap file (.BMP) in your screen savers directory and
   name it BITMAP.BMP, BITMAP.SPX will use that bitmap instead of the normal
   Screen Peace bitmap.

   9.5 Password protection may be added to Screen Peace. I personally don't
   like it, but if I get enough requests for it, I will try to add it (it is
   kind of a nasty problem given the screen saver extension interface). So
   far, I've only had one request from several hundred messages.

   9.5 In certain cases, not all the savers you have in your directory will
   show up in the "Configure..." listbox in the Options dialog. This happens
   when you are running a Windows application with the same root name as one
   of the screen savers (example: when CLOCK.EXE is running, CLOCK.SPX will
   not show up in the list box). This is a problem with Windows not being
   able to load both an EXE and a DLL with the same root name. 

   9.5.1 It is also possible that you could start an EXE with the Options
   dialog box up. In this case, any saver with the same root filename whose
   name is in the list box will not function and the default screen saver
   (just blanks the screen) will run instead. This only happens in saver
   preview cases (see Section 7.0 above).

   9.6 Please note that if you choose the "Active DOS box disables Screen
   Peace" Advanced Option, Screen Peace will be disabled ANY time a DOS box
   is active INCLUDING when the DOS box is iconized. Moving the mouse pointer
   into the Saver Now Corner overrides this limitation.

   9.7 Due to an incredible number of messages I have to ask the following:
   Please look for information on Screen Peace in the message section
   of the MSWIN forum on Compuserve before sending me mail about any problems.
   If you're having a problem, it is likely that someone else has had the
   same problem and the answer is on the board. This will save me time and
   allow me to get busy writing LOTS of extensions for Screen Peace. Do not
   feel that I don't want to hear from you! If you have any comments or
   suggestions or problems (I hope the problems are about all solved), I
   would love to hear from you. I will be posting messages describing updates
   and problem workarounds under the topic "Screen Peace".

   9.8 Many thanks are due to Morrie Wilson for help in correcting the bugs
   in previous versions.

                  Documentation for Screen Peace 1.2
                         by Anthony Andersen
                       Compuserve [72037,2474]

                      Program and documentation
                    Copyright 1990 Anthony Andersen
                        

[1.0 Introduction]

   Screen Peace is a screen saver for Microsoft Windows 3.0. "So what?", you
   say, "I've seen lots of screen savers for Windows." Well... this one is 
   different. Screen Peace by itself is not terribly flashy - it just
   blanks the screen after a certain number of seconds, but it is extensible.
   You can add additional screen savers just by putting more screen saver
   files in the proper directory. If you have the Windows 3.0 SDK, the
   Microsoft C 6.0 compiler and the Screen Peace saver kit, you can make your
   own screen savers.

   Screen Peace screen savers are invoked in two ways: 
      1. if you don't a) move the mouse or b) click a mouse button or 
         c) hit a key during a period of time longer than the Saver Delay
         time (default is 300 seconds).
      2. if you move the mouse into the Saver Now Corner (default is the
         upper left corner).

   See the configuration options (Section 4) for information on changing
   these values.

   Screen Peace picks a saver extension randomly from the saver extensions
   in the Saver Path directory.

   Screen Peace 1.2 may be freely distributed with the following three
   conditions:
      1. This file be distributed along with the SAVER.EXE and SAVERDLL.DLL
         files.
      2. No money may be charged for the Screen Peace program.
      3. No more than $7 may be charged for the media it is shipped on.

   Screen Peace is CharityWare. Please see the note near the end of this
   file about payment (don't worry, it's a VERY easy payment plan and you
   can feel good about paying for this program). If you paid money to someone
   other than me for a disk containing Screen Peace, you have NOT paid for
   Screen Peace, but for the disk it came on.

[1.1 Screen Peace 1.1 additions]

   Screen Peace 1.1 will change the Wallpaper bitmap if you specify that it
   should. It randomly picks a bitmap from the directory you specify as the
   Bitmap Directory.

   Screen Peace 1.1 shows you which screen saver extensions are enabled. If
   an extension is enabled, you will see a small circle ("degrees" mark - as
   in temperature or portions of an angle) after the name of the saver in the
   "Configure" list box in the Options dialog.

[1.2 Screen Peace 1.2 additions]

   Lots of bugs fixed!
      1. Saver Now and Saver Never corners should now work properly in
         all cases.
      2. The problem with non-readable disks is fixed (if this happened to
         you, you probably clicked on a floppy drive icon in the program
         manager when there was no disk in the drive). This was a bad
         bug and I apologize for releasing Screen Peace with it there. I
         hope it didn't cause any major problems. The cause, in case you're
         interested was a call to the C library time() function in a bad
         place. Anyway, the DLL is about half its previous size.
      3. The cursor not blanking (which only happened on certain video
         boards) should be fixed. Let me know if you have any more problems
         with this.

   Screen Peace now recognizes Windowed DOS boxes in 386 Enhanced mode and
   allows you to choose not to blank the screen when one of the DOS boxes
   is the active window. See the Advanced options in Section 4.2 below.

   Screen Peace now realizes a color table if you have a graphics adapter
   with a 256 color driver. This should help several of the savers look 
   better. In case you're interested, it realizes a table similar to the
   Macintosh default color table for 256 color mode. This option can be
   disabled. See the Advanced options Section in 4.2 below.

   The Saver Now and Saver Never corners are now 5x5 pixels instead of
   a single pixel.

   Screen Peace now supports up to 80 saver extensions. (It also supported
   this number in 1.1 but I neglected to mention it.)

   The Options dialog has changed its "look". If you have any suggestions
   regarding the aesthetics of Screen Peace, please let me know.

   Even if you were using a previous version of Screen Peace, please read
   this whole document as several things about Screen Peace have changed.

[2.0 What you need to run Screen Peace]

   1. Microsoft Windows 3.0.
   2. Screen Peace. (you need both SAVER.EXE and SAVERDLL.DLL)
   3. Screen Peace saver extensions. (OPTIONAL - They have a .SPX extension)

[3.0 How to run and/or install Screen Peace]

   NOTE: All directions below assume that you have a mouse or other pointing
         device. If this is not so, see your Windows manual for the
         appropiate keyboard equivalents.

   3.0.0 If you already know how to run Windows applications you can 
      probably skip to the next section.

   3.1 Copy SAVER.EXE and SAVERDLL.DLL into your Windows directory
      or another directory on your path. If you don't want to put
      Screen Peace on your path, you will need to include the path
      to SAVER.EXE in each of the following directions. I recommend
      putting Screen Peace in your Windows directory if you are new
      to Windows, it's the easiest way to get things running.

   3.2 Do one of the following:

        A. (Not a very good choice) Select Run from the Program Manager File
           menu, type SAVER.EXE in the edit field, and click the OK button.
           If you choose this method, you must repeat this every time you
           want to run Screen Peace.

        B. (A better choice) Click on one of the program groups in the
           Program Manager and Select New from the Program Manager File
           menu. Make sure the Program Item radio button is checked and
           click the OK button. Type anything in the description edit field
           and type SAVER.EXE in the Command Line edit field. Then click 
           the OK button. Now to run Screen Peace, you only need to double 
           click the Screen Peace icon.

        C. (An even better choice) Insert SAVER.EXE in your WIN.INI file on
           either the "load=" or the "run=" line.

           example:
               load=SAVER.EXE 
                        or
               run=SAVER.EXE

           Just make sure to separate the file names on the line by a space.
           This will load Screen Peace each time you run Windows. By the 
           way, SYSEDIT.EXE is a good program to use for editing the Windows
           system files.

           NOTE: This procedure alone will not run Screen Peace until
                 you restart Windows.

        D. (The best choice) Do BOTH B. and C.

   3.3 Copy any screen saver extensions you may have into a directory named
      C:\SAVER. If you don't want to use the name C:\SAVER, you can change
      the name (referred to as the Saver Path). See the Configuration
      instructions below.

[4.0 How to Configure Screen Peace]

   4.1 Edit the WIN.INI file - This is the most difficult way to configure
      Screen Peace. I recommend using the Menu and Dialog method described
      in Section 4.2. Screen Peace knows about the following entries in the
      WIN.INI file. Find or create something that looks like this:

          [Screen Peace]
          Saver Now Pos=A
          Saver Never Pos=D
          Saver Delay=300
          Saver Path=C:\SAVER
          Saver Enabled=y
          Bmp Change Enab=n
          Bitmap Path=\windows
          Dos Active Disab=n
          Realize Colors=y

      Each of the values in the above example is set to the default value.

      The "Saver Now Pos" entry tells where the Saver Now Corner is located.
      The "Saver Never Pos" entry tells where the Saver Never Corner is
      located. For these entries:

          A = Upper Left
          B = Upper Right
          C = Lower Left
          D = Lower Right

      The "Saver Delay" entry is the number of seconds the mouse and keyboard
      must be idle before a screen saver is started.

      The "Saver Path" entry is the path to the screen saver extension files.

      The "Saver Enabled" entry tells whether Screen Peace is enabled. 'y'
      means Screen Peace is enabled and anything else means Screen Peace is
      disabled.

      The "Bmp Change Enab" entry tells whether Screen Peace should change
      the Wallpaper Bitmap. 'y' means Screen Peace should randomly pick a
      bitmap file from the directory specified in the "Bitmap Path" entry.
      Anything else means Screen Peace should not mess with the Wallpaper
      value in the WIN.INI file.

      The "Bitmap Path" entry tells Screen Peace where to look for bitmap
      (.BMP) files when changing the wallpaper bitmap.

      The "Dos Active Disab" entry tells Screen Peace where it should stop
      blanking the screen if a DOS box is the active window. A 'y' means
      don't ever blank the screen if a DOS box is active and anything else
      means blank the screen normally.

      The "Realize Colors" entry is only applicable to those who have 256
      color video drivers. A 'y' means realize a set of 256 colors for the
      saver programs to use and anything else means use the default 16 
      colors. If you don't have a 256 color video driver, you should ignore
      this field.

      If you have screen saver extensions, there may be other fields. For my
      own savers, there will be at least one entry similar to:

          Sticks On=y

      where 'y' means the saver is enabled and 'n' means the saver will never
      be used.

      NOTES: changes made in the WIN.INI file will not take effect until
             you restart Windows.

   4.2 The Menu and Dialog Way - Click on the Screen Peace icon. You will
      get a menu with the following items:

        Move
        Close
        Switch To...
        Corners
        Options...
        Advanced...
        About...

      The Move item is used to move the Screen Peace icon. See the Windows
      documentation for more information.

      The Close item is used to quit Screen Peace. See the Windows
      documentation for more information.

      The Switch To... item is used to switch to another application. See the
      Windows documentation for more information.

      The Corners item is used to choose the Saver Now Corner and the Saver
          Never Corner. When the mouse pointer is in the Saver Now corner,
          Screen Peace invokes a screen saver after a one to two second
          delay. When the mouse pointer is in the Saver Never corner, Screen
          Peace never invokes a screen saver.

      The Options... item is used to set the Saver Delay Time, set the Saver
          Path, and configure screen savers individually. The following 
          describes the Options dialog box.

          Below the copyright line is a check box marked "Saver Enabled". If
          the box is checked (X'ed), Screen Peace is enabled. Otherwise it
          will not function. By default, Screen Peace is enabled.

          Below the check box is an edit field marked "Delay in Seconds".
          Type the number of seconds you want Screen Peace to wait for a
          mouse or key message before blanking the screen. By default, Screen
          Peace waits 300 seconds.
          
          Below the first edit field is another edit field marked "Saver
          Path". Type the name of the directory you want Screen Peace to 
          search for screen saver extensions in this field. By default,
          Screen Peace searches a directory called C:\SAVER.

          Below the second edit is a list box marked Configure. This 
          contains the names of all the screen savers Screen Peace could
          find. Double click on the name of a screen saver and you can 
          set its configuration.

          Below the list box is a check box marked "Bitmap Changer Enabled".
          If the box is checked, the bitmap changer is enabled. By default,
          the bitmap changer is disabled.

          Below the second check box is an edit field marked "Bitmap Path".
          Type the name of the directory you want Screen Peace to search for
          bitmap files in this field. By default, Screen Peace searches the
          \WINDOWS directory.

      The Advanced... item is used to set advanced options.

          If you check the "Active DOS box disables Screen Peace" box, Screen
          Peace will not activate when a Windowed DOS box is the active
          window. The default state of this check box is disabled. You can
          invoke a saver by moving the mouse pointer to the Saver Now corner
          in any case. This should only be needed by people running Windows
          in the 386 Enhanced mode.

          (If you do not have a 256 color graphics adapter, the "Realize
          color table" section will not affect you.) If you check the
          "Realize color table" box, and you have a video driver which
          supports 256 colors (SuperVGA, 8514a, etc.), a 256 color table will
          be realized for the saver window. Currently, some of the extensions
          recognize the additional colors and some do not. In particular,
          Sticks, Blocks, and Kaleidoscope need the realized color table or
          many of the colors they choose will be black. The default state of
          this check box is enabled. For those of you working on your own
          savers, please get a copy of the updated Screen Peace developers
          kit.

      The About... item is used to get information about the programmer.

[5.0 How to preview screen savers]

   1. Select Options... from the system menu.
   2. Hilight the name of the saver you want to preview in the list box.
   3. Move the mouse into the Saver Now Corner or wait for Screen Peace
      to time out.

   After the previous three steps, the saver you have hilighted will be
   started. Sorry, but there is no way to do this without a mouse except
   to wait for the saver to time out.

[6.0 How to get in touch with me]

   1. Write to:

       Anthony Andersen
       1211 S. Quebec Wy #3-108
       Denver, CO  80231

   2. Send Compuserve mail to:

       [72037,2474]

   3. Send mail on a BBS to:

       User # /496 - Magnum BBS     (805)582-9306
       User # /74  - OS/2 Mag BBS   (805)684-0589

[7.0 How to create screen saver extensions]

   Get the file SPEXTN.ZIP from the MSWIN forum on Compuserve or send me
   $5 and I'll send you a disk (please specify format). The zip will include
   the info you need and at least one example saver (STICKS). You must have
   the Windows 3.0 SDK and Microsoft C 6.0 to write saver extensions.

[8.0 How to pay for Screen Peace]

   Screen Peace is CharityWare. A donation of whatever you think appropriate
   (I think $5 or $10 is what the others are charging) can be sent to the
   above address to make your copy of Screen Peace legal.

   ALL PROFITS (UNLESS SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED OTHERWISE) WILL GO TO SUPPORT
   GREEN PEACE, IN MY OPINION A VERY WORTHY CAUSE.

   If you don't wish to support Green Peace, specify which other charitable
   organization you wish your contribution to go to (an address would help).
   If you wish to make the contribution yourself, go ahead but PLEASE send
   me a letter or message telling me about it. I would really appreciate it.

   I hate to do this, but supporting Screen Peace has already been very 
   expensive so I am asking for a VOLUNTARY contribution of $2 to help
   pay my Compuserve bill (I've spent about 10 hours on Compuserve in the
   last five days). If you do not wish to make this contribution, please do
   not feel obligated to do so, but I will have to stop logging on to CIS
   every day and answering every message unless I can find a way to defray
   some of the expense. Any excess money collected WILL go to support Green
   Peace. Please make a note with your payment if you wish to contribute to
   the "Anthony Andersen Screen Peace Support CIS Fund" (or AASPSCISF).

[9.0 Other notes]

   9.1 If you want additional screen savers, I (and hopefully others) will be 
   uploading them to the MSWIN forum on Compuserve. If you want them on disk,
   send me $5 and I'll ship you a disk (please specify format) of no less
   than 10 savers. I would appreciate a copy of any savers you write.

   9.2 Many thanks go to John Ridges (author of the DESKPIC screen saver for
   OS/2 and a really great guy) for the FLEX screen saver and to Keith Agee 
   (another really great guy) for the KALEIDOSCOPE and BLOCKS screen savers.
   Thanks also to both of them for help with testing Screen Peace.

   9.3 Updates will be posted on Compuserve. If you want to be sure to get 
   updates, send an extra $5 and your disk format and I will mail you a copy
   of the next version with as many savers as I can fit on the disk.

   9.4 About BITMAP.SPX. If you put a Windows 3.0 device independent bitmap
   file or an OS/2 1.x bitmap file (.BMP) in your screen savers directory and
   name it BITMAP.BMP, BITMAP.SPX will use that bitmap instead of the normal
   Screen Peace bitmap.

   9.5 Password protection may be added to Screen Peace. I personally don't
   like it, but if I get enough requests for it, I will try to add it (it is
   kind of a nasty problem given the screen saver extension interface). So
   far, I've only had one request from several hundred messages.

   9.5 In certain cases, not all the savers you have in your directory will
   show up in the "Configure..." listbox in the Options dialog. This happens
   when you are running a Windows application with the same root name as one
   of the screen savers (example: when CLOCK.EXE is running, CLOCK.SPX will
   not show up in the list box). This is a problem with Windows not being
   able to load both an EXE and a DLL with the same root name. 

   9.5.1 It is also possible that you could start an EXE with the Options
   dialog box up. In this case, any saver with the same root filename whose
   name is in the list box will not function and the default screen saver
   (just blanks the screen) will run instead. This only happens in saver
   preview cases (see Section 7.0 above).

   9.6 Please note that if you choose the "Active DOS box disables Screen
   Peace" Advanced Option, Screen Peace will be disabled ANY time a DOS box
   is active INCLUDING when the DOS box is iconized. Moving the mouse pointer
   into the Saver Now Corner overrides this limitation.

   9.7 Due to an incredible number of messages I have to ask the following:
   Please look for information on Screen Peace in the message section
   of the MSWIN forum on Compuserve before sending me mail about any problems.
   If you're having a problem, it is likely that someone else has had the
   same problem and the answer is on the board. This will save me time and
   allow me to get busy writing LOTS of extensions for Screen Peace. Do not
   feel that I don't want to hear from you! If you have any comments or
   suggestions or problems (I hope the problems are about all solved), I
   would love to hear from you. I will be posting messages describing updates
   and problem workarounds under the topic "Screen Peace".

   9.8 Many thanks are due to Morrie Wilson for help in correcting the bugs
   in previous versions.

WHISKERS INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

To install Whiskers, copy all of the files to the directory you want 
Whiskers to be in.  Then use the File Manager or Program Manager to start
Whiskers, using the Whiskers.exe file.  Whiskers.exe uses another file 
(included with Whiskers) named Whiskers.dll.  The Whiskers.dll is a  
Dynamic Linked Library.  Be sure to keep the Whiskers.exe and Whiskers.dll
in the same directory. If you have an older version of Whiskers that used
a file named Rodent.exe, please delete the Rodent.exe file.  Whiskers
no longer needs it.

To run Whiskers, double click on its icon in the Program Manager or the
Whiskers.exe file in the File Manager.  Another Whiskers icon will appear
at the botton of your screen.  At this point Whiskers is running and the 
mouse button clicks are being captured and processed as the default set-
tings.  To view or change the default settings, see the "Programming the
Mouse Buttons" section below. 

PROGRAMMING THE MOUSE BUTTONS:
2 and 3 Button Mice

Click once on the Whiskers icon at the bottom of your screen and the sy-
stem menu will pop up.  Select the Buttons... command and a dialog box 
titled "Whisker's Mouse College" will appear.  The Right and Middle button 
key combinations have been programmed with default key values.  You may 
change any of these defaults that you wish.  For example, to program the 
Right button to be the DELETE key, turn the checkbox on, then click on the 
down arrow of the listbox that is in the "no shifts" row and in the Right
button column.  Scroll the listbox until you find the DELETE entry and
then select it.  Now press the OK button.  

To program the Shift+Right button combination, follow the same steps as
above, but make your selection in the listbox in the "shift" row and right
button column.  Follow these steps for programming each of the combina-
tions.  Repeat these steps for programming the Middle button on a three 
(3) button mouse.

MIDDLE BUTTON SIMULATION:

Whiskers can simulate a Middle button on a two (2) button mouse.  To do 
the middle button simulation press and hold down the right mouse button 
and then QUICKLY click the left mouse button.  The left button will ac-
tivate whatever key you have assigned to the "no shift middle button".  If 
you find that the click rate is too fast or too slow for you, the click 
rate can be changed in the Control Panel, Mouse section, Double Click Rate.
To do the other middle button key combinations, press and hold down the 
right button and any of the shift keys and then click the left button.  
When you let up on the right button, the mouse will revert back to its 
normal state.  To program the simulated Middle button, just follow the steps 
for programming the middle button of a three (3) button mouse.

The Shift Left click sequence may be assigned to the right or middle but-
ton, but in some applications it will not work.  For example, in Excel, 
Word for Windows and Notepad the Shift Left click assignment to the right 
or middle button will produce the approperiate extended selection.  How-
ever, in the File Manager, which uses Shift Left click for extended file
selection, Whiskers will not work.  This problem Whiskers not working with 
some applications is caused by the way those applications were written and 
there is no way for Whiskers to get around this.

The Left Double click sequence may be assigned to the right or middle but-
ton, but in some cases it will not work correctly.  For example, in the
Program Manager if you right click (right button is programmed to be Left
Double click) on one of the group icons the group window will open, but the
system menu will also appear.  When you close the system menu, the control 
box (upper left corner) is in reverse video.  This problem does not inter-
fer with the left double click functioning properly.  To correct the 
reverse video effect, just move the group window a little and the problem 
will correct itself.


EXCLUSION LIST:

Click once on the Whiskers icon at the bottom of your screen and the 
system menu will pop up.  Select Exclude... and a dialog box will appear.  
Follow the instruction in the dialog box for excluding certain programs 
from Whiskers attention.

You can also turn Whiskers ON and OFF manually by double clicking on the
Whiskers icon at the bottom of the screen.  Or Clicking once on the icon 
at the bottom of the screen and then selecting Whiskers ON or OFF from 
the system menu.

TO EXCEL USERS:

A Rodent.exe has been marketed separately in the past as an Excel add in.
If you have purchased the Rodent for Excel, just delete the Rodent.exe 
file and any macros that you may be using.  Whiskers is a complete re-
placement for the Rodent.
