PC-SIG Version: S1.0                                                    
                                                                        
Program Title: KinQuest                                                 
Author Version: 5.0                                                     
Author Registration: $79.00                                             
Special Requirements: 640K RAM, DOS 3.1, and an Epson compatible printer
                                                                        
KINQUEST is an industrial strength genealogical research tool that is   
easy to use yet is a serious research tool for both the amateur and     
professional genealogist. It was designed to answer a need to correlate 
large amounts of detailed source information quickly. There are two     
major research problems which KINQUEST is specially able to handle.     
                                                                        
The first is the problem of conflicting facts. As a genealogical record 
grows, it becomes more difficult to validate new facts. KINQUEST can    
quickly display vital statistics and a list of all documents in the     
research file that contain any one name on the database.                
                                                                        
Second is the problem of the indefinite relative. Research turns up many
names that cannot be easily related to a family but whose relationship  
cannot be ruled out. KINQUEST is a place to put that information until  
such a time as that fact iS needed.                                     
                                                                        
This genealogy program allows the entry of 2 billion names without the  
need to enter relationships or ID numbers. Relationships can be added or
changed without the need to re-enter data. Different families and       
unrelated names can be kept on the same database. Multiple databases are
allowed. There are no program limits to numbers of marriages or         
children. Searching can be done by parts of names or places (e.g. middle
name or birth county) or by jumping to any immediate relative or        
ancestor (by using an ancestor chart).                                  
                                                                        
KINQUEST controls document references and displays all documents for a  
given name, and will produce five reports. The shareware version also   
comes complete with the ancestry of George Washington. KINQUEST runs on 
floppy or hard disk and is perfect for laptops used to gather field     
data.
