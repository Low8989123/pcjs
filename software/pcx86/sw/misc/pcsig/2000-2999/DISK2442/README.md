## Information about "200 ICONS FOR WINDOWS 3.0"

    Wow!  Here are 200 icons you can use with Windows!  You'll find DOS
    prompts, faces, books, program names, trees, charts, graphs, and many
    other full color icons you can use to spruce up Windows 3.0.  Changing
    old icons to new ones is a breeze.  So dump out those boring
    monochrome icons that Windows gives you, and try some really vivid
    pictures that express your personality.
