                      CHINESE CHECKERS
                        Version 2.0
                      October 1, 1992

            Copyright (c) 1992, ImagiSOFT, Inc.
                    All rights reserved.


                     WHAT IS SHAREWARE?

Shareware is a beautiful concept that gives you a chance  to
"try"  Chinese Checkers and other programs before you  "buy"
them.   If you try Chinese Checkers and continue to use  it,
please send us the $16.95 registration fee and we will  send
you the latest Deluxe Version of Chinese Checkers.


            BONUS FEATURES IN THE DELUXE VERSION

The  Deluxe Version has the following bonus  features  which
are not available in the Shareware Version:
   * Save Game Option
   * Undo Last Move
   * Animated Icons On/Off
   * Sound Blaster / Adlib Music
               OTHER BENEFITS OF REGISTERING

   1.  The  Deluxe  Version uses about 100K less  hard  disk
       space.   This  is  because it doesn't  need  all  the
       documentation  files and uses a more powerful  method
       of compressing the graphics files.

   2.  We  will  notify  you of  major  updates  to  Chinese
       Checkers which you will generally be able to  receive
       for only a $3.00 shipping and handling charge.

   3.  We  will  notify  you  when  we  develop  other   new
       products.   Registered  users  generally  receive   a
       discount when new products are introduced.

   4.  When you register, we will send you a shareware  copy
       of  at least one of our other products  to  evaluate.
       Our most popular product is MOVIES TO GO!, which is a
       powerful,  graphics-oriented video movie  guide  with
       information  on more than 4,000 of  Hollywood's  best
       movies.

                         THANK YOU!

We  at ImagiSOFT enjoyed creating Chinese Checkers.   David,
is primarily responsible for Chinese Checkers.  He spent six
tedious  months working in assembly language developing  the
user  interface, and another four weeks  developing  Chinese
Checkers itself.  One year later, David spent another  month
implementing  the most often requested suggestions  for  our
Deluxe Version 2.0.  Russ spent a week on the artwork --  we
have  received  hundreds of letters applauding  his  talent!
The  newest member of our team, Robert Allen,  composed  the
music.   Our quality control people, Kathy, and Dorine  gave
this  program  a thorough work out before they  signed  off.
Mike coordinated this project and wrote the documentation.

In  June  of  1992,  Chinese  Checkers  was  nominated   for
"BEST NEW PRODUCT" and "BEST ENTERTAINMENT SOFTWARE" at  the
Shareware Industry Awards in Indianapolis.  We would like to
thank  Michael E. Callahan,  Randy MacLean,   Bob Ostrander,
Jim Perkins,  and other members of the nominating  committee
for helping to make ImagiSOFT famous!

Of  course, it is the financial support of our  hundreds  of
loyal  customers  which has Chinese Checkers  possible.   We
appreciate you most of all.
