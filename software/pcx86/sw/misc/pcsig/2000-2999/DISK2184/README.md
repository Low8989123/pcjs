## Information about "THE ELEMENT STUDY AID"

    Having recurring nightmares about flunking your chemistry class?
    Well, we've got good news for you! THE ELEMENT STUDY AID teaches you
    everything you need to know about all of the elements on the
    Periodic Table. Learn the element's name, atomic number and symbol,
    atomic weight, common valence, specific gravity, and the melting
    and boiling points of each. An option on the Periodic Table allows you
    to see where all of the elements fit into it. After you have studied
    the elements or the group of your choosing, run the test
    option to see how well you've learned them.

Are you doing poorly in your chemistry classes?  If you are, we've got  
good news for you.  Introducing THE ELEMENT STUDY AID:  this program    
will teach you everything you need to know about all of the elements    
on the periodical table.  It will give you the element's name, atomic   
number, atomic symbol, atomic weight, common valence, specific gravity, 
melting point, and boiling point of each element.   An option is given  
on the periodic table to see where all of the elements lie.  After you  
have studied the elements or the group of your choosing, you may run the
test option and see how well you have learned them.
