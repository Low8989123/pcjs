Disk No: 2917
Disk Title: PC-Wizard PowerMaster Plus+  2/2 (also #2706)
PC-SIG Version: S4.0

Program Title: PC-Wizard PowerMaster Plus+
Author Version: 4.0
Author Registration: $54.95
Special Requirements: Hard drive.


PC-WIZARD POWERMASTER II is a menu program to run all of your
application programs and automatically perform backups on your hard
disk.

Application programs and hard disk backups are executed by using the
function keys in a series of custom menus.  Up to ten different menus
may contain up to 90 different programs.  For application programs that
may require additional input from the user, PC-WIZARD lets you specify
whether or not each command allows user entry on the command line.
After completing all activities, PC-WIZARD automatically takes you to
the appropriate menu to backup each hard disk drive and information is
given about the last backup.

PC-WIZARD will educate the user on how to use DOS commands.  A menu of
20 common DOS commands is provided, and PC-WIZARD provides a Help menu
and examples of each command.  The user can become proficient in basic
DOS commands and manage the computer system without becoming dependent
on a specific menu program.

PC-WIZARD also has an activity log to record all programs and DOS
commands that are executed.  The activity log shows the date and time of
execution, the amount of time the program was in execution, and the name
of the command that was executed.

A complete network version is available from the author, plus a
multi-user version that allows a standalone computer to handle up to 45
separate users.
