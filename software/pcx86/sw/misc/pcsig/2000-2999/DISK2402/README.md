DAYO BUSINESS APPLICATIONS   Version 1.3                       12 July 1990

      DAYO is a collection of multiuser business applications that provide a
  means of managing inventory, purchasing, invoicing, customers, vendors,
  sales and more... All DAYO products are multiuser, designed to work on a
  Microcomputer (PC) Based Local Area Network (LAN), like Novell (tm). They
  can, however, work as a 'standalone', running on a single PC.

      To date, large and complex mulituser business applications required Mini
  and Mainframe computers, but because of products like the PC based LAN/
  Network, they can now be run on microcomputers. DAYO is one of the first
  microcomputer based business applications designed to handle such a system.

      DAYO Business Applications grow with your company. The ability to
  upgrade your system is available with the addition of other DAYO products.
  Source to DAYO is also available, allowing you to make further modifications
  and enhancements. DAYO Clock was written with Qbasic (tm); all others were
  written with Clipper (tm).


      Current Modules:

    Inventory         Back Orders             Smart Reports
    Point of Sale     Accounts Receivable     Materials Requirement Planning
    Price Book        Accounts Payable        Menu
    Quotes            General Ledger          Clock
    Index             Look Up Databases       Payroll
    Passwords         End of Period/Purge     Update & Conversion
    Time & Billing

      DAYO databases are all dBASE (tm) compatible, thus providing an
  additional or alternative source of support and reporting.

      DAYO was created by TJS LAB, a Software Publishing & Computer Consulting
  Company based in Orlando Florida. Support, Outsourcing, and customizing of
  DAYO is a major function of TJS LAB.

      The Shareware versions of DAYO can be found on many Online Services like
  Compuserve, GEnie, and many SDN BBSs. Shareware versions can also be
  obtained for 2 per $5.00 or $25.00 for all (this is a handling and materials
  charge), from TJS LAB. The cost for the registered versions is only $25.00
  each module. Source code is also available (includes the registration cost),
  for all the modules.

  *  DAYO requires DOS 3.3+, 640K, a hard disk, and an IBM (tm) compatible PC.

  DAYO APPLICATIONS:


  INVENTORY

    DAYO Inventory is a Multiuser Inventory Control, Purchasing, and Vendor
 Maintenance application. Use DAYO Inventory to create and maintain an
 inventory of any product. Create and print purchase orders on a standard
 printer or a Hewlett Packard LaserJet (tm). Receive purchase orders into
 inventory, with the option of printing receivers ('key recs'), and inventory
 tags/price labels. Maintain a Vendors database complete with the vendors
 purchasing history. With the exception of the initial and ongoing data entry
 of new product and vendors, DAYO Inventory is totally menu driven. Since DAYO
 Inventory is multiuser, it is capable of operating on most of the PC based
 networks, ie Novell (tm). Other features include Reports, Labels, Lists, and
 a Graph. A simple database management module is also included to provide you
 with additional means to modify, view, and report your data. The ability to
 upgrade your system is available with the addition of supporting DAYO
 products (ie: DAYO POS, DAYO EOP, DAYO AP, and more...).


  POS

      DAYO POS (Point of Sale) is a Billing and Invoicing application for any
  size business. It is the DAYO module that permits you to invoice out your
  products while keeping an accurate record of all your 'sales'.  Features
  include:  Multiuser (ie: Novell), Registers, Quote Interface (to DAYO
  Quotes), Templates Back Orders, Data Entry Validation, Cash Drawers (Serial
  or Parallel), Databases are dBase (tm) compatible, HP Laser Special
  Invoices, Preprinted Invoices, Standard Invoices, Packing/Shipping Lists,
  Customer Ship To/Mailing Address Labels, Sales Graphs, Special Customer
  Pricing  ( Margin, Discount Off List, Fixed), Sales Tax Codes, Terms Codes,
  Invoice Type Codes, Shippers/Method of Shipment Codes, Credit Limits,
  Passwords (with DAYO Passwords), and many Reports.


  PRICE BOOK

      DAYO Price Book is a system of creating and maintaining specialized
  pricing for your customer/clients. Special printouts (Price Books/Catalogs)
  may be printed to a standard printer, or to a Hewlett Packard (tm) Laserjet
  or compatible. It requires the presence of DAYO Inventory and DAYO POS
  (Point of Sale) programs/databases.

      Customers are invoiced (with DAYO POS), using the price in the inventory
  database (INV.DBF), or with one of the special Price Book methods:

      Fixed          -  Fixed Price for a Unique Item + Customer (1st Priority)
      Margin         -  'Cost Plus'                              (2nd Priority)
      List Discount  -  Discount off the List/Retail Price       (3rd Priority)

   DAYO BUSINESS APPLICATIONS                                       Page 3


  QUOTES

      DAYO Quotes creates sales order quotes based on the DAYO Inventory,
  Customer, and other DAYO databases. Quotes can be printed on a standard
  printer or a Hewlett Packard (tm) Laserjet compatible printer. The quote can
  be printed on a pre-printed form, on the Laser printer in a special laser
  format, or as a standard/default form. DAYO Quotes closely models itself
  after the DAYO POS (Point of Sale) application and is totally integrated
  with that application. Templates (kits or bundles), are supported.


  INDEX

      DAYO INDEX is a program designed to manage the indexing of the DAYO
  databases. DAYO applications all have multiple indexes, and because it is
  recommended that they be reindexed at least once daily, DAYO Index was
  created to simplify this process.


  PASSWORDS

      DAYO PASSWORDS provide DAYO Business Application users with a system of
  database security through the use of passwords. Its use is optional, but
  recommended in areas where more than one person has access to the data.


  DAYO BACK ORDERS

      DAYO BACK ORDERS is the maintenance module for the processing of all
  your customers/sales backorders. DAYO BO (working with DAYO POS) determines
  and manages the filling (allocation) of your customers backorders. It does
  this through an allocation process that determines what backordered items
  are 'fillable' because of receipts into the inventory. Creates the same type
  invoices as DAYO POS.


  AR (ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE)

      DAYO AR is the 'final chapter' to the processing and maintenance of all
  your Receivables. DAYO AR includes routines to handle cash receipts,
  customers, invoice types, terms, taxcodes, sales persons, and more. Many
  reports are included (ie: Ageing, Customer, Sales...). There is a routine
  to print Statements (ie: SMART, 90, 60, 30 days), and another one to create
  and print 'non' standard invoices (not applicable to DAYO POS). HP Laser
  forms are provided as an option for Statements and Invoices.


  AP (ACCOUNTS PAYABLE)

      DAYO AP is the 'final chapter' to the processing and maintenance of all
  your Payables. DAYO AP's key mission is to process/post your purchase orders,
  however, many other routines have been provided, ie: Expense Maintenance,
  1099 MISC Forms, Purchase Clearing, Vendor Maintenance, Hand/Manual Checks,
  Batch Checks, Recurring Checks, Unlimited Bank Accounts, Unlimited Check
  Printing Formats and over 21 Reports.

  finances. DAYO GL is totally integrated with the other DAYO packages.

      DAYO Look Up is a routine for DAYO users to view data from any DAYO
  database or dBase (tm) compatible database (.DBF). No editing is allowed.
  This provides a 'safe' tool for users that do not have the need to make
  changes to the databases. Has multi-level passwords.


  DAYO EOP

      DAYO EOP (End of Period Pack & Inventory) contains routines that are
  normally run at the end of a reporting period (ie: Month). DAYO EOP permits

  are included (ie: AR Ageing, AP Summary, Inventory Movement).
