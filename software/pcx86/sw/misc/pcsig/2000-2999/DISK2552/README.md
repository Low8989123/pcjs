PC-SIG is the world's oldest and largest distributor of shareware.
Since 1982 PC-SIG has been compiling the most respected shareware
collection anywhere by actively seeking top software authors and
their high quality programs.

Shareware is a unique approach to software retailing in which
consumers purchase software directly from the author.  Individual
authors avoid costly marketing, promotion, and packaging by
allowing their programs to be copied and shared with few
restrictions.  PC-SIG plays a vital role in the shareware process by
bringing shareware to the consumer.  As a central distributor,
PC-SIG can give these programs the exposure they deserve at a
fraction of the cost of bringing a single software package to
market.  In the end, the consumer wins with great software at
prices far below traditional retail markets.

The end user also wins with the opportunity to try the full program
before buying it from the author.  This ``try-before-you-buy''
method of software distribution is successful because shareware is
high-quality software.  Authors are confident that once you have
used their programs you'll be impressed and want to register.

        Dear Sirs/Madames,

        This disk contains the share-ware releases of Virus Central
        CGA/EGA v2.00. Virus Central Lite v2.00, the beta version of
        which I sent you earlier, will not be released publicly as of
        this time as I have encountered bugs in the program that have
        been difficult to locate. I will send you a complete copy of
        Virus Central Lite as soon as it is available.

        The Virus Central CGA and EGA programs are on two ZIP files.
        They are:

           VC200CGA.ZIP - Virus Central CGA v2.00
           VC200EGA.ZIP - Virus Central EGA v2.00

        The EGA version requires an EGA/VGA system while the CGA version
        will work with CGA/EGA/VGA equipped systems. Both programs
        will need a minimum of 512k RAM and work best when installed on
        a hard disk. Please be aware that the programs use identical
        file names (the executable CGA and EGA programs are both file
        named CENTRAL.EXE), so they could easily overwrite each other if
        "unzipped" in the same directory. Please refer to the
        documentation for more information.

        Since sending you the beta copies, a new feature has been added
        to the programs; Configuartion Options Locking. If you have been
        testing the betas, you will have to use the Update utility to
        correct your configuration file. Again, please refer to the
        accompanying documentation for more information.

        If you have any further questions about the programs, the
        documentation, or the accompanying support files, please feel
        free to contact me at this address/telephone number:

           Alejandro L. Abello
           2937 Sherwood Drive
           San Carlos, CA.  94070

                           VIRUS LIST UPDATE UTILITY

                                 Version 2.00

                            Copyright (C) 1990, 1991
                             by Alejandro L. Abello


        The Virus List Update Utility (UPDATE.EXE) is a program for
        quickly updating the list of viruses in the Virus Central
        configuration file. The program reads the list in the
        VIRLIST.TXT file, which comes with the ViruScan and CleanUp
        programs, and reconstructs the list in CENTRAL.CFG, without
        changing any of the configuration options. This way, you can
        easily keep the virus list up to date, more accurately and with
        minimal effort. You can, of course, still manually enter the
        virus list using the features available from Virus Central, but
        the Update utility simplifies the whole process.

        NOTE:
        Version 2.00 of the Update Utility can correctly update the
        configuration file of Virus Central 1.40, but will not work with
        the configuration files of earlier releases of the program. If
        you are using a copy of Virus Central earlier than v1.40, refer
        to the Virus Central User's Manual for information on manually
        correcting the configuration file


        USING THE PROGRAM

        Update works best when installed on the same directory as
        CENTRAL.CFG. Also, it is a good idea to have a copy of the
        VIRLIST.TXT file in that directory, too.

        Once installed, enter "UPDATE" to execute the program.

        You will be presented with the Main Menu, showing 3 options, on
        the left side of the screen. To select an option from the menu,
        use the up and down arrow keys to position the cursor over the
        desired option, and press [Enter] to select it.

        On the right side of the screen are the settings used by the
        program. Check these settings carefully before you begin the
        updating of CENTRAL.CFG, and change them, if necessary.


        The "Begin Update" Option

        When selected, "Begin Update" reconstructs the virus list in the
        CENTRAL.CFG file. This is actually a four step process, and
        messages describing the progress of the program at each step
        will be printed to the screen. Assuming all goes well, you
        should see the following messages:

        Reading In Virus Central configuration file . . .  DONE
        Reading In Virus List . . .  DONE
        Sorting Virus List . . .  DONE
        Writing New Virus List . . .  DONE
        Virus List Successfully updated!

        If something goes wrong during the process, you will be given an
        error message. In most cases, the error will be caused by a
        problem in the program settings.
        Note that Update will not change the first 30 viruses, since
        Virus Central defines them as sacred. Also, it does not add new
        viruses to the list; it reconstructs it from scratch.


        The "Change Settings" Option

        This option lets you modify the settings used by the program.
        Use the up or down arrow keys to select the setting you wish to
        modify. Press the [Esc] key to return to the Main Menu.

        The first setting is the file path to the configuration file.
        Normally, Update will look in the current directory or search
        the DOS path for the file CENTRAL.CFG. If it is unable to find
        it, the path will default to the root directory ("\"). If this
        is incorrect, possibly because the configuration file is in a
        directory not specified in the DOS search path, change this
        setting.

        The second setting is the name of the configuration file. This
        normally defaults to "CENTRAL.CFG." If you have changed the file
        name of the configuration file, change this setting to reflect
        the new file name.

        The third setting is the file path to the virus list file.
        Normally, Update will look in the current directory or search
        the DOS path for the file VIRLIST.TXT. If it is unable to find
        it, the path will default to the root directory ("\"). If this
        is incorrect, possibly because the virus list file is in a
        directory not specified in the DOS search path, change this
        setting.

        The fourth setting is the name of the virus list file. This
        normally defaults to "VIRLIST.TXT." If you have changed the file
        name of the virus list file, change this setting to reflect
        the new file name.

        The fifth field specifies whether or not you want Update to
        include all viruses in the list. Normally, Update will only
        include viruses which are marked as removable by Clean-Up.
        Setting this to "YES" will cause Update to include all the
        viruses on the list, even those that need M-DISK, SCAN/D,
        M-3066, or some other disinfector.

        The last field specifies whether or not you want to include
        "extinct" viruses in the list. Normally, Update will skip over
        viruses marked as extinct (in the virus list file, those that
        begin with a "*"). Setting this to "YES" will add them to the
        list.


        The "Return to DOS" Option.

        Select this option to terminate the program and return to DOS.

                           VIRUS LIST UPDATE UTILITY

                                 Version 2.00

                            Copyright (C) 1990, 1991
                             by Alejandro L. Abello


        The Virus List Update Utility (UPDATE.EXE) is a program for
        quickly updating the list of viruses in the Virus Central
        configuration file. The program reads the list in the
        VIRLIST.TXT file, which comes with the ViruScan and CleanUp
        programs, and reconstructs the list in CENTRAL.CFG, without
        changing any of the configuration options. This way, you can
        easily keep the virus list up to date, more accurately and with
        minimal effort. You can, of course, still manually enter the
        virus list using the features available from Virus Central, but
        the Update utility simplifies the whole process.

        NOTE:
        Version 2.00 of the Update Utility can correctly update the
        configuration file of Virus Central 1.40, but will not work with
        the configuration files of earlier releases of the program. If
        you are using a copy of Virus Central earlier than v1.40, refer
        to the Virus Central User's Manual for information on manually
        correcting the configuration file


        USING THE PROGRAM

        Update works best when installed on the same directory as
        CENTRAL.CFG. Also, it is a good idea to have a copy of the
        VIRLIST.TXT file in that directory, too.

        Once installed, enter "UPDATE" to execute the program.

        You will be presented with the Main Menu, showing 3 options, on
        the left side of the screen. To select an option from the menu,
        use the up and down arrow keys to position the cursor over the
        desired option, and press [Enter] to select it.

        On the right side of the screen are the settings used by the
        program. Check these settings carefully before you begin the
        updating of CENTRAL.CFG, and change them, if necessary.


        The "Begin Update" Option

        When selected, "Begin Update" reconstructs the virus list in the
        CENTRAL.CFG file. This is actually a four step process, and
        messages describing the progress of the program at each step
        will be printed to the screen. Assuming all goes well, you
        should see the following messages:

        Reading In Virus Central configuration file . . .  DONE
        Reading In Virus List . . .  DONE
        Sorting Virus List . . .  DONE
        Writing New Virus List . . .  DONE
        Virus List Successfully updated!

        If something goes wrong during the process, you will be given an
        error message. In most cases, the error will be caused by a
        problem in the program settings.
        Note that Update will not change the first 30 viruses, since
        Virus Central defines them as sacred. Also, it does not add new
        viruses to the list; it reconstructs it from scratch.


        The "Change Settings" Option

        This option lets you modify the settings used by the program.
        Use the up or down arrow keys to select the setting you wish to
        modify. Press the [Esc] key to return to the Main Menu.

        The first setting is the file path to the configuration file.
        Normally, Update will look in the current directory or search
        the DOS path for the file CENTRAL.CFG. If it is unable to find
        it, the path will default to the root directory ("\"). If this
        is incorrect, possibly because the configuration file is in a
        directory not specified in the DOS search path, change this
        setting.

        The second setting is the name of the configuration file. This
        normally defaults to "CENTRAL.CFG." If you have changed the file
        name of the configuration file, change this setting to reflect
        the new file name.

        The third setting is the file path to the virus list file.
        Normally, Update will look in the current directory or search
        the DOS path for the file VIRLIST.TXT. If it is unable to find
        it, the path will default to the root directory ("\"). If this
        is incorrect, possibly because the virus list file is in a
        directory not specified in the DOS search path, change this
        setting.

        The fourth setting is the name of the virus list file. This
        normally defaults to "VIRLIST.TXT." If you have changed the file
        name of the virus list file, change this setting to reflect
        the new file name.

        The fifth field specifies whether or not you want Update to
        include all viruses in the list. Normally, Update will only
        include viruses which are marked as removable by Clean-Up.
        Setting this to "YES" will cause Update to include all the
        viruses on the list, even those that need M-DISK, SCAN/D,
        M-3066, or some other disinfector.

        The last field specifies whether or not you want to include
        "extinct" viruses in the list. Normally, Update will skip over
        viruses marked as extinct (in the virus list file, those that
        begin with a "*"). Setting this to "YES" will add them to the
        list.


        The "Return to DOS" Option.

        Select this option to terminate the program and return to DOS.
