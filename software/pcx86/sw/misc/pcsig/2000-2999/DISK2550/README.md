Disk Title: Picture Label                                               
PC-SIG Version: S1.0                                                    
                                                                        
Program Title: Picture Label                                            
Author Version: 2.1                                                     
Author Registration: $10.00                                             
Special Requirements: Graphics card and printer.                        
                                                                        
PICTURE LABEL prints images from either PrintMaster, PrintShop, or The  
New PrintShop graphics libraries as well as the text on address labels, 
in one easy operation.  Use any custom graphics created with these      
programs or other available clip-art (See COOPER GRAPHICS, PC-SIG       
Library).                                                               
                                                                        
NOTE: PICTURE LABEL is a stand-alone program and does not require either
PrintMaster or PrintShop.  Only the graphics libraries are required.    
                                                                        
PICTURE LABEL is totally menu-driven and loaded with such features as:  
                                                                        
 ~ Four label heights -- 15/16", 1-7/16", 1-15/16", and 2-15/16".       
                                                                        
 ~ Standard 6 lines per inch spacing provides up to 5 lines on a 1"     
   label.                                                               
                                                                        
 ~ On-screen view of 12 graphic images at one time.                     
                                                                        
 ~ Selection of graphics libraries is done with a single screen display.
                                                                        
 ~ Special printing features and font selection such as double wide,    
   double high, italics, and enhanced.                                  
                                                                        
 ~ Save label address data with fonts and printing enhancements for     
   later use.                                                           
                                                                        
Got a large mailing list?  PICTURE LABEL can be used to ``pre-print''   
just the graphics on your label stock.  Later use your database or mail 
label program to print the address lines.
