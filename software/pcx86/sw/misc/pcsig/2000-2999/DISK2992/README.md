This is one of the best alien spaceship shoot'em up arcade games that   
can be found anywhere. The 256 color VGA graphics and animation are     
outstanding, and if you have a Sound Blaster card, you will get full    
digitized speech. Music for both Sound Blaster and Adlib sound cards is 
also provided. You have to hear it to believe it.                       
                                                                        
This slick game starts after the Xidus jam the nightly newscast and     
threaten to destroy the entire planet. Your mission is to destroy the   
Xidus and save the earth and its people. Your super space fighter is    
equipped with rapid fire cannons, missiles, and megabombs. Destroy      
special ships with your fighter claw and get some even better weapons.  
This game will keep you coming back for more and more. It is truly      
excellent.
