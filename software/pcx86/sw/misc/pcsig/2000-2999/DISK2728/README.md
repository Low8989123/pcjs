## FILE2728.TXT

{% raw %}
```
Disk No: 2728
Disk Title: Hard At Work
PC-SIG Version: S1.0

Program Title: Hard at Work
Author Version: 1.1
Author Registration: None.
Special Requirements: No special requirements.

HARD AT WORK (HAW) has eight different screens to make your computer
appear busy while you are away.  These dynamically changing screens
produce a busy effect for the casual eavesdropper.

The screens supplied are those of a system test, a database re-index, a
spreadsheet FILL option, disk optimization using Speedy Disk, a virus
scan, and a speaker integrity test.  All of the screens are amusing and
provide laughs when the truth is discovered.

Definitely for the office computer.  Use as a joke on a co-worker who
may be fooled into believing that the computer is at work while you take
a break!

Understanding the Shareware Concept:

    Shareware is not free software. Copyright laws apply to both
shareware and "commercial" software, and the copyright holder retains
all rights in the program. The term "shareware" refers to a try-before-
you-buy method for distributing software. The author specifically
grants the right to copy and distribute the evaluation version of the
software, as long as no fee is charged. Where a copying fee is charged,
certain restrictions may apply.
    Shareware distribution gives you the chance to try software before
buying it. If you try a shareware program and continue using it, you
are expected to register your use with the author. With registration,
you receive a license to continue using the software. This may include
a copy of the latest version of the program, technical support, and, if
applicable, future upgrade notification and other services.
    Shareware authors are expert programmers, just like commercial
authors, and the products are of comparable quality. (In both cases,
you will find both good and bad programs!) The price of shareware is
significantly lower than that of commercial software because of the
method of distribution. When you pay for shareware, you pay for the
software only, not for expensive advertising and fancy packages. With
commercial software, you pay for the program before you try it, and you
may get stuck with a product that does not suit your needs. With
shareware, you pay for the software after you have found it to be
useful.
    Shareware authors are paid for their work only when you register
your use of their products. Your support keeps this system working and
makes it possible for the authors to keep producing new and better
products.
    The shareware concept is based entirely on the honor system, and
generally works quite well. Most people are honest and will not violate
the trust placed in them by the author of the software. The author
counts on your integrity.

About the ASP:

    The Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP) is an industry
organization formed to strengthen the future of shareware. All ASP
members subscribe to a code of ethics designed to ensure that users
receive superior products and services. These policies work to the
mutual benefit of authors, users, and vendors.
    For more information on the ASP, write to P.O. Box 5786, Bellevue,
WA 98006, or visit the ASP forum on CompuServe (GO SHAREWARE at any CIS
prompt).

This is NOT a public domain program. All program and data files are
Copyright 1990, Rosemary West, all rights reserved. Distribution
restriction rights are claimed under that copyright and are outlined
below and in the file VENDOR.DOC.

Limited Distribution License:
-----------------------------

As the exclusive copyright holders for this software, Rosemary West
and R.K. West Consulting authorize on-line distribution only in
accordance with the following restrictions. Disk Vendors and
Distributors should refer to the VENDOR.DOC text file for complete
license information.

The software package is defined as containing all the material listed
in the VENDOR.DOC text file. If any file listed in the VENDOR.DOC text
file, or the VENDOR.DOC file itself, is missing, then the package is
not complete and distribution is forbidden. Please contact us to
obtain a complete package suitable for distribution.

     *    The software package - including all related program files
          and documentation files - CANNOT be modified in any way
          (other than that mentioned in the following paragraph) and
          must be distributed as a complete package, without
          exception. The VENDOR.DOC text file contains a list of all
          files that are part of the software package.

     *    Many BBSs customarily add to each archived file a small text
          file which describes the BBS and tells people that the file
          was downloaded from that particular BBS. Other BBSs add a
          small one-line message with their BBS name and phone number
          into the compressed file, which will display when the file
          is uncompressed. Either of these methods of mentioning your
          BBS are acceptable and may be used, provided the program and
          documentation is otherwise unmodified and complete.

     *    We prohibit the distribution of outdated versions of the
          software package. If the version you have obtained is over
          six (6) months old, please contact us to ensure that you
          have the most current version.

     *    Licensee shall not use, copy, rent, lease, sell, modify,
          decompile, disassemble, otherwise reverse engineer, or
          transfer the licensed program except as provided in this
          agreement. Any such unauthorized use shall result in
          immediate and automatic termination of this license.

     *    U.S. Government Information: Use, duplication, or disclosure
          by the U.S. Government of the computer software and
          documentation in this package shall be subject to the
          restricted rights applicable to commercial computer software
          as set forth in subdivision (b)(3)(ii) of the Rights in
          Technical Data and Computer Software clause at 252.227-7013
          (DFARS 52.227-7013). The Contractor/ manufacturer is R.K.
          West Consulting, P.O. Box 8059, Mission Hills, CA 91346.

     *    All rights not expressly granted here are reserved to R.K.
          West Consulting.

Update Service:
-------------------

Some BBSs prefer to obtain programs directly from the authors. If you
would like to obtain programs directly from us, automatically, then
please help us to cover the cost.

If your BBS would like to receive automatic upgrades to any of our
products, directly from us, then please refer to the information
below. Due to the time and expense we are generally unable to upload
directly to a large number of Bulletin Board Systems. However, we are
able to mail updates on disk to many BBSs.

If your BBS would like to receive automatic updates then please take
advantage of our Update Service. Under this program you can receive
updates of all our programs (as of this writing we have over 17
shareware programs in distribution) for an entire year for only $35
(this helps to offset our costs).

To receive updates, simply send us a letter with the name and mailing
address of your BBS, BBS phone number, voice phone number, the name of
the person we may contact (preferably the SYSOP or CO-SYSOP), and a
check or money order for $35 (for countries outside of North America
please add an additional $20). Payment in U.S. funds drawn on a U.S.
bank only, please.

NOTE: All BBSs participating in our Update Service will automatically
receive any NEW programs which we may release while their Update
Service is in effect.

The Update Service is only intended to help us cover our expenses in
those cases where a BBS desires to obtain the program directly from
us. If you have other standard ways to obtain current versions of
these programs, then you may not want to use our Update Service.

------------------------------------------------------------------

For consistency and to help users locate the files, please use the
following file name(s):

If the program and documentation are contained within an archive file,
please use the following name:

     HAW.ZIP

If the program is compressed using some other file compression method,
then please use the name listed above, but with the appropriate
extension (PAK, ARC, LZH, ZOO, ZIP, etc.).

If you have an earlier version of this software on your BBS, please
delete it. Thank you!
