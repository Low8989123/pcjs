Disk No: 2746
Disk Title: QuestMaker
PC-SIG Version: S1

Program Title: QuestMaker
Author Version: 2.1
Author Registration: $20.00
Special Requirements: EGA, 286 or better, and a hard drive recommended.

If you have been dreaming of creating the next great animated adventure
game, your dreams may come true with QUESTMAKER.  More than two years in
development, QUESTMAKER represents a giant step forward in animated game
creation.

Even non-programmers will be able to create animated adventure games
similar to popular games such as Kings Quest.  This unique program
allows the user to create fantasy, adventure, or even mystery games
using .PCX images.  QUESTMAKER is an excellent educational tool for
creating subject-specific games.  Make learning fun!

QUESTMAKER comes with a complete sample tutorial game called the
``Adventures of Hero Harry.''  This game demonstrates most of the
program functions.  You won't need to worry about details such as Save
and Restore operations, character movements, game Help, speed control,
and inventory management since they are already built in.  These
automatic functions will reduce your game development time.  Create a
complete game in a couple of days instead of a couple of years.

Since many of the standard functions are already programmed, you can
allow your imagination free rein to construct the ultimate animated game
you've dreamed about.

All graphics used by the game are 640 x 200, 16-color .PCX images, which
you can create using programs such as PC-Paintbrush or the QUESTMAKER II
Toolkit, available after registration.
