## Information about "PICTURETHIS 3 OF 4 (1130, 1474, 2302)"

    Quickly and easily prepare professional-looking drawings for printing
    on PostScript-compatible laser printers and imagesetters with
    PICTURETHIS.  Do them either freehand or by tracing ``template''
    screens captured with a companion program, CAPTURETHIS.
    
    Use PICTURETHIS even if you don't know how to program in the
    PostScript page description language.  View a screen representation of
    your drawing as you prepare it, easily making additions and
    alterations.  Print PICTURETHIS drawings at lower resolution on some
    dot-matrix printers, using the graphics screen dump program supplied
    with DOS.
    
    PICTURETHIS doesn't need a lot of fancy hardware -- just an IBM PC, XT,
    AT, or compatible.  It doesn't even require direct access to a laser
    printer.  Drawing files can be sent by mail or modem to a laser
    typesetting service bureau for overnight return of low-cost prints with
    300, 1270, or even 2540 dots-per-inch resolution.

With PICTURETHIS, you can quickly and easily prepare                    
professional-looking drawings for printing on PostScript-compatible     
laser printers and imagesetters.  You can do them either freehand or by 
tracing ``template'' screens captured with a companion program,         
CAPTURETHIS.  PICTURETHIS doesn't need a lot of fancy hardware -- just  
an IBM PC, XT, AT, or compatible.  You don't even need direct access to 
a laser printer.  Your drawing files can be sent by mail or modem to a  
laser typesetting service bureau for overnight return of low-cost       
prints with 300, 1270, or even 2540 dots-per-inch resolution.  You can  
print PICTURETHIS drawings at lower resolution on some dot matrix       
printers, using the graphics screen dump program supplied with DOS.     
                                                                        
You don't have to know how to program in the PostScript page description
language to use PICTURETHIS.  You view a screen representation of your  
drawing as you prepare it, so additions and alterations can be made     
easily.

         GETTING STARTED

           This file and TUTOR2.TXT provide a "hands-on" tutorial to
         introduce beginners to PictureThis and CaptureThis.
           Print out copies of this file, TUTOR2.TXT, and KEYS.TXT
         (so you can quickly look up the functions of various keys if
         you forget them), and you'll be ready to try PictureThis and
         CaptureThis. Happy drawing!

         EXERCISE 1. RUNNING PictureThis

         1. Make copies of the PictureThis distribution disks, as per
         the READTHIS.1ST file on distribution disk #1, if you haven't
         already. PLEASE don't run PictureThis using the original
         distribution disks!
           The following files are needed for this tutorial:

         PICTHIS3.EXE
         PTS3T.OVR
         PTS3D.OVR
         LEAF.TMP
         LEAF.DRW
         PIVY.DRW
         CAPTHIS.COM or ACAPTHIS.COM
         TEST1.DAT
         GRAPHBOX.CLP
         SCALE.CLP
         AXIS.CLP
         FONT91.*


                                                                           2
         FONT93.*
         STANDARD.SFT
         *.FAC
         !*.*  (part files for Kartoons, such as !NOSE.1 and !CHIN.5)

           To use the DOS shell feature of PictureThis, you might
         need to copy COMMAND.COM to your "RUN" floppy disk or hard-
         disk directory for PictureThis

         2. You MUST have a video board and monitor compatible with
         CGA medium-resolution (320 x 200) graphics; a monochrome
         (TTL) monitor with a Hercules-compatible graphics board
         should work IF it has software or hardware CGA emulation
         (several inexpensive CGA emulation programs are available,
         some marketed as "shareware").
           At the DOS prompt for the floppy disk drive containing the
         PictureThis "PROGRAM" disk or for the PictureThis hard-disk
         directory, key in "PICTHIS3"; then press Enter. Immediately
         press Tab IF you have a Hercules-compatible graphics board
         with CGA emulation. Some CGA emulators cannot handle direct-
         to-screen writing in text mode, which is the default mode of
         PictureThis. Pressing Tab (ONLY while the program is loading)
         switches to (slightly slower) through-the-BIOS writing of
         text characters. Otherwise, your computer might hang up. The
         title screen should appear for a few seconds, and then a
         copyright and ordering information screen should appear.
         Please read it! When you press a key to continue, a blank
         screen with a dotted frame and an X-shaped cursor at its
         center should appear. This is the PictureThis drawing screen.
           If you see "OUT OF MEMORY" when PictureThis tries to load,
         you need to free up some memory by removing memory-resident
         programs. If you still see "OUT OF MEMORY" after freeing up
         as much memory as possible, you'll need to install more RAM
         to run PictureThis. At least 512 KB RAM is required. See the
         user manual for information on changing the memory needs of
         PictureThis.

         3. Knowing how to exit from a program is just as important as
         knowing how to run it! To return to DOS from PictureThis, no
         matter where you are in the program, press Esc (repeatedly if
         necessary) until you see the prompt "Quit PictureThis? (Y/N)"
         Then press Y if you really want to quit; press any other key
         (including, but not limited to N) if you don't. Note:
         Usually, PictureThis is INSENSITIVE TO CASE (here, Y is
         treated the same as y).
           Try it: press Esc. When you see the exit prompt, press any
         key OTHER THAN Y. The prompt vanishes and you're still in
         PictureThis. Press Esc again, then Y -- you're back at the
         DOS command prompt.
           Run PictureThis again by keying in "PICTHIS3" and then
         pressing Enter (and, if necessary, Tab), as before. In the
         Registered Version, but NOT this "Shareware" Version, you can
         press Esc immediately after Enter (or immediately after Tab)
         to bypass the title and copyright screens.

         4. Press R and you should hear a beep, meaning that R is an
         invalid key, currently (but not always) inappropriate. Don't
         worry about pressing invalid keys: nothing else happens
         except the beep. If you get tired of hearing beeps, you can

                                                                           3
         turn them off by pressing H.
           Try it: press H, then R: no beep. Press H again, then R
         again: the beep is back, AND an error message appears. Press
         a key to make the error message go away. When you press H and
         then R a third time, you're back to only a beep. The H
         (for "Hear") key toggles among three responses to invalid key
         inputs: beeping with no error messages, no beeping and no
         error messages, and beeping with error messages. Note: Not
         all invalid keys have associated error messages (a complete
         list of error messages can be found in ERRORS.TXT). When
         error messages are toggled on, special prompts appear during
         some infrequently used and/or possibly confusing operations.
         We recommend that beginners toggle on beeping AND error
         messages and prompts, so, if you just pressed H three times,
         as directed above, press it twice more.
           To make sure beeping with error messages and prompts are
         now toggled on, press W. This ("What's Happening") key turns
         a status box on and off at the bottom of the drawing screen.
         Press W a few times to see the box appear and disappear,
         ending with it toggled on. For now, you can disregard most of
         contents of the status box, but there should be an "H+" in it
         to denote that beeping and error messages/prompts are on. If
         there is just an "H " in it, only beeping is toggled on, and
         if there is an "H-" in it, neither beeping nor error
         messages/prompts are toggled on. Press the H key a few times
         to watch the symbols cycle among the three possibilities, and
         stop with "H+" showing. Then press W to toggle the status box
         off.
           Currently valid keys are listed in contextual help screens
         which can be accessed (except when a menu is showing) by
         pressing ?. Try it. Then press a key to return to the drawing
         screen.

         EXERCISE 2. ABOUT FILES

         1. The "ultimate products" of PictureThis are files written
         in the PostScript page description language, which contain
         all of the information about your drawings needed by
         PostScript-compatible printers and imagesetters to generate
         hard copies. Six other kinds of files can be involved in the
         production process: template files, drawing files, clip art
         files, data files, Kartoon face files, and Kartoon part
         files. (Also, font files are used when you place text on
         drawings.)
           CGA (medium- or high-resolution) graphics screens can be
         captured in TEMPLATE FILES by using the CaptureThis (or
         Alternate CaptureThis) program; these files then can be
         imported into PictureThis to provide background screens for
         tracing.
           DRAWING FILES are used to store and retrieve information
         about your drawings in a format usable by PictureThis; you
         can save a drawing-in-progress in a drawing file for later
         recall.
           CLIP ART FILES save parts of drawings for use in other
         drawings.
           DATA FILES provide numerical data for plotting two-
         dimensional graphs.
           Kartoon FACE and PART FILES are used to store faces and
         face parts used in Kartoons mode.

                                                                           4
           Following the instructions in this tutorial, you will work
         with sample template, drawing, clip art, and data files, and
         you will create a template file, two drawing files, two clip
         art files, a face file, two face part files, and two
         encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files. The recommended
         extensions for names of PictureThis template, drawing, clip
         art, data, face, and PostScript files are, respectively,
         .TMP, .DRW, .CLP, .DAT, .FAC, and .EPS. All face part file
         names start with an exclamation mark (!) and have numbers as
         their extensions (example: !NOSE.3); face part files are
         named and accessed automatically. Font file names have
         extensions .FNM, .FIN, .FKN, or .SFT.
           Access the file operations menu by pressing F10. In
         response to the menu, press R (for "ReadTMP"). A prompt for a
         template file specification appears, with a "wild card" file
         specification in the second line. This file specification
         consists of your current directory (see your DOS manual) and
         "*.TMP." Press Enter and a directory page appears with all
         files listed which match this file specification, with a
         (reverse-color) block cursor on the first file name. Move the
         block cursor to LEAF.TMP using the cursor keys (if necessary)
         and press Enter. The drawing screen reappears and you should
         see a representation of a leaf, which can be used as a
         tracing template for your drawing. Note: Importing a template
         file erases a template already on the screen. In Exercise 15,
         you'll learn how to capture CGA graphics screens for use as
         templates.

         2. Press F10 to access the file operations menu a second
         time. In response to the menu, press G. A prompt for a
         drawing file specification appears with a "wild card" file
         specification on the second line (your current directory and
         *.DRW). Press Enter; a directory page appears. Move the block
         cursor to LEAF.DRW using the cursor keys (if necessary) and
         press Enter. The drawing screen will reappear with the same
         template, plus curves (with a color different from the
         template colors) along the leaf's edges and stem. These
         curves comprise a drawing previously made with PictureThis.
         Note: Importing a drawing file erases a drawing already on
         the screen. In Exercise 7, you'll learn how to save a drawing
         file.

         3. Encapsulated PostScript files are ASCII text files which
         can be written, but not read, by PictureThis. To write such a
         file for the leaf drawing, again access the file operations
         menu by pressing F10, then, in response to the menu, key in
         W. Respond to the next prompt ("Use current settings? (Y/N)")
         by pressing Y to accept the defaults (see the PictureThis
         user manual for more information). In response to the prompt
         for a filespec, key in "LEAF.EPS" and then press Enter. The
         file is written to disk, in the current directory. If there
         is any problem, such as an open drive door, you'll see an
         error message and have a change to correct the problem before
         attempting the procedure again.
           If you want to take a look at the PostScript file just
         saved, you can shell to DOS. (Note: COMMAND.COM must be
         accessible; see your DOS manual.) To shell, access the file
         operations menu again by pressing F10. In response to the
         menu, press D. The DOS prompt appears. At the DOS prompt, key

                                                                           5
         in "TYPE LEAF.EPS" and then press Enter. You can stop the
         scrolling temporarily, by pressing Ctrl S; press any key to
         begin scrolling again. At the DOS prompt, return to where you
         were in PictureThis by keying in "EXIT" and pressing Enter.

         EXERCISE 3. THE SCREEN

         1. To access the miscellaneous menu, press F9. In response to
         the menu, press P to select a different palette. There are
         six palettes (three normal and three intense) available,
         although your video card and/or monitor might not show each
         palette differently.
           Press 2 or 3 on the main keyboard (not on the numeric
         keypad) to respond to the next prompt. For an intense palette
         (not available with some video cards and monitors), press
         Shift simultaneously with the number key.
           Try this (F9, then P, then a number key, with Shift or not)
         several more times to see which palette choices are available
         with your video card and monitor. Stop at the palette you
         find most pleasing.

         2. Press T. This ("Template") key toggles the template off,
         so you see only the drawing. It does NOT erase the template
         permanently. Press T again to toggle the template back on.
           Press R. This ("Remove and Restore") key toggles the
         drawing off, so you see only the template. It does NOT erase
         the drawing permanently. Press R again to toggle the drawing
         back on.
           Press D. This ("reDraw") key erases both the template and
         the drawing, and then immediately draws them again -- useful
         for removing "garbage" (extra and/or missing parts of curves)
         which appears occasionally on the screen (especially when
         erasing or manipulating objects, as explained later in this
         tutorial). Such "garbage" may not be aesthetically pleasing,
         but it ISN'T included in drawing or PostScript files made
         with PictureThis, and preventing it would have slowed the
         program's operation. The D key also has another function,
         described in step 5 of this Exercise.
           Press C. This ("Clear") key accesses a prompt to erase the
         drawing PERMANENTLY! The drawing will be lost IRRETRIEVABLY
         unless you saved it previously in a drawing file. In response
         to the "Clear current drawing? (Y/N)" prompt, press any key
         other than Y to make the prompt disappear; the drawing
         remains. Press C again; since you can easily get LEAF.DRW
         again, press Y. Only the template remains. To get LEAF.DRW
         again, press F10 and then G; press Enter and use the cursor
         keys (if necessary) to move the block cursor to LEAF.DRW.
         Press Enter, and the leaf drawing appears again.

         3. Note that the curves comprising the drawing have small
         boxes at their ends. To see the drawing without these boxes
         (and with no screen border), press V. This ("Viewscreen") key
         is useful when you want to find out how much of the available
         memory a drawing has used.
           Press U to toggle on the "memory Used" box (the viewscreen
         must be on); press U again to toggle the box off). For more
         information on memory limits, see the user manual. No drawing
         can take place while the viewscreen is on (the cursor is
         gone!). Press Esc to return to the drawing screen.

                                                                           6
         4. To see an approximation of the drawing as it will appear
         when output on a PostScript printer, press Q. The "Quickshow"
         screen shows approximately correct line widths, fills, etc.
         (see Exercises 6 and 9).
           By using the Print Screen function (see your operating
         system manual for more information), you can "dump" the
         Quickshow screen to a dot matrix printer for a low-resolution
         print of the drawing, assuming that you previously installed
         a memory-resident graphics printer driver program appropriate
         for the CGA graphics mode (such as GRAPHICS.COM, supplied
         with PC-DOS, or a more sophisticated program such as Pizazz).
         Press Esc to return to the drawing screen.

         5. Six screen magnifications are possible: 50%, 100%, 300%,
         600%, 1200%, and 2400%. You see the 100% screen currently.
         Switch to the 50% screen by pressing - (on the numeric
         keypad). Now switch back to the 100% screen by pressing + (on
         the numeric keypad). Press + four more times to switch
         successively to the 300%, 600%, 1200%, and 2400% screens.
         Notice that the template is NOT shown on the 600%, 1200%, or
         2400% screens (the template at these magnifications is too
         coarse to be of much use). Switch back to the 100% screen by
         pressing - four times. So: Press + to magnify, - to
         demagnify.
           When the magnification is "zoomed" to any screen except
         the 50% screen, the screen centers on the cursor. (The 50%
         screen always shows the entire available drawing area.) When
         working on the 100%, 300%, 600%, 1200%, or 2400% screen, you
         can center the screen on the cursor without "zooming" by
         pressing X.
           The T, R, and C keys work the same way at all screen
         magnifications, but at the 50% screen, the D key also
         switches among four algorithms for compressing the template
         (the practical significance is that some template lines might
         be visible only when some of the algorithms are used). Press
         the numeric keypad - to switch to the 50% screen, then press
         D repeatedly as you watch for subtle changes in the template.
         (It might help to toggle the drawing off by pressing R, for a
         better view.) If you zoom and then return to the 50% screen,
         the template looks as it did when you left the 50% screen.
         Test this if you want.
           The viewscreen and the Quickshow screen also can be
         "zoomed," using the + and - keys on the numeric keypad.

         6. You can scroll around any screen EXCEPT the 50% screen.
         Use the number keys (except 5) on the numeric keypad with
         Shift pressed or NumLock toggled on. Try it. Note that the
         scrolling increment is about one-quarter of the screen,
         horizontally or vertically (or both, for diagonal scrolling).
         Also note that when the cursor reaches the edge of the screen
         during scrolling, it is "dragged along" by the scrolling, so
         it remains at the edge of the screen. The viewscreen and the
         Quickshow screen also be scrolled, using the same keys.

         7. You can center the frame (the rectangular dotted box) on
         the screen (at 100% to 2400% magnifications) by pressing
         Shift 5.
           You can center the frame on the screen and simultaneously
         center the cursor in the frame (called "zeroing" the screen)

                                                                           7
         by pressing Z.
           The viewscreen and the Quickshow screen also can be
         centered and zeroed (even though the cursor doesn't show!),
         using the same keys.

         8. Whenever a screen (drawing, Quickshow, or view) is being
         redrawn and a key is pressed which redraws the screen (+, -,
         D, scrolling keys, and Q or V while at the drawing screen),
         the drawing process stops immediately, and the newly
         specified screen starts to draw. This speeds magnification
         and scrolling of complicated drawings.

         EXERCISE 4. CURSOR MOVEMENTS

         1. Note: For cursor control via a mouse, refer to the file
         PTMOUSE.TXT on one of the distribution disks. To move the
         cursor anywhere on the screen, use the number keys (except 5)
         on the numeric keypad (with Shift not pressed and NumLock
         toggled off). Initially (if you have brought in LEAF.DRW),
         the cursor moves one pixel horizontally or vertically (or
         both, for diagonal movements) each time a number key is
         pressed. Practice moving the cursor around, and then press
         Ins, with Shift not pressed and NumLock toggled off. Use the
         numeric keypad number keys again to move the cursor. Now the
         cursor moves 10 pixels each time a number key is pressed. The
         Ins key toggles between cursor movement increments (you can
         think of these as cursor "speeds") of one and 10 pixels. (The
         cursor also can be moved in "real" units: inches,
         millimeters, centimeters, points, or picas & points. For
         "real" units, both the "slow" and "fast" cursor "speeds" can
         be changed; see the user manual on how to do this.)

         2. To move the cursor to a corner of the frame, press Ctrl
         Home, Ctrl End, Ctrl PgUp, or Ctrl PgDn. The cursor jumps to
         the appropriate corner of the frame.

         3. Another way to move the cursor around a drawing is to use
         the endpoint selection operation, which you initiate by
         pressing Del, with Shift not pressed and NumLock toggled off.
         The cursor moves to the closest curve endpoint, all of the
         curves having that endpoint are dashed, and (if "H+" is
         toggled) a prompt to press +, -, Space, or Enter appears. Now
         press + several times, so the cursor moves to each endpoint
         in turn. Next, press Esc. The cursor returns to where it was
         before Del was pressed.
           Again press Del; press + a few times, then press - a few
         times to return to the endpoint where the cursor went when
         you pressed Del.
           If you press - immediately after pressing Del, the cursor
         jumps to the most distant endpoint. Try it. In general, + (or
         Space) takes the cursor FORWARD through the sequence of
         endpoints arranged (approximately) by closeness to the
         original cursor position, and  - takes the cursor BACKWARD
         through the same sequence.
           To select an endpoint at which to leave the cursor, press
         Enter when the cursor is on the desired endpoint. The cursor
         remains at the endpoint, and the dashing of the curves
         having that endpoint goes away.


                                                                           8
         4. Press P. This ("Position box") key toggles the cursor
         position box (at the bottom right corner of the screen) and
         the relative cursor position box (at the top of the screen)
         on and off in a three-way toggle (try it, and stop with only
         the position box on). The number on the left in the
         position box is the horizontal distance of the cursor from
         the left of the frame in INTERNAL UNITS; the number on the
         right is the vertical distance of the cursor from the top of
         the frame in INTERNAL UNITS. Watch the numbers as you move
         the cursor around the screen. Try this at various screen
         magnifications.
           What are internal units? PictureThis saves the positions of
         the cursor and elements of drawings in internal units (ius).
         These are integer values allowing extremely fine resolution.
         (On the 50% screen there are 48 ius per pixel; on the 100%
         screen there are 24 ius per pixel; on the 300% screen there
         are 8 ius per pixel; on the 600% screen there are 4 ius per
         pixel; on the 1200% screen there are 2 ius per pixel; and on
         the 2400% there is 1 iu per pixel. For the default settings,
         1 iu is approximately 1/1000 inch.)
           You can move the cursor in internal unit increments as well
         as in pixel increments. To switch to internal units, press I.
         Now move the cursor around the screen again. Try it at
         various screen magnifications. Ins still toggles between 1
         and 10 units per cursor movement increment, but now the units
         are internal units, not pixels. Press W to see the status
         box. The fifth character from the right in the status box is
         "I" (for internal units) Press I again. The "I" changes to
         "E" (for external units). ("G" (for grid) is a third
         possibility, as described in the user manual). The number
         following this indicator is the cursor speed. The two
         characters following the cursor speed abbreviate the current
         units ("PX" for pixels).

         EXERCISE 5. DRAWING CURVES

         1. By following the instructions in the remainder of this
         tutorial, you'll draw a leaf with three leaflets, using the
         template already on the screen as a guide for the first
         leaflet. But first, you need to erase the already completed
         leaf drawing. Press C and then Y to do this. Make sure you
         are at the 100% drawing screen (see Exercise 3.5), and that
         it is centered (see Exercise 3.7).

         2. Curves drawn in PictureThis are cubic Bezier curves, which
         means that they are each completely determined by two
         endpoints and by two "control points" (one associated with
         each endpoint) which specify curve shape. To draw a curve,
         you first set (specify the location of) its first endpoint,
         then you set its second endpoint, then you position its
         control points, and finally you set the curve.
           Before you begin drawing, remember what was said earlier
         about using Esc to cancel the current operation. If you
         become confused or frustrated at any point, just press Esc
         to restore the program to its state just before you began the
         current operation. Also, we recommend that you press W to
         toggle the status box on (if it is not already showing) while
         learning to draw; in the status box is an indicator of the
         current operation or state (before you begin drawing, it says

                                                                           9
         "FREE").
           Start with the leaf's stem. Move the cursor to the tip of
         the template leaf, at the upper left. The internal units of
         the tip (shown in the position box) used when making the
         drawing saved in LEAF.DRW are 972 (horizontal), 972
         (vertical), but you don't necessarily have to duplicate that
         drawing exactly. Press Ins and I as necessary to alter cursor
         speed. When the cursor is where you want it, press F1. This
         key sets the endpoints of curves. Now it says "LINE" in the
         status box.
           Move the cursor to the other end of the stem, at the top of
         the small oval. The ius used when making the drawing saved in
         LEAF.DRW are 6492, 3708, but, again, you needn't duplicate
         that drawing exactly. When the cursor is where you want it,
         press F1 again to set the curve's second endpoint. The curve
         is actually a line at this stage, but the status box says
         "CURVE" because you now are able to alter the curve's shape.
         Move the cursor away from the second endpoint, up and to the
         left, and the line becomes curved. You are moving the control
         point associated with the second endpoint (which we'll call
         the "second control point") away from the second endpoint.
           Press F2. This key switches the cursor between control
         points after both endpoints of a curve have been defined. The
         cursor now is at the first endpoint, which is where the
         "first control point" is located initially (control points
         are always at their associated endpoints until you move
         them). A dot marks the position of the second control point.
         Now move the cursor away from the first endpoint, down and to
         the right, and you can make the curve have an S-shape. You
         are moving the first control point away from the first
         endpoint.
           Press F2 again. The cursor jumps back to the second control
         point, leaving a dot to mark the position of the first
         control point. Now you can move the second control point
         again. You can keep pressing F2 and moving the cursor, in
         turn, positioning both control points so as to shape the
         curve the way you want it. The LEAF.DRW drawing has 1596,
         1572 for the first control point's coordinates, and 5532,
         2580 for the second control point's coordinates.
           Now you need to set the curve. Press F3. This key sets a
         curve after its two endpoints have been set and its two
         control points have been positioned. The status box says
         "FREE" again. You've just drawn your first curve in
         PictureThis. Note that the cursor ends up at the second
         endpoint; this makes it easy to draw a succession of
         connected curves.
           NoW for the end of the stem. The cursor is already where
         the first endpoint of the next curve should be. There is an
         important rule for drawing with PictureThis which is
         exemplified here: IF YOU WANT CURVES TO CONNECT PRECISELY,
         MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE A COMMON ENDPOINT. If you simply
         move the cursor by eye, it can LOOK as if the cursor is
         positioned exactly at an endpoint, yet it can be off by as
         many as 47 internal units (on the 50% screen). The ways to be
         SURE that you are at a previously set endpoint are either to
         end up there after setting a curve (as you just did), or to
         use the endpoint selection operation, as described in
         Exercise 4.3.
           Now switch to the 300% screen for a better view of what

                                                                          10
         you're doing. You will draw only the right side of the oval
         to allow this leaflet to be attached to others in the final
         drawing. Without moving the cursor, press F1 to set the first
         endpoint of the right side of the oval. Now move the cursor,
         set the second point, move the two control points (switching
         between them by pressing F2 when necessary), and finally set
         the curve with F3. In LEAF.DRW, the coordinates of the second
         endpoint are 6444, 3828; it also has 6588, 3772 for the
         coordinates of its first control point, and 6492, 3868 for
         the coordinates of its second control point.
           Switch back to the 100% screen and press Shift 5 (on the
         numerical keypad) to center the frame on the screen. Next,
         draw the bottom curve of the stem, starting at the endpoint
         at the bottom of the stem end you just completed (the cursor
         should already be there), and ending at the leaf tip
         endpoint. Remember to use the endpoint selection operation to
         make sure that you are at the previously defined tip
         endpoint. The LEAF.DRW bottom stem curve uses first control
         point coordinates 5556, 2628, and second control point
         coordinates 1356,1668.

         EXERCISE 6. MODIFYING CURVES

         1. If you happen to make a mistake when drawing a curve, or
         decide later that a curve should be altered, you can erase or
         change the curve. To try this, press F4. The cursor moves to
         the nearest endpoint, just as if you had pressed Del. Right
         now, the cursor should already be on the tip endpoint. Select
         that endpoint by pressing Enter. One of the curves having the
         endpoint where the cursor is located becomes dashed, and a
         prompt appears. You can switch the dashing between each of
         the curves having the selected endpoint by pressing Space, +,
         or - (try it). Dash the LOWER of the curves, then press
         Enter. The curve modification menu appears. Press E (for
         "Erase"). A prompt appears asking if you're sure you want to
         erase the curve. If you answer Y, the curve is erased
         IRRETRIEVABLY. Go ahead and press Y. (If you answer with N
         (or any character except Y or y), the curve is not erased,
         and the curve modification menu will reappear.)

         2. You'll need to redraw the curve you just erased, but this
         time, press F1 to define the curve's first (upper left)
         endpoint, then use the endpoint selection operation (Del,
         then +, -, and/or Space, repeatedly if required) to move the
         cursor to where the curve's other endpoint should be (at the
         bottom of the stem oval), and press F3. This sets a straight
         line between the two endpoints, since neither control point
         was moved away from its associated endpoint. Press F4, then
         press Enter to choose the current endpoint (at the bottom of
         the stem oval), then Space to choose the straight line, and
         finally Enter to see the curve modification menu. You want to
         "Change" the line to a curve, so press C. The menu and the
         dashing go away; A CURVE WHICH CAN BE SHAPED IS NOW ON TOP OF
         THE ORIGINAL LINE. The status box says "CHANGE." Move the
         cursor with the numeric keypad number keys to shape the new
         curve; notice the dashed line still in place to show you what
         the original curve looks like. When you are changing a curve,
         you can use the F2 key to switch between control points, as
         usual. When the new curve's shape is acceptable to you, press

                                                                          11
         F3 to define the new curve. The old curve (represented by the
         dashed line) is erased.

         3. Press F4, choose the long curve again, then (at the curve
         modification menu) press L (for "Line"). A line parameter
         menu appears which allows you to change the chosen curve's
         line weight (thickness), line gray, linecap (the way the line
         ends), and line dash pattern. The top line of the menu lists
         the parameters which you can change. The second line lists
         the current values of those parameters. Press W. Now you can
         key in a new line weight value in PostScript points (1 point
         = 1/72"). Key in "20" and press Enter. Now press K (for
         "Keep") or Enter to save the new line weight, followed by Q
         to see the Quickshow screen. Notice that one of the long
         curves is now MUCH thicker than the other. Press Esc to
         return to the drawing screen.
           Press F4 again; choose the thick curve again. Press L; then
         press G. Now you can change the gray percentage of the curve.
         The gray values range from 0% (white) to 100% (black). Key in
         "50" and press Enter, then press K or Enter to save the new
         line gray. Now look at the Quickshow screen (Q). Press Esc to
         return to the drawing screen.
           Press F4 again and choose the thick curve. Press L twice.
         Now you can change the linecap (the way the line ends). The
         default linecap is "Round," and you can see on the Quickshow
         screen that the current thick curve has rounded ends. The
         other two choices are "Butt" (the cap ends at the curve end
         and is squared off) and "Square" (the linecap projects half
         the width of the curve beyond the end and is squared off).
         Try these and check the results on the Quickshow screen.
           For details on changing the dash pattern, see the user
         manual.
           You can experiment by altering the line parameters and
         checking the results with the Quickshow screen. It is
         possible to change any combination of the line parameters at
         one time before you press K for keep. If you press Esc while
         at the line parameter menu, NONE of the changed values are
         saved. Note that a white (0% line gray) curve doesn't show at
         all on the white background, but does show where it crosses
         another darker curve. While you are experimenting, change a
         line weight to -1. This changes the curve to a "construction"
         curve which shows on the drawing screen as a dotted curve,
         but doesn't show at all on the Quickshow screen or the
         PostScript output.
           When you are done experimenting, change all curves back to
         a line weight of 1, a line gray of 100 (black), and round
         linecaps.

         EXERCISE 7. CUTTING CURVES

         1. All that remains to complete your drawing's outline is
         adding the leaf edge curves. There is a potential problem
         here: each of the (two) edge curves which you will draw share
         the leaf tip endpoint, but they also need to intersect the
         stem curves (near the stem oval) where there AREN'T any
         endpoints currently. Recall that precise intersections of
         curves occur ONLY at shared endpoints. We need to ADD an
         endpoint "in the middle" (actually, nearer to the right end)
         of each of the stem curves. This can be done by "cutting"

                                                                          12
         each of the curves into two curves which are very similar to
         the parts of the original curves on both sides of the newly
         added "middle" endpoint.
           To begin the cutting operation, press F5. The cursor jumps
         to the nearest endpoint, just as if you had pressed Del.
         Select the rightmost endpoint of the upper stem side; next
         select the upper stem side by pressing + until it is dashed
         and then pressing Enter. Now you can move the cursor ALONG
         the curve with the cursor keys until the cursor reaches the
         point at which the leaf edge meets the stem (LEAF.DRW uses
         6216, 3456). You might want to press Ins to slow the cursor
         speed. Press F3 and PictureThis automatically cuts the
         original curve into two curves at the newly chosen "middle"
         endpoint. Now do the same operation for the lower stem side
         (in this case, LEAF.DRW uses coordinates 6096, 3480 for the
         new "middle" endpoint).

         2. Now complete the leaf by drawing the upper and lower leaf
         edges using the newly established endpoints. First draw the
         lower leaf curve, starting at the lower endpoint. For the
         lower leaf edge, LEAF.DRW uses 1380, 2868 and 4344, 3892 for
         the control point coordinates. Next draw the upper leaf edge,
         starting at the leaf tip. For the upper leaf edge, LEAF.DRW
         uses 6216, 1406 and 3852, 1164 for the control point
         coordinates.

         3. At this point you should save your drawing! Press F10 to
         access the file operations menu, then press S. A prompt
         appears asking if you want to save the drawing as LEAF.DRW.
         Answer with N. In response to the next prompt, key in:
         "MYLEAF.DRW" and press Enter. It should only require a few
         seconds for your drawing to be saved.

         EXERCISE 10. DRAWING BOXES AND OVALS

         1. Turn the template off by pressing T, and erase your
         drawing by pressing C followed by Y.

         2. To draw a box, move the cursor to where you want a corner
         of the box and press B (for "Box"). Now move the cursor away
         from the first corner. A box follows. When you are satisfied
         with the size of the box, press F3. The box is set, and the
         cursor returns to the initial corner. Each box made this way
         has four straight lines connected at four corner endpoints.
         You can treat each of the four straight lines as you would
         treat any other curve.

         3. To draw a square, press B at one corner of the square,
         then press S (for "Square"). Two guidelines appear, running
         through the cursor position at 45-degree angles. Move the
         cursor along one of the guidelines by pressing one of the
         "diagonal" cursor keys (7, 9, 3, or 1 on the numeric keypad).
         A square follows. You can press the cursor key diagonally
         opposite to the first one you pressed to go in the other
         direction along the same guideline. If you now want to move
         the cursor along the other guideline, you must first press
         F2. Try it. The square disappears, and the cursor moves back
         to the original corner. Now you can move along the other
         guideline with the other two diagonally opposite cursor keys.

                                                                          13
         When you are satisfied, press F3 to set the square. If the
         squares which you draw using this method don't appear to be
         true squares, you need to adjust your screen's aspect ratio
         (see the user manual).

         4. To draw a circle, press O (for "Oval") with the cursor
         positioned where you want the center of the circle. Two
         guidelines appear through the cursor position, one horizontal
         and the other vertical. Move the cursor along the horizontal
         guideline with the 4 and 6 numeric keypad keys. A circle is
         drawn, centered on the guideline cross, passing through the
         cursor. When you are satisfied with the circle, press F3, and
         the circle is set. It consists of four Bezier curves, each of
         which can each be treated as any other curve drawn in
         PictureThis. The cursor is positioned at the center of the
         circle to facilitate drawing concentric circles.
           If the circles you draw don't look like true circles, you
         need to adjust your screen's aspect ratio (see the user
         manual).

         5. To draw an oval (ellipse), press O with the cursor where
         you want the center of the oval, and start by drawing a
         circle as above. When the circle is a reasonable size, press
         F2. The cursor jumps to the top or bottom of the circle,
         where the circle crosses the vertical guideline. Now you can
         change the circle to an oval by moving the cursor up and down
         (with the 8 and 2 numeric keypad keys). You can move the
         cursor back to its previous position on the horizontal
         guideline (to change the horizontal dimension again) by
         pressing F2, and so on. When you are satisfied with the oval,
         press F3. The oval is set as four Bezier curves, and the
         cursor is positioned at the center of the oval.

         6. Draw several boxes, squares, circles, and ovals, making
         some of them overlap. Try pressing Esc at various points
         while drawing, to see what happens. (Remember that, in
         general, Esc backs out of an operation one step at a time.)

         EXERCISE 9. MODIFYING TRAILS

         1. A "trail" in PictureThis consists of one or more curves
         which are treated as associated with each other. Usually,
         trails are composed of curves continuously connected endpoint
         to endpoint. Trails can be filled with gray shades and
         combined to form "objects" which can be manipulated in other
         ways. Whenever you draw a curve it is automatically put in a
         trail. If the NEXT curve you draw has its FIRST endpoint in
         the SAME place as the previous curve's SECOND endpoint, the
         second curve is put in the same trail, and so on. When you
         drew the leaf edges in Exercise 7.2, you drew them so
         they would form a continuous trail (of two curves). The
         curves which form an oval or a box are also automatically
         placed in a trail.

         2. Now you will fill some of the boxes, circles, and ovals
         that are on your screen. To access the trail menu, press F6.
         Then press F to fill a trail. The cursor jumps to the initial
         point of one of the trails on screen (the initial point is
         the first endpoint drawn in a trail), and the trail is

                                                                          14
         dashed. Press +, Space, and - repeatedly until the trail you
         want to fill is dashed (in this case just pick any box or
         oval), and then press Enter. A prompt appears, showing the
         current gray fill percentage and asking for a new one. The
         current fill should be -1%, meaning that the selected trail
         is NOT filled (that is, it is transparent -- not the same as
         white, which is opaque to parts of the drawing beneath it;
         see below). Enter a number between 0 (white) and 100 (black).
         The screen is unchanged (since fills do not show on the
         drawing screen), so press Q to see the Quickshow screen. The
         trail you have chosen is filled with a pattern representing
         the shade of gray you have chosen. Now press Esc to return to
         the drawing  screen.
           Fill other ovals and boxes with different gray percentages,
         and check the results on the Quickshow screen. If you fill
         some overlapping trails you will notice an important property
         about PictureThis (and PostScript) fills: they are "opaque."
         If a trail overlaps another trail, and the trail "in front"
         is filled, the portions of the other trail that are "behind"
         the first trail are NOT visible on the Quickshow screen or on
         the PostScript output. Watch overlapping trails being drawn
         on the Quickshow screen. First the "behind" trail is drawn
         completely; then the "in front" trail is drawn, obscuring
         part of the "behind" trail. It is as if the "in front" trail
         is pasted over the "behind" trail. The order in which trails
         are "pasted" on the Quickshow screen (and on the PostScript
         output) initially is determined by the order in which they
         are drawn (the earliest drawn are "pasted" on first), but
         this layering can be changed easily (see Exercise 11.5).

         3. On the drawing screen, scroll your drawing so that an edge
         of the frame runs across your computer's screen (see Exercise
         3.6). Now draw a circle so it is partially within the
         frame and partially outside the frame. Fill the circle and
         press Q. Notice that only the part of the circle WITHIN the
         frame appears on the Quickshow screen. That is because the
         frame "clips" your drawing: only portions of a drawing WITHIN
         the frame show on the Quickshow screen and on the PostScript
         output. It is easy to change the size and location of the
         frame (see the user's manual).

         4. If you have many elements in a drawing, the Quickshow
         screen may take a long time to finish drawing. To stop it
         before it completes drawing, press Esc. When you press Esc a
         second time, the drawing screen reappears. Try it.

         5. Try erasing one or more trails. To do this, press F6 to
         bring up the trails menu, then press E (for "Erase"). A trail
         is dashed. Choose a trail by pressing +, -, and/or Space
         repeatedly, then press Enter. A prompt appears, asking if you
         want to erase the chosen trail. Answer Y and the entire trail
         is erased.

         6. Now you will change the line parameters of some trails.
         First press F6 to access the trails menu again; then press L.
         Choose a trail in the normal mannner. When you press Enter, a
         line menu appears. This menu is the same as the line menu for
         a single curve (see Exercise 6.3), except with an added
         parameter: the "join" of the trail, which refers to how two

                                                                          15
         curves of a trail are joined where they connect at their
         endpoints. If the second line for any of the parameters says
         "Mixed," then the curves in the chosen trail don't all have
         the same value for that parameter.
           You can change the line weight, line gray, and linecap of
         ALL the curves in the trail, just as you changed them for an
         INDIVIDUAL curve in Exercise 6.3. Try it and check your
         results with the Quickshow screen. Try changing a filled
         trail's line weight to -1 and check the Quickshow screen; you
         should see a filled area with no boundary.
           Also try changing the join for a box with thick black lines
         (say, 40 points). The three possibilities are "Mitered" (the
         default for boxes), "Rounded," and "Beveled." Look at the
         joins on the 300% screen.
           You also can change the dash pattern of ALL curves in a
         trail; see the user manual for instructions.

         7. Now return to your leaf drawing by pressing F10 and G,
         then keying in "MYLEAF.DRW" and pressing Enter. Notice that
         the current drawing is cleared before the new drawing is
         brought in. Center the frame (if it isn't centered already)
         by pressing Shift 5. Fill the trail made of the two edges of
         the leaf with some reasonable gray value (say 50%). (It was
         drawn as a continuous trail in Exercise 7.2.) If you look
         closely, you will notice that the two leaf edges do not form
         a CLOSED trail -- there is a small gap at the stem. When a
         trail that is not closed is filled, PictureThis automatically
         closes the trail by drawing a straight line of line weight -1
         (a construction line) from the last endpoint in the trail to
         the first one, and filling the resulting closed trail. In
         this case, it doesn't matter, but you usually will want to
         fill only closed trails.
           After you have filled the trail, change all the curves of
         this trail to a line weight of -1. Check your results on the
         Quickshow screen. Notice that the stem is mostly covered by
         the leaf fill pattern now; you will correct that in the next
         step.

         EXERCISE 10. DEFINING A TRAIL

           Many trails are defined automatically as you draw them, but
         sometimes you need to define a new trail of already existing
         curves. The stem of the leaf was drawn as a continuous trail,
         but since you erased one of its curves and redrew it, it is
         no longer a single trail. This gives you the opportunity to
         learn how to define trails. Press F6, then press D to start
         defining a new trail. The cursor jumps to the nearest
         endpoint (just as if you pressed Del). Move the cursor using
         +, Space, and/or - repeatedly until it is on one of the
         endpoints of the stem; press Enter. One of the curves
         emanating from the chosen endpoint is now dashed. If it is a
         stem curve, press Enter. Otherwise, press +, Space, and/or -
         repeatedly until a stem curve is dashed and then press
         Enter. The chosen curve becomes dashed-and-dotted, and the
         cursor jumps to the other end of the curve. In the same
         manner, choose the next stem curve, etc., until the cursor is
         back to the original endpoint, then press D (for "Done"). The
         new trail is now defined. A prompt appears asking for a fill
         value for the new trail; enter some reasonable value (say,

                                                                          16
         75%) CONSIDERABLY DIFFERENT from the fill value of the leaf.
         Now a prompt appears asking if you want to change the line
         parameters of all the curves in the new trail. Press Y and
         change the line weights of all the curves to -1.
           View your drawing on the Quickshow screen. Now the stem is
         again "in front of" the leaf, because the stem trail was
         defined more recently than the leaf edge trail.

         EXERCISE 11. OBJECTS AND CLIP ART

         1. You have finished drawing one leaf with filled areas, but
         the ultimate goal is to draw a compound leaf with three
         leaflets. To do this, you will group the trails of your leaf
         into an "object" which can be scaled, saved as clip art,
         copied, and otherwise manipulated. An object is a group of
         trails, smaller objects, and text blocks (see Exercise 15)
         which can be manipulated as an whole. To define your leaf as
         an object, first press F7 to access the object menu. Then
         press G (for "Group"). One of the trails on the screen is
         dashed. Press Enter to select the trail. It is dashed-and-
         dotted; the other trail is dashed. Press Enter again to
         select the second trail also. Since there are only two trails
         on the screen and you have selected them both, PictureThis
         automatically stops the selection process and groups the two
         trails into an object. If there were trails or objects on the
         screen which you shouldn't be included in the new object, you
         could select the trails/objects which you DID want to include
         (in the usual manner, with +, Space, -, and/or Enter), and
         then press D (for "Done").

         2. Your new object (the leaf) now can be scaled down to
         leaflet size, but first you should save it as clip art. To do
         this, press F10 to access the file menu, then press E (for
         "Export"). Since there is only one object on the screen, it
         is automatically selected for exporting, and you are asked
         for a file specification. Key in "LEAF.CLP" and press Enter.
         The object is saved as a clip art file.

         3. Since you have saved the object, it's safe to erase it. Do
         this by pressing F7, E, and Y. (The object automatically was
         chosen since it was the only one.) You should have a blank
         screen, so draw a large box somewhere in the middle of the
         screen and fill it, just to have something on the screen.

         4. Press F10 to access the file menu, then press I (for
         "Import"). Press Enter to see the directory, and choose
         "LEAF.CLP" to be imported. The curves of the leaf (without
         endpoints) are drawn on the screen in the positions they were
         when you saved them, and a prompt ("OK? (Y/N)") appears.
         Press Y, and the leaf is redrawn with endpoints.


                                                                          18
         5. Look at the Quickshow screen. The leaf should be in front
         of the box, probably obscuring some or all of the box
         (depending on where and how large you drew the box). When you
         import clip art, it is placed at the FRONT of the drawing.
         Let's change the layering so that the box is in front of the
         leaf. To do this, press Esc to get back to the drawing
         screen, then press F7 and L (for "Layer"). An object on the
         screen becomes dashed. Choose the box in the normal way and a
         layering menu appears. Press F to move the box to the front
         of the drawing. Check with the Quickshow screen. Now repeat
         this process, but move the box to the rear by pressing R.
         Note that trails (for example, the box) which are not part of
         objects can be treated like objects for most object
         manipulations, including erasing, layering, moving, copying,
         scaling, rotating, flipping, and inclining. (More about these
         manipulations later.)
           If there are several objects on the screen, you can move
         the chosen object "Ahead of" or "Behind" selected objects,
         thus putting it somewhere in the "middle" of the layering. To
         try this, first press F7, then U (for "Ungroup"). The leaf is
         selected automatically (it is the only object -- the box is a
         trail and cannot be ungrouped), and a prompt appears, asking
         if you want to ungroup the leaf. Press Y; the leaf now is two
         separate trails. Now the box should be at the rear, with the
         actual leaf in front of it and the stem in front of the leaf
         (check on the Quickshow screen). Try to put the stem in back
         of the leaf but in front of the box using the "Ahead" or
         "Behind" options. (There are a least two ways: F7, L, select
         the stem, B, select the leaf, D; and F7, L, select the leaf,
         A, select the stem, D.) To continue with the drawing, relayer
         so the stem is in front, and group the leaf and stem; erase
         the box.

         EXERCISE 12. MANIPULATING OBJECTS

         1. You need to scale down the leaf down so three leaflets
         fit on the screen. Press F7, then press S. The leaf is chosen
         (and dashed) automatically, since it is the only object on
         the screen. A prompt appears asking if you want to replace
         the original object. Press Y, since you want only a small
         leaflet. (If you pressed N (or any character except Y or y),
         when you completed the operation, both the original large
         leaf AND the smaller scaled leaflet would remain.) A prompt
         appears (assuming "H+" is toggled; if it is not, toggle it
         on, press Esc twice to get to the "FREE" state, then start
         this Exercise again). The prompt says "Move then F1 to set
         anchor point." The anchor point is the point around which the
         object will be scaled; it will not move when the scaling is
         complete. In this case, the upper-left tip of the leaf is an
         appropriate anchor point, so press Del, followed by +, Space,
         and/or - repeatedly until the cursor is at the tip of the
         leaf, then press F1. You are asked if you want to scale by
         cursor movement or direct entry. Press D. (To learn how to
         scale by cursor movement, see the user manual.) Next you are
         asked if you want uniform scaling (horizontal and vertical
         scaling by the same amount); press Y. At the prompt, key in
         the factor by which the leaf will be scaled: ".5" (to make
         the leaflet half as big as the original leaf); press Enter. A
         prompt about scaling line weights appears; press any key

                                                                          19
         other than Y or y to answer negatively. (See the user manual
         for more details.) A leaflet is drawn on the screen (without
         endpoints), and you are asked: "OK? (Y/N)." Answer "Y"; the
         old (large) leaf is erased, and the new leaflet is drawn with
         endpoints. You might notice some "garbage" on the screen;
         this doesn't affect the PostScript output, but if it bothers
         you, press D to redraw the screen without the unwanted dots.

         2. Two more leaflets are needed. To make copies of the
         leaflet now on the screen, begin by pressing F7, then C. The
         leaflet is selected and dashed automatically, since it is the
         only object on the screen. A prompt appears: "Move then F1 to
         set start point." The cursor should be at the endpoint where
         the lower section of the leaf joins the stem, which makes an
         appropriate start point, so just press F1. Another prompt
         appears: "Move then F3 to set finish point." Move the cursor
         to the right with the cursor key 6 until it is at about 5046,
         2228. A dotted line follows from the start point. Press F3. A
         copy of the leaflet appears (without endpoints) at the new
         location. (Notice that the start point of the original
         leaflet is copied to the finish point, with the rest of the
         leaflet copied around it; this allows for precise placement
         of any part of an object.) A prompt asks if the copy is
         "OK?"; press Y. Another prompt asks if you want to copy
         again; press Y again. Now make a second copy of the leaflet.
         The start point remains the same; a dotted line connects it
         to the cursor. Move the cursor to a new finish point
         (approximately 4566, 3188); press F3 and another leaflet
         appears. Answer Y to the "OK?" prompt, but N to the "Again?"
         prompt.

         3. You now have three leaflets, but they are not oriented
         correctly for joining together to make a leaf. To orient
         them correctly, start by "flipping" the upper-right leaflet.
         To do this, press F7, then F. Now you must ACTIVELY choose
         the upper-right leaflet, since there are three objects on the
         screen; do so in the normal manner. Answer Y to the prompt
         about replacing the original object. Another prompt appears:
         "Move then F1 to set first flipline point." Press F1 at the
         current cursor position (the cursor should be where the lower
         part of the leaf joins the stem). Another prompt appears:
         "Move then F3 to set second flipline point." Move the cursor
         to the tip of the leaflet (a dotted line follows) and press
         F3. A mirror image of the leaflet, flipped over the dotted
         line, appears (without endpoints), and you see the "OK?"
         prompt (which you should answer by pressing Y).

         4. Next, the upper-right and lower leaflets must be rotated
         so they can be attached to the stem of the original leaflet.
         Press F7, then press R. Select the upper-right leaflet and
         answer Y to the "Replace original object?" prompt. A prompt
         appears: "Move then F1 to set anchor point." The anchor point
         for rotation is the point about which the object will be
         rotated; it does not move during the rotation. In this case,
         the anchor point should be at the lowest endpoint of the
         stem. Move the cursor there and press F1. Choose whether to
         enter a rotation angle by cursor movement or direct entry; in
         this case, press C to choose cursor movement. (See the user
         manual for details on how to rotate by direct entry.) A new

                                                                          20
         prompt appears: "Move then F2 to set 0 degree direction."
         Move the cursor near the tip of the upper-right leaflet,
         press Del to get exactly to the endpoint, and press F2. A
         solid line will have followed from the anchor point; the
         angle of rotation is measured at the anchor point from this
         line. A final prompt appears: "Move then F3 to set rotation
         angle." Move the cursor to the right. A dotted line is drawn
         from the anchor point to the cursor. Press P to turn on the
         relative position box (see Exercise 4.4). When you are
         rotating an object, the relative position box shows the
         rotation angle (the angle between the solid and dotted line).
         Move the cursor until the angle is about 83 degrees, then
         press F3. A rotated leaflet (without endpoints) and the "OK?"
         prompt appear; answer the prompt with Y, and the rotation
         operation is complete. Similarly, rotate the lower leaf by
         about -50 degrees about the lowest stem endpoint. (Note that
         in PictureThis, angles are positive in the clockwise
         direction.)

         EXERCISE 13. CONNECTING CURVES SMOOTHLY

         1. Now you need to extend the original (middle) leaflet's
         stem. Since the stem is small, it is easier to work on the
         300% screen; first move the cursor to about 4740, 3084, then
         press + to zoom to the 300% screen, centered on the cursor.
         Turn the relative position box off and the current position
         box on by pressing P twice, so you can see the most important
         areas of the screen.

         2. The stem extension should look like a continuation of the
         stem, so the curves making up the extension should have line
         weight -1 (that is, they should be construction curves), the
         same as the curves making up the stem. We could draw them as
         regular curves and then change their weight to -1 later, but
         it's easier to change the current "default" line weight and
         draw them as construction curves in the first place. To do
         this, begin by pressing L. A line parameter menu just like
         the one for trails appears. The only difference is that the
         state in the status box reads "NEWLNS" rather than "TRLNS" as
         it for trails. The current values of the line parameters are
         on the second line of the menu. These values are assigned to
         all newly drawn curves. The line parameters of previously
         drawn curves are NOT changed if the values are changed. You
         can change any of these line parameters, just as you can
         change the line parameters of an individual curve or trail.
         Change the current line weight to -1. All curves drawn from
         now until you change the current line weight again are
         construction curves.

         3. The new stem extension should connect smoothly with the
         stem already there. This is easy to do using the built-in
         smoothing capability of PictureThis. To begin drawing the
         stem extension, first move the cursor to the upper stem end
         and press F1 to start a new curve. Now press S to indicate
         that you want to connect the new curve smoothly (tangent at
         the shared endpoint) with an existing curve. One of the
         curves emanating from the endpoint is dashed; cause the side
         (long) curve of the stem to be dashed by pressing +, Space,
         and/or - as necessary, then press Enter. A guideline through

                                                                          21
         the endpoint and TANGENT to the side of the stem appears.
         Move the cursor to the other end of the curve (at about 5252,
         3540); press F1. Press F2 to jump the cursor back to the
         first control point, then move the cursor. It is constrained
         to move ALONG the guideline. Since the cursor moves ONLY
         along the guideline (which is tangent to the existing curve),
         the two curves join smoothly at the endpoint, and in the
         PostScript output they appear to be one continuous curve. Set
         the first control point at about 3936, 2584. Set the second
         control point at approximately 5060, 3460 (in the normal
         manner -- the second control point is NOT constrained by a
         guideline). Press F3 to establish the curve; the guideline
         disappears.

         4. When you are drawing a continuous curve by connecting
         several sequentially drawn curves smoothly, it is desirable
         to smooth at EVERY successive endpoint. You can do this by
         pressing A (for "Automatic smoothing"). Notice that the "A"
         at the left side of the status box now is followed by a "+"
         instead of a " ." This means that automatic smoothing is
         toggled on. Your cursor still should be at the second
         endpoint of the curve which you just drew. Press F1 to start
         the next curve. A tangent guideline automatically appears
         tangent to the last curve drawn. Now move the cursor to about
         5204, 3612; press F1.
           If you find the screen too crowded with guidelines, you can
         make them invisible by pressing E (for "Erase"). All types of
         guidelines (for smoothing, ovals, and squares) become
         invisible, but the cursor still moves along the invisible
         guidelines. You can toggle the guidelines back on by pressing
         E again. The "E" in the status box is followed by a "+" if
         the guidelines are invisible, by a "-" if they are visible.
           Finish the curve by placing the first control point
         (smoothed) at about 5288, 3560, the second control point (not
         smoothed) at about 5276, 3636, and pressing F3.
           Now press F1 again; since automatic smoothing is on, a
         tangent guideline appears (only momentarily if guidelines are
         toggled off). Move the cursor to the original stem's lower
         endpoint and press F1, followed by S, and choose the stem's
         side (lower) curve to smooth by. You now are smoothing on
         both ends of the curve. The control points should be set to
         about 4888, 3512 and 3832, 2560 (or whatever gives a good
         looking stem -- but be sure to move each control point at
         least a little way from its associated endpoint, or the
         curves won't join smoothly).

         5. Fill the trail which you just made (the stem extension)
         with the same gray percentage you used for the original stem
         (75% was suggested). Look at your drawing on the Quickshow
         screen at 300%, then zoom down to the 100% screen. The stem
         should appear smooth (within the limitations of the screen
         representation).

         EXERCISE 14. MOVING OBJECTS

         1. You now need to move the two side leaflets so their stems
         intersect the main stem realistically. You could cut the
         curves which form the main stem and then (after moving the
         side leaflets to approximately the correct positions) extend

                                                                          22
         their stem ends to meet those cut points, but that isn't
         necessary in this case. It's easier to move the stem ends of
         the leaflets so they completely overlap the main stem. Since
         they are all filled with the same gray and are not outlined,
         they will look fine on the PostScript output this way. Move
         the cursor to about 4452, 2820 and zoom up to the 300%
         screen. All of the stem ends should be visible.

         2. To move the bottom leaflet, press F7, then M, select the
         leaflet, and move the cursor to the lower endpoint of its
         stem end and press F1 for the start point. Now move the
         cursor to about 3956, 2632. Press F3 for the finish point.
         Watch closely as the new stem end is drawn; does it
         completely overlap the main stem and not stick out the other
         side? If it looks good, answer Y to the "OK?" prompt. (If it
         doesn't, answer N and move the finish point a little.) Move
         the other leaflet similarly, by setting the right endpoint of
         its stem end to the start point and moving the cursor to
         about 3986, 2626 for the finish point. Check your work on the
         Quickshow screen at both 300% and 100%. Your drawing of a
         poison ivy leaf is complete. (Of course, it isn't quite
         botanically correct, because we kept the drawing simple for
         purposes of this tutorial.)

         3. Before you add text to the drawing, you should group the
         three leaflets and the main stem into an object and save it
         as clip art (see Exercise 11). You also should save your work
         as a drawing periodically (see Exercise 7.3), and now is a
         good time to do it. If you are adventurous, you might want to
         scale down the leaf (with three leaflets) and combine several
         of them with some stems to make a whole poison ivy vine! The
         scaled-down leaves might not look very precise on the drawing
         screen or Quickshow screen, but they should look fine on the
         PostScript output. (In general, if you want something small,
         first draw it big, and then scale it down; very little
         accuracy is lost. Or you can draw a small object on the 600%,
         1200%, or 2400% screens.)

         EXERCISE 15. ADDING TEXT

         1. Now you are going to add some text to your poison ivy
         drawing. First, you'll label some of the parts. Move the
         cursor to about 3054, 595; press F8. The text menu appears.
         To enter text, you need to specify point size (size of the
         text characters; 72 (PostScript) points = 1"), a font number
         (typeface), line spacing (distance between successive lines
         of text), justification (positioning of text on the page),
         and gray value (0% -- white -- to 100% -- black). All of
         these text parameters have default values (note that the
         default value for font number is 0, an invalid number, and
         it MUST be changed to a valid number before text can be
         entered), as shown on the second line of the menu. Press P to
         see the parameters menu. Press F to choose a new font. A
         prompt appears asking for a font number. Fonts are numbered
         from 1 to 9999. Press ? to see a help screen giving
         previously assigned numbers for the 35 PostScript fonts found
         in most PostScript-compatible laser printers. Right now,
         you'll be using Times-Roman, font number 91 on the chart.
         Press any key to return to the font number prompt, then key

                                                                          23
         in "91" and press Enter. PictureThis searches for the
         specified font's information files in the current directory,
         and then in the \FONTS subdirectory (if it exists) of the
         current directory. If the font information files aren't
         found, you are asked to key in a new directory. You CANNOT
         use a font unless its information files have been read. Back
         at the text parameters menu, press P to change the point
         size. At the prompt, key in "20"; press Enter. When you
         change the point size, the line spacing automatically is set
         to 120% of the point size (in this case 24 points), but it
         can be reset independently. The rest of the parameter
         defaults are fine for now (position justification and 100%
         (black) text), so press K (or Enter) to keep these
         parameters.
           Back at the text menu, press E to edit. The drawing screen
         is replaced by a full-screen editing screen. This is a
         "counting editor" with many features tailored to technical
         typesetting, but in most cases you can use it like a
         conventional text editor. The bottom line gives brief
         descriptions of the active function keys. The top line gives
         information about how your text will appear on the drawing
         screen, but it can be ignored for now. (You can press F1 to
         see an editing help screen.) For now, key in the single word
         "leaflet" on the first line of the editing screen; you can
         use the cursor, BackSpace, and/or Del keys to help correct
         mistakes. Next, press F5; this "sets" the text in the editor
         onto the drawing screen. The drawing screen reappears as you
         last saw it, and the word "leaflet" appears, beginning at the
         cursor position. (This assumes that the screen font file,
         STANDARD.SFT, is in the current or \FONTS directory. If it
         isn't, you're asked for a new directory.) Notice that the
         cursor is at the BASELINE of the word (where the characters
         "rest"). You have just set your first PictureThis "text
         block" (that is, the text on the screen which results from
         pressing F5 when in the editor).
           Now move the cursor to about 3534, 3475 and press F8 TWICE;
         (this is a short cut into the editor when the current text
         parameters are as desired). Type the word "rachis" (that's
         the technical term for the stem to which the leaflets of a
         compound leaf are attached), and press F5. This second label
         appears at the current cursor position.
           Next you need to draw pointers from the labels to the parts
         they label. Change the line weight for subsequently drawn
         curves to .5 points (see Exercise 13.2). To move the cursor
         to the BEGINNING of each text block in turn, press Tab, then
         proceed as for endpoint selection: press + (or Space) and/or
         - to cycle repeatedly to cycle around the text blocks. If you
         press Shift Tab and then + (or Space) and/or - repeatedly,
         the cursor goes to the END of each text block in turn. Try
         both. Now draw a line from the the beginning of the word
         "leaflet" to the left leaflet. Endpoints of about 3366, 667
         and 4038, 1339 are appropriate. Next, draw a line from the
         word "rachis" to the stem. Try endpoints at about 3822, 3307
         and 4062, 2707.
           Text blocks can be treated as objects or grouped as parts
         of objects, for manipulation in any of the ways in which non-
         text objects can be manipulated (moving, copying, scaling,
         rotating, saving as clip art, etc.). They even can be edited
         AFTER they have been manipulated. See the user manual for

                                                                          24
         more details.

         2. Now, make a title for your drawing. You will "center" the
         title text in a "margin." Margins are boxes in which text
         blocks set from the editor are placed. The current margin is
         the default one, which is at the same position as the default
         frame. This default margin is fine for now. Move the cursor
         to the left of the margin by pressing Ctrl L. (The cursor
         also can be moved to the right, top, and bottom of the
         current margin by pressing Ctrl R, Ctrl T, and Ctrl B,
         respectively. Try it.) Move the cursor to about 0, 4344.
         Press F8, then P. Change the font to "93" (Times-Bold) and
         the point size to "50"; then press J followed by C to change
         the justification to centered. Press K (or Enter) to keep the
         new text parameters and return to the text menu. Press E (or
         F8 or Enter, whichever it most convenient) to get into the
         editor. Key in "Poison Ivy"; press F5. The words "Poison Ivy"
         appear at the VERTICAL position of the cursor, centered
         between the left and right sides of the margin. Notice that
         the characters are drawn twice (the second time slightly
         displaced up and right from the first), to indicate that they
         are "bold" (note: "italic" characters are shown slanted).
         PictureThis uses the same screen font to show characters of
         all standard PostScript fonts, so each on-screen character's
         FORM isn't much like it will appear in the PostScript output,
         but each character is shown with quite accurate PLACEMENT,
         WIDTH, and HEIGHT.) View your drawing on the Quickshow
         screen, then save it.

         3. To finish the illustration, a technical description of
         poison ivy will be added. First draw a box to contain the
         description. Place its corners at (exactly, please!) 5502,
         4776 and 7656, 3144. (Use the I key to switch to a cursor
         speed of 1 iu per key press when necessary.) You now need to
         make a new margin within the box, to contain the text. First
         press F8. Now press M (for "Margin"). Draw the new margin as
         you would draw a box: go to one corner (5646, 3624) and press
         F1; move the cursor to the other corner by pressing Ctrl PgDn
         (to go to the lower right corner of the frame, which also is
         the lower right corner of the box just drawn) and then moving
         back a little to 7512, 4656. Press F3 to set the second
         corner of the new margin box. Notice that the margin is a
         little smaller than the box; that's so the text won't go all
         the way to the edges of the box. The new margin looks like a
         box of a different color, with no endpoints at its corners.
         Press F8 again, then +, Space, and/or -; this allows you to
         cycle through the margins previously defined (two in this
         case: the default and the one you just made); stop with the
         new margin showing (to make it the current margin), and press
         Esc to return to the "FREE" state.
           Since the box is such a small part of the screen, it will
         be easier to work at the 300% level. Move the cursor near the
         center of the box (about 6558, 3912); press +. Before
         entering the text, the cursor must be at the proper position;
         move it to 5646, 3360. Press F8 to see the text menu. The
         text parameters need to be changed again; change the font to
         font 91 (Times-Roman), the point size to 10, and the
         justification to full. (Full justification means that the
         text lines up vertically both on the left side of the margin

                                                                          25
         and on the right side of the margin; this is accomplished by
         adding extra space as needed between words.) Try a short cut
         into the editor by pressing Enter twice. (Enter can serve as
         a substitute for K (for "Keep"), as well as a substitute for
         E (for "Edit" in the text menu.) Font 91 will be the main
         font for the description, but the first two words actually
         need to appear in Times-Bold, font 93. You could do this by
         changing the font in the text parameter menu and making two
         text blocks (one would consist of the first two words in
         bold, the other the rest of the text in roman), but it is
         easier to change the font for a few words in a text block by
         using typesetting codes in the block. To start a typesetting
         code, press Ctrl A. A left pointing triangle, signifying
         "typesetting code begins," appears where the edit cursor was.
         Now key in "ft93"; this code means change to font number 93.
         End the typesetting code by pressing Ctrl Z (a right pointing
         triangle ends the code). Key in "Rhus toxicodendron." (This
         is the scientific name for poison ivy). To switch back to the
         Times-Roman font, press Ctrl A; key in "ftp"; press Ctrl Z;
         code means switch back to the previous font (in this case,
         font 91). The top status line says (among other things!)
         "FT91"; move the cursor back into the middle of "Rhus
         toxicodendron" and the status line says "FT93"; it also gives
         the current (that is, at the current cursor position) point
         size ("PT10"), justification ("JF"), text gray percentage
         ("GR100"), and line spacing in points ("LS12"). The remaining
         numbers tell how much space within the current margin box
         (both vertically and horizontally) have been used and remain
         to be used, with the cursor at its current position. All of
         this status line information can be quite useful when you are
         entering complicated text, but it can be ignored most of the
         time (including right now). Move the cursor to the end of the
         current line by pressing the End key on the numeric key pad,
         and key in a single space, followed by the following
         paragraph (DON'T press Enter until you're done!):

             Suberect and bushy, scrambling over fences, walls,
             etc., or in woods climbing by rootlets to
             considerable heights. Leaves pinnately 3-foliolate;
             berries whitish or cream-colored, 5-6 mm. in
             diameter. Abundant in hedgerows, thickets, and
             woods. To many persons, poisonous to the touch.

         End the text with an Enter. This prevents the last line from
         being fully justified. You will have noticed that the text
         automatically wrapped long before it reached the end of the
         editor line. It wraps when the margin line is full. Look over
         your text and correct any errors. (Check the editor help
         screen by pressing F1 to see the functions of various keys,
         if you want.) When you are satisfied, press F5 to set the
         text. The paragraph you typed in appears on the drawing
         screen.
           You'll notice that the spaces between the words in the
         fourth line are rather large. This isn't desirable, so you
         need to edit the paragraph. To do this, you need to "cut" the
         text block back to the editor for re-editing. First press Tab
         to make sure the cursor is at the beginning of the text
         block; then press F8, followed by C (for "Cut"). The menu box
         disappears, the text block is dashed, and an information

                                                                          26
         block about the dashed text block appears at the bottom of
         the screen. Press Enter to select the text block. (You could
         choose other text blocks, EVEN THOSE OFF THE SCREEN, by
         cycling through them, using the +, Space, and/or - keys.) The
         text block is erased, and the text menu reappears. The text
         block isn't lost, it's in the editor. Go into the editor (by
         pressing E, Enter, or F8) to edit the text block. The spaces
         in the fourth line were exceptionally large because the word
         "considerable" is too long to fit on that line. This can be
         remedied by hyphenation. PictureThis does NOT have automatic
         hyphenation (it would require too much memory!), so you must
         do it yourself. Key in a hyphen ("-") FOLLOWED BY A SPACE
         after the "consider", so it looks like "consider- able." Now
         press F3 to "compose" the text. Composing recalculates where
         the text wrapping must occur for each of the lines in the
         editor. You should compose whenever you have made changes to
         the text, so you can see the correct wrapping. Now press F5
         to set the text block. Now the spaces between the words in
         the seventh line are a little large. If you want, you can cut
         the text block back to the editor again, change "diameter" to
         "dia- meter," and then set the text. With experience, you
         won't need to look at the text on the screen each time to
         decide where to hyphenate; in the editor, if a long word
         wraps when you are in the middle of it, you can insert a
         hyphen right there and then.
           Cutting can be very useful. You can cut the text back to
         the editor to correct errors, to change any of the text
         parameters (point size, font, justification, etc.), to change
         the position of the text (i.e., screen cursor position), or
         to change the margin. Try it. You particularly might want to
         see what changing the justification to right, centered, and
         left (without changing anything else) does to the text.
           Go to the 100% screen by pressing -; center the screen by
         pressing Shift 5; then IMMEDIATELY press Q to see the
         Quickshow screen. Notice that you DON'T have to wait until
         the screen is completely drawn to scroll, zoom, Quickshow, or
         view. The drawing stops where it is and begins anew on the
         just specified screen. If you find that the drawing takes too
         long to redraw because of the text, press J (for "Jabber");
         the screen redraws with the text "greeked," that is, with
         just baselines and ascender (along the tops of letters) lines
         are shown, instead of the individual characters. The
         Quickshow screen also shows greeked text. If you press J
         again, the text is greeked on the drawing screen, but
         individual characters show on the Quickshow screen. Pressing
         J a third time returns to showing individual characters on
         both the drawing and Quickshow screens.

         4.  Your drawing is complete, so save it (see Exercise 7.3).
         (A drawing previously completed using this tutorial is named
         PIVY.DRW on one of the distribution disks.) Also save your
         work as an Encapsulated PostScript file. See the user manual
         for the many ways you can modify your drawing's final output
         (including scaling from tiny to huge, changing the page
         orientation, and/or moving the drawing's position on the
         page(s)).

         5. Deliver your resulting EPS file(s) to a laser printer or
         imagesetter. How you do this depends on the particulars of

                                                                          27
         your situation. Consult laser printer user manuals or
         typesetting service bureau personnel, as appropriate.
         Encapsulated PostScript files produced by PictureThis also
         can be imported into many page layout programs.

         EXERCISE 16. KARTOONS MODE

         1. Kartoons mode allows -- as they say -- "kids of all ages"
         to make an unlimited variety of cartoon faces very easily. It
         was our 10-year-old son's idea (and he and his 7-year-old
         brother contributed some of the Kartoons artwork included on
         one of the distribution disks); but we enjoy 'tooning around
         at least as much as he does!
           To enter Kartoons mode, press K. (If there's a already a
         regular-mode drawing, you're asked whether you really want to
         clear it and enter Kartoons mode, and if the Kartoons part
         files (!FOREHD.1, !NOSE.5, etc.) aren't in the current
         directory, you're asked for a new directory.) A face appears
         on the screen in parts, forehead first, then ears, chin,
         eyebrows, eyes, and nose. We call him "Joe"; see what he
         looks like on the Quickshow screen by pressing Q, then press
         Esc to get back to the drawing screen. Notice that there is a
         box drawn around the forehead. This indicates that the
         forehead is the current part. Press U (for "Use part"); the
         current forehead is erased and a new one appears. You can
         cycle through all the possible foreheads (that is, those with
         part files) by pressing U, +, or Space (for the "forward"
         direction), or - (for the "backward" direction) repeatedly.
         When you find a forehead you like, press Enter to keep that
         forehead. Now press K (for "Khoose block"). The box moves to
         the left ear. Continue pressing K (or +, Space, and/or -) to
         cycle through the different parts. Stop at a box by pressing
         U to start cycling through the parts for that box. You can
         make a huge number of unique faces just using the supplied
         parts! Look at some faces on the Quickshow screen.

         2. If you find a face you'd like to have easily accessible
         in the future, you can save it as a face file. Press F10 and
         then P (for "PutFAC"). You're asked for a filename. We
         recommend that you use the extension .FAC.
           You can retrieve this face, or any of several included on
         the distribution disk. To do this, press F10 to see the file
         menu, then press G (for "GetFAC"). Press Enter to see the
         filenames of all the face files in the current directory.
         Choose one with the block cursor; press Enter; the current
         face is replaced by the one you selected. You can use K and U
         to change the new face, too.

         3. You can make your own part files. Our sons made many of
         those on one of the distribution disks -- can you top those?
         It's fun to try, and an excellent way to practice many of the
         PictureThis operations. Part files actually are just
         specially named clip art files, so they can be objects,
         trails, and/or text blocks. You can use nearly all of the
         normal PictureThis operations in Kartoons mode; the only ones
         which you can't use are getting a drawing (you can get a face
         instead) and plotting data (see Exercise 17).
           Pressing C clears the face and returns you to normal
         drawing mode (after a prompt). (If at any time you get a

                                                                          28
         message saying you're almost out of memory, press C to clear,
         then K, and you're back in Kartoons mode with the same face,
         and more free memory.)
           Return to Kartoons mode, if necessary. To make a new pair
         of eyebrows, press K until the current block is around the
         left eyebrow. Erase the current left eyebrow by pressing F7
         and E, choosing the eyebrow object in the normal manner, then
         pressing Enter and answering Y to the prompt. Now draw a new
         eyebrow in the general area of the current block. It can be a
         single curve, a filled trail, or a number of trails. (It
         DOESN'T need to be in the current box, but it probably will
         fit in with other parts better if it is.) Check it on the
         Quickshow screen, to make sure the line weight, etc., is
         reasonable. If the eyebrow is made of more than one trail,
         group the trails (see Exercise 11.1). Press Y (for "Yes save
         part"). Choose the eyebrow in the normal manner (it should be
         dashed) and press Enter; the eyebrow which you drew is added
         to the left eyebrow part files; now it can be retrieved in
         the usual manner, using U. You also should make a mirror-
         image right eyebrow. To do this, press K one time to change
         the current block to the right eyebrow; erase the current
         right eyebrow; flip the left eyebrow over a vertical center
         line (see Exercise 12.3); press Y and choose the new right
         eyebrow to save. Of course, you don't have to erase a current
         part object to make a new part. You can add to or change an
         existing part, group it as an object, and save the new object
         as a part file.

         EXERCISE 17. PLOTTING DATA FROM A FILE

         1. PictureThis allows numerical data from a file to be
         plotted automatically in a two-dimensional graph. A simple
         sample data file TEST1.DAT is on one of the distribution
         disks. It consists of some comments and eleven lines of data
         with two numbers in each, the first being the line number (0
         through 10) and the second being the first number squared
         (0,1,4,9,16,...,100), thus making two columns. (See the user
         manual for acceptable formats for data file; files produced
         by many spreadsheet and scientific programs can be used with
         few or no changes.)
           Before you start, make sure you're in the regular drawing
         mode (not Kartoons), and toggle on the status box and "H+";
         make sure that the default frame is the current one (F, Y),
         and change the current units to inches (F9, U, I, Enter; see
         the user manual for more details), and turn the position box
         on if it isn't on already. The position box now measures in
         inches from the top left corner of the (default) frame. Set
         the line weight to .25 points (L, W, ".25," Enter).
           To plot the data in TEST1.DAT, begin by pressing F10 to see
         the file menu. Then press U (for "UseDAT"); you will be asked
         for the data file's file specification, so key in "TEST1.DAT"
         (prfaced by its path, if it isn't in the current directory).
         You're asked for the x field (x means horizontal, field means
         (more or less) the column number), press Enter to accept the
         default field 1. You're then asked for the y (vertical)
         field; press Enter to accept the default field 2. PictureThis
         then reads the data file and reports how many pairs (one
         number of each pair in the first field of each line and the
         other number of each pair in the second field of each line)

                                                                          29
         are in the file, and how many data points can be plotted with
         the current memory available. You are asked for the 1st pair
         to plot; press Enter to accept the default (pair 1, on the
         first (non-comment) line of the file). Another prompt appears
         asking if you want to plot EVERY pair, every 2ND pair, or
         every 3RD pair, etc.; press Enter to accept the default
         (every pair). You then are asked how many points to plot;
         press Enter to accept 11 (the total number of pairs in
         TEST1.DAT).
           Now you need to define the limits of plotting. All data
         points which fall outside the boundary you define (by
         specifying its lower-left and upper-right corners) are NOT
         plotted. A prompt appears telling you to move the cursor to
         xlow, ylow (defining the lower-left corner of the boundary)
         and press F3; move the cursor to about 1.0, 4.5; press F3. A
         prompt shows the minimum value of x in the file and asks you
         to enter XLOW (the value of x at the plot boundary's lower-
         left corner); press Enter to accept 0. Similarly, press Enter
         at the next prompt to accept 0 for YLOW (the value of y at
         the plot boundary's upper-left corner). You see a prompt
         telling you to move the cursor to xhigh, yhigh (defining the
         upper-right corner of the boundary). Move the cursor to
         about 7.0, 1.0; press F3. Press "Enter" twice to accept the
         default values of XHIGH (10) and YHIGH (100). PictureThis
         automatically scales the data points between xlow, ylow and
         xhigh, yhigh. Finally, you can choose whether to plot dots or
         lines; in this case, press L to plot lines. The file is read;
         a graph is plotted between xlow, ylow and xhigh, yhigh; and
         you are shown how many data pairs were plotted, as well as
         the number of the last pair plotted. Press a key to continue.

         2. Import the clip art file AXIS.CLP included on one of the
         distribution disks. As you can see, this consists of labeled
         horizontal and vertical axes for the graph. It was made by
         importing SCALE.CLP (also on a distribution disk), scaling it
         larger for the horizontal axis, rotating, flipping, and
         scaling smaller for the vertical axis, and adding appropriate
         labels. You can try all that for practice if you want.

         3. To highlight the graph's data points, a small object can
         be copied to each endpoint on the curve. PictureThis allows
         multicopying of an object to every, or selected, endpoints of
         a trail. To do this, first import the clip art file
         GRAPHBOX.CLP. This is a small white-filled box. Move the
         cursor to near the bottom left of the drawing, then press
         F6 to see the trails menu, followed by O (for "Object to
         Endpoints"). Now you must select a trail; choose the trail
         which was plotted (+ or -) and press Enter. Now select the
         small square as the object to copy, and press Enter. A prompt
         appears asking you to move the cursor to the start point of
         the object and press F3 (the start point is the point which
         will be copied directly over each endpoint); move the cursor
         close to 2.0, 3.0 (the center of the clip-art box) and press
         F3. You're asked if you want to copy to ALL endpoints of the
         trail; answer Y. The small box automatically is copied to
         all of the endpoints. This multicopying ability is useful not
         only for data plots; it can make interesting designs quickly.
         Erase the original box, since it is no longer needed.

                                                                          30
         4. Finally, the graph needs a label. Move the cursor to
         approximately 2.3, 1.9. Press F8. Press P to change the
         parameters; set the point size to 30, and make sure that the
         font is 91, and that the justification is position. Press
         Enter twice to get into the editor. Now key in: "y =
         x<spo>2<spx>" (with the "<'s" and ">'s" replaced by Ctrl A
         and Ctrl Z, respectively). (The "spo" typesetting code means
         start a superscript; the "spx" code means end a superscript.
         The superscript text (in this case a "2") is made smaller and
         moved up to form a superscript. The text returns to normal
         with the "spx" code. Similar codes ("sbo" and "sbx") work for
         subscripts. Subscripts and superscripts can be nested.) Press
         F5 to set the text. If you are satisfied, your data plot
         drawing is complete. Save it as both DRW and EPS files, and
         print the EPS file if you want. Exit from PictureThis by
         pressing Esc and Y.

         EXERCISE 18. CAPTURING SCREENS FOR USE AS TEMPLATES

         1. To install the memory-resident CaptureThis program used
         for capturing screens, with CAPTHIS.COM in the current
         directory, key in "CAPTHIS" and press Enter.
           A message noting that CaptureThis has been installed should
         appear, and the DOS prompt should return.
           Now run PictureThis. If you get an "OUT OF MEMORY" error
         message, your computer doesn't have enough memory to run
         PictureThis with CaptureThis installed. If you have other
         memory-resident programs installed, remove them or reboot
         without them and try again. If you still cannot install
         CaptureThis and then run PictureThis, you should try
         capturing a screen using CaptureThis from a CGA graphics
         program that needs less memory than does PictureThis, or you
         should try Alternate CaptureThis with PictureThis (see
         below).
           As soon as the title screen is completely displayed (when
         it says "PictureThis" in script), press Shift PrtSc. After
         these keys are pressed, CaptureThis checks your computer's
         BIOS to determine the current video mode; if, according to
         the BIOS, the mode is CGA text, NOT CGA graphics, then a
         warning message appears at the top of the screen: "NOT CGA
         GRAPHICS! Try Capture? (Y/N)"/"ESC to exit." This should NOT
         happen unless you pressed Shift PrtSc too late -- when the
         copyright/ordering information screen (in text mode) is
         displayed. If you DO see this message, press Esc. Exit from
         PictureThis and then try again. Occasionally, an applications
         program programs the video controller chip directly for CGA
         graphics, but fails to update the BIOS; if the screen looks
         like CGA graphics even though CaptureThis has determined
         (from the BIOS) that it DOESN'T seem to be, you could still
         try to capture the screen in a template file for importing
         into PictureThis by pressing Y. Then you would respond to the
         prompts which follow. We recommend that you use the extension
         ".TMP" for template files. If the captured screen isn't CGA
         graphics, its file will produce "garbage" when imported into
         PictureThis.
           Or, if you wanted a normal screen dump to a printer, you
         would press N. Caution: If a printer is not connected, or if
         it is turned off, your computer might hang up. For a graphics
         mode screen dump, you must have installed a memory-resident

                                                                          31
         graphics printer driver program appropriate for the graphics
         mode (such as GRAPHICS.COM, supplied with PC-DOS for dumps of
         CGA graphics screens to IBM-compatible dot matrix printers)
         PRIOR to installing CaptureThis.
           Alternatively, to proceed WITHOUT capturing or dumping the
         screen, you would press Esc.
           If, according to the BIOS, the current video mode IS CGA
         graphics, a different message appears: "Perform Screen
         Capture? (Y/N)"/"ESC to exit." This is the message you should
         be seeing now. To capture the screen in a template file for
         importing into PictureThis, press Y. Now key in "PTTITLE.TMP"
         and press Enter. Directory specifications can be used for
         files (this might be necessary, to write the file on a
         different disk, if you get a "disk full" error message). Each
         template file takes about 16 KB. Again, we recommend that you
         use the extension ".TMP" for template files.
           If, instead, you wanted a normal screen dump to a printer,
         you would press N. Caution: If your printer is not connected,
         or if it is turned off, the computer may hang up. For a CGA
         graphics screen dump, you must have installed an appropriate
         memory-resident graphics printer driver program (such as
         GRAPHICS.COM, supplied with PC-DOS for screen dumps to IBM-
         compatible dot matrix printers) PRIOR to installing
         CaptureThis.
           Alternatively, to proceed without capturing or dumping the
         screen, you would have pressed Esc.
           If CaptureThis doesn't work correctly with your computer
         (an example is the Zenith Z-100 running ZPC) or with
         particular programs (examples are those which "take over" the
         keyboard), you should try the Alternate CaptureThis program
         instead. Once installed, this program doesn't require any
         keyboard input other than Shift PrtSc to capture CGA graphics
         mode screens, and thus will work even with programs which
         "take over" the keyboard (unless they take over the Print
         Screen interrupt; to date, we've found only one program that
         does this: The Newsroom Pro).
           To install Alternate CaptureThis, reboot your computer;
         then, at the DOS prompt corresponding to the drive containing
         the disk with ACAPTHIS.COM, key in "ACAPTHIS"; then press
         Enter. A message noting that Alternate CaptureThis has been
         installed should appear, and the DOS prompt should return.
           Now run PictureThis. As soon as the title screen is
         completely displayed (when it says "PictureThis" in script),
         press Shift PrtSc. If Alternate CaptureThis determines (from
         your computer's BIOS) that the current video mode is NOT CGA
         graphics, it performs a normal screen dump to a printer. This
         should NOT happen unless you pressed Shift PrtSc too late --
         when the copyright/ordering information screen (in text mode)
         is displayed. Caution: If a printer is not connected, or if
         it is turned off, your computer might hang up. For a graphics
         screen dump, you must have installed a memory-resident
         graphics printer driver program appropriate for the non-CGA
         graphics mode PRIOR to installing Alternate CaptureThis. If
         you get a normal screen dump, or your computer hangs up, try
         again.
           If, according to the BIOS, the current video mode IS CGA
         graphics, Alternate CaptureThis will capture the screen in a
         file named A0.TMP (in the current directory). Subsequently
         captured screens will be saved in files having the following

                                                                          32
         sequence of names:

           A1.TMP, ..., A9.TMP, B0.TMP, ..., B9.TMP, ..., C0.TMP, ...

         Caution: Each time ACAPTHIS is installed, it saves screens in
         files (beginning with A0.TMP) WRITING OVER ANY EXISTING FILES
         IN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY WITH THE SAME NAMES WITHOUT WARNING
         -- so after saving a series of files with ACAPTHIS, you
         should rename them before installing ACAPTHIS again, to guard
         against overwriting, and to provide more descriptive names.

         2. In PictureThis, press F10 to access the file operations
         menu, then press R and key in the name of the file you just
         saved (PTTITLE.TMP if you used CaptureThis, or A0.TMP if you
         used Alternate CaptureThis), with a directory specification
         if necessary. And there's the template!

           Now that you've completed this tutorial, we recommend that
         you explore PictureThis and CaptureThis on your own,
         referring as necessary to the user manual to learn more about
         the details of how these programs work. The user manual
         contains more details and examples on areas covered by this
         tutorial AND information on how to use the MANY features NOT
         covered in this tutorial (working in different units,
         changing the cursor speed, using a grid, scaling the drawing,
         noting points, measuring distances, many more text features,
         etc.) Have fun!
