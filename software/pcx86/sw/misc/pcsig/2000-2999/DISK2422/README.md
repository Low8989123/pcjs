## Information about "ROMEO AND JULIET 1 OF 2 (#2423 ALSO)"

    ROMEO AND JULIET is a true classic.  But was it meant for only the
    elite few who can figure out what all those words and flowery phrases
    really mean?
    
    This program, from the author of the shareware program MACBETH, proves
    that Shakespeare can actually be understood and enjoyed by the non-
    Shakespearean fan!  Geared to aid students of English literature at the
    high school level, ROMEO AND JULIET accomplishes this seemingly
    impossible trick through the use of menu-driven quizzes and games,
    notes, and a `tour' through the Globe Theatre where the plays were first
    seen by audiences.
    
    As with his other programs, the author also offers his students The
    Competition! -- a chance to win prizes of cash and computer products,
    achievable only through a close knowledge of the play.  Definitely a
    win-win program!

                           INTRODUCTION TO ROMEO & JULIET
                           ==============================

     'Romeo & Juliet' is one of Shakespeare's most famous plays, and the only
     one that deals directly with the theme of young love.

     Written in about 1597, it is one of his earliest tragedies, and different
     from the others in that the final tragedy cannot be traced directly to some
     fault of character in either Romeo or Juliet.

     As usual, Shakespeare did not create an original story. His characters are
     taken from the history books, and the works of other authors. In this case
     his basic story was a traditional Italian one, possibly based on true
     events. Shakespeare seems to have acquired most of his material from one of
     the first English versions of the story, a long poem written by Arthur
     Brooke. He introduced new characters (noticeably Mercutio) and shortened
     the time-span of the original plot to its final breathless length.


                            INTRODUCTION TO THE PROGRAMME
                            =============================

     The programme consists of a series of activities to assist high school
     students learning Shakespeare's play 'Romeo & Juliet'. The student can
     select the activity of his choice from a series of menus.

     Activities include several quizzes or games, notes on a wide variety of
     topics, graphics of the Globe Theatre and even a competition with the
     chance to win worthwhile prizes.

     The games are designed to be fun and at the same time to provide a fairly
     painless way to memorise quotations, learn important speeches, and in
     general, to become familiar with the plot, characters and themes of the
     play.























                                        (p3)








                                 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
                                 ===================

     The programme will run on IBM and Compatible computers with 512Kb of memory
     or more. CGA card is required, although it is not necessary to have a
     colour monitor. However, colour is recommended, especially for the games.

     The programme is normally supplied on two 5.25" floppy disks and the
     default set up is for the programme disk to be in Drive A and the data disk
     in Drive B. These defaults may be changed, however, from the SETUP option
     on the Main Menu, and the programme will also run from a single drive (of
     720Kb or more) or from a hard disk.


                                    INSTALLATION
                                    ============

     You are advised to use the DOS DISKCOPY command to back up your disks
     before you use them.

     If you intend to run the programme from the original disks, or from back-
     ups of the originals, no installation is required. If you want to run it
     from a hard disk or from a high capacity disk, just follow the simple steps
     below to install it successfully.

     1. Create a new directory or subdirectory for the programme (if desired)
     using the DOS MKDIR or MD command (See your DOS manual).

     2. Copy all the files from the Programme Disk and the Data Disk to the
     chosen directory or sub-directory using the COPY *.* command. You may copy
     the data files to a different directory from the programme files if you
     wish.
     N.B. The Programme Disk (Disk 1) is the one containing the main programme
     file RJ.EXE

     3. When you first run the programme, select SETUP from the Main Menu, and
     alter the Drive/Directory setting to the one where you copied the data
     files. You must do this before you attempt any of the activities which load
     data from the disk. (Most of them do!).

     4. Please note that although the files from the data disk may be stored in
     a separate directory, ALL the files from the Programme Disk must be kept
     together in the same directory.














                                        (p4)








                                 HOW TO GET STARTED
                                 ==================

     A. Two 5.25" Floppy Disks

     Insert the Programme Disk in Drive A and the Data Disk in Drive B. Now turn
     on, or reboot your computer. N.B. You can reboot by pressing the Ctrl
     key,the Alt key and the Del key all at once, or by pressing the Reset
     Button if there is one.
     Alternatively, if your computer is already running and the DOS prompt is on
     the screen, insert the disks as above. Now change to Drive A if necessary
     by typing A: <<Enter>> To run the programme, type AUTOEXEC <<Enter>>

     B. One 3.5" disk

     Insert the disk in your drive and turn on, or reboot your computer.
     Alternatively, if your computer is already running and the DOS prompt is on
     the screen, make sure you are using the correct drive (Usually Drive
     A:),and then type AUTOEXEC <<Enter>>

     C. Hard Disk

     Make sure you have followed the instructions in the previous section to
     make a directory and copy the files to it. Now change to that
     directory.(e.g. If your Hard Disk is Drive C and you created a new
     directory called LITDISK, then type CD C:\LITDISK) <<Enter>>)
     Now type AUTOEXEC <<Enter>>


                                   USING THE MENUS
                                   ===============

     You find your way around the different parts of the programme by using a
     very simple system of menus.
     The choices offered at each level are shown on the screen, with the first
     one high-lighted. Use the arrow keys to move the high-light to the
     selection you want. Then press the <<Enter>> key to go to that selection.If
     your computer has a numeric key-pad, you may use those arrow keys as well,
     but remember to turn off the Num Lock function.

     To Find A Menu

     If a menu is not currently showing on the screen, you can almost always get
     to one by pressing the <<Esc>> key. This will halt the current activity,and
     display the active menu.












                                        (p5)

                                   THE COMPETITION
                                   ===============

     One of the unique features of this programme is the on-disk competition. To
     take part in the competition, you must first solve a code. To see the coded
     message, select COMPETITION from the Main Menu.

     Once you have cracked the code, you will be able to confirm your success
     with part one of the competition, and this confirmation will be written
     onto the disk. This will gain you access to the next level of the
     competition, a treasure hunt in the Globe Theatre.

     Once the treasure is discovered, you will be able to answer a series of
     questions which make up Part Three of the competition.

     Write your solution to the coded message on the Entry Form (Included as
     page 11 of this manual), and also write the answers to the five Buried
     Treasure questions. Please note that you must be a registered user of the
     programme to be eligible to enter the competition.

     First prize is cash to the value of approximately US$50 plus computer
     products. Second prize US$15 plus computer products. Twenty consolation
     prizes of computer products. The value of the prizes may vary slightly from
     year to year, but should increase rather than decrease (assuming enough of
     you lovely people out there in Computer-land buy my programmes).

     The competition is an annual one closing at the end of November each
     year,and with the winning entries drawn at the beginning of December.

     All prize-winners will be notified by post, and all entrants in the
     competition will receive a list of results.

                              CUSTOMIZING THE PROGRAMME
                              =========================

     With a modicum of knowledge and the ability to use a text processor, you
     should be able to customise some of the data used in the programme, if you
     so desire. The most obvious areas where this can be accomplished are as
     follows:

     QUOTATION QUIZ  - The data for this quiz is contained in the text file
     RJQUOTES.QQZ on Disk 2. The first item in the file is the number of quotes
     currently in the file. Don't forget to update this if you add or delete
     quotes. Each question must contain the following items: The quotation
     itself, the correct answer, 3 incorrect answers, a sentence explaining the
     context of the quotation, the Act number, the scene number. Use ordinary
     Arabic numerals for Act and scene numbers, not Roman numerals. When typing
     in quotations, use a * to indicate line breaks. A quick look at the file
     should make it clear what to do if you are still confused.

     POISON - This is my version of the Hangman game. You can easily add new
     words by altering the file POISON.DTA on Disk 2. The first item in the file
     is the number of words. Don't forget to update this if you add or delete
     words. Each word used in the game also has an accompanying definition; this
     must be included.

     PLOTSWAP - The data for this is contained in the file PLOTSWAP.DTA. The
     first item in the file is the number of 'events' listed. The more events
     included in this file, the more difficult the game becomes. You could use
     this fact to make the game more challenging or more simple, but remember
     the minimum number is 12. The events in the file must be listed in the
     exact order in which they occur in the play.

     NOTES - I don't recommend that you alter the notes, as my system for
     printing them to the screen is a little peculiar to say the least, but if
     you must experiment, then go ahead. Plot summaries can be identified by the
     file suffix .PLT , Character studies have .CHR , while other notes have the
     suffix .NTS  The first item in each file is the number of screens or pages
     of data, then each 'page' has the number of data items on that page.
     Beginning an item with a * indicates that the item is to be high-lighted in
     the text. To print a blank line, include an item consisting of 4 or more
     spaces enclosed in quotation marks. You may need to experiment a little to
     find out just how much will fit on each page.

     MISSING WORDS - If you have a lot of time on your hands, and are by nature
     a patient and tolerant person like me, then you can try writing different
     speeches for the Missing Words game. I'll leave you to figure out how it's
     done! Unfortunately, you won't be able to change the reference to the
     speech in the GAMES Menu.

     FAMILY FEUD - Not much you can change here, except for the True/False
     questions. These are contained in the file BORDATA.DTA  Take care not to
     make the questions too long.

     I guess that's about all, unless you are one of those people who can't
     resist seeing what Shakespeare looks like wearing spectacles and a false
     nose. The pictures are all in BLOAD format.

                                 ABOUT THE PROGRAMME
                                 ===================

     This programme began its life as a set of quizzes I programmed for my own
     Literature students at a High School here in Singapore. Over the last two
     years, the programme has grown and developed and gone through a variety of
     versions, to become what it is today. It has been quite well-received by
     students here who face a compulsory Shakespeare component in their
     Cambridge GCE O Level examinations.

     Originally, as the new owner of an Apple II clone, I programmed in
     Applesoft Basic. The programme fitted easily onto one 5.25" floppy disk,and
     consisted mainly of three games and the segment on the Globe Theatre. I
     believed then as I believe now, that people do not really want to sit and
     read pages of notes from a computer monitor.

     However, feedback from users indicated a desire for more notes, so the
     programme quickly grew. It also changed direction to become IBM-compatible
     to run on the computer of choice of 80% of the student population here in
     Singapore. So I put my prejudices aside and picked up a smattering of
     GWBasic.

     As the programme grew and became more sophisticated, I felt the need for
     something a little more powerful and faster than interpreted Basic, so
     Microsoft QuickBasic made its appearance. I still see room for improvements
     and additions to the programme, and each new version on each different text
     is a little more sophisticated than its predecessor. Who knows what the
     future will bring?

     Currently, available titles are:
     MACBETH
     ROMEO AND JULIET
     ANIMAL FARM by George Orwell
     LORD OF THE FLIES by William Golding
     WALKABOUT
     THE GHOST OF THOMAS KEMPE

     and next on my hit-list

     TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD by Harper Lee
