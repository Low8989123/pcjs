## Information about "FAST/SOFA/FFD"

    FAST is a completely new language for PC compatibles.  FAST provides
    many new commands and options supported by your computer, but not
    supported by other languages.  The main feature is speed.  FAST produces
    code which runs faster than any other high-level language including C,
    Pascal, and compiled BASIC.
    
    FAST supports multiple files, conditional assembly, word aligned
    variable and compiler directives.  FAST has built in commands, fully
    optimized, that support windows, sprites, very fast screen printing,
    integer arithmetic, and file handling.  FAST even comes with a source
    code debugger.
    
    SOFA is a CHASM-compatible 8088 assembler that assembles about 350 lines
    per second on a 4.77Mhz PC.  SOFA, like CHASM, builds .COM files, which
    accounts for its speed.  Modular programming is possible with SOFA
    because it can include any number of source files, a valuable feature.
    However, the size of a .COM is still limited to 64KB.  SOFA also
    supports conditional assembly.
    
    FFD is a free-form database which can store an unlimited amount of data
    and still access it almost instantly. FFD is different from most
    information retrieval programs because it does much more than that.
    
    FFD is designed for inputting data -- anything from client mailing
    lists and letters to full scale relational data. With some planning,
    FFD can be used to store client details, transactions and inventory
    with order details. Full relational capabilities are possible without
    actually defining any fixed structures.
    
    FFD can also be used to store program source files. This is ideal for
    producing cross-reference lists and finding field names or procedures.

information retrieval programs because it does much more than just      
retrieve information.  FFD is designed for inputting data, anything from
client mailing lists and letters to full scale relational data.  With   
some prethought FFD can be used to store CLIENT details, TRANsactions   
and INVENTory with ORDER details.  Supposing the capital letters were   
the different record names, and they were all stored in the database,   
you could search for CLIENTs, then sort them, find the one you want,    
then search for all transactions with the CLIENT's account number.  Full
relational capabilities are possible without actually defining any      
fixed structures.
