PC-TALK is a new product for business and personal applications. The    
library consist of over 100 words that can be used in all sorts of      
possibilities. There is no special hardware need to run the voice       
library ( it works thru the PC speaker).  The voice commands can be put 
in any batch file (*.bat) and added to your programs/menus. This package
is very easy to use, you simply need to type PC-TALK at the dos prompt, 
followed by the words you would like to say (example: to say happy      
birthday, type in "PC-TALK happy birthday").  Also included in this     
package is a PCX display program (EGA/VGA, 640x350, 16 colors) that can 
be used to display PCX pictures, and talk over them. Imagine creating a 
rolling PCX demo with real human speech describing exactly what the     
computer is displaying.

III. How to Run THE DEMO/TUTORIAL PROGRAM
-----------------------------------------

     We recommend that you run this package from your HARD DRIVE.
     -----------------------------------------------------------

     SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 512K of memory
			  any graphic monitor (EGA/VGA for PCX display).
			 

     If you have a FLOPPY based system, insert the disk into the A
     drive, then log onto the A drive, by typing in:
     
     A:

	  Then to start the program, type in :

     TALKDEMO


     If you have a HARD DRIVE system, insert the disk into your A
     drive, then make a subdirector on your hard drive, by typing in:

     C:
     MD\ PC-TALK

	  Then log onto the ABC-TALK subdirector, by typing in:

     CD\ PC-TALK

	  Then copy all the files on this disk to the subdirector on
	  your hard drive, by typing in:

     COPY A:*.*

	  Then to start the program, type in :

     TALKDEMO



IV.  ERRORS/PROBLEMS
--------------------

     REMOVE ALL TSR PROGRAMS AND HAVE 512K OF FREE MEMORY AVAILABLE
     BEFORE RUNNING THIS PROGRAM.

     If the sound output is distorted or muffled or slow, this usually
     reflects that a TSR (Terminate and Stay Resident) program is running.
     Remove all TSR programs before running PC-TALK.

     If you have a problem displaying the HAPPY.PCX file, this may be
     caused by not having a EGA graphic display adapter or a VGA display
     adapter that is not compatiable with the EGA adapter.

     If you have a problem with the keyboard this maybe caused by not
     having enough memory in your system (512K needed) or the file size
     in your config.sys file is to small. Try increasing your file size.

     If the speech output is not loud enough, this is usually caused by a
     inexpensive PC that has a ceramic speaker built on to the mother board.
     There is no cure for this problem (your PC is not 100% IBM compatible).

     If you have any problems other then the ones listed above, please call
     us or send us a letter, with the error information. This will enable us
     to correct the error(s).     THANKS........

     continue to support our software and create new and exciting educational
     programs. Considering the price of a comparable commercial software
     package, it's obvious that Shareware is a good deal for everyone.

	 There are real advantages to the Shareware system. You get to try
     out software to make sure it's compatible with your system and that it
     fits your needs before you "buy" it. C.S.S. Inc. saves the expense of
     advertising, packaging and distribution and passes the savings on to you.
     Plus, We are much more accessible than commercial software sources, so
     your questions and suggestions are much more likely to be responded to.

	 Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software, and
     the copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific exceptions
     as stated below.  Shareware authors are accomplished programmers, just
     like commercial authors, and the programs are of comparable quality. (In
     both cases, there are good programs and bad ones!)  The main difference
     is in the method of distribution.
        
	 Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. You
     should find software that suits your needs and pocketbook, whether it's
     commercial or Shareware.  The Shareware system makes finding software
     easier, because you can try before you buy.  Shareware has the ultimate
     money-back guarantee- if you don't use the product, you don't pay for it.
