Disk No: 2955
Disk Title: C*GEN  (#2954, #2960 also)
PC-SIG Version: S1.0

Program Title: C*GEN Customer Survey Generator
Author Version: 2.1A
Author Registration: $95.00
Special Requirements: 640K RAM, graphics card, DOS 3.3+, hard drive, and
                      dot matrix or laser printer.

For a successful business, it is essential to discover what is important
to your customers and how your services and products are perceived.
C*GEN allows you to easily design a customized and fully computerized
customer and/or market research survey using a database of 430 questions
covering 20 topics. Your own questions (both multiple-choice
quantitative and open-ended qualitative) and topics, introductory text,
and demographic questions can be included as well.

The surveys, which are designed by you, can be conducted interactively
on the phone or with questionnaires. Custom reports and graphs with
trend analysis and breakdowns by demographic categories can be produced.

C*GEN can also be used to computerize your organization's existing
surveys or to develop other types of surveys (Market Research, Training
Needs Assessment, etc.).
