                        =====================
                        Program Requirements:
                        =====================

    Mine Field runs in 640 X 480 X 16 VGA graphics mode.  It
    requires about 350K of disk space and about 400K of free
    memory (RAM).  Mind Field also requires a mouse for program
    interaction.  The delay at the beginning of the program is
    necessary to load all of the pictures that this program uses.

    NOTE:  Because of the intensive disk access of this program
           when loading the graphics files (Especially during the
           introduction) it is recommended that you run it from a
           hard disk.  This will drastically cut the delay at the
           beginning of the program.


                         ====================
                         Program Description:
                         ====================

    Mine Field is a graphical game of logic and deduction.  Your
    job is to mark all of the mines in a mine field so that your
    troups can make it through safely.  There are 15 differect
    board to choose from and you can select how many bombs to put
    on each board.  The games begins with a board of raised tiles.
    Your then have to click on a tile and hope there isn't a mine
    under it.  If you don't get blown up the tile removes itself to
    reveal either a blank space or a number.  A blank space means
    that there are no bombs in the 8 surrounding squares and the
    computer will automaticly uncover those squares for you until
    it reaches a square with a number.  A numbered square means that
    there are that number of bombs in the surrounding 8 tiles.

    You have to figure out where all of the bombs are and mark them
    by clicking on them with the right button.  This turns the tile
    red and prevents you from uncovering it with the left button.  If
    you change your mind about weather or not there is a bomb under
    a red tile then you can click on it again with the right button
    and it will turn back to a normal square and you will then be able
    to uncover that tile with the left button.

    The game is over when you mark all of the bombs or when you uncover
    all of the safe tiles.

    Some of the features of Mine Field include:

      *  Superb VGA graphics.

      *  Mouse support.

                          ==================
                          Shareware Concept:
                          ==================

    If you are familiar with the idea behind Shareware, then you
    know that Shareware is the ultimate in money back guarantees.

    Most money back guarantees work like this:  You pay for the
    product and them have some period of time to try it out and
    see whether of not you like it.  If you don't like it or find
    that it doesn't do what you need, you return it (undamaged)
    and at some point - which might take months - you get your
    money back.  Some software companies won't even let you try
    their product!  In order to qualify for a refund, the
    diskette envelope must have an unbroken seal.  With these
    "licensing" agreements, you only qualify for your money back
    if you haven't tried the product.  How absurd!

    Shareware is very different.  With Shareware you get to try
    it for a limited time, without spending a penny.  If you
    decide not to continue using it, you throw it away and forget
    all about it.  No paperwork, phone calls, or correspondence
    to waste your valuable time.

    Software authors who use the Shareware method of distribution
    feel that Shareware is the best way to try a product.  You
    are able to try it on your own system(s), in your own special
    environment, with no sales people looking over your shoulder.
    Have you ever purchased a car and realized that if you could
    have test driven it for 2 weeks your purchase decision might
    have been different?  With Shareware these problems can be
    avoided - you DO have a 2 week test-drive!

    After trying a Shareware product and deciding to continue to
    use it, then - and only then - do you pay for it.  not only
    that, but Shareware is traditionally MUCH less expensive
    simply because you are paying for the software, not the
    advertising and marketing that comprises that majority of the
    cost of most software (a one page ad in PC Magazine, one
    time, can cost upwards of $20,000).  If the try-before-you-
    buy concept sounds like an ideal way to make your purchase
    decisions, you're right!

    Some companies burden their products with annoying copy
    protection schemes because they don't trust their users.
    Shareware developers not only don't use copy protection, they
    freely distribute their products because they DO trust their
    users.

    Someone once said that you should never trust software that
    doesn't trust you.  This makes a lot of sense - no wonder
    Shareware is becoming so popular among users and developers.


  Mine Field Documentation                          Page 6 of 16



    Shareware is a distribution method, NOT a type of software.
    Shareware is produced by accomplished programmers, just like
    retail software.  There is good and bad Shareware, just as
    there is good and bad retail software.  The primary
    difference between Shareware and retail software is that with
    Shareware you know if it's good or bad BEFORE you pay for it.
    Registration of Shareware products, in addition to being
    required, is also an incentive for programmers to continue to
    produce quality software for the Shareware market.

    There is another significant advantage to Shareware - it
    allows small companies like Expert Source Code, Inc. to make
    software available without the hundreds of thousands of
    dollars in expenses that it takes to launch a traditional
    retail software product.  There are many programs on the
    market today which would never have become available without
    the Shareware marketing method.  Please show your support for
    Shareware by registering those programs you actually use and
    by passing them on to others.  Thank you for your support!

    In the early days of Shareware there were no real standards.
    Independent authors had no efficient way to learn from each
    other or to work together to improve the overall image of
    Shareware.  There was no system in place th ensure that users
    were treated fairly and professionally.   There was no way
    for users to find an address for an author who had moved.  In
    short, the Shareware community was disorganized and each
    author did things the way he or she thought was best.  It was
    clear that if Shareware was ever to become a viable and
    respected marketing alternative, there had to bo some stan-
    dardication.  There had to be some guidelines to best serve
    the users.

  Mine Field Documentation                          Page 9 of 16



    In 1987 a handful of Shareware authors founded the Associa-
    tion of Shareware Professionals (ASP).  In forming this
    industry association these Shareware authors had several
    primary goals in mind, including:

      *  To inform users about Shareware programs and about
         Shareware as a method of distributing and marketing
         software.

      *  To foster a high degree of professionalism among
         Shareware authors by setting programming, marketing,
         support standards for ASP members to follow.

      *  To encourage broader distribution of Shareware through
         user groups and disk dealers who agree to identify and
         explain the nature of Shareware.

      *  To assist members in marketing their software.

      *  To provide a forum through which ASP members may
         communicate, share ideas, and learn from each other.


    The newly formed Association of Shareware Professionals
    worked together to draft a code of ethics for all present
    and future members.  This code of ethics included several
    requirements that soon became very popular among users
    (customers), including:


      *  A member's program (evaluation version) could not be
         limited (crippled) in any way.  In the true spirit of
         Try-Before-You-Buy, users must be able to evaluate all
         the features in a program before paying the registration
         fee.

      *  Members must respond to every registration.  At the very
         least they must send a receipt for the payment.

      *  Members must provide technical support for their
         products for at least 90 days from the date of
         registration.

    A new system was put in place to help ensure that users were
    treated fairly and professionally.  If a user was unable to
    resolve a problem with a member author them the user could
    contact the ASP Ombudsman with their complaint.  The
    Ombudsman would then try to help resolve the dispute.  for
    more complete details reguarding the Ombudsman, please refer
    to the "ASP Ombudsman Statement" below.
