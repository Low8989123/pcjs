The $HAREWARE MARKETING $YSTEM is a detailed two-part resource for
shareware authors who need creative ideas and a RATED mailing list of
over 800 major shareware distributors, large computer clubs and
recommended BBS systems.  The first part of the package, the shareware
distributor's database, contains mailing addresses, phone numbers, a
Shareware Distributor Rating and other detailed data which can be used
to prepare envelope mailing labels or BBS calling uploads.

The database file is rated by shareware distributor so you can mail your
shareware to vendors rated A, B or C.  The database file is supplied in
standard file formats such as dBASE and 1-2-3 which can be directly
imported into your database!  Sort lists of shareware distributors by
zip, state or other criteria.  Foreign and U.S. distributors and
computer clubs are included.

The second part of the package is a detailed newsletter and marketing
strategy guide, prepared by an established shareware author.  It
contains dozens of creative tips, tricks and traps which every shareware
author should know.  Written by the author of the PC-LEARN computer
tutorial, the $HAREWARE MARKETING $YSTEM provides detailed and valuable
information in a frank, candid and sensible style.
