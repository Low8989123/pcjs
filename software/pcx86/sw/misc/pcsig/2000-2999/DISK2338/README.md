## Information about "PC ASSEMBLER HELPER & TUTOR #2 (& 2337)"

    The PC ASSEMBLER TUTOR is an assembler tutorial that covers all 8086
    instructions.  Starting with the simplest instructions, it works its
    way through the whole instruction set.  TUTOR also covers details of
    the hardware involved with the 8086.
    
    The PC ASSEMBLER HELPER (ASMHELP.OBJ) is an object file which does I/O
    for assembler-level routines. It also displays the 8086 registers and
    flags, if desired, and allows each arithmetic register to be
    independently formatted.
    
    The intended users are people who are already competent programmers in
    a high-level language and either are just starting to learn assembler,
    or know fewer than 60% of the assembler mnemonics and want to learn
    more. TUTOR assumes that the user has a general knowledge of the DOS
    commands, subdirectory structure, and pathnames. It is also helpful if
    the user has already linked object modules to form an executable file.
    
    This is the only manual on the market that systematically covers the
    assembler mnemonics system, allows easy input and output of data at the
    assembler level, and allows you to see the arithmetic registers in the
    way they are being used.

             This subdirectory contains a compressed file which makes up disk4
             of The PC Assembler Tutor. The Tutor no longer fits on 3 disks so
             it is divided to make 4 disks.

             This file is self-extracting. You enter the name of a file on the
             command line, just as you would the name of a program.

               >disk4

             The program will start and unpack all the files into the current
             directory. Before starting, the program will prompt you to make
             sure that you want to continue. Press N if you don't want to go
             on.

             You may unpack it directly to floppy disk. Just use an empty
             formatted disk and make the floppy disk drive the current
             directory.

             The list of all files is in FILELIST.DOC which is in the
             \COMMENTS subdirectory of disk1. You start doing the Tutor by
             reading INTRO1.DOC and INTRO2.DOC and then doing the chapters
             starting with chapter 0.
