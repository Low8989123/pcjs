## Information about "TUTOR DOS 1 OF 4 (2385-2387 ALSO)"

    TUTOR DOS was created by a professional computer instructor to assist
    beginners who are trying to learn DOS. It was written with the novice
    in mind, and starts with the basics of RAM and DOS before moving on to
    topics such as formatting disks, manipulating sub-directories, and
    creating batch files.
    
    TUTOR DOS consists of 21 interactive lessons. Students are able to
    practice their newfound skills as they acquire them. TUTOR DOS will
    recognize a variety of answers to its questions and prompts users with
    hints. Each lesson ends with a short quiz to help students review what
    they have learned. At the end of the program, students take a
    multiple-choice test to evaluate their knowledge. Based on this test,
    TUTOR DOS either recommends lessons for review or rewards the student
    with a custom printed certificate.

          INTRODUCTION

          Now that we have all of the legal stuff out of the way, I can get
          on with telling you about the program.  TUTOR DOS is an
          interactive, beginner's DOS tutorial.  It assumes that the user
          knows virtually nothing about MS-DOS.

          The program consists of an introduction, twenty-one lessons, a
          final test, and a few closing remarks.  The program is contained
          in twenty-six program files, three batch files, and one
          documentation file.  (There is a complete list of the names of
          these files at the end of this document.)

          TUTOR DOS offers several advantages over currently available
          commercial tutorials.

               *TUTOR DOS was designed to talk 'to' you, rather than
               'at' you.

               *All of the lessons in TUTOR DOS are quite short and
               none of them should take more than twenty to twenty-
               five minutes to complete.

               *You may use the [ESCAPE] key to exit any lesson at any
               time.

               *TUTOR DOS has been programmed to accept several 
               answers to each of its questions.

               *If you give the wrong answer to a question, TUTOR
               DOS will provide a hint.

               *If you can't seem to get the right answer to a
               question, keep trying.  After you've tried three times,
               TUTOR DOS will type the right answer for you.

               *Each lesson ends with a quiz.  These quizzes will help
               you judge how well you've learned the material in each
               lesson.

               *The course ends with a comprehensive examination. 
               TUTOR DOS will analyze your answers and (if necessary)
               give you a list of lessons to review.

               *If you score over eighty percent on the test, TUTOR
               DOS will print out a certificate of achievement with
               your name on it.

               *TUTOR DOS is distributed as SHAREWARE.  If you enjoy
               it, I ask that you send me a donation of ten dollars. 
               This is far less expensive than commercial DOS
               tutorials which generally cost thirty to fifty dollars.














          SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

          TUTOR DOS has been designed with the average user in mind and,
          therefore, will work on virtually any PC.  The specific
          requirements are:

               256 K Random Access Memory
               DOS 2.1 or higher

          There are no other requirements.  TUTOR DOS will run from floppy
          disk drives (of any size) or from a hard disk drive.  It will run
          equally well on color and monochrome monitors.

          INSTALLING TUTOR DOS

          If you do not have a hard disk drive, or do not want to put TUTOR
          DOS on your hard disk drive, no installation is necessary.  
          However, if you want to install TUTOR DOS on your hard disk
          drive, all you have to do is follow these instructions:

               1) Turn on your PC.

               2) Wait for the prompt to appear on the monitor, it
               should look something like C:\>, and it will be
               followed by a small, blinking cursor.

               3) Put TUTOR DOS disk number 1 in your A: disk drive.  (If
               you have more than one floppy disk drive, you'll have to
               figure out which one is the A: disk drive.  If your disk
               drives are stacked on top of one another, this will be the
               top disk drive.  If they are side by side, it will be on the
               left.)

               4) Type A:INSTALL A C and press the [ENTER] key.

               5) Follow the instructions that appear on your screen.

          USING TUTORDOS

          If you are using TUTOR DOS from a disk drive, make sure that
          TUTOR DOS disk number 1 is in the drive and the door is closed. 
          Type TUTORDOS and press [ENTER].

          If you have installed TUTOR DOS on your hard disk drive, wait for
          the C:\> and type TUTORDOS and press [ENTER].

          In either case, after a moment, TUTOR DOS will begin to give you
          instructions on the screen.  From this point on, all you have to
          do is follow these instructions.

          all four disks to aid beginning users and reduce the amount of
          disk swapping.

          TUTOR DOS was written using Borland International's TURBO BASIC
          version 1.1. Portions of the program make use of Rick
          Fothergill's public domain TBWINDO utilities.
