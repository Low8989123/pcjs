## Information about "THE LAST WORD"

    Who said ``I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death
    your right to say it.''?  This, and hundreds of other famous
    quotations, are the basis of the trivia game, THE LAST WORD.
    
    Answer questions about quotations by selecting either who said it, why
    it was said, where it was said, or what it was said about.  Your
    answers are matched against a set of acceptable responses with a
    sophisticated pattern-recognition algorithm.  You don't even have to
    spell every name perfectly to receive credit, and bonus points are
    given for quick responses.
    
    While this is not a game for children, it can be used as an
    educational tool for young adults.  Quotations are taken from old
    movies (Garbo, Bogart, etc.), humorists like Robert Orben, songs from
    Gilbert and Sullivan, and writers like Kipling, Nietzsche, Frost,
    Shakespeare, and Hemingway.  (Ans: Voltaire.)

                                     DISCLAIMER

          The author hereby disclaims all warranties relating to this
          product, whether express or implied, including without limitation
          any implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a
          particular purpose. The author cannot and will not be liable for
          any special, incidental, consequential, indirect or similar
          damages due to loss of data or any other reason, even if the
          author or an authorized agent has been advised of the possibility
          of such damages.  In no event shall the liability for any damages
          ever exceed the price paid for the license to use the software,
          regardless of the form and/or extent of the claim.  The user of
          this program bears all risk as to the quality and performance of
          the software.

                                     LICENSE

          'the last word' is a Shareware product.  As such, it is made
          available to the general personal computing public for
          evaluation.  Users are licensed to operate this program on their
          personal computers for the purpose of test and evaluation on a
          trial basis for a limited trial period.  It is not possible to
          reasonably define the limits of a fair and equitable time period
          for evaluation; therefore it is left to the user's judgment and
          sense of fair play as to the time required to make a decision as
          to its usefulness.  If the user decides the program is not of
          sufficient merit to warrant purchase through registration with
          the author, he/she should remove the program from his/her
          personal computer.  Otherwise, if the program is deemed useful
          and is in regular use on the user's computer system, registration
          with the author is required.

          Registered users are those users who elect to pay for 'the last
          word' and register that payment with the author.  By virtue of
          registration and payment for the program, registered users are
          granted a license to continue to utilize the program on their
          personal computer for as long as they choose.  This license
          authorizes the user to use the program on any personal computer
          system he or she may own or use so long as the program is
          operated on only one computer system at a time.

                                      GUARANTEE

          'the last word' is offered with an unconditional 30-day money-
          back guarantee.  If you become unsatisfied with the program for
          any reason within that period, just let me know and your
          registration will be refunded upon receipt of any registration
          materials.

          This guarantee is unconditional.  I would ask, however, if you
          are having a problem to let me know before giving up on LWORD
          since your problem may be something I can solve.

          Finally, if you receive a defective disk with your registration
          package either through my error or through postal service
          "processing", let me know and I will send replacements promptly.

                                    REGISTRATION

          'the last word' is the sole property of Gordon Haff.  The
          program may be freely copied and transferred to individual
          parties for evaluation purposes.  It may be posted on Bulletin
          Board systems (BBS) for electronic access as long as NO FEE is
          charged for its distribution except for private BBS operations
          that charge a regular user subscription fee.  Computer
          information services such as Compuserve (CIS), Genie, and Byte
          Information Exchange (BIX) are authorized to post this product
          for subscriber access.  'the last word' may be distributed on
          diskette for a fee only by 1) disk distributors/vendors who are 
          associate members of the Association of Shareware Professionals 
          (ASP) or 2) users groups which do not charge more than a nominal 
          fee ($5) to cover the costs of distribution.  Any changes to 
          these policies must be made in writing by the author.

          'the last word' is a fully functional Shareware product.
          Shareware is a computer program distribution/marketing method
          that permits potential buyers to thoroughly try the program prior
          to purchase. It is NOT free and it is not in the Public Domain.
          If, after evaluating the program, you find it to be useful enough
          to use it on a regular basis, you are expected to pay for it by
          registering with the author.

          The registration fee is $15.00.  The payment of this registration
          fee to the author entitles the user to full use of the product
          for an unlimited period of time in addition to product support.
          PLUS YOU GET THE FOLLOWING:
             -  A disk with the latest revision of 'the last word'
             -  New data files with twice the number of questions
             -  A "Branding" program which allows you to "brand" your
                serial number into 'the last word' (and subsequent
                versions) and thereby avoid any registration reminders
             - A coupon good for $5 off the registration of the author's 
               Directory Freedom file management program
             - A copy of the author's Trivia Command game

          This program is produced by a member of the Association of
          Shareware Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure that the
          shareware principle works for you. If you are unable to resolve a
          shareware-related problem with an ASP member by contacting the
          member directly, ASP may be able to help. The ASP Ombudsman can
          help you resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member, but
          does not provide technical support for members' products. Please
          write to the ASP Ombudsman at P.O. Box 5786, Bellevue, WA 98006
          or send a Compuserve message via easyplex to ASP Ombudsman

                                  TECHNICAL SUPPORT

          Full technical support is available to registered users of
          'the last word'.  I have found that the most effective product
          support can be delivered through the electronic services listed
          below.  If this option is not open to you, however, I also offer
          full product support through the mails, or, if the problem
          absolutely cannot wait, the telephone (no collect calls please).
          (It's not that I don't want to talk with you, it's just that I
          have found it very difficult to talk through complex problems
          over the telephone.)  I will do my best to resolve any software
          bugs in a timely manner and I am always open to incorporating new
          features or changes which are appropriate to the nature of the
          product.

          I will attempt to respond to software trouble reports made by
          non-registered users if the problems affect the general
          functionality of the program.  Such users should not, however,
          expect product support beyond initial aid to determine if the
          program is suitable for their needs.

          The above are roughly in order of preference (i.e. how quickly
          I'm likely to see your message and be able to respond).  I check
          Channel One almost daily and the other electronic services at
          least weekly in most cases.  In addition, I monitor the Interlink
          Shareware relay and the PCRelay Shareware relay via Channel One.

          Note 1:
          I can be reached on two Internet nodes:
          1)   gordon_haff@img024.ceo.dg.com (or you may need something
                  along the lines of
               gordon_haff%img024.ceo.dg.com@relay.cs.net if your system
               doesn't recognize the dg.com domain)
          2)   Alternatively 72561,2637@compuserve.com goes to my
               Compuserve mailbox.  This second method is probably the more
               reliable of the two.

          Note 2:
          When contacting me via Compuserve, please use the Easyplex mail
          system since I do not regularly monitor any of the IBM SIG
          message bases.

          Note 3:
          I don't use BIX much any longer, so this is probably not a very
          reliable way to get hold of me.

          the last word 1.0                                          5

          1.0  Background and Philosophy:

          Don't you hate all those multiple choice quiz games?  At any
          rate, you have to admit that they're hardly the msot natural
          thing in the world.  I mean -- how often in the course of a day
          does someone ask you "What's the answer to this problem?  I've
          already decided it's A, B, C, or D.  OK, quick now, which one?"

          Fortunately, some trivia games are much more adaptable to the way
          people normally answer questions.  They let you type in the
          answer exactly as it's stored in the computer.  These games
          remind me so much of when I play Trivia Pursuit.  We sit around
          and spell out all our answers letter by letter.  If you miss a
          single letter, you have to do a lap around the room.  (It's a
          tough crowd.)  My sixth grade spelling teacher would have
          approved of this sort of game.  I don't know about you, but I
          have enough trouble with typing at the best of times without a
          little clock going tick-tock near my ear.

          'the last word' is a bit different.  Most of the questions are
          answered by typing in a free-form answer which is then matched
          against a set of stored responses by something fancy called a
          Ratcliff/Obershelp pattern recognition algorithm.  This
          algorithm, in addition to making my game sound incredibly
          sophisticated, does a real nice job of figuring out if the user's
          response is deserving of some hard-earned points or just a
          particularly irritating blast from your PC's 15 cent speaker.

          I also tried to pick a topic which was a bit more interesting
          than just your run-of-the-mill trivia game.  This game is about
          quotes (MIT and Dartmouth alumni may recognize the genesis of the
          name).  All sorts of quotes -- literature, politics, social
          commentary, classic, modern, you name it we've got it.

          I've tried to make this game as intuitive as possible.  The
          on-line help should answer most any pressing questions you have
          about the meaning of life and which command-line switches are 
          valid.  In fact, I could probably fill the rest of this manual 
          with a random number table and no one would know the difference 
          since no one reads manuals.  Do me a favor, please, however.  At 
          least read section 2.0 which is a short compendium of the things 
          you really ought to know about before running the game.  It will 
          save you endless embaraassment from when you call me and I have 
          to explain as gently as possible that the answer is in the manual 
          as plain... Well, you get the idea.

          the last word 1.0                                          6

          2.0  Things You Really Oughta Know:


            o  DO make a copy of the distribution disk before you start
               messing around with it.

            o  But DON'T run the program from a write-protected disk (or
               one with less than 200 bytes or so free).  'the last word'
               needs to create a high-score file and pointer files for the
               questions.  It will have trouble doing this if the disk is
               write-protected or full.

            o  DO change to the directory containing all 'the last word'
               files before running the program so that LWORD can find all
               its support files.

            o  DO take advantage of an Adlib board if you have one by using
               the /ad command-line switch but DON'T use this switch if you
               don't have an AdLib board.

            o  If you want to exit the program in midgame, DO use the Alt-X
               key combination.  This will update the pointer files so you
               don't have to answer the same questions all over again next 
               time you play the game.  If you pound on the keyboard and 
               manage to break out of the program in another manner, these 
               cleanup functions won't be run.

            o  DO use the F1 key if you need help, but be aware that the
               clock is still running if you ask for help in the middle of
               answering a question.

            o  DO select the "Player" item from the main menu before
               "Go"ing on with the game.  That way you can be sure
               everything is setup like you want it and your name is
               available for the high-score file.

          3.0  Setting Up 'the last word':

               3.1  About this Manual:

          This documentation was written at a level which, I hope, is
          appropriate to the level of computer sophistication of most LWORD
          users.  This level assumes a degree of familiarity with keyboard
          usage on an IBM-PC/AT compatible and a basic understanding of how
          DOS is employed to run programs and execute commands.

          If the above scares you a bit, don't let it.  We have all been
          beginners at one time and I'm sure you can borrow a book or
          friend who will help you through any rough spots you run into.
          (And feedback on any spots of opaqueness in this manual is always
          welcome as well.)

               3.2  Included Files and Such:

          The following files should be included in your archive:

               LWORD.EXE      The main program file
               LWCATA.DAT     The data files
               LWCATB.DAT
               LWCATC.DAT
               LWCATD.DAT
               LWORD.HLP      Help file
               LWORD.ICO      Windows 3.0 Icon file

               READ.ME        Important information
               LWORD.TXT      This manual
               REGISTER.TXT   Registration form

               Adlib files: (These may be erased if you don't have an Adlib
                             board)
               PLAYROL.EXE
               TURKEY3.ROL
               ROOTBEER.ROL
               BANK.BNK

               The following files are CREATED by LWORD.  You probably want
                    to erase these files if you got them from someone else.

               LWCATA.PNT
               LWCATB.PNT
               LWCATC.PNT
               LWCATD.PNT
               LWORD.SCO

          The installation process couldn't be simpler.  Just copy the
          files you need/want to a subdirectory.

          If you want to install LWORD under Windows 3.0, setup a .PIF file
          with 256KB minimum memory, the appropriate switch setting and
          subdirectories for your installation (the LWORD subdirectory
          should be your StartUp Directory), and install the LWORD.ICO icon
          if desired.

          4.0  Command Line Switches:

          The switches listed in this section should follow the program
          name when running LWORD from the DOS command line; i.e.

               LWORD /ns /snow

          would turn off sound support and use a (slower) screen writing
          method which avoids snow on certain older CGA boards.  A '-' can
          be used instead of a '/' for any UNIX hackers out there.

          Since there is likely to be a common set of switches which you
          use all the time, I recommend that you either write a batch file
          called something like LW.BAT which contains a command line like
          the above, or you write a Windows .PIF or a Desqview .DVP file
          which 1) supplies the optional parameters you desire, and 2)
          changes to the directory containing 'the last word' data and
          support files.

               4.1  Command Line Switch Summary:

          /?        Command line help
          /ns       No sound
          /ad       Turn on Adlib support
          /bw       Use BIOS-write functions
          /snow     Avoid snow with some older CGA boards


               4.2  Command Line Help ( /? )

          This switch aborts the program load and instead presents you with
          the above list of program switches.

               4.3  No sound ( /ns )

          This command line switch is one of the three ways to turn off the
          (default ON) sound support in 'the last word'.  If you really,
          truly want to avoid any sound (you wouldn't be playing this at
          work would you?) you should use this switch since otherwise
          you'll get some sound from the opening displays before you get
          a chance to turn it off from the main menu or the hot-key
          toggle.

               4.4  Turn on Adlib Support ( /ad )

          'the last word', in its present incarnation, has somewhat limited
          Adlib support.  Specifically, it plays a song (which can be
          interrupted at any time by the user) when the game first comes up
          and when the high scores are displayed.  If you have an Adlib
          board, use this switch to turn on support.  If sound is turned
          off, Adlib music will not be played even if this parameter is set
          to on.

               4.5  Use BIOS-write functions ( /bios )

          The windowing libraries used by 'the last word' use direct video
          writes as a default.  If this, for some reason, causes a problem
          with your configuration, try this switch.

               4.6  Avoid Snow ( /snow )

          Some older CGA (Color Graphics Adapter) boards generate spurious
          dots or "snow" on caused by the CPU and the display-refresh
          circuitry simultaneously accessing the video buffer.  Setting
          this switch avoids this problem but also slows things down quite
          a bit.  If you prefer speed over a clean display update, or if
          you have an EGA or other color display adapter that doesn't need
          to do this checking, don't use this switch.


          5.0  Hot Switches:

          Hot switches are keystrokes which can be entered at most points
          in the program to activate a particular function.  The available
          switches are as follows:

               F1    -- Display help
               Alt-X -- Quit (also called 'The Boss walked in key')
               Alt-S -- Toggle Sound On/Off
               Alt-P -- Display game parameter screen

          6.0  Playing the Game:

               6.1  Summary:

          The basic objective of the game is to collect as many
          points/dollars as you can.  This entails answering as many
          questions correctly as quickly as possible.

          The base game consists of four rounds of four questions each for
          each player.  One or more bonus rounds may be won if sufficient
          points are won in preceding rounds.  Each player selects a
          category and bet in each round.

          At the end of the game, any players who made it into the top ten
          scorers are entered into the high score file.

          The above is a pretty brief description, but playing the game
          should be intuitive (at least it is if I wrote it the way
          I intended).  Various elements of the game are described in
          greater detail below.

               6.2  Main Menu:

          INSTRUCTIONS display on-line help.  Equivalent to F1.

          PLAYERS sets the number of players, player names and typing time
                  for each player (default 5 seconds)

          LIT allows the player(s) to select whether literature questions
                  (i.e. those questions with both an Author and a Title
                  answer -- mostly in the WHERE? category) require the
                  players to supply Both, Either, Author, or Title.

          SOUND toggles sound on/off.  Equivalent to Alt-S.

          ADLIB toggles Adlib support on/off.

          GO continues with the game.

          QUIT (Well what do you think this does?)

               6.3  Working with Menus:

          All the bar-type menus in 'the last word' operate in the same
          manner.  An item can be selected either by pressing the UP or
          DOWN cursor keys until the desired item is reached and then
          pressing <ENTER> or by pressing the "quick select key."  The
          "quick select key" in the letter in each menu item which is a
          different color from the rest.

               6.4  Game Parameters Display:

          After selecting the 'Go' menu item, the player(s) is presented
          with a display of various game parameters such as the player
          name(s) and whether Sound is on or off.  This display can be
          viewed at other points in the game through the Alt-P hot key.
          Additional information (which cannot be altered by the player at
          this time) includes the number of points required to earn the
          first bonus round and the additional points required to earn
          additional bonus rounds.  If you don't like what you see, press
          <Escape> to return to the main menu.

               6.5  Selecting a Category:

          To select a category, the player types 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'.
          Note that the selecting a category BIASES the use of that
          category for individual questions in that round but does not
          guarantee the use of that category for all questions in the
          round.

               6.6  Category Definitions:

          WHY   --  What were the circumstances which caused this quote?  
                    Typical answers would be the name of a person or an 
                    easily described event of some sort.
          WHO   --  This one's a bit more straightforward.  Who said this?
          WHERE --  The author/speaker and where the quote appeared.  Most
                    of the questions in this category are from books,
                    poetry, etc.  A few are from films and such (in which
                    case the "author" is the *actor/actress* who said the 
                    item in question).  
           WHAT  --  Fill in the missing part(s) of the quotation.

               6.7  Bets:

          The Bet placed has two effects.  The first is setting the number 
          of points which you win or lose depending upon whether the
          question was answered correctly or incorrectly.  (You get
          additional points if the question was answered correctly -- this
          is discussed later on.)  The second effect is that for each 100
          points bet over 200, 5 seconds are taken away from the allowable
          time you have to answer the question.  Which brings us to:

               6.8  Time:

          Here's how it works.  The base time is 30 seconds.  ADD to that
          the typing time per answer line (i.e. for literature questions
          which have both Author and Title components, the total added time
          is 2 x typing_time).  SUBTRACT from that 5 seconds for each 100
          over 100 has been placed as a bet.

          So, for a typing time of 5 and a bet of 500, the allowable time
          to answer a standard question would be:

                30 [base] + 5 [typing time] - (4 * 5) = 15 seconds

               6.9  Answering the Question:

          There are three types of answers:

          EXACT MATCH: A template is displayed which shows the exact number
          of words and letters required.  Only one combination of
          alphanumeric characters constitute an acceptable answer (though
          the comparison algorithm allows minor deviations to account for
          minor misspellings).

          INEXACT MATCH: Take your best stab at the answer.  No indication
          of length of answer or number of words in the answer is given.
          Through a pattern recognition algorithm, the computer will try to
          match your answer to a list of acceptable responses.

          MULTIPLE CHOICE: There are a few of these too.

          You must press <Enter> to tell the computer to process your
          answer including on multiple choice questions.  If you run out of
          time, nothing you have entered will be processed.  Moving between
          words in "Exact Match" templates is done automatically as you
          fill up each word.  You need not press <Space> or <Enter>
          between words.


               6.10 Challenging the Answer:

          If you disagree with the computer's "marking" of your answer (or
          if you want to cheat), you can challenge the computer by pressing
          F10.  From here, you can either:

               Continue with the Challenge (in which case your points will
                    be adjusted as if the answer had been originally
                    correct or incorrect -- including time bonus points if
                    any)

               Discard (which will basically throw the question away)

               Drop Challenge (which continues with no changes)

               6.11 Scoring

          The scoring algorithms are as follows.

          Correct answer = Correct points (100) + Bet + 3 x seconds
                           under 20 (plus typing time) taken to answer

          Incorrect answer = -Bet

          Scoring for Out of Time is the same as for Incorrect.

          7.0  Technical and Acknowledgments:

          'the last word' was written by Gordon Haff using Turbo C 2.0 in
          conjunction with Mike Smedley's CXL 5.1 libraries for windowing
          and other functions.  The Ratcliff/Obershelp pattern recognition
          algorithm was based on code from the article "Pattern Matching -
          The Gestalt Approach" by John W. Ratcliff and David E. Metzener
          in Dr. Dobbs Journal, July 1988 as modified by David Kirschbaum
          and converted to a medium memory model by Gordon Haff using TASM
          2.0.  Adlib support is provided through "PLAYROL.EXE" by Tracy
          Harton (I determined the author by looking through the .EXE file
          and I have no other information.  I hope that distributing the
          file in this manner is not a problem.)  Conventional sound
          effects are through NOISE.PAS by E. Kasey Kasemodel converted to
          C by Gordon Haff.

          The principal alpha/beta tester was Rick Strom who also designed
          the included Windows icon.


          8.0  Other Programs by the Author:

          Directory Freedom (DF):  Offers users a fast, compact alternative
             to DOS Shells which provides 1) selective file and
             directory operations; 2) a scrollable environment for
             examining directories; and 3) user-defined keys which
             can operate upon highlighted files (e.g. defined
             editors).  DF is written in assembler and requires only
             about 12K on your disk.  A companion configuration program
             allows for user-friendly configuration of a wide range of
             program parameters.  Latest rev: 3.50a.  Archive: DF350A.
