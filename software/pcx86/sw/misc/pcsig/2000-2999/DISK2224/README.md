                              Shooting Gallery
                       Release 1.1   February 23, 1990

                                Nels Anderson
                               92 Bishop Drive
                            Framingham, MA  01701


       Most people seem to enjoy trying to hit a target.  Whether it's
       tossing a ball through a hoop, trying to shoot cans off a fence,
       or blasting space aliens on a computer screen, there's something
       about it that's FUN!
       
       "Shooting Gallery" is an attempt to recreate a shooting range on
       a computer screen.  It originally started as just a target shoot
       as you might find at a carnival, but even before I had that done
       I had ideas for other rounds.  This first version has six rounds
       (well, actually two different variations on each of three ideas).
       I still have more ideas for rounds, so later versions of the game
       will undoubtedly have more rounds.  But I wanted to get the game
       out to you, the player, because past experience shows that some
       of the best new ideas come from the people actually playing the
       game.
       
       Shooting Gallery shouldn't require much instruction to play.  It
       works, basically, on the concept: "if it moves, shoot it!".  Rather
       than reading all the way through the instructions, just play a few
       rounds and then come back for some tips on how to maximize your
       scores.  There is help at the title screen and each round uses a
       portion of the screen to give you point values or tips.

       Shooting Gallery runs in 320x200, 256 color MCGA graphics, thus an
       MCGA or VGA video card and monitor is needed. It also requires a
       mouse.  If you get a message asking for a graphics driver (i.e.
       "EGAVGA.BGI") your system doesn't support the required graphics
       mode and you won't be able to run the game.

       Shooting Gallery is distributed as Shareware -- this allows you
       to try it before you buy it, but if you continue to use the game
       regularly you are expected to register.  When you register, please
       let me know what version you have (it's right on the title screen)
       and I'd also be interested to know where you got it from.  Please,
       make sure you put your name and address on your letter!  Or you 
       can use the instant registration form in the file "orderfrm.txt".
       Just copy the file to your printer, fill it out, and mail it.  If
       you're not familiar with the Shareware concept, please read the
       file "sharewre.txt".  The registration is $15, for which I will
       send you a disk with the latest version.  Or, for $20 you can get
       the "deluxe" version which includes a copy of the latest version
       of the game in a binder with printed instructions.

       If you have any suggestions or discover any problems with the
       program you can reach me via the )(evious BBS (PCBoard) system
       (300/1200/2400/9600-HST, 8N1) at 508-875-3618 or 617-449-7322.
       Leave a C)omment to the sysop to reach me.  )(evious is the
       official support BBS for all my software and the latest versions
       are always available for downloading there.  There is also a
       support conference for people to exchange game tips or ask
       questions.  J)oin conference #31 and check out the latest tips.
       
       You can also reach )(evious through RelayNet.  If there's a
       RelayNet board in your area send a routed message to me at node
       XEVIOUS.  The Shareware conference would be the best choice,
       but if that's not available try TPascal, Games or even Common.

       I'm also available through CompuServe's EasyPlex mail system.
       Send email to me at 71020,2613.



*****************************************************************************
*                             PLAYING THE GAME                              *
*****************************************************************************


       OBJECT:

         The object varies with each round, but in general you want to
         hit the targets as quickly as possible.  Each round is described
         individually below.  Even if you decide you don't like the game,
         please don't shoot the programmer!


       GENERAL:
       
         If you need to you can abort the game at any time by hitting the
         ESC key.  Rounds 1 and 4 can also be paused by hitting the space
         key; the other rounds already have natural pauses in them.


       ROUND 1:
       
         This is a version of the carnival shooting booth.  Different
         targets have different point values, as shown at the bottom of
         the screen.  In addition, there is a bonus for hitting something
         on the faster moving rows:  10 extra points for the top row, and
         5 extra points for the middle row.
         
         Make sure to hit the extra ammo and extra time boxes whenever
         they appear to keep the round going longer.
         
         The real way to maximize points is by hitting a whole row of the
         same target type.  The number of targets in a row varies from 4
         to 8, and the bonuses vary from 100 to 250:
         
             Target Description   Number in a Row   Bonus Value
             ------------------   ---------------   -----------
             Duck                        8              100
             Spinning Wheel              8              100
             Squirrel                    6              100
             Clay Pipe                   8              100
             Wine Bottle                 6              100
             Soda Can                    8              100
             Beer Bottle                 4              200
             Pinwheel                    6              100
             Fruit                       6              100
             Heart                       6              100
             Smiley Face                 8              100
             Coffee Mug                  6              100
             Candle                      4              250

         If you need to pause the round, just hit the space bar on your
         keyboard.  Click the mouse to restart.
       
       ROUND 2:
       
         This round requires hitting a "clay pigeon", a target that is
         tossed off into the distance that you try to hit with a shotgun.
         The target moves quickly and so rapidly grows smaller and harder
         to hit.  For best results, try to aim a little ahead of the
         target; it takes a while for the shot to reach it through the
         distance!
       
         No points are given for a miss.  When you hit, the score is
         based on how quickly you hit the target.  See the upper right
         part of the scoreboard for your time.
       
       ROUND 3:
       
         In this round you must quick draw against a target.  Watch the
         timing lights and when they turn green, draw your "Rodent .45"
         from its holster, aim at the center of the target and fire!
         
         Your score is based on both your time and how close you got to
         the exact center of the target.  See the upper right part of
         the scoreboard for your time.
         
       ROUND 4:
         
         This is a repeat of Round 1, but with a few complications added.
         All the targets have changed, and their point values have, in
         general, doubled.  The bonuses for hitting targets on the faster
         moving rows have doubled as well.
         
         To make things more complicated, the targets will change direction
         at random times.  Also, there's a special target labelled "HIT ME".
         Do what the target says!  If you don't hit it before it scrolls off
         the screen there is a 500 point penalty.
         
         As in Round 1, the best way to get a top score is by hitting a
         whole row of the same target.  In this round, the number of targets
         in a row varies from 4 to 8, and the bonuses vary from 200 to 500:
         
             Target Description   Number in a Row   Bonus Value
             ------------------   ---------------   -----------
             Bell                        8              200
             Flower                      6              200
             Baseball                    8              200
             Bomb                        4              200
             Alarm Clock                 6              250
             Beer Bottle                 4              250
             Diskette                    8              200
             Shield                      6              250
             Chicken                     5              200
             Flowers                     6              200
             Stein                       6              200
             Wreath                      5              200

         If you need to pause the round, just hit the space bar on your
         keyboard.  Click the mouse to restart.
       
       ROUND 5:
       
         Once again you're at the skeet shooting range as in round 2.
         This time, though, you're equipped with a double barrel shotgun
         and you'll have two clay pigeons to hit each time.
         
         You're given points for each target you hit, even if you hit
         only one out of two.  Your time, though, is always based on the
         time it takes to make both shots.  Shoot fast for the highest
         score.
       
       ROUND 6:
       
         As in Round 3 you must quick draw against a target.  This time,
         though, there are two targets to hit.  HIT THE LEFT TARGET FIRST!
         
         You are scored separately on the accuracy of each shot, but your
         time is your total time for both shots.
       
       
       GAME OPTIONS:
       
         The title screen provides a number of options.  In addition to
         going straight into the game you can practice any one round, see
         the high score hall of fame, get some help, etc.
         
         Help:
         
         If you've read this far into the docs you probably don't need
         any more help, but these screens can be used as a quick
         reminder of what each round is.  At each help screen you have
         the option of going on to the next screen, going back to the
         previous screen, or quitting help.
         
         Info:
         
         Some basic information on Shooting Gallery and how to register.

         Scores:

         View the high scores hall of fame.  The high scores are also
         shown at the end of each game.  Click to exit the hall of fame.

         Practice:
         
         This brings up a list of all the different rounds available.
         Point to the button next to the round you want to practice and
         click.

       COMMAND LINE OPTIONS:

         There are two options when starting up the game.  Some people
         play in an environment where quiet is necessary so I've made it
         possible to play with the sound off.  Add a " -s" to the command
         line to turn sound off.

         I haven't yet come up with the perfect speed calibration system
         and as a result some users of v1.0 found that the game moved too
         fast.  There is now an option to slow down the game.  Use
         " -d###" where ### is a number of your choosing that sets the
         delay in movements.  The higher the number, the slower the game
         will move.  Try starting at 100 and work up or down from there.
         To give you an idea on how fast things should move, on round 1 a
         target on the bottom row should cross the screen in about 7
         seconds.

         Since command line options are confusing to some people, here
         are examples of how to use them.  To turn the sound off, your
         command line should look like this:

                                  shoot -s

         To use a speed delay factor of 100, your command line would look
         like this:

                                 shoot -d100

         Finally, you can use both options at the same time.  To play
         with the sound off and a delay factor of 125, the command line
         would look like this:

                               shoot -s -d125
