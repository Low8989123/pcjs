Disk No: 2787
Disk Title: Formula I
PC-SIG Version: S1

Program Title: Formula I
Author Version: 06/91
Author Registration: $49.50
Special Requirements: None.

FORMULA I is the first part of a two-part program which teaches a
complete Algebra course -- from basic addition to imaginary numbers.
Written for high school and college students, its design makes it
available to anyone who wants to acquire Algebra skills.

FORMULA 1 is the joint effort of a physicist with many years of
experience in teaching and tutoring math, and a psychologist who
specializes in the use of the computer as a teaching tool.  State of the
art Artificial Intelligence techniques imitate the actions and
recommendations of a human tutor.  The tutor checks your progress and
guides you through the course, the same way a human tutor would.

You may choose not to use the electronic tutor.  Decide which topics you
want to study and in what order.  The tutor will not prevent you from
doing this, but it will make a comment if it ``thinks'' there is a
better choice you could make!

The shareware version contains three of the nine tutorials which make up
the entire course.  The ``Introduction to Numbers,'' the ``Introduction
to Fractions'' and the ``Quadratic Equations'' tutorials have been
included in full.  The Pre and Post Tests for the other six tutorials
are included to allow you to assess what the tutorials on these topics
will cover.
