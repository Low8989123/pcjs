## Information about "PC-IRIS, PC-MERLIN, PC-LOCK"

    A file containing sensitive information may be encrypted by IRIS,
    effectively precluding unauthorized disclosure.  The (encrypted) file
    may be copied to floppy disk and sent via public mail (an insecure
    channel) to another party, who, having access to IRIS and the "KEY"
    used to encrypt the document, will be able to decrypt the file,
    producing the original spreadsheet.
    
    IRIS implements these commercial cryptographic techniques:
    
    ~ ADFGVX
    
    ~ RSA public key cryptography
    
    ~ DES
    
    ~ LITTLEWOOD
    
    ~ VERNAM (XOR)
    
    ~ PLAYFAIR
    
    ~ BAZERIES
    
    ~ VIGENERE
    
    ~ CRC (checksum) generation
    
    ~ Secure file erasure.
    
    PC-LOCK allows the user of a PC to "lock" a DOS session, thereby
    inhibiting unauthorized usage of the machine during short absences such
    as lunchbreak.  The PC-LOCK program prompts the user for a password (and
    re-prompts for verification), and then prevents any further use of the
    machine until the correct password is re-entered.
    
    PC-MERLIN integrates the DOS "copy" program with data encryption.  This
    allows the user to copy multiple files to a target disk or directory,
    encrypting the data as the copy proceeds.  Such a function is
    particularly useful to users who only need to encrypt data that goes
    offsite to remote users, or backups.

			PC-Lock V1.1-1
			==============

Overview
---------

PC-Lock allows the user of a PC to 'Lock' a DOS session, thereby inhibiting
unauthorised usage of the machine during short absences such as lunchbreak.

The PC-Lock program prompts the user for a password (and re-prompts for
verification), and then prevents any further use of the machine until
the correct password is re-entered.

Once PC-Lock has activated (by entering a valid password and verification)
there are only 2 ways to de-activate it:

	1: Enter the correct password
	2: Re-boot the machine (By power-off/on)

Re-booting the machine is a rather ham-fisted way of gaining access to the
machine, and will be obvious to the legitimate user, who will then investigate
who has been using the machine in his absence.

			PC-Merlin V2.0-1
			================


Overview
---------

PC-Merlin implements the DOS 'copy' program with data encryption. This
allows the user to copy multiple files to a target disk or directory,
encrypting the data as the copy proceeds.

Such a function is particularly useful to users who need exchange
sensitive data with remote users, or who need to keep offsite backups
of such data.

PC-Merlin encrypts data using the DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm
in ECB, CBC, CFB, CFB8, OFB, OFB8 modes. There is currently no known general
solution to this algorithm.


PC-Merlin syntax
----------------

    MERLIN input output /K:keyvalue /E /D /S /B /M:mode /V:vector

       input         The source file(s)
       output        The destination file(s)
       /K:keyvalue   Keyphrase or DES 64 bit hex key
       /E            Encrypt the input
       /D            Decrypt the input
       /S            Secure erase the source after processing
       /B            Brief mode - suppress block counting for speed
       /M:mode       DES mode: ECB, CBC, CFB, CFB8, OFB, OFB8, default is ECB
       /V:vector     Initialization vector, default is 12-34-56-78-90-ab-cd-ef


The input & output files must be supplied as parameters 1 & 2 respectively.
The order in which the switches are supplied is unimportant.


Keyvalue expression:

The keyvalue may be entered in one of 2 forms:

	1. 64 bit Hex. This is a 64 bit or 8 byte Hex value entered thus:

		/K:1F-6C-F1-37-1A-D4-71-0F

	2. Keyphrase. This is any arbitrary sequence of characters such as
	   an easily remembered phrase. The minimum length allowed is 8 
	   chars, maximum 64 chars. Two rules should be considered when
	   selecting keyphrases:

		1. Easily remembered phrases are often easily guessable
		2. Long phrases produce more secure keys than short ones

	   An example of a good (ie: secure) keyphrase would be:

		/K:slowaheadallengines

Cipher function:

The user selects the cipher function, Encrypt or Decrypt with the /E or /D
switches. /E indicates that encryption is required, /D indicates that dec-
-ryption is required. If both switches are specified, then the last one on
the command line has precedence.


Secure erase:

It is often desirable to erase the input file after processing. This option
is selectable by specifying the /S switch. The secure erase function erases
files by repeatedly overwriting them with a changing pattern. After the file
data has been overwritten, it is then deleted.


Example:

A user wishes to copy all data from a directory to floppy, which will be 
stored off-site:

	C:> merlin c:\secrets\*.DBF a: /K:nevertalktostrangers /E

The user may choose to erase data after it has been copied thus:

	C:> merlin c:\secrets\*.DBF a: /K:nevertalktostrangers /E /S


If the data had to restored from floppy, then the following command would
be used:

	C:> merlin a:*.* c:\secrets\*.DBF /K:nevertalktostrangers /D


New features in this release
----------------------------

F1  DES chaining modes implemented. All common DES modes are now supported,
    these being:

	ECB  - Electronic code book 		(Default)
	CBC  - Cipher block chaining    	(Recommended)
	CFB  - Cipher feedback (64 bit)
	CFB8 - Cipher feedback (8 bit)		(V. Slow!)
	OFB  - Output feedback (64 bit)
	OFB8 - Output feedback (8 bit)		(V. Slow!)

    If unspecified, ECB mode will be used. Other modes can be selected
    by specification of the /M: switch, for example /M:CBC selects cipher
    block chaining mode.

F2  /V Initialization Vector switch. The initialization vector used in
    CBC, CFB, CFB8, OFB, OFB8 modes may be specified via the /V:vector
    switch. If unspecified, the IV will default to:

		/V:12-34-56-78-90-ab-cd-ef

F3  /B brief mode switch. Specification of this switch causes Merlin to
    not display the current block count during file processing. This 
    improves overall performance.

F4  DES performance. The performance of DES encryption/decryption has been
    improved by 300%.

F5  Secure erase performance. MERLIN now implements the FASTerase erasure
    algorithm, with 300% performance improvement.

## OZY.TXT

```
I met a traveller from an antique land
who said: two vast and trunkless legs of stone
stand in the desert... near them, on the sand
half-sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
and wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command
tell that its sculptor well those passions read
which yet survive, stamped on those lifeless things,
the hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
and on the pedestal, these words appear:
'My name is OZYMANDIAS, king of kings,
look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!'
Nothing besides remains, round the decay
of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare.
The lone and level sands stretch far away.
