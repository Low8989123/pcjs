    include:
    
    ~ Reads 8 to 30 point mono and proportional fonts.
    
    ~ No font selection required, just hit Start.
    
    ~ Supports HP Scanjet directly.
    
    ~ Supports other scanners via TIFF, compressed TIFF, and .PCX files.
    
    ~ Selectable resolution, including 200 dpi (FAX), and 300 dpi.
    
    ~ Preview and on-line correction modes with graphics adapter.
    
    ~ Mis-recognition flagged with selectable character.
    
    ~ Real-time viewing for text during processing.
    
    ~ Includes both menu-driven and command line interface.
