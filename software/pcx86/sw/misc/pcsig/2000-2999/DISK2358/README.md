## Information about "DATA MASTER"

    DATA MASTER is not your run-of-the-mill dBase III and Lotus 1-2-3 file
    manipulator. Use functions like create, modify, browse, add, and copy
    to create dBase III databases from Lotus 1-2-3 worksheets, change the
    structure of the databases, and design your own custom reports.
    
    The ability to build a powerful query (search filter) is a must for
    today's software needs. With DATA MASTER, you have the most
    sophisticated and easy-to-use query builder you will ever need for your
    data searches.
    
    DATA MASTER can convert Lotus 1-2-3 worksheets into dBase III files and
    back again. With this program in your computer you can do
    everything you need to do, and more, with your dBase III, Lotus 1-2-3,
    and even Symphony worksheets. A full calculator, DOS commands and
    access to your text files anywhere on your hard drive is just a
    keystroke away.
