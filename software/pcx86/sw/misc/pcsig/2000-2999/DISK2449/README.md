## Information about "9 O'CLOCK PERSONAL TIME-TRACKING SYSTEM"

    Now you can manage your time far better than ever before!  9 O'CLOCK
    PERSONAL:
    
    ~Tracks up to nine simultaneous activities, each with its own
    attached-note capabilities.  You can even do so with 9 O'CLOCK entirely
    removed from your computer's memory--even with your computer turned
    off!  And, of course, you may pause, restart, save, and reset clocks at
    any time.
    
    ~9 O'CLOCK may be run like any other ordinary program or as a
    "stay-resident" program instantly available with a "hotkey" of your
    choice.
    
    ~An alarm clock "beeps" and "pops up" your own message at the chosen
    time.
    
    ~The accompanying 9OLOGP Data Base Manager provides total control of
    clock data you file in 9 O'CLOCK's data base.  Edit, print, and
    otherwise manipulate all clock data--even create data for an activity
    which catches you unexpectedly without 9 O'CLOCK handy.  Records may be
    grouped for printing, editing, etc., quickly and easily by date range
    and more--or individually selected at any time.  Sophisticated report
    format options are provided.
    
    ~The data base for filed clock information may be of virtually unlimited
    size.
    
    ~Want to use 9 O'CLOCK's data with another program?  No problem.
    9 O'CLOCK provides automated export to formats usable by virtually any
    external data base, spreadsheet, or word processing program.
