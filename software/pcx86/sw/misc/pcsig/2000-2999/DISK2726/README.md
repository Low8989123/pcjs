Distribution of Programmer's SUPER-MAINT:

This file is intended for professional distributers of shareware, but
the general restrictions contained herein apply to anyone who distributes
SUPER-MAINT, be it one copy or many.

EmmaSoft retains all rights to Programmer's SUPER-MAINT(tm).  SUPER-MAINT 
is protected by United States Copyright Law.  

You may distribute SUPER-MAINT provided you comply with the following 
conditions:


    1.  Professional Distributors of shareware (and other programs) MUST
        contact EmmaSoft before distributing SUPER-MAINT.  In catalogs there
        MUST be a line in the program description describing the registration
        fee, and somewhere in the catalog there must be a satisfactory 
        explanation of the shareware concept, including the facts that all
        rights to this copyrighted program are retained by the copyright
        owner, that shareware is NOT the same as public domain programs, 
        and that registration fee is required if the program is used beyond 
        the trial period.

        As of this writing we are requiring that distribution disks cost a
        user no more than $10.  When you contact us please indicate what you 
        charge for distribution.  Professional distribution is authorized by 
        letter only.  You must have authorization in hand from us BEFORE 
        distributing SUPER-MAINT.

    2.  No files may be changed.  All text and settings must be as shipped
        originally from EmmaSoft.  The original .zip file (SUPER.ZIP) must 
        be used to do this.  When unzipped it has a message confirming the
        authenticity of the files.  This both insures that they are, indeed, 
        the original files, and protects against viruses.

        If you recieved SUPER-MAINT on a distribution disk you must make
        exact copies of all files on the disk.  You may then distribute
        SUPER-MAINT on another disk (containing all the files).  You MUST NOT
        compress the files yourself.  If you recieved a compressed version
        that does not display the message, "Authentic Files Verified", 
        followed by a number and "EmmaSoft Co." it is NOT supported by
        EmmaSoft.  Contact EmmaSoft immediately for a good copy.

    3.  Some professional vendors use their own compression package.  
        EmmaSoft will authorize such distribution on a case by case
        basis.  Please indicate how you plan to distribute SUPER-MAINT.

        If you have SUPER-MAINT on the distribution disk and would like
        to distribute it in .zip format EmmaSoft will gladly provide
        you with a .zip file.  This .zip file displays an authentication
        notice (and "EmmaSoft Co.") that confirms the file came from
        the original author.  This is a protection to our (and your)
        customers against corrupted files and viruses.

Here is a brief product description:
