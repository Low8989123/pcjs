## Information about "PEG SOLITAIRE"

    PEG SOLITAIRE is played on a playing board shaped in the form of a plus
    sign. The board has 33 holes with 32 pegs.  (The center hole of the
    board is left empty.)  The object is to remove all but one of the pegs
    from the board jumping one peg at a time.
    
    COLOR PEG is a second game.  This board has 24 pegs divided into
    different colored groups of 6 pegs each.  The object of this game is to
    jump pegs until all peg groups have exchanged positions.  You win when
    the top and bottom peg groups have swapped places and the right and left
    peg groups have done the same.
    
    Both of these games are simple to operate, but difficult to master. Use
    the keyboard or mouse to move around.

                                  PEG RULES
                                  (Game #1)

       Peg Solitaire is played on a playing board shaped in the form of 
       a plus sign, consisting of 33 holes of which 32 are filled  with 
       pegs.   The center hole of the board is left empty.  The  object 
       is  to remove all the pegs from the board except one.   This  is 
       done  by jumping one peg at a time.  Once you've jumped  a  peg, 
       you must remove the peg you have just jumped.  Play continues in 
       this manner until you are left with one peg or you can no longer 
       make any valid jumps.

                             VALID JUMPS FOR PEG

       You  may  only  jump pegs in either  a  horizontal  or  vertical 
       direction being sure to only jump over one peg at a time.
       

                               COLOR PEG RULES
                                  (Game #2)

       The  Color Peg board is similar to the Peg Board.   It  contains 
       only  24 pegs but has the 9 center holes empty.  These  24  pegs 
       are  divided into 4 groups of 6 pegs each.  Each group  of  pegs 
       are  colored differently.  The top group of pegs are  blue,  the 
       right  side is green, the bottom is purple and the left side  is 
       red.   The  object in this game is to jump pegs until  you  have 
       swapped  peg  groups.  You have won the game when  the  top  and 
       bottom  peg groups have exchanged positions, and the  right  and 
       left peg groups have exchanged positions.


                          VALID JUMPS FOR COLOR PEG
                                 (Hard Mode)
       
       When pegs are jumped, they are left on the board.  They are  not 
       removed  as  in game #1.  You may jump in either  a  horizontal, 
       vertical or diagonal direction so long as only one peg is jumped 
       at  a  time.  Jumps are valid so long as they  stay  within  the 
       confines of the playing board.  IE:  You may not jump across  an 
       inside  corner that would take your line of travel  outside  the 
       game board.


                          VALID JUMPS FOR COLOR PEG
                                 (Easy Mode)

       Valid  jumps for the Easy Mode of play is identical to the  Hard 
       Mode except you will be allow to jump outside the bounds of  the 
       playing  board.   This applies to the immediate  inside  corners 
       only.

       all the Peg loads in all the graphic information located in  the 
       3  Peg.Dat  files.   When all the  information  is  loaded  into 
       memory,  you will hear a beep and see the message to  press  the 
       ENTER key.

       these  will  change to Playing Options  (See  Playing  Options).  
       Your Main Options will display the following:
        
                    F1/ENTER       Play Peg Solitaire
                    F3             Setup Menu
