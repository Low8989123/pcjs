## Information about "NEWQUIZ/QUIZWHIZ"

    NEWQUIZ lets you make tests, quizzes, and trivia games as fast as you
    can type.  Just type in a question, add the multiple choice answers
    (only one correct answer of course), note the correct answer, and you
    have a quiz.  Make up one question; make up as many as your disk will
    hold -- it's that easy.
    
    Then, using QUIZWIZ, take the quizzes you made and test yourself or
    friends.  QUIZWIZ lets up to four people take the same quiz at the same
    time.  It keeps track of right and wrong answers, and the percentage of
    correct answers.
    
    To get you started, QUIZWIZ comes with an example quiz with 900
    questions about the Bible.  Use it to make your own quizzes or just to
    brush up on your Bible trivia.  Either way NEWQUIZ/QUIZWIZ is a winner.

          The following Files should be present on your disk.

          1 - NEWQUIZ.EXE..... To create a new data file or edit one.
                               To print your test.

          2 - QUIZWHIZ.EXE.... To test yourself.

          3 - QUIZWHIZ.QIZ.... Data file

          4 - README.DOC...... Explanation File.


            I wrote the programs to be very user friendly. Both these
          programs use a common data file.

            If you are in school and you find it hard to remember your
          lessons then create a new data file for yourself using
          NEWQUIZ.EXE.  You could create one for each subject at the
          beginning of the year and continue to add questions all year
          long. Whenever you want to review just type QUIZWHIZ and
          select the file you created. When you finish with your review
          the program will automatically switch the answers around. I
          wouldn't want you to remember what letter the answer was
          instead of what the answer is.

          The QUIZWHIZ program is set up to select Random questions.
          I didn't write a routine to check for duplicates so you could
          get the same question more than once.

          ONE THING TO REMEMBER if you type NEWQUIZ and want to start a
                                new file then press 0 when the data
                                 files come up on screen. It will then
                                 ask you for a FileName. 8 letters is
                                 the maximum for a FileName. I'll add
                                 the extention of .QIZ

          If you chose to Print the file the program will ask you if
          you want the Answers also. It will will print with or without
          the answers and it will print either to the Printer or to a
          File. If you select File it will ask you for a name. This
          time you can add whatever extention you want.

          If you print to a file it will put your 3 line header along
          with the date and time at the top of each page. It will put 8
          questions on each page and it will put the page break symbol
          at the end of each page.

          If you find this program useful then you should register it
          with me. The suggested registration fee is $10.00 if you
          received the program through shareware. If you purchased the
          program from a software house then you still should register.
