In your own home you can now be in control of all the speed and         
firepower an F-18 has to offer! Master the instrument panel, learn how  
to climb and dive, turn your radar screen into a combat sighting scope  
and fire 20 MM rounds at the enemy jet, or try the sidewinder missile.  
Keeping an eye on your altimeter, land your jet to refuel and then      
return to the air to engage more enemy aircraft. An excellent combat    
jet simulator.

        Welcome to Miramar Jet Flight Simulator,


        The following guidelines should help you get your F-18 Hornet
        off the carrier deck and flying.

        1)  Press the "9" key to increase throttle to the point at
        which the color changes to red (red line) on the right hand
        linear tach gauge.

        2)  Press the "L" key to launch the steam catapult.

        3)  Press the "3" key to back off the throttle a little else the
        jet will explode from over-revving or extreme heat buildup.

        4)  At this point press the "2" key once to pull back on the
        stick and start climbing.  Don't hold it down else you will do
        a loop and crash in the water.  After the horizon drops a little,
        press the "8" key to hold a steady rate of climb.  Think of the
        keys 4,6,2, and 8 as the left,right,forward, and back directions of
        a control stick.  The stick does not return to center automatically.
        Therefore, if you pull up by pressing "2" you must press "8" to 
        return the control stick to center position and stop climbing.
        Watch the "T" bar gauge on the lower center dash to see where the
        control stick is at any time.

        5)  Once you have gained sufficient altitude (upper right gauge)
        you can start manuevering the jet without crashing into the ground.
        The same rules for climbing and diving apply to turning left and
        right.  The whole idea is to keep the horizon line in sight at all
        times.  If you lose track of which way is up or down, try to stop
        the horizon from moving and look at the artificial horizon gauge.
        The line in this guage follows the true horizon and the red portion
        of the gauge represents ground.  If the top of the gauge is red 
        and the bottom is blue then you are flying inverted.

        6)  At some point in the game an enemy aircraft will appear and
        will randomly start flying in front of you.  If you don't shoot
        him down within a certain amount of time then he will shoot you
        down.  As soon as he appears press "C" to turn your radar screen
        into a combat sighting scope.  Crosshairs should appear in the
        middle of the screen.  The red blip on the scope is the enemy jet, 
        if he goes off your screen then watch the red blip to try and get
        him in your sights.  Now comes the hard part, you must fly your
        jet and try to get the enemy jet in your crosshairs.  As he goes
        through them press the space bar to fire 20 MM rounds at him.  If
        you hit the other jet it will explode and another will appear.  To
        stop playing the game press "Q" to quit and the computer will show
        you your combat record.  

        7)  If you have a hard time shooting at the other jet, try using a
        sidewinder missile.  (Much more effective!).  To do this follow step
        6 except that after you press "C" to get into combat mode, press the
        "S" key to enable sidewinders.  The crosshairs turn into a circle
        and the enemy jet will have a square around him.  Try to get the 
        circle inside the square.  When you do the computer will lock on
        and the lock on light will turn red.  At this point the on board
        flight computer is flying your jet and keeping the enemy's jet 
        locked in your sights.  Now all you do is press either the "Z" key
        or the "X" key to fire left wing or right wing sidewinders.

        8)  At some point you will run low on fuel or ammo.  To get refueled
        you must land your jet on the ground.  Watch your altimeter and start
        descending.  Keep the aircraft level and slowly descend until the 
        altimeter reads 0.  At this point the fuel and ammo gauges should
        be reset and you can climb to engage more enemy aircraft.

        Obviously, this game is a little difficult to get used to due to
        the complexity of the aircraft you are flying.  But, with practice
        you should become an accomplished jet fighter pilot.

                           Good Luck and Have Fun,

                                        Sincerely,

                                               Marc H. Cochran
                                               President
                                               Awesoft, Inc.
