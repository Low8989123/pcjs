## Information about "ORGANIZE!"

    ORGANIZE! -- an innovative, cost-effective PIM (Personal Information
    Manager) for Windows.
    
    No matter how disorganized you are, this program can track all of your
    important projects without the complex and rigid control systems most
    PIMs use.  Cluttered with unused functions, they steepen the learning
    curve unnecessarily.  With ORGANIZE!, add new functions only as you
    need them.  Learn as you go.
    
    One of the easiest-to-use systems ever, ORGANIZE! looks and feels just
    like a diary.  Flip pages like the real thing with binders that click
    open to insert more pages. The Word-in-Context system will manage all
    random AND structured personal information that you enter into the
    diary.  You will never lose your way in this piece of software.
    
    If you are looking for a program to help you record contacts, schedule
    appointments, track projects, or control random notes and ideas, this
    may be for you.

## CONVERT.TXT

{% raw %}
```
This document is only for registered users of Organize!.

You are provided with a utility to convert your information 
invested in the shareware evaluation version of Organize!. This
utility allows you to convert your data files making it readable with
the new password that comes with registration.

How to Use the utility.
---------------------
The utility program is convert.exe.
The command structure

   convert <keycode> <data file name>

e.g. convert ABCDEFXY myfile.dn

This would convert a user data file myfile.dn built with password 'share'
to myfile.dn1 that would be readable with the registered version of Organize!
with a password built with keycode ABCDEFXY. 

Backup your existing myfile.dn and rename myfile.dn1 to myfile.dn or any
filename with extension .dn

Welcome to Organize!. The most innovative, easiest to use and most cost
effective PIM (Personal Information Manager) for Microsoft(R) Windows(TM).

BEFORE YOU GO ON
----------------
You can get the latest version from Compuserve Windows Forum or send me a
cheque equivalent to US$7 and your contact address, so that I can mail you 
the latest version as soon as possible. Please specify 3.5 inch or 5.25 inch
format.

You should explore the Word in Context/Keyword system of data management.
Under the Page menu, use the Page Keywords to look at the example keywords.

Read the Write document manual.wri if you have problems. It is only 7 short
pages.

Converting from earlier versions to 1.3
--------------------------------------
A significant new feature in this version is the ability of Organize! to print
a report to a Word Processor. This would allow you to review the report before
printing on the printer. To do this properly, you would have to use the
End Note feature (Activated with F2 or from the Edit menu) to tell Organize!
where to stop at the end of each entry.


WHAT IS ORGANIZE!
-----------------
Organize! looks and feels exactly like a diary, making it one of the easiest 
to use software ever. No matter how disorganized you are, Organize! can 
organize it all for you and without sticking to a system that all PIMs 
impose on their customers and there is no need to plough through thick 
manuals. Because of its innovative design, you add functions as you need 
them. There are no unnecessary functions to clutter your way, steepening 
the learning curve unnecessarily. 

Organize! can flip pages like the real thing with binders that click open
to insert pages. But most important, it uses a Word in Context system to
manage random and structured personal information that you enter into the 
diary. With this system you will never loose your way again in a software.

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------
This document supercedes all documentation of earlier versions of Organize!.
Those who have registered with earlier versions can automatically use the
earlier keycode and registration number to register. Upgrade from earlier
versions is free at the moment.


THE SHAREWARE CONCEPT (USER SUPPORTED SOFTWARE)
----------------------------------------------
You are encouraged to copy and share the program freely with others.  
You have the luxury of trying out the complete program, at your own pace 
in the luxury of your own home or workplace. If, after trying out the 
programs, you decide to continue to use them, you can purchase the programs
from the program's author, a process known as registration.

When you share this software with others, please include all the files as
shown in the packing list. Compress it in library format if you are 
uploading onto any BBS.

REGISTRATION
------------
If you find this program useful you should register to get a personal 
version. Registration fee is only US$35. Please look at order.txt for 
details.

Why you should register
-----------------------
1. You get your personal Organize! with a password of your choice. This 
   would keep your information confidential as they are encrypted with your
   password as the key. Password must be between 4 and 10 characters long.
   With encryption, another copy of Organize! with a different password
   cannot read your files and yours cannot read others likewise.

2. Inexpensive upgrade offers. (Free upgrades at the moment)

3. Be informed of updates.

4. The opportunity to shape the future of this product.

5. Free and unlimited technical support on Compuserve, letter or fax. 

6. A sense of pride in having honestly participated in the Shareware
   revolution.


Future Versions
---------------
I have received many wonderful suggestions. To keep you folks from waiting too 
long, I will release each version with additional features as fast as I can 
build them.

Version 2 is also in the works and would include enhanced features like support 
for DDE, book marking, more complete data manipulation, changeable passwords 
and yet with data encryption etc. This would be a major release

Asia. The U.S. is our main investor and source of ideas, with over 600 
corporations and billions of dollars invested. Ashton Tate, Lotus and 
Xerox has software development centres here. My country is in an exciting 
period of change, one of the engines that is leading the Asia Pacific in 
its current expansion. Together with the West Coast, Japan and the other 
NIEs, we are significantly contributing to the coming Pacific Century.

Version History
---------------
Version 1    - Runs only in Windows 2 and the real mode of Windows 3.
(June '90)
Version 1.1  - Runs in all the memory modes of Windows 3.
(July '90)
Version 1.2  - Deletes blank pages, optional password, accept command line
(Aug '90)      parameters, load .dn files and/or run Organize! using the 
               WIN.INI file. Page to the Keywords page quickly.
Version 1.3  - Ability to produce reports in a Word Processor and printing.
(Oct '90)      Launches Windows Calendar and the on line manual from within
               the software.
               No more drop dead date of 12/91. No longer 'crippled' in
               any way.
               A new Personal Organizer icon
	       On Line manual that launches Windows Write and the manual.
	       Launches Windows Calendar program
               This is the first WIN 3 specific version.

The Future  -  Ver 2 is in the works. Support for DDE is planned, plus the
               following
               1. It own calendar program.
               2. A new Context Sensitive Help System.
               3. A significant improvement in the Word In Context System.
                  You can read my ideas on version 2 in the example data
                  file example.dn. The keyword is 'Ver 2:'
               4. If or when high res 1024x768 becomes standard. A larger
                  book Organize! would be built and I would plan to 
                  include Graphics capability. At the moment the page 
                  size is too small for this.
         
               No more version 1.X series is planned, unless I receive
               too many common and overwhelming suggestions again.
