Author Registration: $59.00                                             
Special Requirements: Hard drive.                                       
                                                                        
This program is all that a pilot could hope for in a pre-flight planner.
                                                                        
The CLEARANCE FLIGHT PLANNING SYSTEM allows a pilot to pick any starting
point and destination within the U.S. and Canada and have a route       
displayed showing the MEA, MOA's, Victor airway, Jet airways,           
intersections, etc., along the route of flight.                         
                                                                        
It will:                                                                
                                                                        
~ Generate a route from city to city using common names (e.g. Chicago to
New York (not ORD to JFK)                                               
                                                                        
~ Once the flight plan is generated, the return flight is displayed with
a single keystroke                                                      
                                                                        
~ Generate a route from and including way points such as LAT-LONG       
co-ordinates, DME radial and distance, intersection names, and          
VOR-to-VOR                                                              
                                                                        
~ The NavAid (navigational aid) frequencies and their LAT-LONG positions
can be printed out and taken along the flight                           
                                                                        
~ The distances between each point, its elevation, and MEA (or obstacle 
clearance) are also printed                                             
                                                                        
~ Up to 5000 flight plans can be stored for easy reference.  Use as is  
or edit for any special circumstances that may arise.                   
                                                                        
CLEARANCE FLIGHT PLANNING SYSTEM, especially when linked with the       
WEATHER STATION (PC-SIG #2702) and WEIGHT AND BALANCE (available only   
through the author), will provide any pilot with the most thorough      
pre-flight planning imaginable.                                         
                                                                        
This program is not for the novice pilot.  Its best utility would be    
found in the higher performance, instrument-rated environment.
