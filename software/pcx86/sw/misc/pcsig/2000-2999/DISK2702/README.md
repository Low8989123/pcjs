Disk Title: Weather Station                                             
PC-SIG Version: S1                                                      
                                                                        
Program Title: Weather Station                                          
Author Version: 3/91                                                    
Author Registration: $49.95                                             
Special Requirements: PC-SIG #2699-#2701, hard drive, modem, & DUAT memb
                                                                        
This program can be an invaluable aid to those pilots who have problems 
understanding and deciphering the government's computer weather program 
(DUAT).  The WEATHER STATION will collate and print, in plain English,  
any forecast a pilot could want for pre-flight planning.                
                                                                        
The WEATHER STATION, when coupled with the CLEARANCE FLIGHT PLANNING    
SYSTEM (#2699-#2701), will retrieve the weather and forecasts, calculate
and file a flight plan, and automatically provide the pilot with an     
accurate, weather-corrected flight plan.                                
                                                                        
As a stand-alone program, the WEATHER STATION is fully compatible with  
DUAT and can be customized for just about any weather vendor.  All of   
the significant weather prognoses can be accessed by this program in an 
easily-understood format.
