## Information about "VACATION PLANNER"

    The nicest thing to happen to car trips since highways, VACATION
    PLANNER gives you personalized trip information on the shortest route,
    cities en route, mileage, and travel time.  It takes your starting
    city, all the interesting intermediate spots where you want to
    sightsee, and your destination city, and calculates the shortest route.
    It also tells you the distance between each town along the way, and the
    time and distance it takes.
    
    VACATION PLANNER manages to give you all this information quite
    painlessly.  There is step-by-step documentation if you feel you need
    it, and a special two page "Easy-Doc" instruction set for all of us
    impatient people.  VACATION PLANNER offers clear menu choices and an
    option that keeps the instructions on screen while you follow them.
    VACATION PLANNER comes with a general USA map and detailed California
    state map.
    
    VACATION PLANNER doesn't ask much of you and gives back a lot.
    If you're planning any trips out of town this year, plan to consult
    VACATION PLANNER first.  Don't leave home without it!
