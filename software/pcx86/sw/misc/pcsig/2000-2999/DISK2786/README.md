QUIZ-MAKER is an educational tool and a Trivia game.  Take quizzes in
three formats -- match the question with the answer, type in an answer
to the question or choose the correct answer from the four or five
answers listed.

QUIZ-MAKER has two modules.  QUIZPLAY lets you play the quizzes.
QUIZMAKE is the Development module used to create quizzes.  Of course,
there's no challenge to solving quizzes you've created yourself, so
create them for others -- your spouse, children, friends, colleagues or
the world at large.  Give them a copy of  QUIZPLAY and the quizzes
you've created, and let them have fun meeting your challenge.

Upload quizzes to your favorite Bulletin Boards or Compuserve (the IBM
NEW WordGames Forum or the Education Forum).  Become known for your
ability to create Trivia quizzes.  (Your name will be displayed on the
files you create!)

The user-friendly nature of the menus and the online hints make this an
easy program to use.
