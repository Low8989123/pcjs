Author Registration: $25.00                                             
Special Requirements: 640K RAM, a hard drive, and DOS 3.3.              
                                                                        
DAYO is a collection of multiuser business applications that provide a  
means of managing inventory, purchasing, invoicing, customers, vendors, 
sales and more... All DAYO products are multiuser, designed to work on a
Microcomputer (PC) Based Local Area Network (LAN), like Novell (tm).    
They can, however, work as a 'standalone', running on a single PC.      
                                                                        
To date, large and complex mulituser business applications required Mini
and Mainframe computers, but because of products like the PC based LAN/ 
Network, they can now be run on microcomputers. DAYO is one of the first
microcomputer based business applications designed to handle such a     
system.                                                                 
                                                                        
DAYO BAR CODE prints 3 of 9 bar codes onto an Epson (tm) or IBM (tm)    
compatible dot matrix printer. It is integrated with the DAYO Inventory 
and the DAYO Customer databases. It can be used as a standalone         
application if you just have a limited number of labels to print, or    
have no use for an inventory control or account receivable application. 
Labels are printed onto standard labels (3.5 by 15/16 inches at 6 lines 
per inch). The inventory bar code label consists of an item number, its 
bar code, with the option to also print the vendor item number,         
description, unit of issue, weight, and bin/location. The customer bar  
code label consists of a customer number, its bar code, with the option 
to also print the customer's name and telephone number.                 
                                                                        
Inventory and Customer bar codes can be printed by 'browsing' through   
their respected databases using multiple indexes. When a desired item or
customer is found, just press enter to print. Batch printing of item bar
codes is possible based on the item type, class, location, receipts, and
purchase orders.                                                        
                                                                        
DAYO Business Applications grow with your company. The ability to       
upgrade your system is available with the addition of other DAYO        
products. Source to DAYO is also available, allowing you to make further
modifications and enhancements. DAYO Clock was written with Qbasic (tm);
all others were written with Clipper (tm).

DAYO databases are all dBASE (tm) compatible, thus providing an         
additional or alternative source of support and reporting.

║  This DAYO module comes in a self-extracting compressed format.         ║
║  You will require a hard drive or high density drive, 640K RAM, and     ║
║  DOS 3.3 in order to install the program to your computer.              ║
║  Please NOTE your CONFIG.SYS file must exist on your boot disk/drive,   ║
║  and it must have (as a minimum), BUFFERS=30, and FILES=55.             ║
║  Run a DAYO program to create this file should you not have one, or     ║
║  do not know how to create/edit it.                                     ║
║                                                                         ║
║  If you are installing the entire DAYO system, then we recommend        ║
║  that you use the DAYO SETUP disk. It will create the necessary         ║
║  directories and copy the files. After running SETUP, run MENU.BAT      ║
║  from the \DAYO directory. Enter/select each of the modules from the    ║
║  menu, and if the module is present the program will handle the         ║
║  creation of all databases, index and configuration files.              ║
║                                                                         ║
║  For manual installation, create a subdirectory called DAYOBAR, and     ║
║  copy all the files from the distrubution disks, then switch to the     ║
║  that subdirectory and type; DAYO39. Once the files are uncrunched,     ║
║  type DAYOBAR to start, or COPY DAYOBAR.DOC to print the documentation  ║
║                                                                         ║
