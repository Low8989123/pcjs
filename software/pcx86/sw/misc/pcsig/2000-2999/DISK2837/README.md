The Market Chartist, an interactive computer-based tutorial, was created
to help you to become more informed and self-reliant in your investment
decision making. A basic understanding of technical market analysis is
an important part of a well-rounded investor's knowledge regardless of
investment strategy. The tutorial introduces you to the construction and
interpretation of several market charts used by technical market
analysts to guide their investment decisions including moving averages,
momentum, advance-decline lines, trading volume, and trendlines.

Computer-based instruction provides a high-interest learning medium. The
tutorial stimulates student involvement by providing an interactive
educational environment. Questions embedded in the self-paced
instruction reinforce course content and provide students with
individualized feedback concerning their progress. The Market Chartist
features a 40-page Course Notebook of illustrations and worksheets,
which can be printed from within the program.
