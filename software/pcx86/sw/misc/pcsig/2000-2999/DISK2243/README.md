## Information about "GENESIS: SERIES II 2 OF 2 (2242 ALSO)"

    Turn your computer into a check-writing machine with GENESIS: SERIES
    II. It's an easy-to-use home check writing program. So simple, in fact,
    that anyone who now maintains a checkbook by hand already knows the
    basics. The display screens even look just like your checkbook --right
    down to the names on the checks.
    
    GENESIS automatically does all the calculations that you do now hand,
    but it won't make any mistakes. Balance your checkbook in a fraction of
    the usual time, and if you are out of balance, it will help you find
    and correct the error. Print your checks, configured to your specific
    printer. You don't even need special checks -- the check on the screen
    will look similar to the one you are using.
    
    Keep track of tax deductions or anything else that you want to
    categorize. Search for a check written months ago with only the barest
    of information, and then get a report on the findings. Checks that you
    write to the same companies over and over will be kept in memory, ready
    to be used at the push of a key. Tired of addressing envelopes? The
    program does it for you. To keep prying eyes out, give GENESIS a
    password and your checkbook is locked. There is also multiple
    checkbook support.

              MANUAL

              Before you do another thing, read the  Genesis  manual.   This
              manual can be sent to your printer by typing  PRINTDOC  at the
              A: prompt with the Help Disk in Drive A.


              STRIPDOC

              If you are going to use  Genesis  from  a  floppy drive or two
              floppy drives and not a hard disk,  it  is advisable to remove
              the manual file from the  operating  (Backup Help Disk)  disk.
              This will free up valuable  space  on this disk if it is to be
              used to hold the data files.   This  can  be  done  by  typing
              STRIPDOC from the DOS prompt with the  Help Disk  in the drive
              or simply deleting the file named  "GENASCII.V20"  if  you are
              familiar with  DOS commands.   MAKE SURE YOU HAVE REMOVED THIS
              FILE FROM THE  HELP DISK  THAT  YOU  WILL BE USING AND NOT THE
              ORIGINAL DISK AND MAKE SURE YOU  ALREADY  HAVE  ALREADY MADE A
              HARD COPY OF THE MANUAL AS  DESCRIBED  IN  THE PARAGRAPH ABOVE
              ENTITLED "MANUAL"!


              HARD DRIVE INSTALLATION

              The hard drive installation programs  (INSHD1 & INSHD2) assume
              that the  user is installing  Genesis to  Hard Drive "C"  from
              Floppy Drive "A".   If  you  are  not using this configuation,
              simply make a subdirectory of  your hard drive named "GENESIS"
              and then copy all the  files  from the supplied floppy disk to
              that subdirectory  (Refer  to  your  DOS manual if you are not
              sure how to do this).


              GENESIS PROGRAM FILES

              The list of files  in  Appendix D of the Genesis manual may be
              slightly  different  than  those  actually  shipped  on   your
              Genesis: Series II disk.    This is due to continuing improve-
              ments to the program that have been made since the manual went
              to  print.  This  will  not  affect the program's performance.


              MANUAL SECTION 3.0 - BEGINNING YOUR CHECKBOOK

              Your beginning balance must not exceed  $9,999.99.  If you are
              fortunate  enough  to be in this situation  (you obviously are
              not married or have children)  simply  enter  the  amount over
              $9,999.99  as  a  deposit to the checkbook (See Section 4.11).
