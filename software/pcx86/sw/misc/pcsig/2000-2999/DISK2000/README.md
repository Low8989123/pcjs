Roll the computer dice to move around the board.  Which type of square  
you land on, determines what type of question you get.  Sound familiar? 
Catagories include animals, entertainment, geography, history, sports,  
Bible, famous people, and misc.                                         
                                                                        
The object of the game is to accumulate the largest number of points    
before any player lands on the "Final Question" which is located in the 
middle of the screen.  Players are rewarded points for answering        
questions correctly, landing on the $ square, or if another player lands
on a "claimed" square, and if the final question is answered correctly. 
Players have points subtracted for incorrectly answering a question or  
for landing on a "claimed" square.

                                    OBJECT


    The object of the game is to accumulate the largest  number  of  points
    before any player lands on the "Final Question" which is located in the
    middle of the screen.


                                    POINTS


    Players are rewarded points for answering questions correctly,  landing
    on  the $ square, or if another player lands on a "claimed" square, and
    if the final question is answered correctly.

    Players  have points subtracted for incorrectly answering a question or
    for landing on a "claimed" square.

                                   QUESTIONS


    Squares which have a question are identified by having an A,B,C or D in
    them.   These  letters  correspond  to the category listed on the upper
    right portion of the screen.  Points for answering questions  correctly
    are as follows:

                        Level One       -   500 Points
                        Level Two       -  1000 Points
                        Level Three     -  1500 Points
                        Final Question  - 10000 Points

    When  a  player  lands  on  an A,B,C or D square, that category will be
    shown on the upper right of the screen.  A question will  be  displayed
    with  four  possible  answers  if  you are playing with multiple choice
    answers, or just the question if you  are  not  playing  with  multiple
    choice answers.

    If  you  are  playing with answers shown, the computer will ask you for
    your choice (1,2,3 or 4). You have 30 seconds to answer that  question.
    The  30  second clock will appear on the upper right of the screen.  If
    you answer the question incorrectly or if your time  runs  out,  points
    will be subtracted from your score.

    If  you  are  playing  without the answer shown, you have 30 seconds to
    decide on the correct answer and tell it to the other  players.   Press
    the  return key to see the correct answer.  If your answer was correct,
    press the "Y" key after the question "Were you correct  (Y/N)"  appears
    on  the screen. If your answer was not correct, press the "N" key after
    the same question appears on the screen.

    Points subtracted for incorrect answers are as follows:

           Level One       - 25 Points times the number on the dice
           Level Two       - 35 Points times the number on the dice
           Level Three     - 50 Points times the number on the dice

    After a player answers a question correctly, then that player  "claims"
    the  square.   That  player's  token  will appear on the square for the
    remainder of the game.  Each time another player lands on  a  "claimed"
    square,  points  are subtracted from that player's score and points are
    added to the player who has "claimed" the square as follows:

                         Level One       - 125 Points
                         Level Two       - 250 Points
                         Level Three     - 750 Points

                                 BONUS POINTS


    Bonus points are awarded each time a player lands on the "$" square and
    when the first player reaches the "?" (FINAL QUESTION) square.

    Bonus points for the "$" square are as follows:

                         Level One       - 250 Points
                         Level Two       - 500 Points
                         Level Three     - 750 Points

    Bonus points for the "?" are as follows:

                        Correct Answer   + 10000 Points
                        Incorrect Answer - 10000 Points







                               WINNING THE GAME


    The final question is located in the center of the game  board  and  is
    worth  10,000  points.   The  computer  will determine a player's final
    question from the subject category in  which  they  achieved  the  most
    incorrect answers. The player with the most points wins the game!

                HAVE FUN AND ENJOY PLAYING PASS-AROUND TRIVIA!
