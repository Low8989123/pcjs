INTRODUCTION

386TEST (TM) is a diagnostic program designed to test motherboards and
system components. Computational loads on the processor, and numeric
processor (if present) exceed by orders of magnitude the use a computer
would receive in a commercial environment in a 24 hour period.

This program tests all of the system's resources including the BIOS,
CPU, NDP, CACHE, RAM, EXTENDED MEMORY and DISPLAY MEMORY. Once started
386TEST (TM) will run for 24 hours.


DISCLAIMER

THIS PROGRAM TESTS A COMPUTER USING TESTS DESIGNED TO DETECT DEFECTIVE,
UNRELIABLE, OR IMPROPERLY RATED COMPONENTS. THIS PROGRAM WILL CAUSE
YOUR SYSTEM TO RUN AT TEMPERATURES FAR IN EXCESS OF NORMAL OPERATING
TEMPERATURES FOR A 24 HOUR PERIOD. THIS WILL SUBJECT YOUR COMPUTER TO
HIGHER THAN NORMAL USE AND STRESS DURING THE TEST PERIOD.

SYSTEMS WHICH USE LOW QUALITY COMPONENTS CAN BE PERMANENTLY DAMAGED BY
THIS PROGRAM! THE AUTHOR, DISTRIBUTOR AND LICENSEES OF THIS PROGRAM
CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, REAL OR OTHERWISE CAUSED BY
THIS PROGRAM.

ANY USE OF THIS PROGRAM SIGNIFIES THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THIS WARNING AND
WISH TO SUBJECT YOUR SYSTEM TO THESE TYPES OF TESTS AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE
FACT THAT YOUR COMPUTER MAY NOT OPERATE AFTER BEING TESTED.


RUNNING 386TEST (TM)

1) BEFORE running the program, please disable any memory managers you
   may be loading from your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file. A DOS
   Extender which handles all memory management tasks is incorporated
   into the program.

2) Copy 386TEST.EXE and 386TEST.SYS to the directory where you want to
   install the software. You should not run this program from the
   distribution diskette. It is advisable to copy and run this program
   from your hard disk drive.

3) DO NOT turn off your monitor during this test. You can turn the
   brightness down to prevent burn-in of the monitor screen if you
   desire but DO NOT turn off the monitor.


WHAT IS 386TEST (TM) ALL ABOUT

This program is designed to put your system through an electronic
torture test. It works on the principle that most problems appear due
to either poor engineering, defects during assembly or the use of
improperly rated components.

386TEST's intensive testing will bring the system's components to
extremely high operating temperature and subject them to extremely high
operational stresses. Design or component flaws will show up by hanging
the system or causing the system to perform warm or cold boots.

The best time to use this program is when you receive your brand new
computer. While you won't be able to use your new computer for one day,
it is better to locate any problems as soon as possible. If your system
passes the 24 hour test, it should keep running.

If you find that your system hangs or reboots, then something is wrong
with your computer. This program is used by a computer manufacturer to
test their computers in a 110 degree burn-in room for 48 hours. Any
computer with high quality, properly rated components can run this test
for weeks without crashing.

After the initial test and before the warranty expires run this test
three times, or a total of seventy two hours, just to make sure you can
detect any problems and get them fixed before the warranty expires.


NEW FEATURES IN 386TEST (TM)

1) 386TEST (TM) now runs multiple background tasks while the main test
   program is running. Background tasks are added on an on-going basis
   to increase the load on the processor, memory and system bus.

2) A DOS Extender is incorporated into the program and allows 386TEST
   (TM) to test additional memory found in above the normal 640k memory
   allocated for DOS programs.

3) The algorithms used in 386TEST (TM) have been changed and increase
   the processor load by approximately thirty percent over previous
   versions of the program.

4) Video RAM testing cycles have been increased to place a heavier load
   on the video display card during the test period.

5) Portions of the program have been ported to machine language
   allowing more tests to be run in a given period of time.

6) The documentation has been changed to reflect program updates.

7) Due to the immense popularity of this program the registration fee
   has been lowered!

8) 386TEST (TM) requires that an 80386, 80486 or 80586 processor be
   present in the system being tested.


WARNING

Do NOT touch any of the components during testing. You can easily get
burned as the components get VERY hot! The system case SHOULD be closed
to insure that normal ventilation procedures are in use.

This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
700 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'GO' at the
DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy access
to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.

The Narc utility, newly instituted with the tenth edition, allows you to
look directly at all the compressed program files on the CD without
having to download the program to your hard disk.  So if you want to
look at the programmer's notes or on-line documentation before using
valuable hard disk space, you can.

The PC-SIG Encyclopedia of Shareware is included on the disk, and a
printed copy of the book is included so you can peruse the available
programs from the comfort of your favorite chair.  All the programs are
logically divided into one-hundred twenty categories making it easier to
find just the right software.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

WARPSPEED is a shareware keyboard utility which will dramatically speed 
up the repetition rate of your keyboard, and it does it without overrun 
(when you release the key you have been holding down and the key        
continues to repeat).  In addition, WARPSPEED does it using less than 1K
of memory.                                                              
                                                                        
Highly customizable, parameters can be specified when WARPSPEED is      
loaded or at any other time through the DOS command line or a batch     
file. You can turn WARPSPEED on or off, cause a speed-up delay, control 
overrun and repetition rate per second, unload it and reclaim memory,   
and display a reminder screen of WARPSPEED's parameters.                
Program Title: VIz                                                      
Author Version: 4.20                                                    
Author Registration: $25.00 (plus S&H)                                  
Special Requirements: MDA/EGA/VGA or Hercules HGC/HGC+ and hard drive.  
                                                                        
VIZ is a small resident program that accelerates BIOS (and DOS) video   
input and output in text mode; it can be used with IBM-compatible MDA,  
EGA or VGA adapter cards and Hercules HGC and HGC+ cards. In its        
present version, VIZ produces video interference ("snow") in old CGA    
cards; for such systems you can use VIz-CGA, a snow-free, 8088-CPU      
oriented version.                                                       
                                                                        
In addition, VIZ includes an independent, resident component for        
displaying a block cursor, either continuously or alternating with a    
line cursor at an adjustable rate of alternation.  The latter display is
well suited for easy localization of the cursor in some laptop screens. 
                                                                        
Finally, VIZ also contains an independent, resident ANSI-filter driver  
that mediates a subset of the ANSI escape sequences to control the      
console. This filter can be used, instead of ANSI.SYS, to implement ANSI
escape sequences to control video display, with the advantage that can  
be turned off and on, and removed from memory without rebooting.        
                                                                        
All 3 resident modules occupy a total of less than about 1800 bytes of  
RAM. Depending on the system configuration and BIOS version, video      
accelerations by a factor of between 2 and 10 have been obtained.       
Program Title: UMAx                                                     
Author Version: 1.20                                                    
Author Registration: See documentation.                                 
Special Requirements: High memory manager.                              
                                                                        
UMAx allows for the testing of a number of services of the extended     
memory manager, which implements the extended memory specification in   
80286-based or higher machines.  The testing includes upper-memory block
services, and provides a list of the size and address of available      
upper-memory blocks.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.


To Order, in the U.S.A.: Call 800-245-6717 and ask Customer Service.
