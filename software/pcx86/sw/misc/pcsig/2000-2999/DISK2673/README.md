## FILE2673.TXT

{% raw %}
```
Disk No: 2673
Disk Title: EGL_RISE
PC-SIG Version: S1.1

Program Title: EGL_RISE
Author Version: 6/91
Author Registration: $25.00 for game, and $39.00 for game creator.
Special Requirements: None.

EGL_RISE comes is made up of two large games. Twenty game levels are
similar to other arcade games such as Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Space
Invaders. Each level is different enough to be a game in itself.  The
25-level adventure series is called the ``Rise & Fall of the Human
Race''. Both games offer excellent graphics

On each level you have a different objective to accomplish -- collect
all the treasures or objects, find your way to a certain destination,
destroy all the monsters, defuse a bomb, etc.  The level ends when you
are hit by a monster or trapped so that you cannot escape.  Some levels
have a timer and you must complete the level before the time runs out.
Some games are played like an arcade game, but in others you must take
your time in order to plan your strategy.

EGL_RISE is compatible with all graphic cards, including CGA, EGA, VGA,
Hercules and monochrome text adapters.  Modify the graphics of the game
characters with a draw function, creating your own style for each game.
You can even create your own games when you register.
