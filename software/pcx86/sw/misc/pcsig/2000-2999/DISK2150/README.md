## Information about "HUGO'S HOUSE OF HORRORS"

    If you are looking for an exciting, fun filled game, HUGO's HOUSE OF
    HORRORS will fit the bill.  Take your hero through an animated
    adventure, solving puzzles, finding hidden objects, and rescuing the
    sweet Penelope from the hosts of the demonic mansion.  At the same time
    stay alive and don't let yourself be turned into dog food!  The
    graphics are fantastic!
    
    Programmmer David P. Gray creates a colorful and challenging world for
    the player. Full moving character pix, furnished rooms, hidden doors, a
    mad doctor, a vicious dog, and much more await any enthusiastic
    adventurer.  Maneuver your character with the arrow keys while simple
    written commands let you take and use items, search and talk.  As you
    solve the puzzles your score increases and is compared to the total
    score possible with the game.  For registered users a free hintbook is
    available as well as the capability to play back previous games.
    
    Similar in concept to LucasFilm's Maniac Mansion, HUGO'S HOUSE OF
    HORRORS, though less complex, is as easy to use and as much fun.  You
    will be glued to the screen for hours as you track your way through the
    haunted halls trying to save your sweetheart from the crazed
    inhabitants.  A treat for all ages.
