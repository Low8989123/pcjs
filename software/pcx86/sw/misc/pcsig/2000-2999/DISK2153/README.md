HOW DO YOU USE FOOTBALL COMPU-SCHED?

First copy the files from this diskette to a work diskette or your 
hard disk.  There should be three files: CSCHED.EXE, CSCHED.ANN, and 
CSCHED.DOC.  See your DOS manual if you need to learn how to do this. 

Note that Football Compu-Sched also creates a data file containing 
scores entered by the user.  These scores are stored in the file 
NFL89.SCR.  Depending on where you obtained Football Compu-Sched, this 
file may or may not be on the diskette.

RUNNING FOOTBALL COMPU-SCHED

You then see the title screen while the data is being loaded.  

Once the data has been loaded, the program will beep.  Press ENTER. 

Next you'll see the copyright screen.  

Press ENTER again. 

You'll now see the main screen.

whole program can be run using the function keys on the left side of your 
keyboard.

       will show up as zeroes.  These standings are calculated based 
       upon scores entered by the user.

       user changeable and are hard coded.

            ESC = Return to the secondary menu.

F6 Displays the results of last year's playoff games.  
Pressing ENTER returns you to the main menu.

ESC Returns you to DOS.  If you have made any changes to scores, then 
an updated version of the data file NFL90.SCR will be written to the 
disk at this time.

And that's it!!  Sit back, kick off your shoes, grab a beer and you're 
set for the new season.  If you're a diehard fan, look for our other 
shareware products aimed at football fans -  Football Scoreboard and
