## Information about "ELFTREE"

    If you want to get the most out of your computer, here's an integrated
    file and directory manager to help you get the job done.
    
    Copy, move, protect, edit, print, rename, locate and hide files
    quickly and easily. Rename, protect, hide, locate, copy, move, make
    and remove directories just as easily. Sort the file display 14 ways.
    You have eight ways of tagging a group of files for use. ELFTREE will
    remember your last 15 commands and give you a convenient way to
    retrieve them when desired. You may also attach short notes to files
    in any directory.
    
    There's an editor that can handle as many files as will fit into RAM.
    It will let you edit multiple files by tagging them and selecting a
    menu option. It has 11 storable keyboard macros for complex editing, a
    speedy search-and-replace, many block commands (cut, paste, copy, save,
    print, convert to upper, lower, proper case), and it's small!
    
    Instruct ELFTREE to run a program for you by simply pointing to it and
    pressing ENTER. ELFTREE can be programmed to recognize up to 40
    extensions per directory, so your applications are automatically
    launched with the corresponding data file. When you use ELFTREE to run
    a program, it will reserve less than 3K for itself, leaving you with the
    room to run memory-hungry programs.
