               PSYCHTROPIC DRUGS AND THE NURSING PROCESS
               -----------------------------------------

                         all rights reserved.




        Welcome to NURSING SOFTWARE SYSTEM'S training programme.




        This programme is designed as a learning aid for Student Nurses
        and as a revision tool for Registered Nurses.


        PSYCHOTROPIC  DRUGS AND  THE NURSING  PROCESS is the  result of
        many hours design  and development, on the part of the authors.
        It is the  second  package in the training  programme and it is
        intended that further pakages be released as they are written.


        The  authors  wish to make these packages available to  as many
        Student  and Registered Nurses as possible, so have decided  to
        release it under the SHAREWARE concept.


        To enable  the SHAREWARE concept to  survive you are encouraged
        to support the  authors by sending a  monetary contribution (we
        are asking $30.00) to the authors.


        The contribution, apart from assisting the authors to  maintain
        an adequate diet and fluid intake, will be used by the  authors
        as a  resource to develop further software packages  to  assist
        Student Nurses and Registered Nurses alike.

        SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
        -------------------

        To run the programme  requires an  IBM XT  or AT  or a 100%  IBM
        compatible computer with at least one floppy disk  drive and  at
        least 265K of memory.


        Either a CGA or EGA card is desirable but not essential. If  you
        do  not  have  a CGA or EGA card the program will  run  but  the
        material  will appear on the screen at half the normal size  for
        for  this package (that is, in normal print) and will appear  to
        the  left  of  the screen.  You will still be able  to  run  the
        the  package, but will not get the full benefits of  the  colour
        capabilities of the programme. A colour monitor is desirable but
        not essential.

        GENERAL INFORMATION
        -------------------

        The program is designed to serve as both a study aid for Student
        Nurses and as a revision tool for Registered Nurses.


        The  package  consists  of  five  modules,  each  of  which is a
        tutorial that informs the user on a group of  psychotropic drug.
        Areas that  are covered  for  each  group  include  the  history
        of  the  drug  group,  chemical types,  pharmacological effects,
        indications,  contraindications, daily dose ranges, benefits and
        limitations,  adverse  reactions,  overdose effects, drug inter-
        actions, and finally the nursing management.


        The five modules cover:

                Antipsychotic Agents;

                Sedative-Hypnotic Agents;

                Antidepressants;

                Mood Stabilizers; and,

                Antiparkinsonian Agents.


        Following the  tutorial in  each module is a short ten  question
        quiz  related to  the drug  group  just studied. The quizzes are
        designed to  enable  the learner  to test their knowledge of the
        drug group the module covered.

        INSTALLATION ON A HARD DISK
        ---------------------------

        Providing all the files are present you can install this package
        on a hard disk using the installation batch file provided.


        1.  Power on the computer.

        2.  Insert the distibution Floppy Diskette in drive A:

        3.  Switch to drive A: so the prompt shows A:>

        4.  Type INSTALL and press <ENTER>

            This will create the directory \NSS2 on drive C: and install
            the package in the directory C:\NSS2.

            A  batch file NSS2 will be created in the root directory  of
            C: to run the package.

        4.  If  a menu system is resident, NSS2 should now be  added  to
            to the menus.



        INSTALLATION ON A FLOPPY DISKETTE
        ---------------------------------

        No  installation  is required to run the package from  a  floppy
        diskette.


        The package will run from the distribution diskette. This is not
        copy protected and should be copied to create a working diskette
        to protect the distribution diskette.

        RUNNING THE PACKAGE FROM A HARD DISK
        ------------------------------------

        To run the programme each time, simply turn your computer on and
        type NSS2 at the C>\ prompt (or run  it from your menu system if
        you have one).



        RUNNING THE PACKAGE FROM A FLOPPY DISKETTE
        ------------------------------------------

        To run the  programme from the  floppy diskette  simply boot the
        computer  with  your DOS  diskette,  then  insert the  programme
        diskette  into  Drive A  and  enter CPI CONTROL.  The  programme
        should then load.

        USING THE PACKAGE
        -----------------

        When  the  package  starts it will display a  menu  of available
        modules.


        Simply select the desired module, by typing  its number, from  1
        to 5.


        Selection of option 6 will exit you from the package and  return
        you to the Disk Operating System (DOS).


        Once  inside  a module the  tutorial will commence. You can move
        around the tutorial by  keying + to move  forward a frame, and -
        to move back  a frame.  Pressing the  ESC  key exits  you from a
        tutorial and returns you to the menu.


        At the end of the end of the tutorial in each module you will be
        given the option of obtaining a printout of the Nursing  Manage-
        ment for that drug group.  To  obtain  a  printout, type Y (yes)
        when you are asked. Pressing N (no) at this point  will take you
        to the next section of the module, the quiz.


        In each module the tutorial is followed by a short quiz. If  you
        don't wish to attempt the quiz,  press the  ESC key to return to
        the menu. If you do attempt the  quiz you will be asked for your
        name.  This is purely for  interactional purposes  and it is not
        recorded.


        The quiz questions then appear.  Answer  each question by typing
        A, B, C, or D to match the desired response.


        A score detailing the number of questions you answered correctly
        on  the first  try is displayed at the end of each quiz. This is
        for your information only and it is not recorded.


        You can exit from the quiz and return to the menu at any time by
        pressing the ESC key.
