Disk Title: The Babysitter                                              
PC-SIG Version: S3.0                                                    
                                                                        
Program Title: The Babysitter                                           
Author Version: 3.0                                                     
Author Registration: $20.00                                             
Special Requirements: No special requirement. Supports a modem.         
                                                                        
For all parents who leave a babysitter in charge of their children (or a
housesitter)!                                                           
                                                                        
Using a modem, this program will call the parents for the sitter with   
the touch of one key, plus any emergency or other contact number.  With 
or without a modem, THE BABYSITTER gives the sitter all the information 
required to care for your children, like:                               
                                                                        
~ Address and number of parents                                         
~ Address and number of other contacts                                  
~ Alarms throughout the day                                             
~ Activities not allowed                                                
~ Allergy list, special recipes                                         
~ List of special information                                           
                                                                        
For the parents, there is included a menu where a list of babysitters'  
names can be kept, plus information such as respective addresses,       
telephone numbers, and availability.  To guard against tampering with   
the computer while the parent is gone and possibly losing the program,  
the sitter cannot drop to DOS, even if the power is shut off.  When it  
comes back on, the computer will go directly to the sitter screen.      
Furthermore, an activity log, accessed only by password, shows the      
parents what keys the sitter pressed and at what time.  And for the     
sitter, there is a help screen that will explain the program if the     
parent is not there to do so.
