## Information about "ICON DRAW & LISTICO"

    Feeling a little limited by the simple icons on your Windows 3.0 screen?
    Now you can custom create your own 16-color icons to appear in Windows.
    And 11 pre-made icons will help get you started.
    
    With ICONDRAW, you can make your own unique icons depicting the choices
    available from your particular windows environment.  Creating new icons
    can be a snap, especially when using one of the 11 pre-made icons
    included to help get you started.  Once a new icon is saved, you can
    change the icons on the Program Manager by using Windows "properties "
    command.
    
    LISTICO is a small utility that displays Windows icons created with
    Icondraw.  It displays icons alphabetically according to their icon
    names.  This program makes it easier to find an icon in a large library
    of icons.  Two sample icons and source code are included with the
    program.

Welcome to Icondraw for Windows 3.0 Version 1.2
-----------------------------------------------
       by Philip B. Eskelin, Jr. and Michael Gates.
This is a shareware program, which I developed as a utility to help others
in their pursuit of an ultimate graphical interface, fitting their needs to
the fullest extent.   I also developed it for personal reward.  Now I would
like to share it with others. 

This application is an icon editor, where you can make your own 16-color, 32x32 
pixel icons which fit into the PROGMAN perfectly.  The following lists the steps 
required to change an icon in the PROGMAN (Program Manager):

1. Save the Icon to a file with an .ICO extension.
2. Click on the icon in the PROGMAN which you wish to change ONCE.
3. Choose File Properties.
4. Click on the "Change Icon.." button.
5. Type in the name of the icon with the full path. (e.g. "c:\windows\myicon.ico").
6. Click on OK, then on OK again.

PRESTO! you will notice that the icon you specified now is visible in the 
PROGMAN.  

Version 1.2 Improvements:

1. All bugs are fixed as far as I know.  Otherwise the features are the
   same.

Wishlist for Icondraw version 2.0 available to registered users:

1. Grid.
2. Transparency will be added.
3. A floodfill tool will be implemented.
4. Copy Bitmap feature added so that you can copy your icon to the Clipboard.
5. "Open Executable" function which will bring up an icon from a Windows 
   application.  

If you have any questions, my name is Philip Eskelin, Jr.  Feel free to mail
me any suggestions at [76701,152].

If you find this a very useful tool, please send 15 dollars to me.  I will 
greatly appreciate it!  In addition, if you register, you will be able to
get my full fledged version 2.0!!  I made the decision to do this because
version 1.2 fixes the bugs, and version 2.0 will have sooo many cool things,
I feel it is only fair to make it accessible to registered users only.  
By the way:  Over 5,000 people have downloaded versions 1.00 and 1.1
combined!  Hope all of you register....<grinnnn>

     Mail Check or cash to:

         Philip B. Eskelin, Jr.
         10007 NE 125th LN #4
         Kirkland, WA.  98034

Thank you again.   I am totally open to feedback and suggestions!!!
