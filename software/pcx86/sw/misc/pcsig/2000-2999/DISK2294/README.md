## Information about "UNCLAIMED FUNDS DATABASE"

    Did you know that there's millions of dollars out there that no one has
    claimed in years -- money that could belong to you? Lost bank accounts,
    estates that have no heirs or heiresses, etc. Find out if you're one of
    the lucky ones by checking out the UNCLAIMED FUNDS DATABASE.
    
    This is a menu-driven program that holds thousands of names and
    addresses of people that have left behind bank accounts for more than
    seven years. Not only are the names and addresses given, but also the
    amounts that were left behind in each of these accounts. You will also
    find a large list of people who have passed away and left a large
    estate to no one, no one who can be found anyway.
    
    Enter a name, city, or street of a person that you think may have money
    coming to them and the UNCLAIMED FUNDS DATABASE will search through its
    list and give you all occurrences of your search criteria. Once a match
    has been made, just give the author a call and he'll be more than happy
    to tell you what is necessary to collect what is coming to you.
