Disk Title: Twenty Greatest Ideas In Human Relation
PC-SIG Version: S1.01

Program Title: Twenty Greatest Ideas in Human Relations
Author Version: 1.01
Author Registration: $15.00
Special Requirements: No special requirements.

THE TWENTY GREATEST IDEAS IN HUMAN RELATIONS  is a computer assisted
instruction course.  It is designed to give the user a working knowledge
of the 20 greatest ideas ever developed for getting along with people.
These ideas are presented in sequential order, with the user providing
feedback to show his understanding of each idea introduced.  This
process can be tedious especially when an incorrect answer is given.
The program will not allow the user to continue until all answers are
correct.  Once the proper feedback is given, the user is allowed to
continue until all the material has been covered.  In order to complete
the course a perfect score must be made on a 20 question test.  Failure
to get a perfect score implies that the user has not mastered the
course, and the test must be taken again.  The course is easy to
understand and takes about an hour to complete.
