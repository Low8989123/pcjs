## Information about "BADGE-O-MAGIC"

    BADGE-O-MAGIC is a dBASE-compatible badge and nametag generator
    designed for use with an HP LaserJet II or 100% compatible laser. Using
    any dBASE III or IV data base (one is included with the
    software), BADGE-O-MAGIC generates one to four line badges with an
    optional header and footer line.  The badges can be printed using
    type styles of 20 to 40 points.  Five fonts are included with the
    program.  Each badge is 3" x 4" with six badges being printed on each
    8-1/2 x 11 inch page.  BADGE-O-MAGIC also includes the necessary
    software to download the soft fonts to your laser printer and to print a
    perforation template suitable for ordering perforated name tag stock
    from your local printer.  The perforated paper and badge holders also
    are available from the author when you register.
    
    BADGE-O-MAGIC also includes powerful file management utilities which
    permit you to edit and add data to any dBASE file without leaving the
    program.
    
    Typical uses for this software would be to prepare name badges for
    participants at a conference, convention, family meeting, social event,
    etc.
    
    The 18 page on-disk manual which comes with BADGE-O-MAGIC is organized
    very well with simple instructions to install and use the program
    quickly.  Running the program is very simple, with all functions
    available from a main menu.
