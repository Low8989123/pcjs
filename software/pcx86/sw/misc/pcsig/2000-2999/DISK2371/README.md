## Information about "QUIKMATH"

    QWIKMATH is one of the most comprehensive programmer's calculator on
    the market today and provides a wide array of features.
    
    Enter values in binary, octal, decimal, or hexadecimal. Results are
    displayed in all these bases, as well as the ASCII or extended scan
    code equivalents. A complete range of arithmetic and bitwise
    operators is supplied. Press any ASCII or extended scan code key and
    instantly see its value in all number bases. Perform calculations with
    32-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit values. A 16-level "undo" feature allows
    escape from most errors. Experiment freely in "what if" sessions
    without losing the results of prior operations. Need help? QUIKMATH has
    context-sensitive help screens.
    
    QWIKMATH's Character Format is a feature not normally found in a
    programmer's calculator. Choose how you want the character output
    treated -- in ASCII mode or extended scan code mode. See ALL the
    characters output to the screen.
    
    QWIKMATH runs as a stand-alone or memory-resident program (instantly
    popped-up with a "hot key"). Now you can have all the functions you
    will ever need in a programmer's calculator, right on your screen.

QWIKMATH is the most comprehensive programmer's calculator on the market
today.  QWIKMATH is full of features, such as, Values may be entered in 
binary, octal, decimal, or hexadecimal, with results always displayed in
all radices (as well as their ASCII or extended scan code equivalents), 
A complete range of arithmetic and bitwise operators, A special         
"character" value-entry mode permits you to press any ASCII or extended 
scan code key(s) and instantly see its value in all radices, The ability
to perform calculations in 32-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit values, A 16-level 
"undo" feature to escape erroneous entries or freely experiment in a    
"what if" session without losing the results of prior operations, and   
Context-sensitive help screens.                                         
                                                                        
QWIKMATH provides a feature not normally found in programmer's

QWIKMATH is executable as a stand-alone or memory-resident (pop-up)     
program.  If installed as a memory-resident program (TSR) it is         
instantly popped-up with a "hot key".  QWIKMATH gives you all the
