This is the second exciting adventure of Nevada Smith.  Nevada wasn't   
satisfied with finding the elusive pharaoh's tomb in his first          
adventure.  After months of searching and studying ancient maps, Nevada 
has stumbled upon the location of a tremendous Viking treasure cave.    
Join our intrepid hero as he heads for the Arctic in this stunning and  
chilling new adventure series!                                          
                                                                        
Arctic Adventure contains 20 all-new diabolical levels, packed with mind
bending, puzzling arcade action designed to keep you from ever          
succeeding.  Nevada will face freezing waters, diabolical traps,        
slippery ice patches, falling stalactites, runaway snowballs and even   
abominable snowmen!  There are many, many more obstacles for Nevada to  
overcome in this highly adventurous series.                             
                                                                        
You will start on a vast arctic "world" map and must find your way      
around the hazardous ice caves.  You are searching for the remaining    
fragments of a map that will eventually lead you to the location of     
the hidden treasure cave.  Gather pick axes to break walls and bullets  
to shoot dangerous enemies, or find the boat to cross the freezing      
waters to unknown caves.                                                
                                                                        
Throughout your adventure you'll also find many bonus items to          
increase your wealth (and score).  It's up to you to learn the use      
of any object you discover, and whether it should be altogether avoided.
                                                                        
This game uses the FAST (Fluid Animation Software Technology) system    
which allows for flicker free movement even on the older IBM PC's.      
Other features:  Great sound effects that can be toggled on or off.     
Flawless keyboard controls or you can use a joystick.  A permanent high 
score table will keep your name on record for all to see, and as with   
ALL Apogee games, you can save and restore your game.
