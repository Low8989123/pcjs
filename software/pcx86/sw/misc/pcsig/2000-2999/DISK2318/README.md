## Information about "GALAXY LITE"

    Back by popular demand!  This program was Galaxy 2.43, but Omniverse
    stopped distributing it when they released version 3.  Starlite Software
    has released GALAXY LITE to continue to support those who prefer the
    older version of the program.
    
    You get the best of both worlds: a choice of menu or quick keyboard
    commands for most functions.  One is great for beginners, the other
    handy for vets who want to go faster.  Mix and match command modes.  The
    pull-down commands work so well, the user's guide can be used as a
    paperweight after a half hour's experience with the program.
    
    Logically structured, GALAXY LITE boasts a short learning curve; its
    commands the result of research into how people use word processors.
    WordStar users love GALAXY because it understands WordStar commands and
    handles WordStar files.  It allows you to print and edit at the same
    time, something that will save hours of time for most fulltime word
    crunchers.  Macros are a snap, easy to develop and easier to use. The
    window system allows you to cut and paste between two files while the
    zoom feature can blow up either window to full screen size.
    
    GALAXY LITE --  Still one of the best word processors around.
