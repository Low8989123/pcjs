## Information about "CURVE DIGITIZER (CGA/EGA) 2 OF 2 (2066)"

    CURVE DIGITIZER is a completely professional, two-dimensional CAD/CAM
    drawing tool for the personal computer. The interactive help screen,
    detailed documentation, and six menu screens make it easy to operate.
    
    ~ Direct hi-resolution printer output with controllable width, length,
    resolution and an option for reverse field-printing.
    
    ~ A wide-printer output option for printers with carriages up to 16"
    wide.
    
    ~ A versatile line thickness controller has been added to the Select
    command. This allows for double lines, poly lines or filled lines with
    a selectable density.
    
    ~ Distance and angle or delta x & y readouts are available.
    
    ~ Advanced features; e.g., scaling & rotation, hatching and area
    calculations of irregular polygons.
    
    ~ A user-defined plotter driver routine is included.

           C U R V E    D I G I T I Z E R    V E R S I O N   4.0

                UPGRADES TO CURVE DIGITIZER SINCE VERSION 3.0

                         PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS


    *  THE DIGITIZER CALIBRATION PHASE HAS BEEN SIMPLIFIED.

    *  A FASTER COMPILER AND PROGRAM MODIFICATIONS NOW YIELD A 55%
       INCREASE IN REFRESH SPEED.

    *  SEVERAL COSMETIC ERRORS HAVE BEEN CORRECTED.

    *  ADVANCED FEATURES, E.G., SCALING & ROTATION ADDED TO THE SYMBOL
       COMMAND.

    *  A USER-DEFINED PLOTTER DRIVER ROUTINE IS AVAILABLE.

    *  HERCULES VIDEO (DMA) RESPONSE TIME IMPROVED. PREVENTS CERTAIN
       SCREEN ANOMALIES EVIDENT WITH CERTAIN HERCULES CLONE CARDS.

    *  EXTENDED THE [ESC] KEY USAGE TO INTERRUPT SCREEN REFRESHING AND
       PRINTER OR PLOTTER OUTPUT EVEN DURING `LAYERS' MODE.

    *  ARC COMMAND FEATURES READOUT OF START & END ANGLES AND RADIUS.

    *  LAYER COMMAND FEATURES SINGLE-KEY SELECTION OF UP TO 10 PATH
       DIRECTORIES.

    *  A BYPASS OPTION WHICH PRECLUDES RESAVING THE INITIAL LAYER FILE.

    *  FORMATTED DISKETTES NO LONGER NEED A FILE ON DISK TO BE USED AS A
       DATA DISK.

    *  FOR COMPUTER SYSTEMS WITHOUT HARD DRIVES AND HAVING, AT LEAST, 2
       FLOPPY DRIVES, A DRIVESPEC CAN BE ENTERED FOR THE AUTODIMENSIONING
       DISK. THIS SAVES CONSIDERABLE DISKETTE SWAPPING.

    *  THE LAYERS MODE SAVES FILE(S) ONLY IF CHANGES ARE MADE.

    *  DIRECT HI-RESOLUTION PRINTER OUTPUT WITH CONTROLLABLE WIDTH,
       LENGTH, RESOLUTION AND AN OPTION FOR REVERSE FIELD-PRINTING.

    *  A WIDE-PRINTER OUTPUT OPTION FOR PRINTERS WITH CARRIAGES UP TO 16".

    *  AUDIO EFFECTS NOW HAVE 3 LEVEL SETTINGS: OFF/MIN/MAX WHICH ARE
       TOGGLED WITH A NEW [!] KEY.

    *  THE [ESC] KEY ALLOWS INSTANT EXITING FROM HELP MENUS. THE HELP
       PACKAGE NOW INCLUDES BI-DIRECTIONAL PAGING THROUGH ALL SCREENS.




    *  A VERSATILE LINE THICKNESS CONTROLLER HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE SELECT
       COMMAND. THIS ALLOWS FOR DOUBLE LINES, POLY LINES OR FILLED LINES
       WITH A SELECTABLE DENSITY.

    *  READOUTS FOR DISTANCE AND ANGLE OR DELTA X & Y READOUTS AVAILABLE
       USING THE [^] KEY.
