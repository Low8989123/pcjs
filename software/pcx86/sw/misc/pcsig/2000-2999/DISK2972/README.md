                    African Desert Campaign Ver. 1.5B

                               STRATEGIES
                           for playing the game

    Fortresses
         This is the most important strategy in the game.  No matter
         what the circumstances are, you want to control as many of
         the bases as you can.  If you control 0 bases you will
         receive 0 new supplies (Supplies should be expected at least
         once every three rounds).  Each fortress you control
         increases the amount of supplies which are possible.

    Separating
         This is probably the most important function in the game.
         This allows you take customize your pieces to perform
         certain tasks.  I have listed a few pieces you could make to
         carry out specific functions.

         1. A piece with only one supply can be used to occupy a
         fortresses without putting a strain on your other supplies.

         2. A piece which contains a substantial amount of move power
         and defensive power, but only one attack power could be used
         to quickly approach an enemy piece like #1 and defeat it.

         3. Fortresses which are close to the enemy should contain
         only defensive power.  Why waste attack and move power in a
         place where it would be stupid to move under most
         circumstances.  Remember you do not need any supplies to
         defend yourself.

         4. Another important piece is one with a lot of supplies and
         move power.  It could be used to re-supply a piece which has
         run out after you have used all of your reinforcements.
         Simply move this piece on top of the one with out supplies
         and press the '+' key and they will merge.

         These are only a few of the possible types of pieces you
         could make to perform certain tasks as they become needed
         during the game.

    Attacking
         When you attack there is a possibility that you could lose
         your entire piece.  Because of this it might be a good idea
         to separate a piece, in order to attack, which only contains
         attack power, move power and a minimal amount of supplies.
         It is very difficult to estimate the amount of supplies
         needed to get right next to a piece and then attack.  All
         you need to know is that you need to have at least 1 supply
         in order to attack.  If you have already separated your piece
         and find yourself running out of supplies before you get to
         your opponent there is a simple solution to the problem,
         assuming the piece that you separated it from is still in
         the same place.  Press ESC until your piece, which you want










page 2

         to attack with, is back to it's original position and you
         are back in the options menu.  Use the separate function
         again to place more supplies right on top of your attacking
         piece.  They will merge together and you will be able to go
         back to the move function and carry out the attack.

    Moving
         There is one thing you must remember about moving.  Once you
         move a piece, it cannot be moved again during that round.
         This means it also cannot attack.  You can still separate it
         after you have moved it, but the new piece you create will
         not be able to move during that round.  Another thing to
         remember about moving is that if you are running out of
         moves left try to place your piece onto a piece of
         escarpment if its not too far out of the way.  This provides
         added protection against the enemy.

This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
700 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'GO' at the
DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy access
to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.

The Narc utility, newly instituted with the tenth edition, allows you to
look directly at all the compressed program files on the CD without
having to download the program to your hard disk.  So if you want to
look at the programmer's notes or on-line documentation before using
valuable hard disk space, you can.

The PC-SIG Encyclopedia of Shareware is included on the disk, and a
printed copy of the book is included so you can peruse the available
programs from the comfort of your favorite chair.  All the programs are
logically divided into one-hundred twenty categories making it easier to
find just the right software.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

AGGRESSION is a board game that combines some of the aspects of checkers
and backgammon. Like checkers, each player's game pieces start at       
opposite sides of the board. You alternate moves, and each player tries 
to be the first one to get all their pieces to the other side. You can  
surround an opponent's game piece and return it to its starting place.  
Play against a friend or the computer. A fun game with sharp graphics.

split your forces, move your troops, and attack your opponent. This is a
strategy-based game with limited graphic displays.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
