ROBOMAZE II - THE LOBBY is the first in a series of three unique action 
arcade games, each one building on the other.  You are a Freedom Fighter
who must regain control of the Tower and the Dome to free your country  
from an oppressive dictator.                                            
                                                                        
To accomplish this, you will be commanding the prototype Stalker robot. 
The Stalker is capable of moving left and right, as well as jumping.  At
the beginning of the game, you have only the limited firepower of a     
gun.  As you acquire money and explore more levels, more powerful       
weapons become available.                                               
                                                                        
ROBOMAZE II - THE LOBBY has 40 levels filled with 15 different types of 
robots whose job it is to protect the Tower.  During your assault, you  
will encounter keys that open doors and chests, land mines and spikes   
that will hamper your progress, and moving platforms that can squash the
stalker like an empty can.  Along the way, you will find hearts that    
give you health, ammunition for your weapons, and even special attacks  
that do anything from making the enemy robots shoot each other to making
you invisible for a short time.                                         
                                                                        
ROBOMAZE II accepts keyboard and joystick input.  However, some commands
must be entered from the keyboard, while others can be executed using a 
joystick.  The game can be played on a CGA system but the 640X200 16    
color-resolution graphics really shine on EGA or VGA monitors.

Getting Started
---------------

Robomaze II accepts keyboard and joystick input.  However, some commands must 
be entered from the keyboard, while others can be executed using a joystick.

To accomplish your objective in the game you will be commanding the prototype 
Stalker robot.  The Stalker is capable of moving left and right, as well as 
jumping.  The gun that he carries can be fired at enemy robots.  These are the 
keyboard commands that control the Stalker's movements and other actions, and 
the commands that call other game functions.


left arrow     Move left                          1    Shield  ($250)
right arrow    Move right                         2    Super Jump  ($350)
down arrow     Stop moving                        3    Down Attack  ($750)
up arrow       Jump                               4    Freeze  ($2,000)
space bar      Fire weapon                        5    Mayhem  ($1,500)
  J            Joystick control                   6    Power Up  ($500)
  K            Keyboard control                   7    Phase  ($3,000)
  Q            End game                           8    Repel  ($4,000)
  S            (Y/N) sound on/off                 9    Defoliant  ($5,000)
 ESC           Terminate program                  0    Zap  ($10,000)
 F1            Help (quick ref.)                                      
 F2            Display game status
 F3            Load a saved game             -    Slow down game           
 F4            Save game                     +    Speed up game


You can change the speed of the game at any time.  When you do, an S followed 
by a number will appear for an instant at the bottom right of the screen.  
This tells you what speed you just selected.  There are nine speed settings, 1 
being the fastest and 9 the slowest.

Choosing the Save game option allows you to continue the game at another time.  
However, you will not necessarily continue from the room that the Stalker cur-
rently occupies, but from the last continue point.  Continue points begin with 
room 5, then room 11, and from that point are spaced five rooms apart.  The 
Stalker will have only five hearts when the game resumes, no matter how many 
he had when you saved the game.  One saved game may be stored at a time.  
Saving a new one will overwrite the old file.


Joystick Control
----------------

Robomaze II accepts input from the keyboard and joystick.  The Stalker robot 
can be moved by moving the joystick in the corresponding direction.  For 
joystick use, press the first button to make the Stalker jump.  Press the 
second button to fire.  All other commands must be entered from the keyboard.




                                      4

Conflict Background
-------------------

You are a freedom fighter -- a member of the Resistance -- fighting against 
your country's tyrannical dictator.  Your tiny country is dominated by two 
massive structures, the Tower and the Dome.  Although the dictator's robots 
control both structures, the Resistance is now poised to begin its assault and 
free your country from its evil ruler and his henchman the Mad Scientist.

For months the Resistance has been tunneling from its secret headquarters 
towards the Tower.  The tunnel is now complete, and you have been chosen to 
liberate the Tower.  In Robomaze, your first adventure, you fought through the 
Maze of Death in the basement of the Tower using the Mk. 39 Fighter robot.

Once on the first floor of the Tower, you have acquired the Stalker robot to 
continue your mission.  The Stalker has many capabilities, about which you 
will learn below.

Many enemy robots will attempt to prevent you from taking the Tower, which is 
divided into five levels of 20 rooms each.  A unique "Boss" robot occupies the 
last room in each level.  These special robots are especially difficult to 
defeat.  The Mad Scientist also has other nasty surprises in store for you, 
but the Resistance is counting on your success.  It is rumored that the Mad 
Scientist himself occupies the last of the 100 rooms in the Tower.

In volume 1 (The Lobby) you attempt to take the first 40 rooms of the Tower.  
To complete your mission you must register to receive volumes 2 and 3.  In 
these new games you will encounter new fearsome robots, and in volume 3, the 
Mad Scientist himself.  No member of the Resistance has ever seen the Mad 
Scientist.  We hope you will be the first.

Tower Terrain
-------------

The Tower has been designed as a defensive stronghold, with many pitfalls and 
traps for enemies of the evil dictator.  The intelligence arm of the Resis-
tance has learned that some of its rooms contain false walls or floors, so 
that if you fall or push through these, you will plunge to your death on the 
sidewalk below.  In some rooms you will find invisible keys and land mines.  
Other special features are as follows.

* Doors and Chests. Your success will require you to acquire keys to open 
  doors and chests that you discover along the way.  Both white and red doors 
  will disappear before you if you are carrying the proper key.  Chests 
  disappear upon being unlocked as well, but they leave behind a valuable 
  treasure.  Once a key opens a door or a chest, however, it disappears.

* Land Mines and Spikes.  These are dangerous objects and must be avoided.  
  Land mines come in various colors and may be hidden on objects of the same 
  color.  They can be deactivated either by shooting them or by using a Repel 
  attack.  Falling on a spike is always fatal unless you are using a Repel 
  attack.

* Plants and Water Coolers.  These objects are normally for decorative 
  purposes only and are not dangerous.  However, sometimes they can be used to 
  your advantage.  When anyone runs into them, they disintegrate.

                                      5

* Moving Platforms.  Platforms are a critical means of transportation in the 
  Tower.  But be careful when you are around them, because if you aren't using 
  a Phase attack the platforms are capable of grinding you into dust.

* Teleporters.  Another means of transportation, these paired devices 
  instantly deliver you to the other teleporter in the room.

* Enemy Teleporters.  These devices are used by the Mad Scientist to drop his 
  reserve robots into the room you occupy.


Special Attacks
---------------

Resistance intelligence gathering has discovered that the Mad Scientist has 
placed magic powers called Special Attacks in the Tower.  Originally designed 
for forces loyal to the evil dictator, these attacks can be purchased if you 
have enough money.  While you may not purchase more than one attack at a time, 
they will help you overcome obstacles and defeat enemy robots.  Once pur-
chased, however, they last for only a short time.  To purchase an attack press 
the number associated with it.

1 Shield ($250)  Repels half of enemy damage directed towards you so that your 
  life force is diminished more slowly.

2 Super Jump ($350)  Allows you to jump 50% higher than usual.

3 Down Attack ($750)  Causes heavy damage to any robot that you jump on.

4 Freeze ($2,000)  Causes all robots and enemy shots to freeze in place, as 
  well as enemy teleporters temporarily to shut down.  But even when frozen 
  enemy robots and shots can still cause damage.

5 Mayhem ($1,500)  Causes all shots fired to be yours.  This means that you 
  cannot be shot and enemy robots will shoot each other.

6 Power Up ($500)  Makes your shots twice as powerful as normal.

7 Phase ($3,000)  Allows you to move through robots and shots without being 
  hit.

8 Repel ($4,000)  Causes enemy shots to bounce off you and become your shots.  
  It also allows you to walk on land mines without tripping them and cross 
  over spikes without being impaled.

9 Defoliant ($5,000)  This unique attack causes all plants destroyed while the 
  attack is operating to turn into hearts and all water coolers destroyed to 
  turn into dollar signs.

0 Zap ($10,000)  Causes horrendous damage to all robots on the screen and 
  disables enemy teleporters for a protracted amount of time.




                                      6

Treasures
---------

Before the Mad Scientist replaced the Tower's human employees with robots, 
these employees had stored treasures in the building.  Gathering these 
treasures will help you succeed in your mission.  Treasures include (1) money 
bags and dollar signs, which give you money needed to buy special attacks.  
(2) Hearts, to increase your health reading on the left bar readout on the 
bottom of the screen, or to give you $1,000 if you are already at full health.  
(3) Health vials, to bring you to full health, or give you $10,000 if you are 
already at full health.  (4) Keys, for unlocking doors and treasure chests.  
(5) Ammo boxes, for filling your ammo, or turning your semi-automatic rifle 
into a machine gun.  (6) Shotgun, Rocket, and Laser, for giving you different 
types of firepower.


Weapons
-------

The Stalker is capable of firing several different types of weapons.  These 
include a semi-automatic rifle, machine gun, shotgun, rocket launcher, and 
laser blaster.  These weapons have varying degrees of firepower and range.  
All but the semi-automatic rifle have limited ammo.


Enemy Robots
------------

Although Resistance intelligence is sketchy here, we do know that fifteen dif-
ferent enemy robots control the rooms of the Tower.  Some of these are poorly 
armed with only a knife, while others are armed with weapons that exceed even 
the Stalker's in firepower.  Some enemies are poorly armored, while others are 
heavily armored.

We have determined that in the last room in each level there is a particularly 
fearsome enemy robot.  These are in addition to the other robots you will en-
counter.  We believe the Mad Scientist himself occupies the final room of
volume 3 of Robomaze II.  No doubt he will be especially difficult to defeat.
