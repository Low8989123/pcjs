Program Title: DAYO MRP (Materials Requirement Planning)                
Author Version: 2.0

Special Requirements: 640K RAM, a hard drive, and DOS 3.3.

more use of overlay files (.OVL), as matter of frac it is a totally     
rewritten program with many more features than version 1.0. version 2.0 
is not compatible with version 1.0.                                     
                                                                        
DAYO MRP (MATERIALS REQUIREMENT PLANNING) is a routine designed for     
manufacturers.                                                          
                                                                        
DAYO MRP builds items (end items) from items (components) in the        
inventory database. End items can later be placed into inventory for    
later sales. Supports a multilevel Bill of Materials. Features          
include automatic inventory posting and creation of inventory           
adjustment records, databases are dBASE compatible, multiuser, and many 
reports are available.

║  This DAYO module comes in a self-extracting compressed format.         ║
║  You will require a hard drive or high density drive, 640K RAM, and     ║
║  DOS 3.3 in order to install the program to your computer.              ║
║  Please NOTE your CONFIG.SYS file must exist on your boot disk/drive,   ║
║  and it must have (as a minimum), BUFFERS=30, and FILES=55.             ║
║  Run a DAYO program to create this file should you not have one, or     ║
║  do not know how to create/edit it.                                     ║
║                                                                         ║
║  If you are installing the entire DAYO system, then we recommend        ║
║  that you use the DAYO SETUP disk. It will create the necessary         ║
║  directories and copy the files. After running SETUP, run MENU.BAT      ║
║  from the \DAYO directory. Enter/select each of the modules from the    ║
║  menu, and if the module is present the program will handle the         ║
║  creation of all databases, index and configuration files.              ║
║                                                                         ║
║  For manual installation, create a subdirectory called DAYOMRP and      ║
║  copy all the files from the distrubution disks, then switch to the     ║
║  that subdirectory and type; DAYOWE then DAYOWD. Once this is done      ║
║  type DAYOW to start, or COPY DAYOMRP.DOC to print the documentation    ║
║                                                                         ║
