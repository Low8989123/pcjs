Disk Title: SuperTraq 1 of 2 (#2756 also)                               
PC-SIG Version: S1.0                                                    
                                                                        
Program Title: SuperTraq                                                
Author Version: 2.1S                                                    
Author Registration: $49.95                                             
Special Requirements: 512K RAM, hard drive, and DOS 3.0+.               
                                                                        
SUPERTRAQ utilizes pull-down menus and pop-up windows to provide an     
easy-to-operate user interface with no cryptic commands to remember.    
                                                                        
SUPERTRAQ implements expense management much differently from other     
expense tracking products.  SUPERTRAQ recognizes that each individual's 
daily routine, activities and habits are different and supports the     
Franklin International Institute Day Planner system.  The Day Planner   
system easily and quickly records expenses and files your receipts.  At 
your leisure, enter the recorded expense information into your SUPERTRAQ
software.                                                               
                                                                        
Many features help manage expenses simply and quickly.  Track expenses  
by project, employee, client, or any number of defined expense files.   
One of the more powerful features is its ability to track and manage    
separate expense files.  Expenses are categorized by Credit Cards,      
Checks, Cash and Mileage.  Each expense category includes the expense   
date, description, type code, tax status, daily entry number, amount and
daily total for each entry.                                             
                                                                        
Various reports can be generated for tax preparation, accounting,       
project planning and tracking purposes, company and individual expense  
management, etc.  Print to the screen, to a file name, or to the        
printer.  Generate reports daily, weekly, monthly, and annually.        
                                                                        
Reports can be generated individually for each expense category.  Also  
available is a Batch Printing mode to automate the printing of each     
report file if and when it is necessary to print.                       
                                                                        
The SUPERTRAQ works with virtually any day organizer or daily/monthly   
calendar system.
