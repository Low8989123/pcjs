## Information about "RAMDESK & RESEARCH"

    RAMDESK is a memory-resident program for single PCs and networks.  It
    maintains a programmable calculator; an address/phone directory; a
    mini-scheduler; a log for entry of income, expenses, and work done; and
    several mini-databases. If used on a Local Area Network, it can pass
    messages among workstations. All of these features are available on a
    pop-up basis.
    
    If RAMDESK is installed without its RAM-resident alarm, it takes up
    only 7K RAM. With the pop-up alarm (which has a snooze feature and the
    ability to handle 20 alarms per day), it requires 45K. The scientific
    calculator alone is worth a look. It combines the most popular
    standard and scientific functions with 50-line "tape," on which you
    may back up to any entry to make a correction. The macro facility
    enables you to program a wide variety of formulas, such as interest,
    depreciation, amortization, etc.
    
    Finally, RAMDESK can work hand-in-hand with TICKLEX and BILL-POWER,
    either in a network environment or on a single PC.
    
    Designed for attorneys, RESEARCH packs the power to document and sort
    through caseloads full of research material to find vital evidence.
    
    A research, document, and evidence organizer, RESEARCH lets you enter
    notes on evidence or other research, and file up to an eleven line
    summary according to source, page, line number and subject. Notes can
    be chained together if 11 lines are inadequate. Using up to 32,000
    entries per hard disk, RESEARCH can file the data under 500 subjects or
    types. Keep tabs on documents or other evidence including who sent it,
    where it is located, and where and when it was found.
    
    Scan-and-find tools are fast and accurate, and enable you to sort
    through massive files for obscure bits of incriminating data. The
    program uses ASCII, making it compatible with your word processor.
