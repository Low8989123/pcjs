## Information about "PBWINDOWS"

    PBWINDOWS is a wonderful windowing utility for users of Spectra
    Publishing's PowerBASIC.  Just include PBWINDOW.INC in your program and
    start creating all types of windows and menus.
    
    With PBWINDOWS, you can create any size window with a variety of
    colors.  Add titles and shadows to your window and you have an enviable
    display screen.  Make menus with a variety of selection options:
    scrolling, non-scrolling, arrowed, single-key selection.  And when
    you're finished, pop the windows off the screen with RemoveBox and
    you're back where you began.
    
    PBWINDOWS comes with easy-to-read documentation.  Programming
    with PBWINDOWS is simple and gives your display screen that
    professional look.  Registered users receive additional source
    code to add personal touches to PBWINDOWS.
