It's adventure time again as HUGO and Penelope get swept up in another  
superbly animated 3-D EGA extravaganza!  This time a murder mystery is  
afoot, with a couple of fiendish twists and a large helping of humor    
along the way.                                                          
                                                                        
Look what's in store -- a revolving bookcase, a saucy French maid,      
and a murderer!!  HUGO II, WHODUNIT? has the same look and feel of      
HUGO'S HOUSE OF HORRORS with more screens and characters.               
                                                                        
If you enjoyed the original HUGO adventure, HUGO II has a real treat    
in store for you!
