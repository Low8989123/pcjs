## Information about "CREATIVITY PACKAGE 1 OF 3 (2076, 2077)"

    The CREATIVITY PACKAGE is a three disk creativity and idea generator.
    Disk one contains Thomas A. Easton's complete book, "Think Thunder! And
    Unleash Your Creativity," a straightforward explanation of the nature of
    creativity and how to develop it.  Disk two contains the program,
    THUNDER THOUGHT, a proven tool for computer-aided brainstorming,
    developing and refining ideas, particularly in the fields of creative
    writing and inventing.  Disk three contains VERSIFIER, the amazing
    poetry writing program that works with the user's word selection to
    create fascinating free verse or haiku poetry.  Considering that any one
    of these disks could be tremendously helpful in understanding and
    developing creative thinking, the effect of all three may be mind
    expanding!
    "Think Thunder!" can be read chapter by chapter on the computer screen
    or printed out.  The book can encourage creative thinking with or
    without the use of THUNDER THOUGHT.
    
    THUNDER THOUGHT works to facilitate the creative process by automating
    its initial stages.  With it, you don't need to worry about how to come
    up with novel combinations of words, images, or ideas.  THUNDER THOUGHT
    will do that for you, leaving you with the task of finding or
    recognizing sense in whatever combinations of words and ideas it
    produces.  THUNDER THOUGHT offers a variety of approaches for this
    creative process including images, topical idea chaining, and other
    innovative ways to expand your idea bank.
    
    VERSIFIER is a creativity-enhancement program for poets. The program
    combines words and phrases into several kinds of free verse and haiku,
    which you can then save and edit.  To get started, both THUNDER THOUGHT
    and VERSIFIER come with a vocabulary.  These lists can be modified or
    replaced to include your own words and thoughts.  The program puts ideas
    together in ways you might not have thought of consciously, yet they are
    still your own ideas, expressed in your own words.

insertion of "extra" charges outside the normal monthly fees. Designed for
the non-accountant, this simple, single-entry system posts the charges each

                            IMPORTANT INFORMATION

All our "Unusual Software" products are sold as shareware. This means you may
use the trial version of a program for a limited period of time to see if you
like it. If you do like the program, then you should register your use by
paying the registration fee. When you become a registered user, you receive
the most advanced version of the program, and your name is placed on a mai-
ling list to receive notices of future upgrades. Trial versions of our pro-
grams are distributed by most shareware distributors, who generally charge
between $1 and $8 per disk. (This fee is for the distribution service only;
it is not paid to us, and is not part of the registration fee.) You may also
obtain the trial version of any product by sending a double-sided, double-
density 5 1/4" diskette in a sturdy, reusable mailer with sufficient return
postage (enough postage for a four-ounce, first-class letter). (Send three
disks for Creativity Package, two for Poetry Generator; an extra stamp for
these programs.) If you don't want to bother with disks and postage, send
$5.00 for the trial version of one disk, $7.00 for two, $8.00 for three, and
$1.00 for each additional disk. The trial version is a fully-functioning
program, but in some cases may lack some of the extra features of the re-
gistered version. If you don't like the program, you are free to erase it,
throw it away, or pass it on to someone else to try. If you do like the pro-
gram and want to keep using it, send in the registration fee to get the
REGISTERED version. Of course, you are always more than welcome to order the
registered version without going through the trial version first. In a few
cases, there is no advanced version yet available, but you still must regi-
ster if you like the program. Registered users receive support by mail, a
newsletter, and future upgrade notification, as well as special discount and
bonus offers.

We also act as a distributor for a limited selection of shareware and public
domain programs from other authors. The fee paid to us for these "Bonus
Disks" is for the copying and distribution service we are providing. It is
not paid to the authors and is not part of the registration fee. See the
Bonus Disk section for details.

Before ordering any software, please read the description carefully, and pay
special attention to the system requirements. Some programs require a hard
disk, graphics capability, or additional memory that you may not have. As far
as we know, our software will run on most standard "IBM compatible" personal
computers (with the possible exception of some Tandy models). However, since
equipment options and configurations vary so greatly, we cannot guarantee
correct results for everyone. If you have a problem, please let us know. 

                               HOW TO ORDER:

REGISTRATION is $6.00 for Penname, $10.00 for Cliche Finder and Curses,
$19.00 for Crystal Ball. Registration for M-LABEL is $10 if you are a
registered MAILLIST user, $39.00 if you are not. WORKBASE registration is
$49.00, $29.00 for all others.

Take $5.00 off your registration if you send a double-sided, double-density
5 1/4" diskette in a sturdy, reusable mailer with sufficient return postage.
(For POETRY GENERATOR, send 2 disks). Postage should be the same amount
needed for a four-ounce, first-class letter. This discount does NOT apply to
CREATIVITY PACKAGE, MAILLIST, or programs with reigstration fee less than
$20.00.If you want the discount, please don't skimp on the stamps! Remember,
the mailer you use to send your disk is the same one we will use to return it
to you. If you are already a registered user of one or more products from our
"Unusual Software" catalog (not Bonus Disks), take $5.00 off your registra-
tion of any new program. This discount may not be combined with any other
discount, and does not apply TO MAILLIST, CREATIVITY PACKAGE, or programs
with registration under $20.00.)

MAILLIST and THUNDER THOUGHT (part of Creativity Package) registrations
include source code if requested. Source code is NOT provided for any other
programs. OBJ file is provided with WOKBASE registrtation. CURSES!
registration includes a free bonus disk.

BONUS DISKS: $3.00 for each disk. Add a $3.00 shipping fee to your total
order. (Shipping fee applies only when Bonus Disks are ordered.) This is not
a registration, just a copying fee. Registration goes to the individual
authors of the programs.

FOREIGN ORDERS: Please add $3.00 for special postage and handling. Unfortu-
nately, we are unable to handle foreign funds. Payment must be in U.S. dol-
lars, payable through a U.S. bank. Canadian postal money orders in U.S. funds
are acceptable. 

3 1/5" DISKS: We normally provide 5 1/4" disks. If you must have 3 /15"
disks, please include an extra $1.00 per disk. Under no circumstances will we
ship unregistered versions on 3 1/5" disks.

NOTE: Some programs are "ARCed". This means that in order to fit several
large files on a single disk, a special archiving and compressing process has
been used. The files must be un-arced before use. We provide the un-arcing
program. Some users have occasionally reported compatibility problems with
the utility used to un-arc our large files (this is rare). If you would
prefer to receive un-arced versions of the programs, enclose an extra $5.00
to cover special handling and materials.                               BONUS DISKS

We are not the authors of these programs, nor are we associated with the
authors in any way other than as a distributor of the programs in accordance
with the authors' terms of distribution. Some of these programs require a
shareware registration fee from satisfied users. Our $3.00 fee per disk is a
payment for copying and distributing the disks; it is not the registration
fee. Please direct shareware registration payments and specific questions
about these programs to the authors whose names appear in the documentation.

Most of the files on these disks have been archived in order to fit more
files on a single disk. Archiving creates a file with the extension ARC. The
ARC file may contain several related files. To use these files, you must
un-arc them. An un-archiving utility is included on each disk for your
convenience.

These programs have been tested, but due to the many possible hardware and
software configurations, we cannot guarantee that any program will run on any
particular system. We do not warrant these programs in any way. If we provide
you with an unreadable disk, you may return it for a replacement copy of the
same disk. Read the file descriptions carefully; some of these programs have
special requirements.

The CREATIVITY PACKAGE is a three disk creativity and idea generator.   
Disk #1 contains Thomas A. Easton's complete book, "Think Thunder! And  
Unleash Your Creativity", a straightforward explanation of the nature of
creativity and how to develop it.  Disk #2 contains the program, THUNDER
THOUGHT, a proven tool for computer-aided brainstorming, developing and 
refining ideas, particularly in the fields of creative writing and      
inventing.  Disk #3 contains VERSIFIER, the amazing poetry writing      
program that works with the user's word selection to create fascinating 
free verse or haiku poetry. Considering that any one of these disks     
could be tremendously helpful in understanding and developing creative  
thinking, the effect of all three may be mind expanding!  Thomas        
Easton's book, "Think Thunder! And Unleash Your Creativity", is a clear,
usable, description of the creative process and how to encourage it.    
"Think Thunder!" can be read chapter by chapter on the computer screen  
or printed out.  The book can encourage creative thinking with or       
without the use of THUNDER THOUGHT.                                     
                                                                        
THUNDER THOUGHT works to facilitate the creative process by automating  
its initial stages.  With it, you don't need to worry about how to      
come up with novel combinations of words, images, or ideas.  THUNDER    
THOUGHT will do that for you, leaving you with the task of finding or   
recognizing sense in whatever combinations of words and ideas it        
produces.  THUNDER THOUGHT offers a variety of approaches for this      
creative process including images, topical idea chaining, and other     
innovative ways to expand your idea bank.                               
                                                                        
VERSIFIER is a creativity-enhancement program for poets. The program    
combines words and phrases into several kinds of free verse and haiku,  
which you can then save and edit.  To get started, both THUNDER THOUGHT 
and VERSIFIER come with a vocabulary.  These lists can be modified or

In some cases, when you try to run a program, you may see
an error message something like this:

Proc TAROT line 0, Open Error DESC3.NTX (4)

This is NOT caused by a bug in the program! If you see a
message with the words "open error" and the number 4, it
is DOS's cryptic way of telling you that you need to make
an adjustment in the CONFIG.SYS file in your root directory.

The CONFIG.SYS file should contain the following two lines:

     files=20
     buffers=20

(Some programs may require even larger numbers, which is
okay.)

If you aren't familiar with the CONFIG.SYS file, your DOS
manual should contain an explanation.

                         USER SUPPORTED SOFTWARE:

The "Creativity Package" distributed by R.K. West Consulting consists of
two programs, VERSIFIER and THUNDER THOUGHT (executable files VERSE.EXE and
THUNDER.EXE and related data files), and a book on disk, THINK THUNDER! AND
UNLEASH YOUR CREATIVITY. VERSIFIER and all related files and documentation
are copyright (c) 1988 by R.K. West. THUNDER THOUGHT and all related files
and documentation are copyright (c) 1988, 1989 by Thomas A. Easton and R.K.
West. The book, THINK THUNDER! AND UNLEASH YOUR CREATIVITY is copyright (c)
1989 by Thomas A. Easton. The authors reserve the exclusive right to
distribute these materials, in whole or in part, for profit. You may freely
copy and distribute the "Creativity Package" as long as (a) you have not
made any modifications in any of the files, (b) you charge no fee, except a
small copying fee, (c) you do not rename, change or omit any of the files or
documentation, and (d) it is not distributed on the same disk with other
poetry writing or creativity-enhancement programs. All distribution copies
must contain the authors' copyright notices, documentation, and all the
original modules.

If you use this software, please become a registered user. The registration
fee is $29.00. Your financial support is important to the improvement of this
program and the development of new programs. Registered users are
automatically entitled to receive the most current upgraded version and will
be eligible for future upgrade service and other special offers. You can
take $4.00 off the registration fee if you enclose three 5 1/4", double-
sided, double-density diskettes (sorry we cannot accommodate 3.5" disks) in
a sturdy mailer with SUFFICIENT return postage. (Please, if you want the
discount, don't skimp on the postage. It should be at least the same as the
postage needed to mail a five-ounce, first-class letter. Keep in mind that
the container you use to send us your disks is the same container we will
use to send the upgrade back to you.) If the disks you send are the original,
unchanged disks you got from a distribution service that charged you a fee
for this program, include the name and address of the service and the price
you paid, and take another $2 off your registration fee. In any case, please
mention where you got your original copy of the program.


                                DISCLAIMER

as much detail as possible and mention the type of hardware you are using,

believe you have found a serious bug, please send us the original
distribution diskette so that we can find the source of the problem. Send
the exact wording of any error messages that you may have seen (if possible,
a print-screen illustrating the problem as it happened would be most
helpful).

We write and distribute other shareware programs, some of which are quite
unusual. We will be happy to send a catalog upon request.
