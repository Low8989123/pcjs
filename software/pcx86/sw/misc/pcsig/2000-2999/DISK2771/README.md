Disk No: 2771
Disk Title: An Ounce of Prevention
PC-SIG Version: S1.0

Program Title: An Ounce of Prevention
Author Version: 1.00
Author Registration: $35.00
Special Requirements: A hard disk drive.

Oz protects your data by preserving deleted and overwritten files so
that you can recover them.  Provided that you have some unused disk
space, this function is far more powerful than that provided by
"unerase" programs such as those found in Norton Utilities or PC Tools.

Oz also performs other valuable tasks related to disk and file safety,
including:

     Protection against attempts to format your hard disk(s).

     Optional protection against all attempts to write to a hard disk.

     Trapping critical DOS errors, providing additional information
     about them, and more power to recover from them.

Oz offers several levels of data protection:

     File Security - Oz automatically preserves deleted files so that
     they may be instantly restored if needed.  Up to eight generations
     of each deleted file can be preserved, all under the same name.

     Reformat Trapping - Oz prevents accidental or malicious attempts
     to reformat a hard disk.

     Write Protection - Oz allows you to write-protect a disk if you
     suspect the presence of a virus, or other rogue program, that might
     try to damage your system.

     Full-Disk Protection - Oz traps "full disk" conditions and offers
     you a helpful set of options to free some space for your work.

     Critical Error Handling - Oz recognizes a number of critical disk
     errors, tells you what is wrong, and offers a range of options for
     dealing with them.
