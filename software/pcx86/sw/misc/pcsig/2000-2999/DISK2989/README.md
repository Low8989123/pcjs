This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
700 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'GO' at the
DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy access
to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.

The Narc utility, newly instituted with the tenth edition, allows you to
look directly at all the compressed program files on the CD without
having to download the program to your hard disk.  So if you want to
look at the programmer's notes or on-line documentation before using
valuable hard disk space, you can.

The PC-SIG Encyclopedia of Shareware is included on the disk, and a
printed copy of the book is included so you can peruse the available
programs from the comfort of your favorite chair.  All the programs are
logically divided into one-hundred twenty categories making it easier to
find just the right software.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed

by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word in the program
description.  A new utility, Narc, is implemented so you can look at the
program files and the author's on-line documentation without having to
first copy the program to your hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and
Narc, you can quickly find the program you want and review it to be
sure, without ever having to run it from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

FUNNY FACE II lets kids create wacky faces from a stock collection of   
mouths, noses, ears, hair, etc. Just like police artist drawings! (Well,
almost!)                                                                
                                                                        
Move the cursor to a picture of a nose on the screen, and you're shown  
pictures of dozens of different noses. Highlight your favorite, and it's
transferred to the picture. Repeat this until you've created a totally  
wacky picture.

This is the second release of Funny Face and it has been significantly
enhanced over the first version. See the features list for new functions.

Funny Face II was designed to provide kids with a creative form of amusement.
It allows children to create animation style faces without requiring them to
to possess strong artistic skills.

Many of the paint packages on the market today require some degree of skill
to generate recognizable pictures. This often times creates frustration on
the part of very young children when using the software. This was taken into
consideration during the design of this software package.

Funny Face II is achieving wide popularity. Download this program to see why!

Funny Face II will run on IBM and compatible computers equipped with 512K of
memory, a hard disk, and an EGA or CGA color monitor with a graphics  adapter.

                           < Features >

EASE OF USE:

   Basic operation of the Funny Face II program can be achieved through the
   use of just two keys:

      The <Spacebar> will move the cursor, ultimately, to any of the usable
      menu or image frames. Pressing the <Enter> key will select the hilited
      option.

   Arrow directional keys are also supported for users who wish to get
   around quicker.

IMAGE PRINTING, COLORING, SAVING, and LOADING:

   Images can be saved and retrieved from disk. Print support is available
   for 180 different printers. Coloring is supported in EGA and CGA modes.

DEMO MODE:

   Random images can be created using the demo mode. Pictures created by the
   demo mode can be captured by pressing any key while the demo image is still
   on the screen.


                           < Whats New? >


COLORING:

   You can now color in the faces that you create. If you have and EGA
   monitor/card then 16 colors are supported. CGA modes support 4 colors.

   When you are in coloring mode you must select CLEAR to return to drawing
   mode.

PRINTERS, PRINTERS, and MORE PRINTERS:

   Funny Face II will support 180 different dot matrix, laser, and color
   printers. Colored in images are printed in shades of gray.

IMAGES, IMAGES, and MORE IMAGES:

   A second panel of hairs, eyes, noses, mouths, ears, eyebrows, and beards has
   been added. This extends the number of different faces you can create
   significantly. I was a little more creative when designing the new images so
   I think the second panels actually add some "fun" to Funny Face II.

PICTURE LABEL:

   You can now personalize your pictures. Pressing the [F5] key will cause
   a prompt to be displayed requesting an image label. The label that is
   entered is displayed at the top of the screen, printed with the image, and
   stored in the PCX file if the image is saved.

SOUND TOGGLE:

   Sound can now be toggled off/on by pressing the [F2] key. The status of the
   sound defaults to on each time Funny Face II is started.

PCX IMAGE FORMAT:

   Images are now saved in the popular PCX format. This means that you can
   import some of your "Funny Faces" into other software programs that support
   the PCX format.


                           < Keyboard >


[F1] HELP

   Displays help screen.

[F2] SOUND TOGGLE

   Toggles sound off / on.

[F3] EXIT

   Returns user to DOS

[F4] PRINTERS

   Allows user to select printer for printing images. This value is saved
   in the FF2.DAT file.

[F5] PICTURE LABEL

   Prompts user for a text string which is placed in the box at the top
   of the screen. This label is printed with the image and is saved with
   the image when the save option is used.

[DEL]

   Removes a piece of the face. Move the cursor onto one of the facial options
   on the main screen and press the [DEL] key. The selected option will be
   promptly removed.

[ARROW KEYS] [SPACEBAR]

   Moves the cursor or coloring arrow.

[ESC]

   Backs up one step. Exits program if on main screen or in coloring mode.


                        < Additional Notes >


When my daughter was 5 I used her as a beta tester for the original release
of Funny Face. She is now 7 and contributed a great deal to the enhancements
that have been made to Funny Face II. I have nieces and nephews that I've
watched become entranced at the different faces that can be created. This
package has even stood in the way of productivity at my office.

It was a great deal of fun putting this package together. There have now been
some 520 individual images drawn to support the menu options and image
frames. Several utilities had to be written to support the development of
this product.

Funny Face II will continue to be distributed through the Shareware market.
I have not seen a substantial amount of registrations to date, however, I am
hoping that after viewing the significant number of enhancements I have made
to this software that you will find that it is worth the $10.00 registration
fee that I am requesting. Please help keep the cost of quality software down
by supporting the Shareware concept and encourage your friends to do the same.

Funny Face II can be freely copied and distributed. I own the copyright to the
product and thus it cannot be used for commercial gain/profit without my
prior consent. If you like the product and would like to become a registered
user please send a check for $10.00 to:

                        Z-ware

                        Sunnyvale, CA.  94086

Registered users will be notified of any updates that are made to the
Funny Face II program.

Your comments and/or suggestions are always welcomed as well. Thank you for
your support and I hope you have as much fun using this package as I had
developing it.


Thank you,

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.
