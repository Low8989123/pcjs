another. Just as a book cannot be read by two different persons at the same
time.

Concept:

To help you catalog your  albums  and  assist  you  in  printing  catalogs,
listings  and  labels  for  the  front of the album.  There are entries for
Album Number, Title, Artist, up to 12 Tunes on each side, category as  well
as three User Defined Fields.

Getting Started:

DO NOT INSTALL THE PROGRAM IF YOU ARE ALREADY USING IT SEE THE INSTRUCTIONS
ON HOW TO UPGRADE THE PROGRAM

Type ALBMSTR to start.

When you first start the program, the computer will bring  up  the  Default
Set  Up  screen. Just enter the info requested.  When  you  name  the  Data
Drive, the program will automatically copy the data files to that drive for
you ! So Have A Disk In The Drive And Ready !  In order to create new  data
disks  see  Set  Defaults  below. You can rename the data file now or do it
later. See below on how to do it later.

QEMM.SYS And Other Extended Memory Managers:

Occaisionally a problem will  be  incurred  by  a  person  using   QEMM.SYS
or other extended memory manager.  This has to do with the way that the SYS
file  manages  memory vs the way that the program wants to use the extended
memory (The program will attempt to use extended memory  automatically,  if
it is available).

On  the distribution disk there is a program called UNIEMM.COM (This can be
renamed to any legal file name EXCEPT the name of the EXE program).  If you
attempt  to run the program and get a DOS ERROR or RUN ERROR message at the
top of the  screen,  use  the  UNIEMM utility to  start  the  program.   It
will  tell  the  program  you  are  using  an extended memory that has this
anomoly and command  the  program  to  remain  in  low  memory  instead  of
switching  to  extended  memory.   After  passing these instructions to the
program, the program will start  with  no  other  commands  needing  to  be
entered.

Colours:

         Color    Letter
        -----------------
         Black      N     {As in Noir}
         Blue       B
         Green      G
         Cyan       BG
         Red        R
         Magenta    RB
         Brown      GR
         White      W
        -----------------

User Defined Fields:

There are three User Defined Fields, they are 30,29  and  5  characters  in
length.  When  in  Default Set Up you can name these anything you want.  ie
Producer, RCA Library Number, Length,  Thumb  (For  Up  or  Down  reviews),
Writer,  Original, well you get the idea.  You can change these anytime you

want.  What you enter here will appear on the Add, Change, Erase  Menus  as
well as the print outs.

The System:

Is designed using KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) so not much  information  is
needed to get started. Here are a few notes to help you use the system:

Universals:

The ESC key will take you back one menu or abort operation.

The  box  in  the  upper  right  hand  corner  of  the  screen will contain
information on how to move around, and data entry tips.

The last line of the screen will tell you what the highlighted option does.

All menu entries can be selected with the light bar,  or  by  pressing  the
first letter of the option.

How To Enter Albums:

There is a data sample in  the  data  files  already.   Try  printing  out,
updating, etc the sample data to get an idea about how the program works.

Also,  try running the Find! and Criteria functions with the sample data to
get a feel for how these functions work.  This is a powerful program!

DON'T FORGET TO DELETE THE SAMPLE DATA BEFORE YOU START ENTERING YOUR OWN!

The Data Entry Screens:

Any  of  the  data entry screens during Add or Update modes can be 'zipped'
through.  That is if you do not enter the  all  the  Tune  lines  just  hit
PageDown after entering the ones you need to blank the rest of the lines.

Change  And  Erase:

When you select either of these options the screen will display  up  to  32
Album  Numbers and Titles.  Move the light bar to the one you want to Update
or Delete and press the enter key.  The ESC key will take you back  to  the
Main  Menu and the PageDown key will bring up the next 32 Titles.  When the
program reaches the bottom of your file it will start again.

You  also  have  the option of looking for a specific Album Number or Title
(These will always be the last two displayed, so use the End key to get  to
the bottom and select the one you want).

Close 'Nuf:

In  the  Change,  Erase,  Criteria,  and  Find!   when you enter the Title,
Artist, User Defined Fields, etc you do not have to enter the entire thing.
For example when entering a title you wish to deal with you do not have  to
enter the full Title, only the first few words, or even letters.  In Update
this will allow you to view all the records that are Close 'Nuf to what you
entered.  EXAMPLE:  Entering  "Meet"  will  bring  up  "Meet Me", "Meet The
Beatles" and "I'll Meet You On The Other Side"


Find!:

Can help you find all of the Albums in the data file that have a particular
Album Number, User Defined Field, Artist , as well as Category  or  even  a
single Tune.  Using "Close 'Nuf" you can Find! any tape easily, ie enter as
much  information  as  you remember and it will search based on your input,
even if it is only one letter.  NOTE: PageUp on these data display  screens
will  take you back to the previous record, PageDown to the next record and
Home to the Find! menu.  You can also Find!  for ComboZ (see below).

Labels&Listings:

You can print out All the data or select a Criteria of data to print.

Criteria:

You can choose the Artist, Title, Category, Album Number,  or  any  of  the
User  Defined  fields  to  select a Criteria of.  Remember that 'Close Nuf'
applies here too.  So by selecting Artists named Bob you would get  all  of
Bob  Mea's  Albums  but  also  Bob Wallace, Bob Redford, etc.  You may also
select a range of tape numbers, keep in mind that these are  inclusive,  ie
25 to 27 will get you 25,26 & 27.  You can also select a KomboZ of Criteria
(see below).

Listings:

A Listing provides the Album Number, Category Title & Artist.

A Catalog provides all information.

A Kustom Listing allows you to build your own print out.  Simply choose the
number beside the items you wish to include in you print out.  The computer
will  track  the  number of characters you have left and tell you if you go
over 80. Hit PageDown to start the printout or ESC to abort.

Front Labels: Gives you Album Number, Artist  &  Title.   (All  Labels  are
standard 3" X 15/16" Pin Fed Labels.

3X5 Cards: Gives you all information printed on 3X5 pin fed cards.

Rolodex  Cards:  Gives  you  all  information  except  the Tunes on pin fed
rotary index cards.

Tune  List:  Will list all Tunes, Album Number and Artist.  Unless you have
very few Albums you will need a Hard Drive or High  Density  Drive  to  use
this feature.

KomboZ:

Selecting  this  entry on the Criteria or Find! screen will let you combine
up to four Criteria.  For example you want a listing of all Albums that are
in Category A and by The Beach Boys. Select the  Category  entry  from  the
ComboZ  screen,  then  type  in A next select the Artist entry, when you do
that you will have a choice of making the statement And or Or.  (Chose  And
in  this example) then you can enter the Beach Boys.  The program will find
all records meeting that Criteria and take you to the Forms menu or display
it on the screen.  (If you had selected Or in the above example  you  would
have  gotten all records for Category A or any done by the Beach Boys {even
those not category A})

A more complex example would be Category A or Category B and  User  Code  D
and  Title  A. (You would get all Categories A or B with the Code D and the
title beginning with A.)

Utilities:

Indexing:

You  can  put  the  file  in  Title,  Number,  Artist  or Category order by
selecting the appropriate option.


Build For Speed:

Should be run occasionally to keep the file in sequential order for speed.

Ghost Buster:

This feature should be run if you get blank records in your data  file,  by
accident.

Default SetUp:

Same as above.  If you wish to create a new data disk, just blank  out  the
Data  Drive  or  insert the letter "Z" and then hit the page down key.  You
will then have the opportunity to name a new Data Drive and File Name.

File Name:

Any  eight character filename allowed.  Reserved name is TEMP.  If you just
want  to  change  the  file  location:  Just copy the files UNICORN.DAT and
UNICORN.NTX to whatever location and/or name you desire,  then  change  the
name within the program.  You MUST copy the files first before changing the
name  on  the  Defaults menu.  ie COPY UNICORN.* A:THING.* (NOTE: The index
{NTX} and data {DAT} file MUST have the same name)

Printer SetUp:

This  allows you to customize the printer codes used by the program.  These
codes can be found in your printer manual.  The codes that the program  has
when originally distributed are for the Epson FX100.  You will need to know
the code for 10 cpi (Pica), 12 CPI (Elite), Enlarged, Condensed (17CPI) and
Double  High/Wide.   If  your  printer cannot handle double high/wide DON'T
PANIC,  just  leave it blank; the program will use Enlarged for that entry.
You do not have to enter the ESC part of the code,  the  program  will  add
that  automatically.  You  can  enter  the letter ESC code or the number it
does not matter: ie ESC code 119 can be entered as "119" or "w".   (Do  not
enter any " "s!)

The codes are used as follows:

           10 CPI        Reports/Catalogs
           12 CPI        Custom Report
           Enlarged      Report/Catalog Titles
           Dbl High/Wide Album Numbers On Labels
           Condensed     <Not Used>

Shell To DOS:

You  can  exit  temporarily  to  DOS  by using that option on the Utilities
Menu.  The file COMMAND.COM must be on root directory of the same  disk  as
the   other   program   files   to   do   this.  You  must  return  to  the
subdirectory/drive of AlbumMaster prior to entering EXIT to return  to  the
program.

Upgrading To 6.60:

Upgrade To 6.60 From 6.40 Or Earlier:

If   you   are  using  a version prior to 6.60 this will help  you  upgrade
your existing data files.  Before installing ANY of the programs files:

        1.  Copy the ALL files with the DAT extension  from  your  existing
        sub  directory  or  diZk  onto a work diZk or sub directory and set
        aside.

        2.   Copy  all  of  the files from the distribution dizk containing
        version 6.60 onto your existing dizk or sub directory.

        3.  Start the program and complete the Default Set Up screen as you
        desire, then from the Main Menu go to the Utilities  Menu.   Select
        the Upgrade To 6.60 option from the Utilities Menu.

        4.   Once  selected  you  will be prompted for the sub directory or
        dizk location  and the file name of the old files. DO  NOT  INCLUDE
        THE  DAT EXTENSION!  For example  your old data file name was TAPES
        and you have copied it to sub directory TEMP on you C: drive.  When
        prompted you would enter: C:\TEMP\ for location and TAPES for name.

        5.  The program will import all of the old files into version 6.60.

        6.  Registered Users have the option of just mailing their old data
        files (and .75 in stamps) to Unicorn and having them  Upgraded  for
        them.

For  versions  after  6.41 just copy the 6.60 EXE file over  the  EXE  file
for that version.

Quik Info:

The program will provide you with the last Album Number used and any missing
Numbers by hitting the F1 key. When you  are  done  just  hit  any  key  to
continue the program. This is helpful when doing Adds and Updates.

Error Messages:

Error Messages will appear at the top of the screen when an  error  occurs.
The  most  common  errors are "Open" which means the program can't find the
data files and "Printer not ready".   You  will  be  given  the  choice  of
correcting the problem or aborting.

Maestro!:

Is a program that will enable you to work with files created  by  Cassette,
Album  and  CDMaster  all at the same time.  It will perform the same Find!
and Print functions as this program, but will use the data from all of  the

*Master  programs  that you are currently using.  Also, the program will do
comparisons between the  files  to  find  multiple  titles.   Finally,  the
program will compare two completely different data files from two people --
so if you have a friend using one of the programs it will compare your data
to his.

The above listed BBSs will always have the latest versions within hours  of
release.  Additionally, these BBSs have proven to be reliable and worth the
cost  of every minute of connect time.  Even if you are not looking for our
latest versions:  Give Them A Call!

Other Unicorn Programs:

All programs are MSDOS compatible, run on 256K RAM, use IBM  graphics/laser
printers,  mono  or colour monitor, and can operate on one/two or hard disk
drives (except DayMaster & CompUser which require a hard  or  high  density
drive).   The  User  can set the colours, printer codes, default data drive
and data file name. There are no 'crippled' features or options.  The  only
difference  between  the  shareware  and registered versions is the lack of
'plea' screens on the registered version  and  the  clarity  of  the  Users
conscience.  Amount in {} is price for registration.

                           The *Master Series

CDMaster - To help Users catalog their CDs and assist in printing catalogs,
listings  and  labels  for the case and front of the CD.  There are entries
for CD Number, Title, Artist, and up to 24 Tunes as well as Category and  3
User  defined  fields.   The program will hold up to 9999 CDs (depending on
disk  space)  and  can  be  used  to find even a single song.  It will also
produce a list of every Tune User have in addition to the regular  catalogs
and case inserts.  Find! option locates CDs by any of the data fields or by
a User defined mix of data fields. {$25}

AlbumMaster  -  To help Users catalog their Albums and assist with printing
catalogs, listings and labels for the front of the Album. There are entries
for Album Number, Title, Artist, and up to 12 Tunes on each side as well as
Category and 3 User defined fields.  The User can define fields for use  as
producer,  writer,  opinions  etc.  The program will hold up to 9999 Albums
(depending on disk space) and can be used to find even a single  song.   It
will also produce a list of every Tune User have in addition to the regular
catalogs. Multiple data field Finds!  and User designed listing make this a
must have for audiophiles. {$20}

CassetteMaster - To help  User  catalog  their  cassette  tapes  and  print
catalogs,  listings  and  inserts for the case and front of the tape. There
are entries for Tape Number, Title, Artist, and up to 14 Tunes on each side
as well as Category. The User can also define  three  entries  for  use  as
producer,  writer,  opinions  etc.   The  program  will  hold  up  to  9999
individual Tapes, with two Titles per Tape (depending on  disk  space)  and
can  be  used  to  find even a single song.  It will also produce a list of
every Tune User have in addition to the regular catalogs. The case  inserts
not  only  print all the tunes, artist, and title but the User defined info
as well.  Find!  and Criteria print option make this very  useful  for  the
'home recorder' or the 'store bought' cassette tape User. {$25}

VideoMaster  -  To  help  User catalog their video tapes and assist User in
printing catalogs, standard and User customized listings and labels for the
spine and front of the tape.  There are entries  for  Tape  Number,  Title,
Rating,  Start Point, Star, Co Star, three User defined entries and a seven
line Synopsis as well as Category.  User can find any tape  by  any  field.
The  program  can  handle  up to 5 titles per tape, with the data file only

being limited by disk space. Great for the home video buff. {$25}

PostCardMaster - The program will help User compose post cards and maintain
addresses  on  disk.   Then  User  may  retrieve  either  listings  of  the
addresses  and  cards, address labels, 3X5 cards, 4X6 post cards or Roladex
cards.  The primary purpose of the program is  to  print  post  cards,  and
address them for the User. Post cards cost 1/3 the price of a letter and in
some  cases  are equally as good ie meeting notices, invitations, change of
address.  This program is a update for an earlier Unicorn Software  release
called FORWARD2. {$20}

DayMaster   -   The   program   provides   User   with  trivia,  birthdays,
anniversaries for a particular date, but also allows User to include  their
own  information  for  any  date.  It  also  gives a quote for the day, and
informs User of any reminders (Weekly/Daily/Monthly/Single/Annual/Range  Of
Dates)  the  User might have.  All of this can take place at boot up or any
other time User activate the program. The  data  file  contains  over  2000
historical events and quotes. {$20}

                            The OMNI* Series

OMNIDiZk - A disk  cataloger  and  labeling  utility.   Features:  Reads  a
floppy  into  memory  and lets User save the data (The saving is optional);
Print out 4 X 1 7/16 or 3 X 15/16 labels as well as catalogs; Perform Find!
searches on any files that User has saved; Print lists of every  file  name
in  the  data  file;  Allow  complete Updates of disks or of just the title
info; Lets User enter a 23 character title, 3 character code and two  lines
of  remarks  up  to  52  characters  each;  Lets User set the data and read
drives. {$20}

OMNIDay  -  A  benchmark  in  electronic  diary programs.  Handles up to 10
Users with PassCode protection for privacy,  optional  encryption  of  data
with  10,000 possibilities per User, automatic entry of text date line, and
a full function text editor with online Help.  The  data  file  is  dynamic
(only  as large as entries) and can be located on any drive.  Daily entries
can be from 1 to 5000 lines with  the  ability  to  change  history  (Alter
Entry) and the ability to make history vanish (Erase Entry).  The Reminisce
feature  allows User to 'thumb' through entries. Prints out the entire opus
or selected dates.  User names the opus and enters their name into  program
for use on screen and in print outs. {$25}

                            The Comp* Series

CompUser - A rated cyclopedia with the names, addresses and  phone  numbers
of  shareware  distributors,  hardware  companies, authors, computer clubs,
BBSs and more.  Almost 2000 entries are in the complete database and it  is
updated  almost  daily with revisions being mailed out every 120 days.  The
program creates, edits & prints post cards, address labels  and  more.   It
will  also  import  new  data  and allow the User to change the data in the
file.  Great for clubs (looking for authors  and  distributors),  shareware
authors  (looking  for markets), shareware libraries (looking for authors),
BBS Users (looking for new BBSs) and the average Comp{ter}User (looking for
all of the above).  All entries  are  rated  A,B,C,D,  or  F  for  size  of
operation  and  the  way  that  they  conduct business. This alone makes it
worthwhile because Users  can  avoid  poorly  rated  businesses  that  have
historical problems and lack good customer service. {$30/Year}

                             The *4D Series

DiZk4D  -  The  first dizk cataloging system specifically written for 4DOS.
DiZk4D will: Read a floppy into memory and lets User  save  the  data  (The
saving is optional). Lets the User enter a 21 character title, 4 digit DiZk
number, 3 character code and two lines of remarks up to 65 characters each.
Change  or  add  file descriptions. Users have the option of using the same
description for all files, or describing them  individually  using  a  full
screen  editor. Prints out 4 X 1 7/16 or 3 X 15/16 labels of the file names
or of file names and descriptions.  Prints out or writes to a file complete
or select listings and catalogs.  Prints out a complete list  of  all  file
information, or writes that information to a file.  Perform Find!  searches
on  any  filename,  description,  date,  title, DiZk number (alphanumeric),
code, or remarks.  Allows complete Updates of DiZks or of  just  the  title
info.  Lets User use Auto numbering of DiZks. {$25}


Check with your favourite shareware dealer or do one of the following:

1.   Call  the  Kokomo  BBS  at  317-457-9100  {First call downloads in the

Limited Distribution License:
-----------------------------

As  the  exclusive  copyright holder for AlbumMaster, Unicorn Software Limited
authorizes on-line distribution  only  in  accordance  with  the  following
restrictions.  Disk Vendors and Distributors should refer to the VENDOR.DOC
text file for complete license information.

The  AlbumMaster package is defined as containing all the  material  listed
in  the PACKING.LST text file.  If any files listed in the PACKING.LST text
file, or the PACKING.LST file itself, are missing, then the package is  not
complete  and  distribution  is  forbidden.   Please contact us to obtain a
complete package suitable for distribution.

    o  The  AlbumMaster  package  - including all related program files and
documentation files - CANNOT be  modified  in  any  way  (other  than  that
mentioned in the following paragraph) and must be distributed as a complete
package,  without  exception.  The PACKING.LST text file contains a list of
all files that are part of the AlbumMaster package.

    o Many BBSs customarily add a small text file (advertisement)  to  each
archived  file.  This text file describes the BBS and tells people that the
file was downloaded from that particular  BBS.   Other  BBSs  add  a  small
one-line  message  with their BBS name and phone number into the compressed
file, which will display when the file is uncompressed.   Either  of  these
methods of mentioning your BBS are acceptable and may be used, provided the
program and documentation is otherwise unmodified and complete.

    o Unicorn Software  Limited  prohibits  the  distribution  of  outdated
versions of the AlbumMaste package, without written permission from Unicorn
Software  Limited.   If  the  version you have obtained is over twelve (12)
months old, please contact us to ensure that  you  have  the  most  current
version.

    o  Licensee  shall not use, copy, rent, lease, sell, modify, decompile,
disassemble, otherwise reverse engineer, or transfer the  licensed  program
except  as  provided  in  this  agreement.  Any such unauthorized use shall
result in immediate and automatic termination of this license.

    o U.S. Government Information: Use, duplication, or disclosure  by  the
U.S.  Government of the computer software and documentation in this package
shall be subject to the restricted rights applicable to commercial computer

All  rights  not  expressly  granted  here are reserved to Unicorn Software
Limited.

BBS Update Program:
-------------------

Most BBSs have standard procedures for acquiring new files.  They get  them
from  other  boards, new programs are uploaded by users, etc.  This is good
because most authors cannot  afford  to  mail  disks  or  upload  files  to
thousands  of  BBSs.  However, some BBSs prefer to obtain programs directly
from the authors.  If you would like to obtain programs directly  from  us,
automatically, then please help us to cover the cost.


If  your  BBS  would  like  to  receive  automatic  upgrades  to any of our
products, directly from us, then please refer to the information below. Due
to the time and expense we are generally unable to  upload  directly  to  a
large  number  of  Bulletin  Board  Systems.   However, we are able to mail
updates on disk (in a sealed envelope) to many BBS's.

If your BBS would like  to  receive  automatic  updates  then  please  take
advantage  of  our  BBS Update Program.  Under this program you can receive
updates for an entire year for only $10 for  all 11  programs  (this  helps
to offset our costs).

To  receive  updates,  simply send us a letter with the name and address of
your BBS, your mailing address, the name  of  the  person  we  may  contact
(preferably the SYSOP or CO-SYSOP), and a check or money order for $10 (for
countries  outside of North America please add an additional $10).  Payment
in U.S. funds drawn on a U.S.  bank only, please.

The  BBS  Update  Program  covers  all  eleven  programs in release.  For a
complete list see the bottom of READ1ST.DOC (as of March, 1991)

NOTE: All BBS's participating in our BBS Update Program will  automatically
receive  any  NEW  programs  which  we  may  release while their BBS Update
Program is in effect.

The BBS Update Program is only intended to help us cover  our  expenses  in
those cases where a BBS desires to obtain the program directly from us.  If
you  have  other  standard ways to obtain programs, then you may prefer not
to use our BBS Update Program.

difference between the shareware and registered versions  is  the  lack  of
'plea'  screens  on  the  registered  version  and the clarity of the Users
conscience.

colour monitor, can operate on one/two or hard disk drives.

Other Requirements: MS-DOS 2.11 or higher.

Limited Distribution License:
-----------------------------

The AlbumMaster package is defined as containing all the material listed in
the PACKING.LST text file.  If any files listed  in  the  PACKING.LST  text
file,  or the PACKING.LST file itself, are missing, then the package is not
complete and distribution is forbidden.  Please  contact  us  to  obtain  a
complete package suitable for distribution.

    o  The  program - including all related program files and documentation
files - CANNOT be modified in any way and must be distributed as a complete
package, without exception.  The PACKING.LST text file contains a  list  of
all files that are part of the AlbumMaster package.

    o  No  price  or  other compensation may be charged for the package.  A
distribution cost may be charged for the cost of the diskette, shipping and
handling, as long as the total (per disk) does not exceed  US$8.00  in  the
U.S. and Canada, or US$12.00 internationally.

    o The AlbumMaster package cannot be "rented" or "leased" to others.

    o  The  person receiving a copy of the AlbumMaster package MUST be made
aware that each disk or copy is  ONLY  for  evaluation,  and  that  Unicorn
Software Limited has not received any royalties or payment for the product.
This  requirement  can  be  met  by including the complete program package,
which contains any appropriate registration reminders.

    o The person receiving a copy of the AlbumMaster package MUST  be  made
aware  that  he  or  she  does  not  become a registered user until Unicorn
Software Limited has received payment for  registration  of  the  software.
This  requirement can be met by including the complete AlbumMaster package,
which contains any appropriate registration reminders.

    o Unicorn Software  Limited  prohibits  the  distribution  of  outdated
versions  of  the  AlbumMaster  package,  without  written  permission from
Unicorn Software Limited.  If the version you  have  is  over  twelve  (12)
months  old,  please  contact  us  to ensure that you have the most current
version.  This version was released in March, 1991.

    o Licensee shall not use, copy, rent, lease, sell,  modify,  decompile,
disassemble,  otherwise  reverse engineer, or transfer the licensed program
except as provided in this agreement.   Any  such  unauthorized  use  shall
result in immediate and automatic termination of this license.

    o  U.S.  Government Information: Use, duplication, or disclosure by the
U.S.  Government of the computer software and documentation in this package
shall be subject to the restricted rights applicable to commercial computer
software as set forth in subdivision (b)(3)(ii) of the Rights in  Technical
Data and Computer Software clause at 252.227-7013 (DFARS 52.227-7013).  The

Vendor Update Program:
----------------------

Most  vendors  have  standard procedures for acquiring new files.  They get
them from other vendors, BBSs, etc.  Most authors  cannot  afford  to  mail
disks  to  hundreds  (perhaps thousands) of vendors.  However, some vendors


prefer to obtain programs directly from the authors.  If you would like  to
obtain  programs  directly  from  us, automatically, then please help us to
cover the cost.

If you are NOT on our current mailing list, but you  would  still  like  to
receive  automatic  updates directly from us, then please take advantage of
our Vendor Update Program.  Under this program you can receive updates  for
an  entire  year for only $10 for all 11 programs (this helps to offset our
costs).

To receive updates, simply send us a letter with your name,  company  name,
mailing  address,  the  name  of the person we should contact (such as your
disk librarian), and a check or money order for $10. (Countries outside  of
North America please add an additional $10). Payment in U.S. funds drawn on
a U.S. bank only please.

The  Vendor  Update  Program  covers all eleven programs in release.  For a
complete list see the bottom of READ1ST.DOC (as of March, 1991)

All vendors participating in our Vendor Update Program  will  automatically
receive  any  NEW  programs  which we may release while their Vendor Update
Program is in effect.

The Vendor Update Program is only intended to help us cover our expenses in
those cases where a vendor desires to obtain the program directly from  us.
If you have other standard ways to obtain programs, then you may prefer not
to use our Vendor Update Program.

Please Help Us Serve You Better:
