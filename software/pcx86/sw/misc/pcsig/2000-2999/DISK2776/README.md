Disk No: 2776
Disk Title: The "perfect" Editor
PC-SIG Version: S1

Program Title: The "perfect" Editor
Author Version: 2.76
Author Registration: $39.00
Special Requirements: Hard drive recommended.

Is there any editor out there that is totally perfect?  Maybe not, but
THE "PERFECT" EDITOR is a great editor designed to facilitate the
building and writing of many types of documents.  With full mouse
support, configuration of colors, and lots more, there are, of course,
the typical word processing features: justification, word wrap, block
operations, etc. And then there's tiling of up to 20 windows, cutting
and pasting between windows, box graphics, and for the programmer,
editing in either hex or ASCII, with PE automatically making the
appropriate adjustments.  With a whole range of excellent features and
good documentation, THE "PERFECT" EDITOR is well worth the time to check
out!
