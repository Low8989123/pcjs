DEEP SPACE is a powerful star-mapping program with a database of 18,000 
stars, used by a number of serious astronomy publications to create     
their star charts.                                                      
                                                                        
It can produce all-sky views for any day and time anywhere on earth.    
Selected portions of the sky can be chosen by constellation or          
coordinates.  Comet paths can be computed and added to the star maps to 
create finder charts or to visualize the orbit of a comet from any point
in space.  A separate routine plots the positions of the planets        
throughout the year and generates orbit diagrams.                       
                                                                        
Although DEEP SPACE has many features that will be attractive to        
experts, it is simple enough to be used easily by beginners.  Each      
option provides intelligent default values in case the feature is beyond
the interest or knowledge of the user.  A simple star chart option is   
provided that bypasses most of the detailed options.                    
                                                                        
The most unique feature of DEEP SPACE is depth.  It can produce stereo  
3-D printouts that show the stars or the orbits of comets in their true 
three-dimensional relationships when viewed with a stereo viewer.  A 3-D
viewer kit is included in the registration price.                       
                                                                        
For centuries Man has gazed at the night-time sky and wondered what was 
out there.  DEEP SPACE will help answer some of those questions.
