## Information about "CONJECTURE"

    CONJECTURE is similar to a very popular TV game show.  You spin wheels,
    guess letters, and try to solve puzzles. The press called it
    "exceptional," and our customers rave over it.
    
    The graphics are excellent and there is a mode for playing solo or with
    up to 4 others. It comes with plenty of puzzles and you can
    customize the game to suit the way you like to play. CONJECTURE sold
    nationwide through major retail stores for $24.95 and is now being
    released as user-supported shareware.  It's great fun.
