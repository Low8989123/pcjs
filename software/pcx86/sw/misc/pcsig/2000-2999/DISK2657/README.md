WINEDIT is an ASCII text editor designed to be first and foremost a     
programmer's editor, with features which facilitate creating and        
maintaining program source code.  With its ASCII file format, ability   
to edit files of almost unlimited size, and word processing features    
such as headers and footers, WINEDIT also serves as an effective "front 
end" for desktop publishers and word processors including PageMaker,    
Word For Windows, and Ventura Publisher.                                
                                                                        
Features:                                                               
                                                                        
~ Uses all available Windows memory to load up to 16MB of text files.   
                                                                        
~ Multiple Document Interface allows an unlimited number of document    
windows.                                                                
                                                                        
~ Run your favorite compiler or other programming tool from within      
WINEDIT, monitor the compiler's output, and allow you to review any     
warning or error messages.                                              
                                                                        
~ Regular expressions can be used in search and replace operations for  
powerful text manipulation capabilities.                                
                                                                        
~ Full access to the Windows SDK help and C 6.0 language help by        
clicking on any SDK or C language key word.  (Requires the Windows help 
file SDKWIN.HLP provided with the Microsoft SDK and Microsoft QuickHelp 
provided with Microsoft C 6.0.)                                         
                                                                        
~ Prints half sized "two-up" pages side by side in landscape mode -     
ideal for source listings or early drafts of desktop publishing         
documents.                                                              
                                                                        
~ Headers and footers.  WINEDIT can optionally place the document name, 
date, and time in the header or footer of any printout.                 
                                                                        
~ Easy to use.  Online help is always available.  All major program     
features are available through the pulldown menus and dialog boxes.     
Most-used features have accelerator keys as well for lightning fast     
operation.                                                              
                                                                        
~ Fast.  One of WINEDIT's design goals is speed in all critical         
operations.  WINEDIT loads large files quickly, updates and scrolls the 
screen instantly, and keeps up with the fastest typist.

          Introduction

          WinEdit is an ASCII text editor designed to take full advantage
          of the Windows 3.0 graphical environment. WinEdit is first and
          foremost a programmer's editor, with features designed for
          creating and maintaining program source code.  With its ASCII
          file format, ability to edit files of almost unlimited size,
          and word processing features such as headers and footers,
          WinEdit also serves as an effective "front end" for
          desktop publishers and word processors including PageMaker,
          Word For Windows, and Ventura Publisher.


          Features

          *  Use all available Windows memory to load up to 16MB of text
             files.

          *  Multiple Document Interface allows an unlimited number of
             document windows.

          *  Run your favorite compiler or other programming tool from
             within WinEdit.  WinEdit will monitor the compiler's output
             and allow you to review any warning or error messages.

          *  Regular expressions can be used in search and replace
             operations for powerful text manipulation capabilities.

          *  Full access to the Windows SDK help and C 6.0 language help
             by clicking on any SDK or C language key word.  (Requires
             the Windows help file SDKWIN.HLP provided with the Microsoft
             SDK and Microsoft QuickHelp provided with Microsoft C 6.0.)

          *  Print half sized "two-up" pages side by side in landscape
             mode -  ideal for source listings or early drafts of
             desktop publishing  documents.

          *  Headers and footers.  WinEdit can optionally place
             the document name, date, and time in the header or
             footer of any printout.

          *  Easy to use.  Online help is always available.  All major
             program features are available through the pulldown menus and
             dialog boxes. Most-used features have accelerator keys as
             well for lightning fast operation.

          *  Fast.  One of WinEdit's design goals is speed in all critical
             operations.  WinEdit loads large files quickly, updates and
             scrolls the screen instantly, and keeps up with the fastest
             typist.

          GETTING STARTED


          Installing WinEdit

             Winedit requires only one file to run: WINEDIT.EXE.  Copy this
             file to a directory on your path, and you can start.  You
             should also copy the WinHelp file, WINEDIT.HLP, to the same
             directory.  If you are running Windows in 386 enhanced mode,
             you can copy the file EDTEMP.PIF to your Windows directory
             to allow WinEdit to compile from within a window.

             That's it!
             
          Entering License Information
          
             Choose this menu selection from the System Menu to enter your
             license number and ID when you register your copy of WinEdit.  
             Registering brings you wonderful benefits:

             - Gets rid of that pesky reminder window that comes up when
               you start the program.
             - Entitles you to one hour free telephone support for 90 days.
             - Gets you the latest version of WinEdit.
             - Gets you a printed User's Manual.
             - Encourages the authors of this program to continue bringing 
               you new and better products instead of breaking down and 
               getting a real job.


          Basic Operations

             WinEdit follows the standard conventions for Windows programs.
             Refer to Chapter 2 of your Microsoft Windows User's Guide for
             instructions on using menus, selecting text, working with
             dialog boxes, working with documents, and using Windows Help.

          Run Menu Commands

             The commands on this menu allow you to run other programs
             from within WinEdit.  Use the Configure... command to enter
             the necessary command to run the program.

             Select the Capture Output box and WinEdit will run the
             program you configure and save its output.  When the program
             finishes, WinEdit will allow you to review any warning or
             error messages that have occurred, along with the corresponding
             source code.

             WinEdit constructs a DOS batch file to execute when you choose
             to capture output.  For this reason, to run a Windows
             application from the Run Menu, do not choose to capture
             output.

             WinEdit Project Files
             ---------------------

             WinEdit saves the information from the Configure... dialog box
             in a private INI file with an extension of .WPJ (WinEdit
             Project File).  Choose the Save... pushbutton to save the
             contents of the dialog box in a .WPJ file.  Choose the Open...
             pushbutton to load an existing .WPJ file.

          PROCEDURES


          Changing Printers and Printer Options

             Select Printer Setup from the File menu to change printer
             settings.

             WinEdit will make the requested changes to your printer
             settings for this editing session only.  The default Windows
             settings will not be changed. To permanently change a printer
             setting, use Control Panel.

             Select Page Setup from the File menu to change the printer
             settings for margins, header, footer, printer font, and page
             layout.  WinEdit will remember these settings from session to
             session.


          Compiling (Running other programs)

             The first five commands on the Run menu are user-configurable
             commands to execute another program.  You may configure these
             commands to execute any .EXE  or .BAT program by typing the
             command text in the appropriate Configure... edit box.

             If the program supports DOS redirection (as most compilers
             and linkers do) you can select the Capture Output box to have
             WinEdit capture the program's output in a file.  When the
             program finishes, WinEdit will allow you to review any warning
             or error messages that have occurred, along with the
             corresponding source code.

             WinEdit constructs a DOS batch file to execute when you choose
             to capture output.  For this reason, to run a Windows
             application from the Run Menu, do not choose to capture
             output.

          Copying, Cutting, and Pasting Text

             To copy and paste, or cut and paste text:

             1. Select the text.

             2. Choose Copy from the Edit menu to copy the selected text
                to the clipboard.  Or choose Cut from the Edit menu to cut
                the text to the clipboard.

             3. Move the insertion point where you want the text to appear.
                Or select text you want the pasted text to replace.

             4. Choose Paste from the Edit menu.


          Creating New Documents

             Choose New from the File menu to open a new, untitled document
             window.

          Deleting Text

             To delete text without sending it to the clipboard:

             1. Select the text.

             2. Choose Delete from the Edit menu or press the Delete key.

             If there is no selection, Delete deletes the character to the
             right of the insertion point.


          Extended Help

             Press Shift+F1 or click the Right Mouse Button on any Windows
             SDK function, message, or data structure name and WinEdit will
             access the SDKWIN.HLP topic for that item.

             If the word is not a valid Windows SDK topic, WinEdit will
             pass the word to QH.EXE (Microsoft's QuickHelp program,
             supplied with most Microsoft language products).  This will
             allow you online access to any language or library keyword
             covered in the QuickHelp database.

             For SDK Help, the WinHelp file SDKWIN.HLP must be in either
             the current directory, the Windows directory, or a directory
             listed in your PATH statement.

             For QuickHelp, QH.EXE must be in either the current directory,
             the Windows directory, or a directory listed in your PATH
             statement. In addition, you must have an environment variable
             "HELPFILES=" defined which tells QH.EXE where to look to find
             the appropriate QuickHelp database files.


          Printing Documents

             Choose Print from the File menu to send the current document
             to the printer.


          Printing Headers and Footers

             Choose Page Setup from the File menu to configure header and
             footer text.  Type the text you wish to appear at the top and
             bottom of each page.

             You can use the following special characters in headers and
             footers:

             * %f      The document name will appear.

             * %d      The file date and time will appear, unless the file has
                       been changed, in which case the current date and time
                       will appear.
                       
             * %p      The page number will appear.

          Saving Documents

             Choose Save from the File menu to save a document.  Choose
             Save As to save the document with a new name, or to save an
             untitled document.


          Setting Preferences

             Choose Preferences from the File menu to choose a screen
             font, default tab size, whether or not to show the Control
             Bar, and startup file loading options.

          Setting Margins

             Choose Page Setup from the File menu to change the margins
             used for printouts.  You can enter the measurements for top,
             bottom, left, and right margins.

             The margin settings are in inches or centimeters,
             corresponding to the English or Metric Measurement setting
             in Control Panel.


          Undo

             Choose Undo from the Edit menu to restore the current line
             to the state it was when the insertion point was first moved
             in to it.


          Using Regular Expressions

             A regular expression is a search or replace string that uses
             special characters to match text patterns.  WinEdit supports
             UNIX style regular expressions.

             When WinEdit conducts a search using regular expressions, it
             must check character by character in your text.  For this
             reason, searches using regular expressions are slower than
             regular searches.

             The following table describes the regular expression
             characters recognized by WinEdit.

             Expression                    Description
             --------------------------------------------------------------
              \         Escape. WinEdit will ignore any special meaning of
                        the character that follows the Escape expression.
                        Use the Escape if you need to search for a literal
                        character that matches a regular expression.

              .         Wild Card. Matches any character.  For example, the
                        expression 'X.X' will match 'XaX', 'XbX, and
                        'XcX', but not 'XaaX'.

              ^         Beginning Of Line. The expression matches only if
                        it occurs at the beginning of a line. For example,
                        '^for' matches the text 'for' only when it occurs
                        at the beginning of a line.

              $         End Of Line. The expression matches only if it
                        occurs at the end of a line.  For example,
                        '(void)$' matches the text '(void)' only when it
                        occurs at the end of a line.

              []        Character Class. The expression matches any
                        character in the class specified within the
                        brackets.  Use a dash (-) to specify a range of
                        character values. For example, '[a-zA-Z0-9]'
                        matches any letter or number, and '[xyz]' matches
                        'x', 'y', or 'z'.

             [^]        Inverse Class. The expression matches any character
                        not specified in the class. For example, '[^a-zA-Z]'
                        matches any character that is not a letter.

              *         Repeat Operator. Matches zero or more occurences of
                        the character that precedes the '*'.  For example,
                        'XY*X' matches 'XX', 'XYX', and 'XYYX.

              +         Repeat Operator. Matches one or more occurences of
                        the character that precedes the '+'.  For example,
                        'XY+X' matches 'XYX' and 'XYYX, but not 'XX'.

          SOFTWARE LICENSE

          WinEdit is not and has never been public domain software, nor is
          it free software.

          Non-licensed users are granted a limited license to use WinEdit
          on a 21-day trial basis for the purpose of determining whether
          WinEdit is suitable for their needs.  The use of WinEdit, except
          for the initial 21-day trial, requires registration.  The use of
          unlicensed copies of WinEdit by any person, business,
          corporation, government agency or any other entity is strictly
          prohibited.

          A single user license permits a user to use WinEdit only on a
          single computer.  Licensed users may use the program on
          different computers, but may not use the program on more than
          one computer at the same time.

          No one may modify or patch the WinEdit executable files in any
          way, including but not limited to decompiling, disassembling,
          or otherwise reverse engineering the program.

          A limited license is granted to copy and distribute WinEdit
          only for the trial use of others, subject to the above
          limitations, and also the following:

          1) WinEdit must be copied in unmodified form, complete with
             the file containing this license information.

          2) The full machine-readable WinEdit documentation must be
             included with each copy.

          3) WinEdit may not be distributed in conjunction with any
             other product without a specific license to do so from
             Wilson WindowWare.

          4) No fee, charge, or other compensation may be requested or
             accepted, except as authorized below:

             A) Operators of electronic bulletin board systems (sysops)
                may make WinEdit available for downloading only as long
                as the above conditions are met.  An overall or time-
                dependent charge for the use of the bulletin board system
                is permitted as long as there is not a specific charge
                for the download of WinEdit.

             B) Vendors of user-supported or shareware software approved
                by the ASP may distribute WinEdit, subject to the above
                conditions, without specific permission.  Non-approved
                vendors may distribute WinEdit only after obtaining
                written permission from Wilson WindowWare. Such
                permission is usually granted. Please write for details
                (enclose your catalog).  Vendors may charge a disk
                duplication and handling fee, which, when pro-rated to
                the WinEdit product, may not exceed eight dollars.
