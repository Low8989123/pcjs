## Information about "HANDICAP II"

    HANDICAP II will make scoring a lot easier for you serious and not-so-
    serious golfers.  Now you can keep track of up to 20 scores for each of
    72 golfers.  Just enter each golfer's name, course name, ratings, slopes
    and pars, course handicaps, and gross and net scores; HANDICAP II
    does the rest.  It will calculate handicap, handicap index, average
    gross, and average putts - all according to the rules in the "USGA
    Handicap System and Golf Committee Manual."  In addition, you can print
    handicap cards, data on all the players, and postings.  HANDICAP II is
    easy for anyone to use and includes all the instructions you need in
    its help menus.  FORE!
