Author Version: 2.5

Special Requirements: Hard drive.                                       
                                                                        
DREAM is a relational database program that comes in three diskettes,   
all three needed to complete the package.  The archiving procedure was  
used to combine the contents of original five DREAM disks into three.   
                                                                        
DREAM, produced by PC-Systems, is a relational database system with     
extreme power and flexiblity.  Much like dBASE, it can custom design    
database applications, which include reports, sorting abilities, query  
abilities, and data entry and retrieval abilities without writing       
code.  DREAM comes complete with over 200K worth of on-line and manual  
documentation which lead the user step by step through the program.     
DREAM can handle over 32,000 records per data file with over 1,500      
characters per fixed record length.

                               Dream Installation



1. We assume that your hard disk is formatted and that the necessary
     DOS files have been copied onto the hard disk.

2. Create directory called DREAM. The hard disk is assigned to drive C.

                         MKDIR C:\DREAM

3. Change directory to the one created in the previous step using command

                          CHDIR C:\DREAM

4. Insert DREAM system diskette #1 in drive A. If your hard drive id is C,
     then type
                           A:INSTALL

5. Follow the procedure for DREAM system diskette #2 and #3 required by
     the installation program.
