## Information about "HANDICAP HORSE RACING"

    Here's a horse racing simulation so real it practically leaves
    hoofprints.  You control the horse registry, jockey, feed bills, stall
    rentals, liqudations, claiming races, auctions, and pari-mutuel
    betting.  HANDICAP HORSE RACING has brought what used to be a simple
    game into the world of high stakes and heart-pounding finishes.
    
    You're the marshal, or track commissioner, and you have a lot to do
    before, during and after the race.  Before you even open the gates to
    the track, you must prepare the registry, see to your funds for race
    pay-offs, and rental and fees from your track stables.  When your
    guests arrive, they'll be bringing their own money (play) for a day at
    the races.  The system will make the race call and help you determine
    the payoff after a race.
    
    With your registry changing as a result of each race, the excitment
    will grow every time you play.  Your guests will look forward to
    playing their "Best of Breed" against the field.  A limited number of
    horses running on an oval track with no betting action are supported.
    Registered users receive a track construction system, full betting
    action and a large stable of horses.

Back in the computer's early game-playing days, a horse race            
involved either waiting for race results from an imaginary track,       
or watching little dots of light run randomly around the screen.        
Those days are long since gone. HANDICAP HORSE RACING has brought       
what used to be a simple game into the world of high stakes and         
heart-pounding finishes.                                                
                                                                        
From someone who used to press a button to start the game, you          
become The Marshal, or track commissioner, and you do a lot more        
before, during and after the race. Before you even open the gates       
to the track, you must prepare the Registry, see to your funds for      
race pay-offs and rental and fees from your track stables. When         
your guests arrive, they'll be bringing their own money (play) for      
a day at the races. The system will make the race call and even         
help you determine who get how much afterwards.                         
                                                                        
With your Registry changing as a result of each race, the excitment     
will grow every time you play. Your guest will look forward to play-    
ing their "Best of Breed" against the field.
