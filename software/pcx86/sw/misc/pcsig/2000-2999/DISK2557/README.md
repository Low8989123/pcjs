Special Requirements: 256K RAM.                                         
                                                                        
The folks that brought you AS-EASY-AS have a new "lite" version of their
popular program. ALITE is a powerful spreadsheet program with graphics  
and minimum hardware requirements.  The program should run on any IBM or
compatible computer with 256k or more (that's right, only 256k),        
equipped with a MONO, CGA or EGA monitor. It's ideal for laptops were   
memory space is at a premium.                                           
                                                                        
Graphics may be printed on any 9-pin EPSON or graphics compatible       
printer, or PIC files may be created for inclusion in other programs.

     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                            
     The  ALITE program and all other programs and materials distributed
     or shipped with it are Copyright TRIUS,  Inc.,  1988-1991,  and are
     protected by U.S.  and international copyright law.  In the rest of
     this document, this collection of programs is referred to simply as
     "ALITE".   You are granted a license to use your copy of ALITE only
     under the terms and conditions specified in this license agreement.
                                                                        
     A  "registered"   copy of ALITE is a copy distributed  on  diskette
     bearing   the  original  TRIUS  and  ALITE  registered  trademarks,
     purchased  from  TRIUS,   Inc.  or from  an  authorized  re-seller,
     accompanied by a printed bound manual.                            
                                                                        
     A  "shareware"  copy of ALITE is a copy distributed on diskette  or
     via  an  electronic  bulletin board,  on-line  service,   or  other
     electronic  means,   obtained  from a shareware  disk  vendor,   or
     obtained   from   another   individual,    without   any    printed
     documentation, other than what is contained on the disk.           
                                                                        
     Shareware  copies of ALITE are distributed to allow you to try  the
     program  before  you pay for it.   They are Copyright 1991   TRIUS,
     Inc.,   and do not constitute "free"  or "public domain"  software.
     You  may  use a shareware copy of ALITE at no charge  for  a  trial
     period of up to 30 days.  If you wish to continue using ALITE after
     that period,  you must purchase a registered copy.   If you  choose
     not  to  purchase a registered copy,  you must  stop  using  ALITE,
     though you may keep copies and pass them along to others.          
                                                                        
     Your  registered copy of ALITE may only be used on one computer  at
     any  given  time,  unless you have a site license,  in which  case,
     ALITE may only be used on the number of computers specified in your
     site license agreement.                                            
                                                                        
     You  may  install  your  registered copy of  ALITE  on  a  computer
     attached to a network,  or remove it from one computer and  install
     it on a different one,  provided there is no possibility that  your
     copy  will be used by more than one user,  unless you have  a  site
     license,   in  which  case there should be no  possibility  of  the
     program being used by more users than it is licensed for.  A "user"
     is  defined  as  one keyboard which is connected to a  computer  on
     which ALITE is installed,  regardless of whether or not the user of
     the  keyboard  is aware of the installation or use of ALITE on  the
     system.                                                            
                                                                        
     You  may copy any version of ALITE for normal backup purposes,  and
     you may give copies of the PROGRAM to other individuals, which they
     may also use and copy subject to the terms of this agreement.    If
     you  copy  the  shareware version of ALITE for  others,   you  must
     include  all of the files distributed with it,  including this one.
     You may not make any copies of the printed and bound ALITE  manual,
     or  copies  of  a  printed version of this  file  without  explicit
     written permission from TRIUS, Inc.                                
                                                                        
     You  may NOT distribute ALITE other than through individual  copies
     of the SHAREWARE version passed to friends and associates for their
     individual use.   Specifically, you may not place ALITE or any part
     of the ALITE package in a commercial library, or distribute it with
     any other product or as an incentive to purchase any other product,
     without permission from TRIUS, Inc.

             -------------------------------------------------

         Copyright 1991, TRIUS, Inc.  All Rights Reserved Worldwide.  
         Published by TRIUS, Inc., P.O. BOX 249, N. Andover, MA 01845-
         1639, USA, Tel. (508) 794-9377, FAX: (508) 688-6312
   
         This file provides information for the distribution of 
         shareware copies of ALITE.   Please note that this policy is 
         for commercial vendors, and anyone distributing shareware copies 
         of ALITE for profit.

         We require that you obtain written permission from us before 
         placing ALITE in any commercial library, unless you have been 
         approved by the Association of Shareware Professionals and have 
         notified us that you wish to distribute ALITE.  

         Please note that before we can send you a copy of ALITE and
         give you permission to distribute it, we require that you meet
         one of the following conditions: 

         1. Send us a copy of your standard written materials 
            (catalogs, flyers, ads, etc.) which clearly explain the 
            shareware concept, the need for users to register shareware 
            products they use, and the fact that the price of your 
            disks, that the user pays to you, is a copying fee ONLY and 
            does not constitute payment for the product.  The material 
            must also clearly differentiate between Shareware and 
            Public Domain software. 

            Note that it is not sufficient to tell us that you explain 
            these issues to customers in person, it must be clearly 
            reflected in your written materials. 


         2. Become an Approved Vendor of the Association of Shareware 
            Professionals (ASP).  For more information on the ASP 
            vendor program, contact the ASP at: 

                     Association of Shareware Professionals
                     Vendor Certification Committee
                     545 Grover Road
                     Muskegon, MI 49442-9427


         If you have not already done so, we strongly recommend that 
         you become an ASP approved vendor.  The ASP vendor program 
         provides an important service for both authors and vendors, 
         and gives customers confidence that reasonable standards are 
         met in the distribution of shareware products. 

         We find it necessary to insist on meeting one of the two 
         conditions, stated above, in order to qualify for shareware 
         distribution of ALITE.  Widespread confusion about shareware 
         and the occasionally troublesome practices of some vendors 
         unfortunately force us to do so.   We look forward to working 
         with you in the future.  Please feel free to contact us if you 
         have any questions or comments on our product or our policies. 

         You can contact us at any of the addresses below.  Please mail 
         materials to us at the P.O. Box address.
