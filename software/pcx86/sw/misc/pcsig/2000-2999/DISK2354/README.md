    executive) into a database.
    
    Features include:
    
    ~ Menu integration to EZ-FORMS EXECUTIVE or EZ-FORMS LITE.
    
    ~ Handles information quickly and easily.
    
    ~ Converts from several other popular data formats, like fixed-length,
    ASCII and "FileExpress."
    
    ~ Reads/writes industry standard .DBF files.
    
    ~ Will create an input screen from your .DBF file.
    
    ~ Handles over 2.1 BILLION records, limited only by disk space.
    
    ~ Full tutorial for the database novice. "DR" program is included to
    create a meaningful database of all the files on any hard or floppy
    drive.
    
    ~ Quickly create from, or match to, a database from an existing form.
    
    ~ On-line manual and extensive context-sensitive Help.
    
    ~ Query, seek, find, and browse modes quickly scan your records.
    
    ~ Print fancy labels using a form as a label.
    
    ~ Modify database format to add/delete fields, change field sizes.
    
    ~ Quick Report feature for on-the-fly counting, adding and averaging.
    
    ~ Multiple indexes: Have your database sorted every way you can.
    
    ~ Automatic indexing as new records are added.
    
    ~ Duplicate search mode.
    
    ~ Merge or append other database files.
    
    ~ Keyboard macros for those repetitive tasks.
    
    ~ Field validations: numeric, logical, date.
    
    ~ Can be used as a fill-out only module for EZFX or EZFL.
    
    ~ Forms printing with all the features supported in the source form.
    
    ~ EZFX v2.4 or EZFL vE20 or higher is required to modify master forms.
    A number of pre-designed forms and applications are included, but they
    can only be modified with EZ-FORMS EXECUTIVE, or EZ-FORMS LITE.
