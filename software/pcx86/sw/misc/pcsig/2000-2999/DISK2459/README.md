## Information about "ZIP MANAGER & MONITOR SAVER"

    Zip Manager is a Windows 3.0 shell for files compressed using PKZIP,
    ARC, and LZH formats.  It also gives you access to Vernon Buerg's
    LIST.COM program, McAffee's Virus SCAN program, and your favorite text
    editor--either DOS or Windows based.  Zip Manager is an easy way to use
    these programs in Windows.
    
    Zip Manager offers all of the available command line switches for PKZIP
    and PKUNZIP.  By simply selecting the appropriate menu item, the user
    can easily set the program to store the path name with the Zip file,
    recurse sub-directories, retain the original Zip file date, etc.
    
    Zip Manager makes it easy for even a novice to use the PKZIP programs
    in a simple point and shoot environment.  Creating a Zip file is simply
    a matter of moving through a few dialog boxes, choosing the files to
    add to the zip file, and then clicking on OK to create it.  The program
    gives the user complete control over every aspect of Zip file
    management.
    
    The commenting of Zip files has never been easier.  Zip Manager allows
    you to specify exactly how you would like to comment the file.  It even
    allows you to comment an individual file contained in a large zip file
    simply by selecting the desired file.  You are then asked to enter the
    comment for that file only.  This is a feature that is offered by no
    other program.
    
    The Windows environment is more fun to look at than DOS, but without
    this program the Windows display is likely to be burned into your
    monitor's phosphors forever.  Monitor Saver is designed especially for
    Windows 3.0 with customizable delay times and network compatibility.
    The program can blank the screen, or fill it with a moving pattern after
    a period of keyboard inactivity.

 About Monitor Saver
 ------------------
 Monitor Saver is a screen blanking utility designed for use with Microsoft
 Windows version 3.0 and above. Please take the time to read this documentation
 carefully. Doing so will ensure that you correctly install and understand
 the features of Version 2.0.
 
 Default Delay Time
 ------------------
 Monitor Saver has a default delay time of 15 minutes.  If this value
 is acceptable, no further action is required.
 
 Setting A Custom Delay Time
 ---------------------------
 If you would like to assign Monitor Saver a different delay time
 than the default, you will need to follow the steps outlined below.
 
 1.)  Use the Windows Notepad and open your win.ini file.

 2.)  Add the following statement:
      [Monitor Saver]
      Delay=X
 The value of X represents the time delay in minutes before Monitor Saver
 will blank your screen. You may assign X any value between 1 and 99 minutes.

 3.)  Save your win.ini file.
 
 4.)  Restart Windows to invoke the new delay time.
 
 Delay Time For The Current Session Only.
 ----------------------------------------
 Monitor Saver Allows you to change the delay time by selecting
 Setup from the System Menu. You can enter a delay time from 1 to 99
 minutes. This value will be current until you change it again or exit Windows.
 
 The System Menu
 ---------------
 To access the Monitor Saver System Menu click on the Program Icon.
 The menu contains the Setup and About selections. This allows you to set
 a new delay time without having to restore the program first.
 
 New Active Screen Displays
 --------------------------
 The User may now select from 3 different active screen displays.
 By default Monitor Saver will display a blank screen.
 See the next section for setting the default screen you would like to use.

 Clock - Icon
 ------------
 Monitor Saver displays a Window with the program icon and the
 current time.
 
 Icon Only
 ---------
 Monitor Saver displays the program icon only.

 None
 ----
 Many user's wanted the option of having nothing displayed while their
 monitor was blanked. This option displays only a blank screen when active.



                                      (1)


 Selecting The Active Screen
 ----------------------------
 You may change the active screen for the current Windows session by
 selecting one of the radio buttons from the setup menu. This allows you to
 easily change the screen if desired.

 If you would like to assign Monitor Saver a different active screen
 to use as the default follow the steps outlined below:
 
 1.)  Use the Windows Notepad and open your win.ini file.

 2.)  Add the following to the [Monitor Saver] line.
      Display=

      Place one of the following display types after the = sign:
      They MUST be entered in LOWER CASE ONLY!:
      clock
      icon
      none

 clock      This displays the program icon and the current time.

 icon       This will display the program icon only.


 none       This will as the name implies display a blank screen for those
            that prefer this. This is the default display.

 3.)  Save your win.ini file.
 
 4.)  Restart Windows to invoke the new active screen.

 Changing The Icon
 -----------------
 To change the icon follow the steps outlined Below.
 NOTE: This applies to the Desktop Icon Only!
 1.) Click on the current Monitor Saver icon.
 2.) Select File from the Program Manager Menu.
 3.) Choose Properties from the menu.
 4.) You will see the Change Icon dialog control.
 5.) Select it and Windows will prompt you for the program name
    that contains an icon you wish to use.
 6.) You may also enter an icon name such as mycustom.ico. Monitor Saver
    will now use that Icon. The Windows user's guide describes in more detail 
    how to change program icons if you have any further questions.
 
 Non Windows Screen Blanking
 ---------------------------
 When using a Non Windows Program in full screen mode or in a Window,
 Monitor Saver will blank the screen, return you to the Windows Desktop and
 Iconize your Non Windows program.

 It is important to understand the following concepts concerning Non Windows
 Applications, the DOS shell, and some Network Drivers. When you execute one
 of these programs the following occurs. Windows turns over I/O control to
 DOS and in doing so disables its own I/O detection routines. Windows
 however does NOT suspend its internal timer functions.  This is desireable
 for many Windows Programs since they continue to receive timer input.
 The clock program is a good example as it continues to keep time even though
 DOS currently has control.



                                      (2)



 This situation presents a problem for Monitor Saver. It is receiving
 timer messages from Windows, but is unable to detect any keyboard or
 mouse events since DOS currently has control of those events. As a result
 Monitor Saver will blank the screen even if you are actively using the
 program.  This will also occur if you have placed your Non Windows program
 in a Window by pressing Alt Enter.

 It is important that Monitor Saver retain its ability to blank a Non Windows
 Screen to afford you with complete monitor protection.  When using the DOS
 shell or a Non Windows Program the delay time in effect will be multiplied
 by a factor of 4. This factor will depend on the time slice settings you
 have chosen for background processing. This provides monitor with protection
 with minimum interaction by the user.
 
 By setting the delay time to 99 minutes from the system menu you can
 effectively extend Non Window screen blanking to a period equal to 4 times
 the 99 minutes. You will still benefit from screen blanking if your
 computer is left on for an extended period of time.
 
 Starting Monitor Saver
 ----------------------
 There are several ways to start and use Monitor Saver.
 Listed below are the most desireable options:
 
 Using The Load Command
 ----------------------
 The win.ini file contains a line that reads load=. Change the line to read
 load=D:\PATHNAME\MS.EXE, where d: represents the drive and pathname
 represents the directory in which you have placed Monitor Saver.
 In most cases the line will read load=C:\WINDOWS\MS.EXE
 
 Using The Run Command
 ---------------------
 The win.ini file contains a line that reads run=. Follow the directions
 for the load command. If you have copied Monitor Saver into your Windows
 directory the run line would read: run=MS.EXE
 
 Other Options
 -------------
 You should add Monitor Saver to an existing program group. Please
 follow the directions in your Windows 3.0 users guide for adding programs to
 a group.

 About Monitor Saver
 ------------------
 Monitor Saver is a screen blanking utility designed for use with Microsoft
 Windows version 3.0 and above. Please take the time to read this documentation
 carefully. Doing so will ensure that you correctly install and understand
 the features of Version 2.0.
 
 Default Delay Time
 ------------------
 Monitor Saver has a default delay time of 15 minutes.  If this value
 is acceptable, no further action is required.
 
 Setting A Custom Delay Time
 ---------------------------
 If you would like to assign Monitor Saver a different delay time
 than the default, you will need to follow the steps outlined below.
 
 1.)  Use the Windows Notepad and open your win.ini file.

 2.)  Add the following statement:
      [Monitor Saver]
      Delay=X
 The value of X represents the time delay in minutes before Monitor Saver
 will blank your screen. You may assign X any value between 1 and 99 minutes.

 3.)  Save your win.ini file.
 
 4.)  Restart Windows to invoke the new delay time.
 
 Delay Time For The Current Session Only.
 ----------------------------------------
 Monitor Saver Allows you to change the delay time by selecting
 Setup from the System Menu. You can enter a delay time from 1 to 99
 minutes. This value will be current until you change it again or exit Windows.
 
 The System Menu
 ---------------
 To access the Monitor Saver System Menu click on the Program Icon.
 The menu contains the Setup and About selections. This allows you to set
 a new delay time without having to restore the program first.
 
 New Active Screen Displays
 --------------------------
 The User may now select from 3 different active screen displays.
 By default Monitor Saver will display a blank screen.
 See the next section for setting the default screen you would like to use.

 Clock - Icon
 ------------
 Monitor Saver displays a Window with the program icon and the
 current time.
 
 Icon Only
 ---------
 Monitor Saver displays the program icon only.

 None
 ----
 Many user's wanted the option of having nothing displayed while their
 monitor was blanked. This option displays only a blank screen when active.



                                      (1)


 Selecting The Active Screen
 ----------------------------
 You may change the active screen for the current Windows session by
 selecting one of the radio buttons from the setup menu. This allows you to
 easily change the screen if desired.

 If you would like to assign Monitor Saver a different active screen
 to use as the default follow the steps outlined below:
 
 1.)  Use the Windows Notepad and open your win.ini file.

 2.)  Add the following to the [Monitor Saver] line.
      Display=

      Place one of the following display types after the = sign:
      They MUST be entered in LOWER CASE ONLY!:
      clock
      icon
      none

 clock      This displays the program icon and the current time.

 icon       This will display the program icon only.


 none       This will as the name implies display a blank screen for those
            that prefer this. This is the default display.

 3.)  Save your win.ini file.
 
 4.)  Restart Windows to invoke the new active screen.

 Changing The Icon
 -----------------
 To change the icon follow the steps outlined Below.
 NOTE: This applies to the Desktop Icon Only!
 1.) Click on the current Monitor Saver icon.
 2.) Select File from the Program Manager Menu.
 3.) Choose Properties from the menu.
 4.) You will see the Change Icon dialog control.
 5.) Select it and Windows will prompt you for the program name
    that contains an icon you wish to use.
 6.) You may also enter an icon name such as mycustom.ico. Monitor Saver
    will now use that Icon. The Windows user's guide describes in more detail 
    how to change program icons if you have any further questions.
 
 Non Windows Screen Blanking
 ---------------------------
 When using a Non Windows Program in full screen mode or in a Window,
 Monitor Saver will blank the screen, return you to the Windows Desktop and
 Iconize your Non Windows program.

 It is important to understand the following concepts concerning Non Windows
 Applications, the DOS shell, and some Network Drivers. When you execute one
 of these programs the following occurs. Windows turns over I/O control to
 DOS and in doing so disables its own I/O detection routines. Windows
 however does NOT suspend its internal timer functions.  This is desireable
 for many Windows Programs since they continue to receive timer input.
 The clock program is a good example as it continues to keep time even though
 DOS currently has control.



                                      (2)



 This situation presents a problem for Monitor Saver. It is receiving
 timer messages from Windows, but is unable to detect any keyboard or
 mouse events since DOS currently has control of those events. As a result
 Monitor Saver will blank the screen even if you are actively using the
 program.  This will also occur if you have placed your Non Windows program
 in a Window by pressing Alt Enter.

 It is important that Monitor Saver retain its ability to blank a Non Windows
 Screen to afford you with complete monitor protection.  When using the DOS
 shell or a Non Windows Program the delay time in effect will be multiplied
 by a factor of 4. This factor will depend on the time slice settings you
 have chosen for background processing. This provides monitor with protection
 with minimum interaction by the user.
 
 By setting the delay time to 99 minutes from the system menu you can
 effectively extend Non Window screen blanking to a period equal to 4 times
 the 99 minutes. You will still benefit from screen blanking if your
 computer is left on for an extended period of time.
 
 Starting Monitor Saver
 ----------------------
 There are several ways to start and use Monitor Saver.
 Listed below are the most desireable options:
 
 Using The Load Command
 ----------------------
 The win.ini file contains a line that reads load=. Change the line to read
 load=D:\PATHNAME\MS.EXE, where d: represents the drive and pathname
 represents the directory in which you have placed Monitor Saver.
 In most cases the line will read load=C:\WINDOWS\MS.EXE
 
 Using The Run Command
 ---------------------
 The win.ini file contains a line that reads run=. Follow the directions
 for the load command. If you have copied Monitor Saver into your Windows
 directory the run line would read: run=MS.EXE
 
 Other Options
 -------------
 You should add Monitor Saver to an existing program group. Please
 follow the directions in your Windows 3.0 users guide for adding programs to
 a group.
