## Information about "LE_C C LIBRARY FUNCTIONS"

    The LE_C LIBRARY is a set of C run-time functions that allow you to
    easily create programs that implement many of today's standard user
    interfaces such as menus, box menus, data entry, help facility, line
    drawing, border drawing (including exploding boxes), and more.
    
    What makes the LE_C LIBRARY unique is its integrated help facility. All
    of the menu and input functions support help screens.  Specify help
    screens unique to each menu selection and even move the help window
    within the screen.  Help screens are an important part of any program,
    especially those using data-entry.  The LE_C LIBRARY provides you with
    the help functions you need to build professional-looking programs.
    
    Specify up to 40 special function keys (Ctrl-F1, Ctrl-End, etc.) for
    use with the menu and input functions.  These 40 keys are in addition
    to the pre-defined commonly-used function keys.  The screen functions
    write directly to video memory resulting in exceptional display speed.
    
    You can increase the functional and aesthetic value of your programs
    with the LE_C C LIBRARY functions.  A demonstration program is included
    to illustrate the value of this library.

LE_C - C Library Functions - Version 1.0

FILE            DESCRIPTION
--------------  -----------------------------------------------
LE_C.LIB        LE_C Object Code Library for Linking C Programs
LE_C.H          LE_C Header File
LE_C.MAN        LE_C Manual
LE_DEMO.EXE     LE_C Demo Program - Type LE_DEMO to execute
LE_DEMO.HLP     LE_C Demo Program Help File
LE_C.ZIP        All of the above files compressed using PKZIP


GENERAL DESCRIPTION
-------------------

The LE_C Library is a comprehensive set of C run-time functions
that allows you to easily create programs that implement many of
today's standard user interfaces.  LE_C contains routines for
menus, box menus, data entry, help facility, border drawing
(including exploding boxes), line drawing, and much, much more. 
Most of the LE_C functions write directly to the video memory
page -- giving you fast screens.

What makes LE_C unique is its integrated help facility functions. 
LE_C allows you to create a very useful help facility with a
minimum of fuss.  All of the menu and input functions of LE_C
support help screens.  In addition, you can specify help screens
unique to each menu selection.  Plus, LE_C will allow the user to
move the help window within the screen.

LE_C also allows you to specify up to 40 special function keys
(e.g. Ctrl-F1, Ctrl-End, etc.) for use with the menu and input
functions.  These 40 keys are in addition to the pre-defined
commonly used function keys.

Extra Bonus!  All registered users will receive the screen
painter & code generator.  The screen painter & code generator
allows you to create screens complete with boxes and lines.  This
utility will then generate LE_C function calls for the desired
screen.
