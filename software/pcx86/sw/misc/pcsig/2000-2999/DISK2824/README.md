Disk Title: Model-S  3 of 3 (#2822 & #2823)                             
PC-SIG Version: S2.5                                                    
                                                                        
Program Title: Model-S

Special Requirements: A hard drive.                                     
                                                                        
MODEL-S is a CASE tool for developing database applications.  This is a 
quality product that can rival any commercial package in its class.  In 
fact, our research indicates that MODEL-S is unique in its design and   
functionality.                                                          
                                                                        
MODEL-S is a powerful piece of software that automates the development  
process yet does not require data processing expertise.  It utilizes the
rapid prototyping approach to application development, integrated with  
automatic generation of the dBASE III Plus programs and data files (.PRG
and .DBF).                                                              
                                                                        
Improvements to MODEL-S include menu driven navigation through the      
system, many prompting features, and a complete User Guide (166 pages)  
ready for printing.                                                     
                                                                        
MODEL-S was designed to enable end users and data processing            
professionals to engage in a true joint application development, which  
promotes active participation of both in most aspects of the development
process.  It helps producing systems on time, within budget, and with   
complete user satisfaction -- all that at a fraction of the traditional 
development cost.
