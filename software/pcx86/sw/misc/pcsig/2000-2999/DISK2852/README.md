Disk No: 2852                                                           
Disk Title: PC-Write Standard 2 of 4                                    
PC-SIG Version: S1                                                      
                                                                        
Program Title: PC-Write Standard Level                                  
Author Version: 2.0                                                     
Author Registration: $129.00                                            
Special Requirements: 384K RAM (640K recommended).                      
                                                                        
With PC-WRITE STANDARD LEVEL, Quicksoft introduces a new member of the  
PC-Write family of word processors.  Ease of use is stressed in this    
version without limiting its standard word processing options.          
                                                                        
Pull-down menus help to keep the learning curve short for the novice.   
The more experienced word processor may choose to bypass the pull-down  
menus in favor of the faster function key commands or use both.  Mouse  
support is offered, as is online context-sensitive Help.  Multiple      
windows allow you to edit up to ten windows or documents at one time.   
Also included is a conversion tool to import and export files to and    
from WordPerfect, ASCII, and DCA/RFT standards.                         
                                                                        
To complete the package, Quicksoft introduces the ``adaptable word      
processor'' which lets you customize it to your specific word processing
needs.  Control the look and feel of the program.  Customizing has never
been easier.  Set your preferences, or ``select your profile,'' from the
pull-down menu bar, the program's Customizer, or during installation.
