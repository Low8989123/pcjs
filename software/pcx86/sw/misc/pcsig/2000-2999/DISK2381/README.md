       350K  of  free  Ram, an EGA graphics adapter,  and  a  MicroSoft

                       SHAREWARE VS REGISTERED VERSION

       Roulette  is written in two versions, a ShareWare version    and   
       a  Registered  version.  The ShareWare version is not   crippled  
       in  any  way.   This is a fully functional program of   Roulette  
       .  The Registered  version comes with added features which  will 
       allow   the  user  more  flexibility with Roulette.   Users   of  
       the   ShareWare version  will  have a message appear at the  end  
       of  the   game.  The  message  will  state  that the program  is  
       NOT    free   and  continued   use  of  the  program    requires   
       registration   with United Innovations Plus.

       To   register  Roulette, fill in the registration form  on   the  
       last  page  of  this  documentation and  send  in  the  required 
       registration fee.

                                    - 1 -








       The  following  documentation  for  Roulette  explains  all  the  
       features  for  the Registered version.   The  words  "Registered 
       Version  Only" may  appear  throughout the documentation.  These 
       are   the  added features which are available in the  Registered 
       version ONLY.


                                ROULETTE WHEEL

       The  Roulette  wheel  has 38 pockets containing  the  numbers  1 
       through 36, O and OO.  The numbers on the wheel are laid out  in 
       circular  fashion as to separate them by color, high, low,  odd, 
       and  even.   The  symbols O and OO are  directly  opposite  each 
       other, separated by eighteen numbers on each side.  The  symbols 
       O and OO are green in color.  The remaining numbers are red  and 
       black which alternate in color around the wheel.


                               ROULETTE LAYOUT

       The  main  portion  of the layout is comprised  of  36  numbered 
       rectangular  spaces arranged in three long columns of 12  spaces 
       each.  The spaces at the head of the rows are numbered 1, 2,  3.  
       The numbering continues in sequence across the rows, ending with 
       34, 35, 36.  There are 2 spaces located at the left side of  the 
       first row of 1, 2, 3.  These 2 spaces contain the symbols O  and 
       OO.

       Along  the front side of the long columns are three  rectangular 
       spaces  marked:  1st. 12, 2nd. 12, and 3rd. 12.  Along the  front 
       side  of  these spaces are 6 rectangular spaces  marked:   1-18, 
       Even, Red, Black, Odd, 19-36.

       At the end of each of the long columns of 12 numbers is a  space 
       marked 2:1 (2 to 1).


                                 WAGER TYPES

       There  are 8 different types of wagers that can be made  on  the 
       Roulette layout.  The following is a chart showing the  possible 
       types of wagers:

                                 Straight Bet
                                  Split Bet
                                  Street Bet
                                  Square Bet
                                   Line Bet
                                  Column Bet
                                  Dozen Bet
                                Even Money Bet






                                    - 2 -








                      WAGERS, BETTING LOCATIONS, & ODDS

       Each of the 8 wager types can be broken down into a total of 154 
       different  locations  where a player may place a  wager  on  the 
       layout.  The following will explain each of the possible wagers, 
       betting location, Casino payoff odds, and betting limits. 

                                 Straight Bet
       
       Betting  on  a single number is known as a  Straight  bet.   The 
       numbers  1  through  36, O and OO make a total  of  38  possible 
       Straight bets.  Your bet must be placed squarely on a number  so 
       as not to be confused with any other type of bet.
