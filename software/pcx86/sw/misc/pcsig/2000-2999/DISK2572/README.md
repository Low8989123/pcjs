Utility programs are a must for today's computer users.                 
                                                                        
Use THE HYPE UTILITIES to search whole disks for a particular file,     
display the free space on a disk, or even add a directory to your path. 
One very nice thing about these small utilities is that if you run the  
program with no parameters, a Help screen will come up explaining the   
format, what the program does, what it's intended for, and gives some   
examples. THE HYPE UTILITIES ARE:                                       
                                                                        
~ ALL2DAY.EXE  Display all of the files created today.                  
                                                                        
~ APATH.COM    Add or remove a directory from your path. It will NOT    
               change your autoexec.bat.                                
                                                                        
~ BEEP.COM     Nothing fancy to this one, it just beeps.                
                                                                        
~ DIRS.EXE     Display all of the subdirectories in current directory,  
               similar to DOS's DIR.                                    
                                                                        
~ FF.EXE       A handy file finder.  Quickly search through a drive     
               volume for that file you can't seem to find.             
                                                                        
~ FREE.COM     Display available disk space, total disk space, and disk 
               space in use on a specified drive.                       
                                                                        
~ MEM.COM      Display the amount of free DOS and EMS memory.           
                                                                        
~ RESTPATH.COM Change to a directory whose name was saved in a file with
               SAVEPATH.COM (Allows batch files to ``remember'' one or  
               more directories.                                        
                                                                        
~ SAVEPATH.COM Save the current directory for later use by RESTPATH.COM.
                                                                        
~ SHOWTIME.COM Display the current time, day, month, date, and year.    
               Its output can be funneled into an ASCII text file for   
               logging purposes.                                        
                                                                        
~ TIMER.EXE    Time program execution. For those who want to know how   
               fast programs run.                                       
                                                                        
~ TODAY.EXE    Display all files created today in a specified directory.
                                                                        
The best thing about THE HYPE UTILITIES is that they are free.  There is
no registration fee required.
