DOUBLECROSS (tm)
----------------

DoubleCross is a strategy game for two players.  The goal is to build a
solid connection between two sides of the playing board.  Each player
tries to connect their sides while blocking their opponent's attempts
to do the same.

This program will work with CGA, EGA, Hercules and VGA graphics modes.
When you run the program, you will be presented with a simple list of
display modes supported.  Simply press the key corresponding to the
mode of your choice and the game will continue loading.  If you do not
know which type you have, try them all until you eliminate those that
your computer cannot support.  Remember that the graphics get better
on the EGA and VGA modes.

To start the program, type DBLCROSS at the DOS prompt.

Advanced Information
--------------------

For CGA displays, DoubleCross uses the high-resolution monochrome mode
to better show the board and pieces.  The VGA support is true 640x480,
16-color support and shows much greater detail than the EGA mode.

Any MS-compatible mouse is supported but you can also use the keyboard
at the same time.  This means that one player can use the mouse and the
other can use the keyboard if you do not like trading the mouse back
and forth after each turn.  We have tried this software with the
following mouse manufacturers: Microsoft, Logitech, and Genius.

If you try to run this program with a mode that your computer cannot
support, you will see a blank screen.  If this happens, don't panic!
The game probably has loaded so you can press the 'Q' key to quit.  If
that doesn't work, you might have to reboot the computer.  All of
this should not happen if you correctly identify your computer's
proper display type.

If you get annoyed at seeing the display menu, you can tell the program
from DOS when you run it by adding the letter for the display mode on
the same command line after the program name:

    DBLCROSS C   - loads in CGA mode
    DBLCROSS H   - loads in Hercules mode
    DBLCROSS E   - loads in EGA mode
    DBLCROSS V   - loads in VGA mode

It's like tic-tac-toe on steroids!  Based on the board game GO-MAKU,    
PENTRIX will test your strategic thinking.  You and an opponent take    
turns placing your games pieces on the board.  Outflank your opponent by
placing five of your pieces in a row and you've won.  The help screens  
explain the rules and make winning sound easy -- but it's not.          
                                                                        
PENTRIX works fine on any system, but has stunning graphics on EGA/VGA. 
Works great with or without a mouse.

An addictive game that's great for get-togethers, BOGGLER is a word game
for any number of players. The game displays a 4x4 square of letters.   
All players try to build the longest and most unique words in three     
minutes time. You can connect any letter to any other adjoining letter  
to form large words (in other words, the path of the word does not have 
to be straight). And the challenges lie in the restriction of being able
to use each letter in the square only once per word.  The only words    
that count as points are words that have three or more letters in them  
and that are unique to everyone else's!

   Boggler is a word game for any number of players.  The game displays
   a 4x4 square of letters.  All players try to build the longest and
   most unique words in three minutes time.  Great for get-togethers -
   very addictive!  Supports CGA, Hercules, EGA and 640x480 VGA graphic
   modes.  Registration is $10

As an alternative to registering individul games, all three games in the
"Dave's Games" set can be registered for only $20.  Both Pentrix and
DoubleCross have a short manual and winning strategy guides that are
sent to registered owners.  Registered owners of Boggler will receive a
copy of "Mega-Boggler" (has an 8x8 letter matrix).
