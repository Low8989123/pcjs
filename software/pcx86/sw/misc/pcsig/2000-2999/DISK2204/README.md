## Information about "LEXICON 1 OF 4 (2205,2206,2485 ALSO)"

    The world's first computer-based public domain Greek and Hebrew LEXICON
    is now available. This program is an add-on to the Online Bible
    (#2191-#2197). The menu-driven program includes Strong's numbers and
    complete Greek and Hebrew Lexicons keyed to Strong's numbers. The
    LEXICON is based on Thayer's Greek Lexicon and the Brown et al. Hebrew
    Aramaic English Lexicon.  You can search for any words, phrases, or
    Strong's numbers and access the definitions, as well as print a passage
    with all the numbers plus the definitions of words used in that passage.
    This saves hours of time during detailed Bible studies.
    
    LEXICON is in text format and may be readily altered using facilities in
    the Online Bible.
