## Information about "GALAXY DISK 2 OF 2 (#765 ALSO)"

    Updated with Microlytics' award-winning 100,000 word spell-checker and
    220,000 word thesaurus, GALAXY's wealth of features make it powerful
    and easy to learn and use.
    
    Logically structured keyboard commands are color-highlighted to help you
    learn shortcuts.  Full mouse support gives you the option of working
    without keyboard commands at all, if you prefer.  An Undo feature lets
    you change your mind after changing your text.  Context-sensitive help
    is always on-line, ready to explain a highlighted command to you.
    
    Features:
    
    ~ Work in up to ten windows on-screen at once.
    
    ~ Size, overlap, zoom any window to full screen in a single keystroke.
    
    ~ Format your text with pre-determined style sheets -- or create your
    own formats.
    
    ~ Edit files as large as eight megabytes using EMS expanded memory or
    hard disk.
    
    ~ Proportional spacing and microjustification.
