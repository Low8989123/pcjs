Not just another pretty face, CHECK-KING combines power and simplicity
in a practical, no-frills product.  Convert your checkbook into a
database, with minimal data entry.  Keep track of all checking
transactions, while easily balancing your checkbook against monthly bank
statements.

Unlike a regular checkbook, CHECK-KING will automatically perform all
calculations and produce a variety of reports for your review.  Define
up to 20 expense categories with up to 20 common payees for your
checks.  As each check is written, CHECK-KING automatically tracks the
next check number.  Simply enter the expense category (if any), the
date, the payee, and the amount.  There is no field to write comments
about each check.  Deposits and cash withdrawals can be entered.
Reports of your checking transactions can be produced by a specifying a
date range, checking amount, checking payee, expense category, or
outstanding transactions.  CHECK-KING always lets you know how much your
balance is (or isn't).

CHECK-KING is for people who want to avoid the hassles of a regular
checkbook, but still need an easy way to balance and reconcile all their
checking transactions.  If you don't need split checking, check printing
and a tie-in to other accounts, this may be the perfect checkbook
program for you.
