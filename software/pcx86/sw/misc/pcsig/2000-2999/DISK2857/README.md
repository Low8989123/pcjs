Disk Title: TesSeract CXL User Interf. Dev. Sys. 3/3                    
PC-SIG Version: S5.52                                                   
                                                                        
Program Title: TesSeract CXL User Interface Development System          
Author Version: 5.52                                                    
Author Registration: $50.00                                             
Special Requirements: A hard disk and C compiler.                       
                                                                        
The TCXL library is a supplement to your C compiler's standard run-time 
library.  It contains over 375 multipurpose functions which provide a   
variety of capabilities.  It is available for several popular C         
compilers including Microsoft C, QuickC, Turbo C/C++, and Zortech C/C++ 
                                                                        
These routines were written in highly-optimized C and assembler code,   
ensuring maximum program speed, minimum program size, easy modification 
and increased portability.                                              
                                                                        
Use customized bar menus to create pop-up, pull-down, and Lotus-style   
menus, as well as any other custom menu that you can define.  Features  
full mouse support, non-selectable items, global hotkeys, and more.     
                                                                        
Multi-field formatted data entry creates data entry forms with one or   
more input fields.  You have full control over user input and can tie   
validation functions into each input field.                             
                                                                        
Context-sensitive Help can index Help files for speed, category, and    
cross-referencing.  Help can be applied at the global, window, menu     
item, and input field levels.                                           
                                                                        
TCXL has scrollable pick menus to select from a list of items.  Full    
mouse support and scroll bars are used in a dedicated file picker.      
                                                                        
Full-featured window control allows as many open windows as memory      
permits.  Windows can be stacked, tiled, shadowed, moved, resized, and  
changed in many ways.  There are more than 75 functions designed to     
handle windowed output.                                                 
                                                                        
User-defined input system provides a consistent interface between the   
hardware-dependent input devices and TCXL's output systems.  Features   
both formatted and unformatted user input, with varying levels of       
output control.                                                         
                                                                        
Nonstandard video sizes EGA 43 and VGA 50-line modes are supported.     
                                                                        
TCXL has a full set of routines for access to Expanded Memory through   
the EMS specification, and for access to Extended Memory through the    
XMS specification.  TCXL also recognizes the presence of advanced       
memory management schemes such as VCPI and DPMI.
