## Information about "EZ-FORMS' DATABASE 2 OF 2"

    EZ-FORMS' DATABASE adds a new dimension to data management and forms
    processing.  It is the perfect marriage of the ever popular "EZ-Forms
    Executive" and "EZ-InFORMa dB"! (Both included.)
    
    Imagine being able to enter information into a database as you fill out
    a form!  Imagine searching for a particular form by typing keystrokes,
    instead of laboriously searching through endless file folders!  Imagine
    being able to generate various printed reports from a single forms'
    data!  Imagine being able to fill in forms by retrieving information
    that already exists in any database!  Imagine no longer...EZ-FORMS'
    DATABASE is here!
    
    Simply read in your form and create a database.  The data you enter will
    automatically be stored into your own database!  And guess what?
    EZ-FORMS' DATABASE reads/writes files in the industry standard ".DBF"
    file format.  So, you can easily use data that has been created by other
    dBase compatible programs.
    
    Whether or not you are currently using a forms processor or database,
    EZ-FORMS' DATABASE is the easiest inFORMation handler ever devised.
