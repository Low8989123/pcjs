## Information about "ALAMANAC"

    ALMANAC is a calendar/scheduler/information utility for Microsoft
    Windows. It provides traditional calendar displays in month and year
    format, as well as a popup desk set for day-to-day notes and schedules.
    Configuration files and overlays allow you to customize calendars for
    your business and personal needs.
    
    An overlay is a set of data which provides ALMANAC with the information
    it needs to calculate the days events will occur on.  The types of
    events ALMANAC will calculate include weekly, monthly, and annual events
    by day or date, as well as birthday, wedding anniversaries, and others.
    Up to ten overlays may be specified in a configuration file, and
    included are three sample files which define holidays for the United
    States, Canada, and Sweden.
    
    In addition to specifying overlay files, ALMANAC auto-load modules allow
    you to configure options for calculating religious holidays (Christian
    and/or Jewish), phases of the moon, and calendar mode
    (Gregorian/Jewish).  A built in database is used to determine your
    location so you can calculate the time and azimuth of the sunrise and
    sunset.

                          Almanac for Windows
                             Version 1.0
                               10/7/90


     Complete documentation for Almanac is included in the file
     ALMANAC.WRI.  This file has been created for use within
     your Windows WRITE application.  It will be copied into
     your Almanac 'master' directory during installation.

     If you are running Windows 3.0 and would like to 'quick'
     start Almanac: (1) place all of the release files onto a
     floppy disk in drive A: (2) select 'Run...' from the
     'File' menu of Program Manager and (3) enter 'A:\ALMSETUP'
     in the edit box.

     Almanac MUST be installed using the provided installation
     utility, ALMSETUP.EXE.  Critical directory information is
     initialized in both your Windows environment and Almanac's
     default auto-load module (ALMANAC.ALM) by ALMSETUP.  Please
     refer to Chapter 2 of the ALMANAC.WRI file for more
     information on running ALMSETUP.

     The original release of this version of Almanac was created
     at Impact Software in a compressed file, ALM100.ZIP.  The
     Almanac files must be extracted from this compressed format
     using a file decompress utility such as PKUNZIP.  The release
     file was compressed using PKZIP version 1.10 and will produce
     authenticity verification messages if 'unzipped' with PKUNZIP
     version 1.10 (or higher), assuring you of an untampered,
     original release direct from Impact Software.

     Software distributors are authorized to duplicate and sell
     media containing this software, PROVIDED THAT ALL FILES
     CONTAINED IN THIS PACKAGE ARE INCLUDED WITHOUT ALTERATION
     and that the price of such sale is determined by and advertised
     as covering ONLY the cost of the software distribution.

     If you feel that you have obtained a copy of this software
     which has been distributed without compliance to the preceding
     paragraph, please contact Impact Software in Chino, California
     at (714) 590-8522.

     Thank you for your support!
