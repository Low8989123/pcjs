Crossword Clipper for Windows
-----------------------------

Crossword Clipper is a Microsoft Windows Clipboard utility, and a
companion application to Crossword Creator and Crossword Publisher. 
It is not an "editor" like Crossword Creator; it is a customizeable
"viewer" and layout tool.

CWCLIP's singular purpose is to place a WYSIWYG image of your puzzle
into the Clipboard, so you can "paste" it into another Windows
application.  Crossword Clipper is not a complex application, and its
operation should be immediately familiar to any Windows user.

System Requirements
-------------------

-  IBM PC or compatible computer, 80286 processor or higher
-  Microsoft Windows 3.0, standard or enhanced mode
-  Crossword Creator 5.0 required for puzzle design


Setup
-----

1.   Copy the VBRUN100.DLL library file from the CROSSWORD CLIPPER
     DISK into your main Windows subdirectory, usually \WIN.  This
     library file must be present before you can run CWCLIP. 

2.   Copy CWCLIP.EXE from the CROSSWORD CLIPPER DISK to a subdirectory
     on your hard disk.  CWCLIP requires Microsoft Windows 3.0
     "standard" mode or "enhanced" mode.  Run it as you would any
     other Windows application.

3.   If you are going to add CWCLIP to one of your Program Manager
     groups, you may want to add Crossword Creator as well.  A Windows
     icon, CWC.ICO, has been provided on the CROSSWORD CLIPPER DISK.


Tips and Hints
--------------

1.   Don't try to run CWCLIP from the distribution floppy disk. If you
     do, Windows may load VBRUN100.DLL from the floppy, too, and
     CWCLIP will run very s--l--o--w--l--y. 

2.   CWCLIP will only read XWP-formatted puzzle files.  You can create
     .XWP files with Crossword Creator's "Export" tool.

3.   To change the size of the puzzle boxes, simply resize CWCLIP's
     window -- the puzzle will be redrawn to fill the new window
     dimensions.  Note, however, that resizing the window does not
     alter the font size you've selected.  It is up to you to select
     an appropriate font for the new box size. 

4.   Avoid resizing the puzzle grid once you've pasted it into another
     application.  Since you are now manipulating a bitmap graphic,
     rather than specific fonts and lines, resizing the image will
     distort its clarity.  Instead, go back to CWCLIP.  Resize the
     grid, clip it again, then re-paste the new image into your target
     application. 

5.   Some Windows applications, Pagemaker, for example, allow you to
     choose the resolution at which graphics are displayed.  Since
     CWCLIP creates relatively high-resolution bitmaps, you may only
     see a "rough" image on the screen if you've selected a
     low-resolution graphics display.  The resolution of the display,
     however, should have no effect on printed output.

This is a companion program to the Crossword Creator program also by PC 
Help-Line.  It's a Windows utility that lets you capture an image of a  
puzzle created in Crossword Creator and paste it in any Windows program 
through the use of the Windows clipboard.  It's a work-around that makes
Crossword Creator Window's compatible.

==========================================================================
1. Personal or corporate checks drawn on a U.S. bank are the preferred
   method of payment.  Purchase Orders are also welcome.

2. PC HELP-LINE cannot accept charge card payments.

3. If you are registering from a country other than the U.S., please
   DO NOT send checks drawn on non-U.S. banks.  Use a cashier's check
   or international money order valued in "U.S. DOLLARS".

   PCHL recognizes that the purchase of an international money order
   or other negotiable instrument may be expensive.  To equalize the
   cost of foreign registration, you may subtract your bank charges
   from the registration fee.  In other words, don't let your total 
   "out-of-pocket" costs exceed what a U.S. registrant would pay.


==========================================================================
                                SHIPPING
==========================================================================
All orders are shipped within 1 week after receipt, via First Class
mail.  Overseas orders are customs-tagged and shipped Air Mail.

If you have a special need or an urgent deadline, please call us to make
arrangements -- we'll be glad to help.  If you're willing to incur the
additional postage, we can ship via next-day courier.
