Wilson WindowWare proudly announces WINCHECK, an easy-to-use and        
attractive Windows 3.0 checkbook balancing program.                     
                                                                        
WINCHECK's purpose is to assist in balancing a personal checking and    
savings account.  It can also print checks on virtually any pre-printed 
check form -- both dot matrix and laser checks are supported.  All data 
entered into the program can be exported into EXCEL compatible files for
more sophisticated analysis and tax-time computations.                  
                                                                        
WINCHECK has an exceptionally attractive and easy-to-use interface.     
Checks and other transactions appear as 3-D dialog boxes with bitmapped 
backgrounds. Standard operations, such as writing a check or making a   
deposit, are performed by clicking on a 3-D iconic toolbox.             
                                                                        
WINCHECK is a shareware product distributed by Wilson WindowWare of     
Seattle. Fully functional evaluation copies are available for download  
from Compuserve, WINAPA forum, Data Library 15.

		WELCOME TO WINCHECK!

 This disk contains WinCheck 2.1A


 This file contains the following information:

        1) Late-Breaking News
        2) The pesky registration reminder screens
	3) A few legal matters
	4) Packing List
	5) Installation Instructions
	6) Online Support Information
	7) Association of Shareware Professionals Ombudsman Statement
	8) The complete licensing agreement
	9) Order Form



	    *** LATE-BREAKING NEWS ***

 This new version of WinCheck, having been through the mill quite a
 few times, finally appears to be at the bug free state we've been
 dreaming of for quite some time.

 For those of you who have been with us since the inception of WinCheck,
 we conquered the embarrassing "What!!?? It can't add bug", the infamous
 "Details file" bug, the "Split Transaction UAE bug", and an incredibly
 long series of ankle-biter bugs.

 If you are new to WinCheck, just be thankful of all the pain and
 anguish your predecessors have endured waiting for WinCheck to become
 the first-rate product it is now.

 Complete disk-based documentation is available in the installation
 directory as WINCHECK.TXT.  It is too large to view with the NotePad
 editor.  You can use Windows Write (be sure to select the Courier Font
 to make the Tabs come out correctly), the file Browser that comes with
 Command Post, WSmooth from PC Magazine, or actually most DOS based
 file viewers.	Just copy the file to your printer to print it.  For
 Example, copy it to LPT1 from File Manager.  Or from the DOS (I know,
 I know) prompt:
    C:\WINCHECK>  COPY WINCHECK.TXT LPT1

 Good Luck



                 REGISTRATION REMINDERS

 Unlicensed copies of WinCheck are 100% fully functional.

 Unlicensed copies of WinCheck have a pesky registration reminder screen
 that pops up whenever you start the program.  Thats it!

 We're not going to beat you about the head and shoulders with our
 reminder screens.  We're sure that once you see the incredible quality
 of our software, you will dig out your credit card, pick up the phone,
 call the nice people at our 800 number and register WinCheck.

 When you pay for the shareware you like, you are voting with your
 pocketbook, and will encourage us to bring you more of the same kinds
 of products.  Pay for what you like, and voila, more of what you like
 will almost magically be developed.

 Besides, I got to feed the cat...


                        LEGAL MATTERS

 Of course the usual disclaimers still apply.  We are not
 responsible for anything at all.  Nothing.  Even if we are
 held responsible, the limit of our liability is the
 licensing fees you paid.  The full text of our license
 agreement is found near the bottom of this file.

                    ON-LINE SUPPORT

 WinCheck has on-line support on a number of computer systems.

 First of all, the home of WinCheck is on Compuserve, in the
 WINAPA forum, in the Wilson WindowWare section (#15 currently).  Also
 the latest and greatest downloads are available from DL15 of the
 WINAPA forum.  The Wilson WindowWare section of the WINAPA forum
 is checked on a daily basis, and all questions will be responded to.

 The FidoNet Windows echomail conference is also monitored for Windows
 questions in general.	Questions about Windows and WinCheck will
 be answered in the echo.

 If your budget is not able to afford Compuserve, we strongly suggest
 that you contact your local BBS sysops and encourage them to carry
 the Windows echomail conferences.

 Registered users may also call our BBS for the latest versions of
 our products. (206) 935-5198   USR HST D/S V.42bis 9600+ 8N1
