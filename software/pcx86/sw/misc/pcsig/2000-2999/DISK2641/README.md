Disk No: 2641                                                           
Disk Title: Back & Forth 1 of 2 (2642 also)                             
PC-SIG Version: S1.71                                                   
                                                                        
Program Title: Back & Forth                                             
Author Version: 1.71                                                    
Author Registration: $69.95                                             
Special Requirements: 100% IBM-compatible PC, hard drive and DOS 3.0+.  
                                                                        
BACK & FORTH is a versatile program management tool that allows you to  
load up to 20 programs at once and instantly switch between them.  Move 
between your word processor, spreadsheets, databases, and utilities at  
will without having to exit, reload, or wait.                           
                                                                        
BACK & FORTH delivers a flexible task management environment for up to  
50 programs.  Each program provides as much memory as needed but        
occupies only 17-23K of memory in your computer.  If the high memory    
loader is used, less than 1K of memory is used.  Accepting the          
definition of 50 programs for selection and use, BACK & FORTH uses      
Expanded Memory (EMS), cleaning up what's left by opening, executing,   
and closing programs within BACK & FORTH.  RAM disks, hard disks, and   
conventional memory can be used to store swapping programs.             
                                                                        
The color environment is easy to use, supporting CGA, Hercules, EGA, VGA
and all video modes by UltraVision.  Customize it, choosing colors that 
suit your own needs.  Supports graphics well and uses a                 
Microsoft-compatible mouse.                                             
                                                                        
Run a selected list of programs automatically when BACK & FORTH is first
loaded.  Word processing capabilities are included.  Select hot keys    
used to pop up BACK & FORTH, the Cut & Paste commands, and all defined  
programs.  Text can be cut from a running program and placed in a       
clipboard for later pasting, can be printed, or written to a separate   
file.                                                                   
                                                                        
BACK & FORTH sets up DOS environments for use in executing programs,    
utilities, and/or DOS commands.  Use your modem to dial a number from   
the screen, and get global support for the following programs: 4DOS,    
PCED/VSTACK, QEMM, 386-to-the Max, etc.
