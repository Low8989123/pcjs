Disk Title: PC Money2                                                   
PC-SIG Version: S1.0                                                      
                                                                        
Program Title: PC MONEY2                                                
Author Version: 2.2

Special Requirements: A graphics card.                                  
                                                                        
Each year it gets a little tougher to keep track of finances.  One      
program figures out loans, the next is needed to plan retirement, and   
yet another is required to track mutual funds -- until PC MONEY2!       
                                                                        
PC MONEY2 will tell you anything about any loan you may be considering. 
Find the monthly payment, the largest loan you can afford, and the years
required to pay off the loan -- even if it has balloon payments.  You   
can even print the loan payoff schedule.                                
                                                                        
For annuities, find out how much money you can put in or how much you   
can take out.  If you have a fixed amount invested and you want to see  
how it will grow, PC MONEY2 will show you.  Have a periodic investment  
plan?  See the value of the plan at maturity, the number of years to    
reach a goal, and more.  PC MONEY2 also keeps track of saving bonds or  
mutual funds and their performance.                                     
                                                                        
Use the set of financial tools included in PC MONEY2 to plan your       
retirement.  Calculate how much money you'll need to invest in order to 
receive a regular income after retirement.  PC MONEY2 is one financial  
tool for all of your investment planning.
