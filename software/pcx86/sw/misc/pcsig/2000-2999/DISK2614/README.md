Author Registration: $20.00                                             
Special Requirements: A printer for RANDO.                              
                                                                        
STATHELP consists of three independent programs: WATSTAT, a clever guide
to which statistical procedures are appropriate for your data; LOOKUP, a
probability calculator for z, t, F, chi-square, and binomial tests; and 
RANDO, a pseudo-random number generator for uniform and normal          
distributions plus exotica-like lottery numbers, random binary , and    
random integers.                                                        
                                                                        
All three programs are menu-driven with context-sensitive help. WATSTAT 
also has extensive documentation and a terrific tutorial which leads you
through the steps toward choosing an appropriate statistic. A great     
package for statistics students and teachers!                           
Program Title: RPNCALC                                                  
Author Version: 1.3A                                                    
Author Registration: $10.00                                             
Special Requirements: None.                                             
                                                                        
RPN, a program which allows your computer to function conveniently as   
a scientific calculator using Reverse Polish Notation, can be used in   
two ways.  As an ordinary `transient' program, it can be invoked from   
the DOS prompt.  It can also be installed as a Terminate and Stay       
Resident (TSR) program, and subsequently invoked from any context by    
pressing the `Hot Key' combination (as a TSR it occupies about 40k of   
memory).  RPNCALC has the following features:                           
                                                                        
~ Scientific notation or fixed decimal display.                         
                                                                        
~ Trigonometric functions and inverses (degrees or radians).            
                                                                        
~ Logarithmic functions and exponentials.                               
                                                                        
~ Additional mathematical and stack functions.                          
                                                                        
~ 6-byte floating point (about 11 digit internal accuracy).             
                                                                        
~ Pi key (3.14159 . . .).                                               
                                                                        
~ TSR can be removed from memory without re-booting.
