Special Requirements: 512K RAM, EGA/VGA, and a hard drive.              
                                                                        
ORION ODYSSEY is a graphical arcade adventure style game which involves 
a space flier (Wally, as he has become to be known) who flies around    
using a jetpack strapped to his back and tries to accumulate as many    
points as possible while destroying alien beings, finding and using     
artifacts, and monitoring his life status, fuel consumption, ammo, etc. 
                                                                        
The Ankh has been stolen by the overlord Bytor.  For it is said that    
whosoever controls the powers of the Ankh controls the universe.  Bytor 
has assigned his supreme wizards to the task of unlocking its magical   
powers.  Your job is to find the Ankh before Bytor and his supreme      
wizards discover its powers.                                            
                                                                        
The fate of the universe lies in your hands....
