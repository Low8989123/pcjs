                              INTRODUCTION TO MACBETH
                              =======================

     'Macbeth' is one of Shakespeare's most powerful tragedies, and its elements
     of ambition, witchcraft and murder make any performance of it memorable.

     The play was written in 1606, three years after King James I ascended to
     the throne of England, and it is significant that the play pays tribute to
     the King in several ways. King James accounted himself an expert on the
     subject of witches, hence a play dealing with the evil influence of black
     magic. The King also traced his ancestry back to two of the play's most
     morally upright characters, Duncan and Banquo. As well, the play subtly
     predicts the continuation of James' family line as monarchs of Great
     Britain.

     As usual, Shakespeare did not create an original story. His characters are
     taken from the history books, and as with others of his plays, he seems to
     have relied this time on the well known history which we know as
     'Holinshed's Chronicles'.

     Although the characters are real historical people, Shakespeare had no
     qualms about rewriting history to suit himself, and there is no doubt that
     he altered events to suit his own purposes and telescoped the events of the
     play into a much shorter time-frame. In fact, one of the noticeable
     qualities of the play is that the events rush forward at a great pace,
     hardly giving the audience a chance to draw breath.

                      INTRODUCTION TO THE PROGRAMME
                      =============================

     The programme consists of a series of activities to assist high school
     students learning Shakespeare's play 'Macbeth'. The student can select the
     activity of his choice from a series of menus.

     Activities include several quizzes or games, notes on a wide variety of
     topics, graphics of the Globe Theatre and even a competition with the
     chance to win worthwhile prizes.

     The games are designed to be fun and at the same time to provide a fairly
     painless way to memorise quotations, learn important speeches, and in
     general, to become familiar with the plot, characters and themes of the
     play.














                                       (p3)









                                SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
                                ===================

     The programme will run on IBM and Compatible computers with 512Kb of memory
     or more. CGA card is required, although it is not necessary to have a
     colour monitor. However, colour is recommended, especially for the games.

     The programme is normally supplied on two 5.25" floppy disks and the
     default set up is for the programme disk to be in Drive A and the data disk
     in Drive B. These defaults may be changed, however, from the SETUP option
     on the Main Menu, and the programme will also run from a single drive (of
     720Kb or more) or from a hard disk.

                                      INSTALLATION
                                      ============

     You are advised to use the DOS DISKCOPY command to back up your disks
     before you use them.

     If you intend to run the programme from the original disks, or from back-
     ups of the originals, no installation is required. If you want to run it
     from a hard disk or from a high capacity disk, just follow the simple steps
     below to install it successfully.

     1. Create a new directory or subdirectory for the programme (if desired)
     using the DOS MKDIR or MD command (See your DOS manual).

     2. Copy all the files from the Programme Disk and the Data Disk to the
     chose directory or sub-directory using the COPY *.* command. You may copy
     the data files to a different directory from the programme files if you
     wish.
     N.B. The Programme Disk (Disk 1) is the one containing the main programme
     file MACBETH.EXE

     3. When you first run the programme, select SETUP from the Main Menu, and
     alter the Drive/Directory setting to the one where you copied the data
     files. You must do this before you attempt any of the activities which load
     data from the disk. (Most of them do!).

     4. Please note that although the files from the data disk may be stored in
     a separate directory, ALL the files from the Programme Disk must be kept
     together in the same directory.














                                      (p4)









                               HOW TO GET STARTED
                               ==================

     A. Two 5.25" Floppy Disks

     Insert the Programme Disk in Drive A and the Data Disk in Drive B. Now turn
     on, or reboot your computer. N.B. You can reboot by pressing the Ctrl key,
     the Alt key and the Del key all at once, or by pressing the Reset Button if
     there is one.
     Alternatively, if your computer is already running and the DOS prompt is on
     the screen, insert the disks as above. Now change to Drive A if necessary
     by typing A: <<Enter>>
     To run the programme, type AUTOEXEC <<Enter>>

     B. One 3.5" disk

     Insert the disk in your drive and turn on, or reboot your computer.
     Alternatively, if your computer is already running and the DOS prompt is on
     the screen, make sure you are using the correct drive (Usually Drive A:),
     and then type AUTOEXEC <<Enter>>

     C. Hard Disk

     Make sure you have followed the instructions in the previous section to
     make a directory and copy the files to it. Now change to that directory.
     (e.g. If your Hard Disk is Drive C and you created a new directory called
     LITDISK, then type CD C:\LITDISK) <<Enter>>)
     Now type AUTOEXEC <<Enter>>

                                    USING THE MENUS
                                    ===============

     You find your way around the different parts of the programme by using a
     very simple system of menus.
     The choices offered at each level are shown on the screen, with the first
     one high-lighted. Use the arrow keys to move the high-light to the
     selection you want. Then press the <<Enter>> key to go to that selection.
     If your computer has a numeric key-pad, you may use those arrow keys as
     well, but remember to turn off the Num Lock function.

     To Find A Menu

     If a menu is not currently showing on the screen, you can almost always get
     to one by pressing the <<Esc>> key. This will halt the current activity,
     and display the active menu.











                                       (P5)









                                   THE MAIN MENU
                                   =============

                                     ============

     The programme has been designed to be as user-friendly as possible. Most of
     the activities have on-screen help. Where more detailed instructions are
     necessary, this option has been included in the menu for that particular
     activity.
     Activities which include their own instructions are:
     Quotation Quiz (Games Menu)
     Missing Words (Games Menu)

                                      (p7)









                                  THE COMPETITION
                                  ===============

     One of the unique features of this programme is the on-disk competition. To
     take part in the competition, you must first solve a code. To see the coded
     message, select COMPETITION from the Main Menu.

     Once you have cracked the code, you will be able to confirm your success
     with part one of the competition, and this confirmation will be written to
     onto the disk. This will gain you access to the next level of the
     competition, a treasure hunt in the Globe Theatre.

     Once the treasure is discovered, you will be able to answer a series of
     questions which make up Part Three of the competition.

     Write your solution to the coded message on the Entry Form (Included as
     part of the registration form on page 10 of this manual), and also write
     the answers to the five Buried Treasure questions. Please note that you
     must be a registered user of the programme to be eligible to enter the
     competition.

     First prize is cash to the value of approximately US$50 plus computer
     products. Second prize US$15 plus computer products. Twenty consolation
     prizes of computer products. The value of the prizes may vary slightly from
     year to year, but should increase rather than decrease (assuming enough of
     you lovely people out there in Computer-land buy my programmes).

     The competition is an annual one closing at the end of November each year,
     and with the winning entries drawn at the beginning of December. All prize-
     winners will be notified by post, and all entrants in the competition will
     receive a list of results.

                                 ABOUT THE PROGRAMME
                                 ===================

     This programme began its life as a set of quizzes I programmed for my own
     Literature students at a High School here in Singapore. Over the last two
     years, the programme has grown and developed and gone through a variety of
     versions, to become what it is today. It has been quite well-received by
     students here who face a compulsory Shakespeare component in their
     Cambridge GCE O Level examinations.

     Originally, as the new owner of an Apple II clone, I programmed in
     Applesoft Basic. The programme fitted easily onto one 5.25" floppy disk,
     and consisted mainly of three games and the segment on the Globe Theatre. I
     believed then as I believe now, that people do not really want to sit and
     read pages of notes from a computer monitor.

     However, feedback from users indicated a desire for more notes, so the
     programme quickly grew. It also changed direction to become IBM-compatible
     to run on the computer of choice of 80% of the student population here in
     Singapore. So I put my prejudices aside and picked up a smattering of
     GWBasic.

     As the programme grew and became more sophisticated, I felt the need for
     something a little more powerful and faster than interpreted Basic, so
     Microsoft QuickBasic made its appearance. I still see room for improvements
     and additions to the programme, and each new version on each different text
     is a little more sophisticated than its predecessor. Who knows what the
     future will bring.

     Currently, available titles are:

     MACBETH

     ROMEO AND JULIET

     ANIMAL FARM by George Orwell

     LORD OF THE FLIES by William Golding

     and next on my hit-list

     TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD by Harper Lee
