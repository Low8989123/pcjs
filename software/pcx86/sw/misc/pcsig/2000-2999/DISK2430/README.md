## Information about "CIVIL WAR BATTLE SET"

    Remember when you played "war" with your friends?  CIVIL WAR BATTLE SET
    can help you relive those days, in the comfort of your home or office!
    
    CIVILWAR is a one-player re-creation of various battles from the
    American Civil War. Choose either side and command infantry, cavalry,
    artillery, and general units. Battles are affected by unit type,
    terrain, leadership, morale, attack type, and other factors. You may
    modify the game difficulty and the aggressiveness of the enemy, as well
    as visibility and artillery range. "Spy" on enemy troops, override
    orders of subordinate commanders, and control intensity of encounters.
    You can create or modify battle scenarios, including battle map, army
    type, strength, and other factors. Name units according to historical
    battles or choose your own names. And, if you get interrupted during an
    intense battle, save it and come back to it during your coffee break!
