Program Title: DAYO GUI POS                                             
Author Version: 4.20G                                                   
Author Registration: $125.00                                            
Special Requirements: 640K RAM, VGA, hard drive, and DOS 3.3+. Mouse is 
                                                                        
DAYO GUI POS (Point of Sale) is a full-featured billing and invoicing   
application for any size business that produces invoices for each sale  
and needs an easy way to keep track of them.  Its graphic user interface
minimizes the amount of typing needed to enter sales.  This can save    
time, and users with little experience can more effectively use a       
computerized system.                                                    
                                                                        
DAYO keeps a database of your customers, an inventory of your products  
and their prices, and a blank invoice.  Sales are quickly recorded by   
selecting the customer name from the database, and selecting the        
purchased items from another list.  All this information is placed in   
the blank invoice on the screen, and the totals are calculated          
automatically.                                                          
                                                                        
This program is suitable for creating invoices, but can also be         
integrated with DAYO's inventory and accounts receivables programs to   
include those functions.  A cash drawer can be opened if the program is 
connected to a serial or parallel port.                                 
                                                                        
DAYO GUI POS is by default a multiuser system, allowing almost unlimited
numbers of users to have the ability to simultaneously invoice using    
this one program on a PC-based LAN/Network. It can, however, be run     
(like all DAYO products) as a 'standalone' application. Hundreds of     
features abound, with more added almost daily.
