Disk No: 2767
Disk Title: Moraff's Stones
PC-SIG Version: S1

Program Title: Moraff's Stones
Author Version: 1.0
Author Registration: Varies
Special Requirements: 512K RAM, and a graphics card.

What do they do in the taverns on Moraff's World?  What a silly
question!  Play the strategy gambling/barter game called STONES, of
course.

Here you are in a tavern on Moraff's World, the only human in the
place.  Don't worry, discrimination is against the law in this
province.  You're sure that the guys (guys? aliens, ETs, BEMs,
whatever...) beckoning you to play STONES with them are nice enough
creatures who just need a fourth player.  You buy into the game and take
a seat at the STONES table.

After a while, you aren't doing badly.  In fact, you've just wiped out
one opponent who leaves the game.  Who's this taking her place?  You
gradually realize that each time one player gets wiped out, it gets
replaced by somebody smarter and nastier.

This excellent game from Moraff supports all graphic cards from Hercules
to 1024 X 768, 256-colors in super VGA resolution.
