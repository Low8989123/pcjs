## Information about "PC-PAYROLL W-4 MODULE"

    Compute the exact withholdings of Federal, FICA and State Taxes for up
    to 30 different employees. The tax tables are valid for 1989 taxes in
    all 50 U.S. states.
    
    PC-PAYROLL W-4 asks questions related to the IRS Form W-4 and
    automatically computes withholdings for each employee. It can also
    compute all taxes for the year 1989. It greatly reduces the amount of
    time normally spent on tax calculations, and prints individual W-4
    worksheets.
    
    Note that this program needs to be updated yearly.

             A W-4 in 8 Easy Screens

These instructions work best with the PC-PAYROLL
W-4 Module "up" and ready to go.  Making a W-4 is
the easiest way to learn this program.

On a FEW machines, an F-Key may give no response.
In those cases the equivalent numeric key works
(1 = F-1, etc.).

TO BEGIN:  At A> type W-4 for the Main Menu.

SCREEN 1) - Main Menu:  Type "F1" (or "1").

SCREEN 2) - Employee Selection Menu:

    * Access an existing record by typing its
      assigned number.
    * Create a new record by typing in an
      "unused" number.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< NOTE >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
   The remaining screens were designed as an
   interview. When all queries answered, the
   result will be a completed W-4 Certificate.
   IF UNNEEDED, SCREENS 6 & 7 WILL NOT APPEAR.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

SCREEN 3) - Enter (or Update) a Record:

    * Name, Address, SSN.  (F1 thru F6 initiate
      the various input prompts: .....  Type in
      data; press ENTER.)
    * All records may be scrolled by menu
      options A, P, or N.
    * Type menu option C when ready for SCREEN 4.




SCREEN 4) - Filing Status/Second Job Worksheet:

    * 5 SETS of queries (F1-F5) make up this
      section.
    * Toggle through choices on each F-Key to
      select appropriate status statements.  The
      number of choices per F-Key varies (2-7).
      Make sure to toggle through all choices per
      F-Key before selection.

SCREEN 5) - Personal Allowances Worksheet:

    * 6 queries (F1-F6) make up this section.
    * All queries toggle (0/1) except F4.
    * F4 initiates input prompt (...).  Type in
       numerical data; press ENTER.

SCREEN 6) - Deductions and Adjustments Worksheet:

    * 3 queries (F1-F3 plus HELP (F10).
    * USE ONLY IN TWO CASE OUTLINED ON SCREEN.

SCREEN 7) - Two-Earner/Two-Job Worksheet:

    * 2 queries (F1, F2) IF APPLICABLE.
    * If not applicable, press "C" to continue.

SCREEN 8) - The completed W-4 Certificate

    * Select "payroll frequency" (F1 toggles
      5 choices).
    * F2; type in "period wages/salary"; press
      ENTER.
    * F3 prints substitute W-4 Certificate.

The W-4 Certificate is now complete.  30 such W-4
Certificates may be stored within this W-4 module
of PC-PAYROLL.




                Other Good Stuff

From the Main Menu of this W-4 Module:

  * F-2 activates a one-screen tax estimator.
    This program contains the 1990 Federal (income
    and FICA) and State withholding formulas for
    all 50 states!  This will enable you to
    estimate withholding tax by pay period AND
    annually.  This info can be used to avoid
    penalties for under withholding and for
    general planning purposes.

  * F-3 summons a 3-screen help file that should
    be read even though you're now an ace
    W-4ologist. It contains info about prompts,
    command lines, facsimile W-4 forms (not IRS
    approved), and other such helpful stuff.

  * F-4 summons a 3-screen library of info about
    W-4s and the process of employer withholding.

  * F-5 summons info about this W-4 module.

  * F-6 is about the real good stuff, PC-PAYROLL,
    the parent program of this W-4 Module.
