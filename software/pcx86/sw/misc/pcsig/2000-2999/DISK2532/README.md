PC-SIG Version: S1.2                                                    
                                                                        
Program Title: Besttest

BESTTEST takes the drudgery out of preparing tests so teachers can have 
more time to teach.  Excellent documentation and a complete tutorial    
make this powerful program easy to use.  Features are accessed through  
function keys, which follow a WordPerfect layout, or through menus.     
                                                                        
Questions are easily created with templates and can have various        
formats, including multiple choice, true/false, fill-in, matching or    
essay.  By assigning reference fields to each question, the questions   
can be sorted or filtered to create tests with a set number of          
questions, one format only, difficulty level, etc.  The order of        
questions and answer choices can automatically shuffled at each         
printing.                                                               
                                                                        
Questions can be stored in files on disk for future editing and         
printing.  Other features include user-defined screen colors and macros.
Dot matrix, daisy wheel and laser printers are supported, with a user-  
defined printer option.                                                 
                                                                        
BESTTEST is the upgrade to both TESTMAKR and EXAMBANK.  Importing of    
files from those programs into BESTTEST is possible.  BESTTEST even     
includes hints for writing good questions.  If you teach the same       
material over and over and hate making up tests, this program is a      
lifesaver!
