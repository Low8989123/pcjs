## Information about "MACBETH 2 OF 2 (2200 ALSO)"

    Studying Shakespeare can be tedious. Do you really understand
    the language? The plot?  The characters?  This program can help you get
    through the play MacBeth, and have fun too.
    
    MACBETH is an easy-to-use program designed as an aid for high school
    literature students.  Using a simple menu system, students are taught
    about the play via quizzes, games, graphics, riddles, and notes on a
    wide variety of topics.
    
    The games are designed to be fun and at the same time provide a
    painless way to memorize quotations, learn important speeches, and, in
    general, to become familiar with the plot, characters, and themes of
    the play.  Definitely a worthwhile investment for those seeking to get
    the most from the play MacBeth.
