    This letter gives the shareware vendor to whom it's addressed
    the right to distribute the game T-Zero through their normal
    distribution channel.  T-Zero is a text adventure that runs
    on IBM PC-type computers under the MS-DOS operating system.
    It normally requires 384k of memory but may be run in 256k.
    It may be run from a hard disk or floppy configurations and
    may be run on a monochrome or color monitor.

    The following description is being given when uploading the
    game to BBS' and Information Services:

    TEXT ADVENTURE TIME TRAVEL FANTASY SCIENCE FICTION SHAREWARE
        This game is dedicated to all gamers saddened by the
        premature death toll sounded for text adventures.  It
        is a text adventure in the grand style, mixing elements
        of fantasy and science fiction while exploring the nature
        of time.  Scenes take place in a rustic but disturbing
        present, a bustling prehistoric era, and a damaged,
        bureaucratic future.  Your task is to locate six round
        objects scattered across eras and landscapes, transport
        them to progressively future time-zones, and manipulate
        them in a fashion that will right the troubled times.
        ADVANCED level shareware--hint file upon registration.
        IBM:  MS DOS--runs in 256 or 384k, from floppy or hard disk,
        on color or monochrome monitor.  Author an ASP member.

    The following limitation on re-distribution is included in the
    player manual of the game:

        Anyone distributing T-Zero for any kind of remuneration
        must first contact the author at the address below for
        authorization.  This authorization will be automatically
        granted to distributors recognized by the (ASP) as adhering
        to its guidelines for shareware distributors, and such
        distributors may begin offering T-Zero immediately (However
        the author must still be advised so that the distributor can
        be kept up-to-date with the latest version of T-Zero.).

    Registration by users for a fee of $15.00 entitles them to the
    following (also from player manual):

        Registered users will receive a disk containing the most
        recent version of T-Zero complete with a hint file not
        available to unregistered users.  The hint facility is
        keyed to user location and what the player has solved
        or accomplished so far.  The hint file may not be distributed
        to unregistered users.

    V1.02 fixes bugs to the WHERE, FIND, and IMAGINE commands as
    well as patching up a "hole" that allowed the game to be
    completed without the full battery of points.
