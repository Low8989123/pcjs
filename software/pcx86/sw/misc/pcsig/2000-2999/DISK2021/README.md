## Information about "ACTIVE LIFE MS-DOS DISK 1 OF 2 (2022)"

    Think a computer is too much hassle to replace your DayTimer?  Or maybe
    your current appointment calendar doesn't have the strength you need?
    ACTIVE LIFE is an extremely powerful system for planning, managing, and
    tracking one's active business and personal life that takes advantage of
    your mouse (though a mouse is not required).
    
    The flexible schedules manage workflow effectively and all types of
    recurring activities need be entered just once.  Plus, the ACTIVE LIFE
    Notebook provides an indexed text/graphics database manager featuring
    telephone auto-dial. ACTIVE LIFE also includes pop-up calendars, alarms,
    and week-at-a-glance.  Printed schedules provide reference and notation.
    
    This DOS version uses a look-alike windows format.  While you can use
    ACTIVE LIFE with only a keyboard, a mouse is highly recommended.

                        How to Install Active Life 1.2
                        ------------------------------
The installation process allows you to select which directory you would like
to contain Active Life files. The directory you name will be created if it
doesn't already exist, and the files will be copied from the diskette(s) to
this target directory. Some files are in compressed form on the diskette(s)
and will be automatically uncompressed as they are installed.

Step 1: Insert the Active Life diskette into drive A: and type A:

Step 2: Type one of the following, depending on the version you're installing:

        ALWIN       (Active Life for Windows)
        ALDOS       (Active Life for DOS)
        ALPM        (Active Life for OS/2 Presentation Manager)

Step 3: Turn to the Active Life User's Guide for further information.
        If you have a packaged copy of Active Life 1.2, the manual will be
        in the box. Evaluation disks contain an abridged user's guide in a
        file called AL.DOC. Use the DOS Print command to print this file:

        C> Print AL.DOC
```
