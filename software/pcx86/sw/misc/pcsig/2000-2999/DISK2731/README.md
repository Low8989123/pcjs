Disk No: 2731
Disk Title: HyperPAD #1 (2731-2735 also)
PC-SIG Version: S1

Program Title: HyperPAD
Author Version: 2.2
Author Registration: $99.00
Special Requirements: 390K RAM, and a hard drive.

HYPERPAD is an object-oriented application development tool to make you
more productive with your PC.  More than two dozen personal applications
are offered, each designed to help you manage information and data
easily.

You can easily personalize these applications, even if you are not a
programmer.  If you're a non-programmer, HYPERPAD's powerful tools give
you the ability to do things with the PC that you never thought you
could do.  If you're a programmer, HYPERPAD is a rich environment that
gives you a huge head start towards your finished product.

When you set up HYPERPAD, you create buttons on your ``home'' pad that
link you to your MS-DOS software.  After setting up your home pad to
launch applications, you'll never have to look at the DOS prompt again.
Push a button and HYPERPAD shrinks to 4K and launches DOS programs such
as Lotus 1-2-3 and WordPerfect or Windows software such as Microsoft
Excel, PageMaker or Corel Draw.

Launch applications, manage information, and plan work in an intuitive,
easily personalized desktop environment without the expensive upgrades
required to migrate to Microsoft Windows, OS/2 PM or other graphical
environments.  HYPERPAD protects your investment in DOS software by
modernizing your DOS environment.  Get all of the benefits of graphical
systems without the headaches and costs.

HYPERPAD features information-filled fields and buttons that can be used
again and again.  Create a button that launches your word processor, and
then copy/paste it to any HYPERPAD application you build.  There are
many different flavors of buttons and fields from which to choose, plus
pop-up menus, dialog boxes, modifiable system menus, and more...

Powerful and easy-to-use character-based painting and drawing tools are
built-in to create colorful pads that will keep the interest and win the
respect of your audience.

Link information by association to create powerful ``hypertext''
systems.  Create interactive tutorials and computer-based training (CBT)
systems.  Build flat file databases or front ends to corporate database
systems.  The more you use HYPERPAD, the more new applications you'll
discover.
