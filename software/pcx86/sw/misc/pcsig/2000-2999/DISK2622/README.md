This is the new generation of DOS menu systems. Whether you're a user   
who wants to access a few programs quickly and easily (with a touch of a
key or two) or a user who needs to turn on all the bells and whistles,  
LOGIMENU should satisfy you. Extensive on-line help, EGA/VGA 43/50 line 
mode supported, mouse support, with passwords, screen saver, hidden hot 
keys, customizable help.  All this, plus an attractive presentation.    
                                                                        
LOGIMENU can also remind you of important dates with its Event Tracking 
feature.  Furthermore, LOGIMENU does not use a single byte of memory    
while your own programs run.  The automatic installation process scans  
your hard drive for popular programs.  And one of its three levels of   
installation will suit your needs perfectly.

PROGRAM TITLE:
     LOGIMENU

PROGRAM VERSION:
     1.51

DESCRIPTION:
     This is a new generation of DOS menu system. From the user
     who only needs to access programs quickly and easily (with a
     touch of a key or two), to the user who needs to turn on all
     the bells and whistles. LOGIMENU satisfies them all.
     Extensive on-line help, EGA/VGA 43/50 line mode supported,
     mouse support, password security, screen saver, hidden hot
     keys, customizable help. All this in an attractive
     presentation.

     LOGIMENU can also remind you of important dates with its
     Event Tracking. Brief, LOGIMENU can make your life much
     easier. Furthermore, LOGIMENU does not use a single byte of
     memory while your own programs run. Also included is
     reporting system that allows you to generate various
     interesting reports. Its automatic installation process
     scans your hard drive for popular programs. One of its three
     level of installation will suit your needs perfectly.

     Up to 50 items per menu, 50 sub-menus (multiple levels), 80
     commands per item and 30 general hidden hot keys. LOGIMENU
     has enough room to satisfy the most demanding user.

WHO IS THE INTENDED USER?
     Every hard disk users.

UNIQUE FEATURES OF THE PROGRAM:
     * Support 43/50 line mode for EGA/VGA monitors. The menu
       and the DOS applications can be set in different modes.
       The mode set in DOS does not affect the mode in which
       LOGIMENU is set (unless DEFAULT mode is ON).
     * Automatic installation. Easy enough for the beginner,
       powerful enough for the most demanding.
     * Event scheduler. There is no better place to put an event
       scheduler than in a menu system.
     * Hidden hot keys. Special keys (like function keys, or Alt
       keys) can be set to work on any menus and sub-menus. For
       frequently used functions, this is extremely helpful.
     * Three levels of help. One of them is customizable.
     * Truly mouse driven. The mouse interface is not a
       keystroke simulator. It is really a completed mouse
       interface with hot zones and mouse cursor.

PROGRAM'S CAPACITY OR LIMITATIONS:
     * 50 menus
     * 50 Items per menu (34 Items in 25 line mode)
     * 80 commands per Item
     * 79 characters per commands
     * 30 General Hidden Hot Keys
     * 32 K for overall data file size (my setup is huge and my
            file is only 10K)
     * 4  Simultaneously job counter
     * NO LIMIT on number of Events
     * NO LIMIT on number of sub-menu level (50 menus limit will
            come first)

REQUIREMENTS:
     DOS 3.0 or higher, 384 K of memory, IBM compatible.
