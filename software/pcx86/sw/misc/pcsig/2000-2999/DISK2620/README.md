Author Version: 2.0                                                     
Author Registration: $25.00                                             
Special Requirements: 640K RAM, hard drive, and DOS 3.3.                
                                                                        
DAYO is a collection of multiuser business applications that provide a  
means of managing inventory, purchasing, invoicing, customers, vendors, 
sales and more... All DAYO products are multiuser, designed to work on a
Microcomputer (PC) Based Local Area Network (LAN), like Novell (tm).    
They can, however, work as a 'standalone', running on a single PC.      
                                                                        
DAYO SMART REPORTS contains many reports and routines that will help you
to manage your purchasing, inventory, invoices, back orders, sales, and 
databases. There are 22 reports/lists/routines included in smart        
reports; i.e., Single warehouse, inventory zero price, valuation        
expanded, inventory zero retail, reorder (2 weeks), reorder (4 weeks),  
reorder (8 weeks), negative onhand, stock level shortage, vendor list,  
stock level over, customer list, inventory ascii text, inventory item   
list, late po, checking account list, po - due in this week, check      
format list, inventory zero cost, and an expenses list.                 
                                                                        
To date, large and complex mulituser business applications required Mini
and Mainframe computers, but because of products like the PC based LAN/ 
Network, they can now be run on microcomputers. DAYO is one of the first
microcomputer based business applications designed to handle such a     
system.                                                                 
                                                                        
DAYO Business Applications grow with your company. The ability to       
upgrade your system is available with the addition of other DAYO        
products. Source to DAYO is also available, allowing you to make further
modifications and enhancements. DAYO Clock was written with Qbasic (tm);
all others were written with Clipper (tm).

DAYO databases are all dBASE (tm) compatible, thus providing an         
additional or alternative source of support and reporting.

║  This DAYO module comes in a self-extracting compressed format.         ║
║  You will require a hard drive or high density drive, 640K RAM, and     ║
║  DOS 3.3 in order to install the program to your computer.              ║
║  Please NOTE your CONFIG.SYS file must exist on your boot disk/drive,   ║
║  and it must have (as a minimum), BUFFERS=30, and FILES=55.             ║
║  Run a DAYO program to create this file should you not have one, or     ║
║  do not know how to create/edit it.                                     ║
║                                                                         ║
║  If you are installing the entire DAYO system, then we recommend        ║
║  that you use the DAYO SETUP disk. It will create the necessary         ║
║  directories and copy the files. After running SETUP, run MENU.BAT      ║
║  from the \DAYO directory. Enter/select each of the modules from the    ║
║  menu, and if the module is present the program will handle the         ║
║  creation of all databases, index and configuration files.              ║
║                                                                         ║
║  For manual installation, create a subdirectory called DAYORPT, and     ║
║  copy all the files from the distrubution disks, then switch to the     ║
║  that subdirectory and type; DAYORD then DAYORE. Once this is done      ║
║  type DAYOR to start, or COPY DAYORPT.DOC to print the documentation    ║
║                                                                         ║
