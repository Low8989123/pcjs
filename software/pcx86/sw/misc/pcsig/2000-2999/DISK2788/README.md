Teachers, Parents, Trainers -- TUTORIALWRITER is an educator's toolkit  
for computer-based training.                                            
                                                                        
The computer is the ideal tool for the classroom, but in order to use it
to the fullest, you have to learn how to program.  Many people have     
knowledge to share but do not want to learn computer programming in     
order to do so.  TUTORIALWRITER has closed this gap.  Anyone who can use
a word processor can create full color computer tutorials with          
Hypertext, pop-up windows, menus, online Help, tests, quizzes, branching
on answers, graphics, mouse support, and more.                          
                                                                        
Harness the computer's power.  Decide what you want to present, type it 
into a standard (ASCII) file with a word processor and then enter       
TUTORIALWRITER's codes where you want them.  Put a title in a fancy box 
at the top of the screen.  Put CONTINUE and QUIT boxes at the bottom of 
the screen.  It is that simple.  There are more than forty codes that   
give the author tremendous control of the computer.  Give the           
ready-to-run tutorial disk to the people it was written for.
