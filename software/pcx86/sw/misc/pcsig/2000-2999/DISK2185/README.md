## Information about "NINE MEN MORRIS"

    Try a game that has its origins in ancient history!  Layouts have been
    found in manuscripts and tombs, including one cut into roofing slabs in
    Germany (Muhle).  Similar to the game Noughts and Crosses or Tic Tac
    Toe, it was most popular in the 14th Century, acquiring the name Morris
    in England. This was possibly due to the board resembling patterns made
    by Morris dancers.
    
    Play takes place on the 24 intersecting points on the board.  Each
    player attempts to arrange three of his pieces in a line on the board.
    Such a line is called a Mill.  This entitles a player to remove any one
    of his opponent's pieces from the board, including any that are
    themselves forming a mill.  A player who can reduce his opponent to two
    pieces or block him from making a legitimate move wins the game.
    
    This strategic two-player game (the computer won't be an opponent) will
    make for a challenging and fun evening!

Nine Men's Morris is a game with its origins in ancient history.        
Layouts have been found in manuscripts and tombs including one cut into 
roofing slabs at Kurna, dated 1400 BC.  This game is now called the Mill
in the United States and Germany (Muhle) and is also known as Morelles  
or Merels.  Similar to the game Noughts and Crosses or Tic Tac Toe, it  
was most popular in the 14th Century, acquiring the name Morris in      
England.  This was possibly due to the board resembling patterns made by
Morris dancers.
