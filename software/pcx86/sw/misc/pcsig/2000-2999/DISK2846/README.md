This educational text adventure game was designed as a way to encourage 
children, ages 10 to 14, to learn about history in a way that they could
also have fun. Using the combined package of the fascination of the     
computer, the tried and true method of repetition, and age old history, 
the stories of Columbus and Marco Polo are learned by allowing the      
reader to make choices that determine the fate of the explorer.         
Registration of SELECT-A-STORY: GREAT EXPLORERS COLLECTION brings the   
stories of three more historical figures to the fingertips of your      
child. These include Robert E. Peary, Capt. James Cook, and Sir Francis 
Drake.
