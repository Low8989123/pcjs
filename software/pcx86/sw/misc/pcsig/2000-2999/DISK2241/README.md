## Information about "PC-TRACK"

    Here's a general-purpose satellite tracking package to take the
    complexity and confusion out of locating an earth orbiting satellite in
    space.  It can also provide the antenna-pointing data necessary to
    transmit or receive signals.
    
    PC-TRACK is intended for anyone who wants to monitor the positions of
    satellites -- from amateur radio operators to professional weather
    satellite users.  The program includes orbital data for a number of
    amateur radio and weather satellites, and position data for a number of
    observation points around the earth.  Others can be added easily.

PC-TRACK is a general purpose satellite tracking package designed to    
take the complexity and confusion out of finding where an earth orbiting
satellite is in space and providing the antenna pointing data necessary 
to transmit signals to or receive signals from them.                    
                                                                        
This package is intended for anyone with a desire to keep track of the  
positions of satellites. This includes Amateur Radio operators tracking 
amateur radio satellites, amateur or professional weather satellite     
users tracking weather satellites, or any other similar application. The
package includes orbital data for a number of amateur radio and weather 
satellites, and includes position data for a number of observation      
points around the earth. Others are can easily added by the user.
