Disk Title: Skyland' Star
PC-SIG Version: S1.0

Program Title: Skyland's Star
Author Version: 3.2
Author Registration: $15.00
Special Requirements: 640K RAM. A hard drive recommended.

Skyland's Star is a science fictional text adventure game which draws
its inspiration from classic prose adventures. The storyline is a
follows: the Earth is in desperate peril. The rapid growth in
population and need for energy has all but depleted the world's fossil
fuels.  Science has been unable to replace them with a safe and reliable
alternative.  The player, a member of a small group of scientists, is
recruited to travel into the future to witness how the problem was
solved - in the past.  The bulk of the game takes place here, in a major
metropolis of the future.  The player must discover how the future
solved the problem and retrieve the necessary information and items for
the present to survive the crisis, so that the future he witnessed can
exist.

The game is intended for anyone who wants a challenging, intelligent
diversion from reality.  The program would be particularly welcomed by
people who long for classic text adventures in these days of graphic
intensive programs.

There are several aspects of this game which make it superior to even
some of the best known professional text adventures.  First, Skyland's
Star has an excellent vocabulary, recognizing nearly 1500 words, and a
parser which can comprehend commands ranging from a single letter to
complex English sentences.  It contains a save and restore feature
which can save up to 26 games to a single directory.  Another feature of
the game is its sheer size.  There are nearly 150 separate locations for
the player to explore, including the City of Skyland itself, the Moon, a
lake, an underground sewer system, and the three story government
complex. The game was the Grand Prize winner at the 1989 Rockwell
International/LAUSD Computer Science Competition.
