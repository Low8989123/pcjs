Francis X. "Butch" Mahoney, Jr.302 Lessard St.Donaldsonville, La. 70346(504) 473-9378The fee for this typeface is $15 as is, check or money order(preferred).Or send $20 and a disk and a list of the sizes of the bitmaps you would like to have and I will try to oblige (within reason...like, don't ask for 127 point,etc...).Hello Font Lover,Previously, I had become much discouraged by distributing my work on CompuServe.  A couple of bad experiences made it difficult for me tocontinue.  However, recently I have received some recognition, and it has made me rethink my position.The economy is bad in Louisiana and I am not doing well.  You may have noticed the address change.  I cannot afford the time on CompuServe except for uploading.  Also, my troubles are your gain for neither can I afford to do any other kind of marketing for my work other than ShareWare (they would cost at least twice as much or more).  And just having me "sit on these faces" (pun intended) is not doing any good for myself or anyone else.  My first uploads to CompuServe were rather primitive attempts.  I think now you will find that I am capable of good - excellent quality alter-natives to the "higher priced spreads".I will assume you know what to do with this typeface.   (use Font/DA Mover 3.2 or higher, don't let Font/DA Mover change the    font id, etc...)            .........if you don't know how to work these, call!!! (not collect)            .........if you can't call, write (like I said, I can't afford CIS)There is only one size bitmap with this typeface (I'm trying to keep my long distance and your download charges to a minimum).  And there is a good chancethat it is not very clean (I was in a hurry...Christmas is coming).  It will however, automatically download to any PostScript Device i.e. LaserWriter, Linotronic, or any of the new PostScript printers that are accessed by AppleTalk.  (Versions of this typeface can be prepared for manual downloading as a text only file for non-Macintosh computers if the need should arise.)If you should happen to investigate any of the other typefaces I've uploadedyou will probably discover that this is a form letter tacked on to every one of them.  You can skip reading the others, however, the ShareWare fee remains.                          PLEASE PAY ME...	                                                          Thank you.

January 1989A few years back, I created a bitmapped font using FONTASTIC, originally called Philo, and after some alterations, Fancy Chancery. It was unique mainly for its removal of dots where  smooth curves would not be permitted, thus giving an overall appearance of gray. The font actually prints quite cleanly (particularly at 12 point) on the Imagewriter and was only a 24 pt. bitmap initially. I am pleased to learn that the font has shown up in numerous places with several different names and variations, from Fluent Fonts of CasadyWare (Casady Greene) (with my permission) to bulletin boards here and there. Most recently I received from Doug Miles in Washington state a newly done bitmap in a heavier weight plus a postscript font executed by Marion Delahan in Oklahoma based upon the same font. Coincidentally, I recently started redrawing the original Fancy Chancery on Fontographer for Laserwriter. When I received the Delahan version I decided on a complete redrawing and renaming of the postscript font. The result is MacHumaine. There have been inquiries as to how I intend to distribute MacHumaine. I wish it to remain in the public domain to be used by anyone who wants to take the time to copy it. Additionally, the package contains the original Fontographer workfile as well as the AFM file so anyone who wishes to alter or improve it, may do so if they have Fontographer. The bitmaps are absolutely pure FONTOGRAPHER generated with no tweaking. For my own purposes this is satisfactory, however if you would like to see them cleaner, have at it with Fontastic. I would not be extremely happy to learn that MacHumaine is being sold, but I am not quite sure how that eventuality would be dealt with. Hopefully this Read Me, which accompanies the font, will make folks realize they need not buy it as it is available without charge. Anyone who wishes to use MacHumaine as a screen display in a commercial program or in conjunction with a commercial program has my permission to do so. Only outright sale of the font is discouraged.Historically, the font MacHumaine, as its name is intended to imply, is based on calligraphic handwriting and is not too distant from Zapf Chancery Black. That font, drawn by Hermann Zapf, was not the model for MacHumaine, but Zapf also used chancery cursive handwriting as a the basis for his font. MacHumaine is a sort of pot pourri of calligraphic strokes and flourishes that, to my eye, seem to be pretty well integrated and, especially when italicized on the Mac, gives an appearance of italic handwriting. I do hope you enjoy it. Oddly, it prints quite well even at small sizes and is quite readable. Please do not use it ALL CAPS. Generally calligraphic styles do not lend themselves to this treatment and this one is no exception. Use key caps to check for a few added characters. Any comments or suggestions on the font are welcome.Bill Horton1205 De la Vina StreetSanta Barbara CA 93101(805) 962-3964
