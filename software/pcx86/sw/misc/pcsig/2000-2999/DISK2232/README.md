                WELCOME TO VGA CONCENTRATION   1.1     03-MAY-1990

   This README file contains important, last minute information in
   addition to VC.DOC .  It also answers many common questions.

                       ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS
   -----------------------------------------------------------------

   A) VGA :  This program requires VGA graphics display and a minimum of
      384 K of system memory.  The program supports the most popular VGA
      cards.  If your card is not included in the "VGA CARD SELECTION"
      menu you have 2 options:  (1) Contact your VGA card manufacturer,
      and ask what other VGA card is yours COMPATIBLE with. Or (2) Just
      try all selections from the "VGA CARD SELECTION LIST" until you
      find one that works reliably.

   B) If you do not have VGA graphics display, read in ALIVE.DOC about
      CRAZY SHUFFLE, our memory Concentration program that works on CGA,
      EGA, Hercules, MCGA.

   C) The program files with extensions ".VL" and ".LST" must be present
      in your current disk and directory.

   D) MOUSE : if you plan to use the mouse, the mouse driver must be loaded
      before running VC. For best results, your mouse driver should be a
      recent update, 1988 or later.  If you have any problem with the mouse
      due to compatibility issues just select the keyboard option from the
      installation menu.

                             UPDATE HISTORY
    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Ver 1.0   01-APRIL-1990  First publication of VGA CONCENTRATION
    Ver 1.1   03-MAY-1990    Fixed "Divide overflow" bug associated
                             with new MICROSOFT Mouse drivers
