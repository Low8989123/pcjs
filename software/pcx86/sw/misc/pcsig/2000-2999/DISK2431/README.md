## Information about "CODE TO CODE"

    CODE-TO-CODE, the "Norton Utilities" of desktop publishing does two
    things to make desktop publishing (DTP) easier.
    
    Edit your typesetting codes from .DTP programs like Ventura
    Publisher, XyWrite III, Magna, Penta, or any word processor that can
    produce an ASCII version of a file (most do).
    
    To do this, it takes a .DTP file and separates it into two files -- one
    with the typesetting codes and one with the written text. Edit the text
    file in your favorite word processor and use CODE-TO-CODE's Search and
    Replace features to make changes to the typesetting code file. When
    you're done making changes, CODE-TO-CODE will combine the two files the
    same way it split them.
    
    CODE-TO-CODE also makes working with large files easier. It splits
    large files into smaller ones. Do this by either specifying a group of
    characters to split on, or the maximum size of the split files (64K
    maximum). Finish your editing and then CODE-TO-CODE easily recombines
    them.

CODE-TO-CODE, the "Norton Utilities" of desktop publishing does two     
things to make desktop publishing (DTP) easier.  First it lets you edit 
and change your typesetting codes from DTP programs like Ventura        
Publisher, XyWrite III, Magna, Penta, or any word processor that can    
produce an ASCII version (most do) of a file.                           
                                                                        
To do this it takes a DTP file and separates it into two file; one with 
the typesetting codes and one with the written text.  Now you can edit  
the text file in your favorite word processor and use CODE-TO-CODE's    
search and replace features to make changes to the typesetting code     
file. Then when your done making changes, CODE-TO-CODE will combine the 
two files the same way it split them.                                   
                                                                        
CODE-TO-CODE also makes working with large files easier.  It's easily   
splits large files into smaller ones.  You can do this by either        
specifying a group of characters to split on, or a maximum size of the  
split files (64K maximum).  Then CODE-TO-CODE easily recombines them.
