CHESS FOR WINDOWS - A simple, public domain chess program...for Windows.
And that's where this program starts becoming attractive.  Featuring    
four skill levels, with a hint feature that will suggest a move for you,
CHESS FOR WINDOWS appeals to both the experienced and beginning players.
But it's also for the novice C programmer.  Source code is included, and
modification of the program is encouraged by the author, provided his   
distribution agreement is followed.
