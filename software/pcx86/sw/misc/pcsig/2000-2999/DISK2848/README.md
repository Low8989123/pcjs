Are you tired of the diet syndrome, only to get bored and eventually    
gain the weight back, and maybe more?                                   
                                                                        
LEANER is a collection of behavioral modification strategies and        
motivational techniques that turn your PC into a motivational tool for  
weight control.  No traditional diary method can provide so many        
different ways of reviewing your entries without forcing you to do the  
plotting and charting.  LEANER keeps the fire going by graphing,        
reporting, charting and reviewing your progress.                        
                                                                        
With more than enough chart space to keep a large family's (or a small  
company's) headway neat and tidy (20 charts/directory and virtually     
unlimited directory space), LEANER sweats the small stuff while you stay
focused on getting into shape.  LEANER will calculate your body fat,    
gives tips on boosting your metabolic rate, designs custom forms to use 
as food diaries and behavior modification tools, and turns the          
information you give based on daily activities into charts and graphs   
for seasonal evaluation.  (The program accepts either Metric or English 
weights and measures and will convert freely between them.)             
                                                                        
LEANER uses the food exchange system developed jointly by the American  
Diabetes Association and the American Dietetic Association. The program 
is designed to help you change your eating and exercise habits so that  
over a period of time not only will you reach your desired weight, but  
you will also have adopted a healthier more satisfying lifestyle.
