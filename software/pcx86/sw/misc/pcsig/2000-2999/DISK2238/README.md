## Information about "THE CHECKBOOK"

    Tired of manually balancing your checkbook and trying to keep track of
    your charge accounts and budgets? Let THE CHECKBOOK free you from this
    drudgery. It's a menu-driven money management system designed for
    family or small business usage where the accounting system is based on
    checking accounts. The maximum amount of money that can be handled is
    $999,999.99.
    
    Select checking accounts or budgets, load another account, reconcile
    statements, print checks, search a file, or use the on-screen
    financial calculator. The financial calculator provides four valuable
    financial tools. Calculate monthly loan payments, display/print
    amortization schedules, project future value of deposits, and
    calculate withdrawals from annuities.
    
    All current transactions and budgets are maintained and manipulated in
    memory.
