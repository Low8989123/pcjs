## Information about "KNOW-IT-ALL"

    Everybody loves trivia, but nobody loves a know-it-all.  That is, until
    they've experienced KNOW-IT-ALL, the trivia question game that goes
    beyond most traditional trivia games.
    
    Star Trek, TV Shows, Science, and Slogans are just a few of the
    categories of questions that you'll find. Start out with the questions
    that KNOW-IT-ALL has to offer and after you've mastered these, use the
    editor in KNOW-IT-ALL to add questions to your own customized data
    file. The questions can be multiple choice or fill-in-the-blank.
    
    KNOW-IT-ALL keeps a running tally of how many questions you've
    answered and returns your score.  Since you can add your own questions
    to KNOW-IT-ALL, you could also use the program as an educational
    computerized tester.

Everybody loves trivia, but nobody loves a know-it-all.  That is, until 
they've experienced KNOW-IT-ALL, the trivia questionaire game that lets 
you break the realm of most traditional trivia games.                   
                                                                        
Star Trek, TV Shows, Science, and Slogans are just a few of the         
categories of questions that you'll find. Start out with the questions  
that KNOW-IT-ALL has to offer and after you've mastered these, use the  
editor in KNOW-IT-ALL to add questions to your own customized data file.
The questions can be multiple choice or fill-in-the-blank.              
                                                                        
As you answer questions, KNOW-IT-ALL keeps a running tally of how many  
guesses you've taken. After you're done, you'll get a percentage of how 
many questions were answered correctly (or incorrectly).  Since you can 
add your own questions to KNOW-IT-ALL, you could also use the program   
as an educational computerized tester.
