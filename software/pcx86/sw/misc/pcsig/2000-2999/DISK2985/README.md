CAPTAIN...THE NATIVES SAY THAT FAR TO THE SOUTH LIES A LONE ISLAND   
HEY...THEY SAY FRIENDLY NATIVES HAVE COME FROM THE SOUTHWEST         
CAPTAIN...THE NATIVES WARN OF WARRING PEOPLES FROM THE WEST          
TO THE SOUTHWEST LIES AN ISLAND OF DEATH THEY WARN...                
THIS PLACE HAS NOTHING TO OFFER FOR US...LET'S GET OUT OF HERE       
THOSE NATIVES LOOK NASTY TO ME...LET'S SKIP THIS ISLAND              
CAPTAIN...I'M TOLD HOSTILE ISLAND TO THE NORTH                       
IT'S A LONG HAUL TO THE WEST BUT A BEAUTIFUL ISLAND THEY SAY         
CAPTAIN, THEY WARN TO AVOID THAT BUILDING...LET'S GO LOOK.           
CAPTAIN...MANY ISLANDS TO THE NORTHWEST BUT OUR CHARTS SHOW NONE     
WE'RE WARNED NOT TO HEAD DUE NORTH FOR THERE IS NOTHING FOR DAYS     
THEY SAY WE HAD BETTER HAVE A BIG BOAT TO HEAD NORTH FROM HERE       
FROM OUR CHARTS, I BELIEVE THE GREAT SEA LIES TO THE WEST            
WE CAN'T TRAVEL ACROSS THE GREAT SEA WITHOUT MUCH FUEL AND SUPPLIES..
TO THE NORTH LIES THE GREAT SEA CAPTAIN.  WE BEST BE WELL STOCKED.   
IF WE TRUST THESE CHARTS CAPTAIN THE GREAT SEA IS TO THE NORTH.      
CAPTAIN..THEY TELL OF A HAUNTED ISLAND TO THE WEST                   
FEW VENTURE VERY FAR WEST OF HERE...SHALL WE EXPLORE...              
THE NATIVES WARN OF A TERRIBLE BUILDING TO THE NORTHWEST             
TO THE NORTHWEST THE NATIVES TELL OF A BUILDING OF DEATH             
CAPTAIN...THEY TELL OF A QUAINT VILLAGE BACK IN THE HILLS...         
CAPTAIN...I HEAR ISLANDS TO EAST FRIENDLY, TO SOUTH HOSTILE          
CAPTAIN...SEE THE BOATS IN THE HARBOR.  LET'S STAY AWHILE AND ENJOY  
I HAVE HEARD IT WOULD TAKE A GREAT VESSEL TO CROSS TO THE WEST       
MANY ISLANDS TO THE WEST....WE SHOULD EXPLORE THEM YOU THINK...      
A TREASURE ISLAND EAST OF THE SEVEN SISTERS...I DON'T BELIEVE IT     
THE NATIVES TELL OF AN EMPTY ISLAND FAR TO THE WEST                  
NOTHING FOR MANY DAYS STRAIGHT TO THE SOUTH CAPTAIN                  
CAPTAIN...LOOK AT THAT LONE BUILDING ON THE HILLSIDE                 
WHAT A QUIET BARREN ISLAND...EXCEPT FOR THAT BUILDING IN THE DISTANCE
CAPTAIN...THESE NATIVES THINK WE'RE FROM SOMEWHERE NORTHWEST OF HERE 
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY THOSE NATIVES ARE JUMPING ABOUT ON THE BEACH    
WELL CAPTAIN...AT LEAST WE GET SOME FOOD...NO FUEL HERE              
CAPTAIN...LET'S KEEP HEADING NORTH...THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING     
CAPTAIN...LOTS OF TRASH ON THESE BEACHES.  SOME ISLANDS MUST BE NEAR.
A VISITOR LIKE US SAYS THERE IS PLENTY OF FUEL TO THE NORTH EAST.    
THEY WELCOME US TO THEIR ISLAND. IT SEEMS THEY RARELY GET VISITORS...
CAPTAIN...CAN'T WE STAY HERE AND VISIT A FEW PUBS...                 
CAPTAIN...NOTHING NORTHWARD...IT'S WEST OR SOUTH FOR US...           
CAPTAIN...THEY WARN THAT ISLANDS ARE RARE TO WESTWARD                
CAPTAIN...I'M NOT SURE I TRUST THESE CHARTS MUCH FURTHER TO THE WEST.
CAPTAIN...MANY RAINS AGO A BOAT LIKE OURS CAME FROM THE SOUTHWEST.

YUK...CAN'T SEE A THING                                              
THERE'LL BE NO NAVIGATING TONIGHT WITH THIS FOG                      
CAPTAIN...IT'S AS THICK AS CHOWDER

WE'RE WARNED NOT TO HEAD DUE NORTH FOR THERE IS NOTHING FOR DAYS     
THEY SAY WE HAD BETTER HAVE A BIG BOAT TO HEAD NORTH FROM HERE       
FROM OUR CHARTS, I BELIEVE THE GREAT SEA LIES TO THE WEST            
WE CAN'T TRAVEL ACROSS THE GREAT SEA WITHOUT MUCH FUEL AND SUPPLIES..
TO THE NORTH LIES THE GREAT SEA CAPTAIN.  WE BEST BE WELL STOCKED.   
IF WE TRUST THESE CHARTS CAPTAIN THE GREAT SEA IS TO THE NORTH.      
CAPTAIN..THEY TELL OF A HAUNTED ISLAND TO THE WEST
