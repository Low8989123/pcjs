This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
700 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'GO' at the
DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy access
to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.

The Narc utility, newly instituted with the tenth edition, allows you to
look directly at all the compressed program files on the CD without
having to download the program to your hard disk.  So if you want to
look at the programmer's notes or on-line documentation before using
valuable hard disk space, you can.

The PC-SIG Encyclopedia of Shareware is included on the disk, and a
printed copy of the book is included so you can peruse the available
programs from the comfort of your favorite chair.  All the programs are
logically divided into one-hundred twenty categories making it easier to
find just the right software.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

Winner of the Optical Publishing Assn's Best Consumer Product Award.

"Never before has such a valuable collection of popular shareware been
compiled on one CD-ROM that everyone can afford." Dr. File Finder a.k.a.
Michael Callahan

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed

by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word in the program
description.  A new utility, Narc, is implemented so you can look at the
program files and the author's on-line documentation without having to
first copy the program to your hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and
Narc, you can quickly find the program you want and review it to be
sure, without ever having to run it from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

System Requirements:

IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible with 384K memory DOS 3.1 or higher and
Microsoft MS-DOS CD ROM extensions.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

     INTRODUCTION
     ------------
     This software is a demonstration of Superscape Virtual Reality
     software specifically produced for PC compatible VGA systems.

     It should be noted that complete Virtual Reality Solution Systems
     are superior to this demonstration in respect of screen resolution,
     degree of detail, control interface and speed of screen update.
     This demonstration will, however, allow an insight into the
     possibilities and experiences of interacting within a virtual
     reality.

     SUPERSCAPE VIRTUAL REALITY SOLUTIONS
     ------------------------------------
     We can turn your ideas, plans or products into virtual worlds.
     You, your customers, and, in fact, anyone can then walk through and
     interact with these environments in real time.

     We will supply a complete solution, comprising a customised 486 IBM
     PC compatible, with a high resolution display and a six axis
     controller which will alleviate the need for many of the keyboard
     functions.  It will also include the Superscape software running
     your virtual world to your specifications.

     The potential uses of these solutions are many and varied, but
     include simulation, visualisation and presentation, for the purpose
     of sales, marketing, training etc.

     It should again be noted that these solutions are top end,
     professional, high resolution systems with considerably enhanced
     performance, resolution and detail than this VGA demonstration.

     For further information on Superscape Virtual Reality Software and
     Solutions, please contact our sales department.


     3D BENCHMARK
     ------------
     Also available is the 3D benchmark disk, for VGA PC compatibles.
     This software has been placed into the public domain to establish a
     reference point for comparing the performance of PC compatible VGA
     systems.

     The 3D benchmark is arrived at by timing one cycle of a continuous 
     3-dimensional Superscape demonstration and then calculating the
     average number of screen updates the computer system has achieved
     in one second (frames per second).  The higher the benchmark, the
     greater the performance.

     Please send  2.50 (or US $5) to cover media, postage, handling
     etc to our mail order department, specifying the disk size you
     require.  (Payment by Access/Mastercard and Visa also accepted.)


     3D CONSTRUCTION KIT - Freescape II
     ----------------------------------
     In simultaneous development, our sister company, Incentive
     Software, has created the 3D Construction Kit, which allows you to
     build as well as interact within your own virtual world.  This
     product uses the predecessor to Superscape - the Freescape II
     system - and is due for release in April 1991.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

To run the demo, type: RUNVGA DEMO.RUN

With that out of the way, this is a demo of Virtual Reality Studio; in fact,
this is the demo VR supplied in the package.  It's a full-fledged adventure
game in which your goal is to get off the planet.

The controls at the bottom of the screen are pretty straight-forward.  Click
them with the left mouse button and they'll do what they should (i.e. go
forward/backward/left/right, turn left/right, look up/down/level).  Using
the right mouse button accelerates most functions, but changes the meaning
of a few: back becomes turn around and look up/down becomes stand up/crouch.

Clicking the left button with the cursor in the viewport fires your laser.
Clicking the right one activates whatever it's on (i.e. opens doors, picks
up objects, etc.).  Escape restarts; Shift-Escape exits to DOS.

If you like its capabilities, Virtual Reality Studio lists for $90, but most 
stores carry it for about $70.  You need a 286 or better with 640k and CGA, 
Tandy, EGA, or VGA graphics.  Supports joystick and mouse and AdLib sound.
Also available for the Amiga (its original platform).
