## Information about "STATISTICALLY ACCURATE BASEBALL"

    Being an armchair baseball manager is a tough job.  For all the work you
    do during the season, the players on the screen never do what you tell
    them to do.  You yell "run for third base" and they stay put at second,
    or you tell them to bunt and they strike out.  Now there's hope.
    
    STATISTICALLY ACCURATE BASEBALL lets you bring together two major league
    baseball teams, historical as well as current, and let them do battle on
    the diamond, with you as their manager.  You can pit your managerial
    skills against the computer, a fellow armchair manager, or let two
    computerized managers go at it head to head.
    
    STATISTICALLY ACCURATE BASEBALL provides you with players from The 1988
    Cubs, A's, Bluejays and Giants, as well as The 1950 Red Sox and The 1936
    Yankees (over 120 more teams are available from the author). It's the
    answer to the question of what to do after the World Series.  Play ball!

        Statistically Accurate Baseball copyright 1988 Joe Damore

 To  play  baseball  you must create a DIRECTORY called TEAMS on A:, C:, or
B: drive at the top level, Then copy the teams you want to use in to the
TEAMS DIRECTORY. Note you may only have 500 teams at a time in the TEAMS DIR. 
because at this time it will only allow 500 files in the list box
at one time. You must also create a DIRECTORY called STATS on A:, C:, or B:
drive because the program will look for this directory to write your stats
files too. This directory also must be at the top level.

Also set the (SAB.CFG) programs config file for the drives you want to
use.  example: C=TEAMS  It must be at the root or top DIR on your disk.
               C=STATS               example: C:\SAB.CFG
 
      This would tell the program to look on C: drive for these DIR's.
Just edit this ascii file and resave it as ascii it must have two lines.
It is preset for the C: drive.

     Look  for  version SABpcv3.exe on Genie to  fix  the last few
bugs in version SABpc.exe and few new features.

               Remember This is Shareware!
               Thanks for your Support.

You can leave me messages on genie but I only log on once a month you can call
or write me any time.

                               SABpcV3.ZIP

  This Document must always accompany the SABpc.exe or SABpcV3.exe
and the 6 Team files that come with it these are shareware files and you
can pass them to friends. But the Stats.prg and the Drafting Program and
all the other teams are not public domain but must be purchased from 
me the author. Please honor this, my price for the programs and teams 
is more than fair.


  This version of Statistically Accurate Baseball is released as 
Shareware and works with only a Color Monitor  included is four teams 
to start you off  with. The 1988 CUBS, 1988 A's, 1988 BlueJays, 1988 
GIANTS, 1950 REDSOX and the 1936 Yankees. If you find  you enjoy this game
then please send $14.00 and you will receive the Drafting Program that
lets you form your own teams from any of the teams I have created, and
also the Stats Compiler Program which compiles team stats and  lets you 
view them or print them at any time. Last but not least you get the 
complete 1987 set of teams and also 47 great teams of the past with at 
least one team included for each city. Also there are no bad bugs in
SABpcV1.exe, there are new enhancements like being able to view game stats 
at any time, pinch runners are now put on base correctly and, score 
sheet problems have been fixed. Also there is now a computer Manager 
you can play against and, if you want to play more than one game without 
rerunning the program you can. You get all this for a very low price 
so please support me, other games of this type sell for as high as 
$69.00 This money covers my three years of hard work, shipping, and 
a disk or disks. Also my wife might let me create a football program
some day.
     A little bit about me. My name is Joe Damore I am 34 years old 
and I work for GTE Directories Corp. as a System Admin. on a Interleaf 
driven Sun system. I am happily married with 4 children ages 13, 6, 
5, and 1. I have a Tandy 1000TX with a 720k 3 1/2 disk, 360k 5 1/4 disk,
768k ram, a 32meg harddrive and last but not least a VGA color system. 
    Now a little info on my program. I worked 3 years to create a  
baseball fans baseball game. This game is statistically accurate if 
you were to play a 162 game season a player should bat very close 
to his  average of that season or pitcher should be right on with 
his ERA. But you as the manager can make a difference in a teams season 
of about 10 games buy putting the right pinch hitter in or calling 
on the right  relief pitcher etc. This game does not have fancy graphics 
but like I  said it does have realism. Also one nine inning game can 
be played in 10 minutes or if you let the computer manager manage 
both teams a game can be played in less than 10 seconds this is great 
for baseball leagues or replays. At the end of the game it prints out a
score sheet so you can enjoy the game and not keep the stats yourself.
The program will also update a stats file too so you can track a whole 
season.
    NOTE: If you play a super teams league by drafting or with the 
old timer teams batting Averages will be lower than normal and pitchers 
ERA. will be higher this is normal and reflects the tougher competition 
in a league filled with super stars.
   My next release of teams is the complete 1989 baseball season 
witch I will have ready by middle Febuary 1990. The 1988 season
witch is now ready.  At a very low cost of only $8.00 the 1989 season.
will also be $8.00.
    Also if you want a team created that I don't have in my best teams 
set I will create one for you at $5.00 per team with a two team minimum.


                    Thank you very much and PLAY BALL !

  To play ball at the dos prompt type SABPCV3, this will start the
loading and running of the baseball program. When the program has
finished loading you will see a message on the screen with a
copyright notice. Now press any key to begin.
   Next pick the home team and then the visiting team by using your
arrow keys to move the highlighted cursor on the team you want then
press enter.
  After you have picked the teams you want, you will now select 
the starting pitchers the same way as you selected the teams.
  The next screen display will ask you if you want the computer 
to manage one of the teams or both of the teams. The computer will 
be no push over as it will play conservatively and by percentages. 
If you want the  computer to manage both of the teams a game can be 
played very quickly. Set the delay setting to Warp, Medium, or Fast 
these settings control how quickly the game displays are shown. You 
would usually set the control to Warp, and watch it fly if the computer 
is against its self.
  Last but not least it is time to choose your starting lineups 
for  each team. This menu screen will display each players name and 
their  most important stats. It will also have a PRESET lineup. Now 
look over  the stats and see if you want to use the PRESET lineup 
or select a  lineup of your OWN choice.
  After you have selected both lineups you should now see the Main 
action screen. This is where every thing happens during the game. 
The top half of the Main action screen has the Scoreboard, Outs made 
in the inning and, the Base Runners on base situation. All this keeps 
you informed on the games progress inning by inning. The bottom half 
of the Main action screen is the area where both managers make their 
strategy decisions and, where you also see the outcome of each play. 
The defensive manager makes his decision first then the offensive 
manager makes his decision. You do this by Selecting the decision you want.
  Don't worry about keeping stats S.A.B. does that for you. And 
at the end of the game it will ask you if you want a printout if you  
have a printer, or you can print them to the screen if you don't. 
Also at any time during the game you can see the starting lineup for 
either team by clicking the mouse on DEF Change for the defensive 
team, or clicking the mouse on OFF Change for the offensive team. 
You are now ready to playball.  


                   Rules Built Into The Program

     There are certain rules built into the program pertaining to 
Strategy. If you accidentally violate one of these rules you will 
be see a alert box telling you  what you did something wrong.


   SQUEEZE BUNT:                        Can only be used when there 
                                        is a runner on 3rd base.

   SACRIFICE BUNT:                      Cannot be used with runner 
                                        on 3rd base.

   STEALING:                            You cannot steal a base 
                                        already occupied.

   INFIELD IN:                          You cannot use unless there 
                                        is at least 1 runner on base.

   HOLDING A RUNNER ON BASE:            You cannot use unless there 
                                        is at least 1 runner on base.

   HIT&RUN:                             You cannot use with a runner 
                                        on 3rd base.

   DESIGNATED HITTER:                   Each team has a Designated 
                                        hitter in the lineup.

   DOUBLE STEAL:                        If a runner on 2nd base attempts 
                                        steal 3rd base and there is a
                                        runner on 1st base this auto-
                                        matically starts a double steal
                                        attempt. 
                 

Defensive Coaching Decisions



PLAY NORMAL:             Usually this is the most often defensive 
                         selection. Best situations to use would
                         be with no men on or poor base stealer
                         is on 1st base.

HOLD RUNNER ON:          You would use this to help prevent 
                         good base stealers from running on
                         you. But this also improves a batters
                         chance to get a base hit by leaving a
                         hole between 1st and 2nd base.

INT. WALK:               You are allowed to intentionally walk 
                         any batter. Good situations would be
                         with 1st base open and a runner on 2nd
                         base to put you in the position for a
                         doubleplay. Or with men on and a good
                         hitter up with two outs.

INFIELD IN:              Playing the infield in decreases the 
                         scoring chances of a runner on 3rd base.
                         It also decreases the chances of a player
                         sacrificing a runner to scoring position.
                         However it increases the batters chances
                         of hitting safely if he swings away, and
                         also decreases the chances of doubleplay.

CORNERS IN:              Playing the corners in decreases the 
                         chances of a player sacrificing a runner 
                         to scoring position. It increases the batters
                         chances of hitting safely if he swings away,
                         but it is less of a increase than playing your
                         whole infield in. Also it doesn't decrease
                         the chances of doubleplay as much.

PLAYER CHANGE:           A defensive manager buy picking this
                         selection can view his starting lineup and 
                         make a player change during the game. 
                         He can also just view his players ratings 
                         during the game and go back to the main 
                         menu with out a change.

Offensive Coaching Decisions


SWING AWAY:              The batter just takes his cuts. This should
                         be the most often used offensive play.

BUNT:                    Used to advance base runners into scoring 
                         position in a close game. You can also bunt
                         for hit if you want.

STEAL:                   If you pick this play during the game,a
                         screen will appear to ask you what base you
                         want to steal. It will also tell you if the
                         runner was safe or out. Also, if you are
                         stealing 3rd base with a runner on 1st base
                         a double steal will occur automatically.
                         The catcher will throw at the man trying to
                         steal 3rd base.  

HIT & RUN:               It should be used with one or no outs. So
                         that your base runners have a better chance
                         to advance to the next base. But it also
                         decreases a batters batting Average.

SQUEEZE BUNT:            It should only be used with one or no outs
                         and a runner on 3rd base. A good bunter
                         will have a good chance to score the runner
                         on 3rd.

PLAYER CHANGE:           The offensive manager can pinch hit any
                         time he wants. He can also pick this choice
                         to view his staring lineup or bench to look at
                         the player ratings.

STATS PROGRAM: Version 3.0 is now out using color!

  The new stats program is easy to use all you have to do is 
make menu choices and the program does all the work for you. It will 
let you view a teams compiled stats and print them.It will let you 
create a baseball league or division of 15 teams or less, and then 
it will  print the standings of the league on the screen or print 
them on your printer. This program  makes it so easy to keep stats 
so that most of your time will be used on playing the game. In V3.0 
of the STATS.prg all bugs are fixed and there is now a totals line 
on the bottom of the stats columns for both batters and pitchers. 


DRAFTING PROGRAM: Version 3.0 is now out using color!

   This new program is also easy to use and all your choices 
are menu selected. This program  allows you to draft your teams from 
any of the current teams I have created which is 100  teams right now. 
It also lets you change the permanent lineup to one of your choice 
on any team that I have created or you have created. If you wish to 
view the pitching  rotation with out making a change enter 99 return. 
This brings you to the main screen.  

NOTE:     If you wish to view the pitching rotation in the DRAFTING.prg
          with out making a change enter 99 at the 1st prompt. This
           brings you to the main screen.

NOTE:     In all of my programs you may exit them at any 
          time with Control-Break or on the Tandy as Cntrl-Hold

NOTE:     You  must have a FOLDER called STATS and a FOLDER called TEAMS
          on your A:, B:, or C: drive at the root or top level of your
          directory for SABpcV1.exe. You then may place the PROGRAMS on your
          hard drive or A: drive. Also all the Teams must be in the TEAMS
          FOLDER and the STATS.STS files will be created and put in the
          STATS FOLDER by the S.A.B. program. Also all LEAGUE.LGE files
          must be kept in the STATS FOLDER.

COMMON QUESTIONS:

Q. > How well do players field if they are out of position.

A. >  If a player who plays infield is put in the outfield 
     or a outfielder is put in the infield then he will perform
     poorly but when you change a infielders position to a
     different infield position then they will perform only
     one rating worse, the same goes for the outfield.

Q. > Why are some players performing at levels that
     are above or below real life.

A. >  There are three main reasons for this. First if you play
     only a short season say about 40 games which may seem like a
     lot, but its really not for baseball this will cause more 
     variations than normal. Because just like in real life your
     players will have hot and cold streaks. But over a 
     long season like the pros play statistics will level out 
     to real life levels.
       Second even if you play a full season of 162 games but, you played
     only the good teams against the good teams or you had a draft league 
     of say 10 teams which in affect gives you a super league. Pitchers
     ERA's should be higher and batters AVERAGES should be lower all other
     stats should be about the same.
       The third reason has to do with how you manage a team. 
     if you bunt, steal, or hit & run more or less than in real
     life you will see different results. How you set
     your lineup will have a big impact on RBI and Run production 
     too. Also how you handle your pitchers is very important to
     statistical out comes.


NOTE: There is a new feature in SABpcV3.exe the Computer manager is now a
      better manager than before. If you let the Computer manager manage
      both teams in the WARP mode a game can be played in as fast as
      3 seconds on a IBM 70-E 80386 computer!
