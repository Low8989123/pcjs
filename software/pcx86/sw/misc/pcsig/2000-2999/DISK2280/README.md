## Information about "ARTPAK"

    If you use PageMaker, Xerox's Ventura, or similar desktop publishing
    software you know that being able to use electronic clip art can make
    it easier to generate professional looking bulletins, flyers,
    newsletters, etc.
    
    This disk contains eight borders, ten headlines, ten pieces of
    electronic clip art, five accents, seven symbols, and eight bonus files
    with four major credit card symbols in .PCX and .TIF formats. The clip
    art can be used with Xerox's Ventura, PageMaker, CorelDRAW, WordPerfect
    5.0+, Word For Windows, AMI,  Arts & Letters, and many other programs
    that can import graphics. WordPerfect macros are included to aid
    beginning users in adding clip art to their documents.
    
    The borders are in .WMF and .CGM formats. These files take up very
    little room and because they use vector graphics, they can be
    proportionally sized without losing resolution.

Using our borders in WordPerfect 5.0 or 5.1.

The following steps will walk you through using one of our borders
(.cgm format) with some sample text in WordPerfect. As you become more
familiar with the steps you can change the size and margins to your liking.
(The 10" height that you will enter in for the border will show 9.83".  If
you know WordPerfect well enough you can either increase the Margins - Top
& Bottom or change the Outside Border Space of the box to get a full 10"
height.)

	I.		Start WordPerfect as you normally do.
			(Make sure your printer is on and properly connected.)

       II.		Insert the ArtPak diskette in drive A.

      III.		Adjust Margins
			1.	Press Format (Shift-F8)
			2.	Select Line (1)
			3.	Select Margins - Left & Right (7)
			4.	Type .25  and press Enter
			5.	Type .25  and press Enter twice
			6.	Select Page (2)
			7.	Select Margins - Top & Bottom (5)
			8.	Type .5  and press Enter
			9.	Type .5  and press Enter 3 times

       IV.	 	Load the border
			1.	Press Graphics (Alt-F9)
			2.	Select User-defined Box (4)
			3.	Select Create (1)
			4.	Select Filename (1)
			5.	Type a:bv4-03p.cgm  and press Enter
			6.	Select Horizontal Position (5)
			7.	Select Center (3)
			8.	Select Size (6)
			9.	Select Both Width and Height (3)
			10.	Type 7.5  and press Enter
			11.	Type 10  and press Enter
			12.	Select Wrap Text Around Box (7)
			13.	Type n  (for No) and press Enter 2 times

	V.		Reset your margins for your text.
			1.	Press Format (Shift-F8)
			2.	Select Line (1)
			3.	Select Margins - Left & Right (7)
			4.	Type 2  and press Enter
			5.	Type 2  and press Enter twice
			6.	Select Page (2)
			7.	Select Margins Top & Bottom (5)
			8.	Type 2  and press Enter
			9.	Type 2  and press Enter 3 times




       VI.		Type sample text
			1.	Type "This is a test using Computer Completer's
 				      ArtPak Borders in WordPerfect.  This text
  				      is 2" from the top and 2" from the left."

      VII.		View and print page
			1.	Press Print (Shift-F7)
			2.	Select View Document (6)
			3.	Press Cancel (F1)
			4.	Select Page (2)

The page will be sent to your printer.



NOTES: If you should experience any difficulty with our graphics in 5.0
you can upgrade to 5.1 or higher and you should experience no problems.
You can also try using grphcnv.exe from WordPerfect.
The macros border.wpm and border50.wpm will essentially perform the
steps above.  Border.wpm is to use with version 5.1 and border50.wpm has
been edited to work properly with version 5.0.  After you enter in the
filename of the border you want, the macro pauses at the graphic display
of the page.  Press Cancel (F1) twice to continue from there.
The macro ccsample.wpm (also found in batch file border.bat) will work
with both versions but you will not be able to edit it in version 5.0.
Copy the files border.bat and ccsample.wpm into the same directory as
WordPerfect on your hard disk.  Then just type "border" at the dos 
prompt from that directory.  The macro ccsample will automatically be
run as WordPerfect starts up and will send a border and text to your 
printer.  (Make sure your printer is on and properly connected first.)
When you order products from us let us know if you are interested 
in having Computer Completers develop additional WordPerfect macros.
