## Information about "CIPHER"

    If you are tired of word games which look dull and boring. Here's a
    colorful and challenging program that uses high-resolution graphics.
    
    CIPHER is a "crypto-quotes" type of game. A quotation is enciphered and
    displayed on the screen in its scrambled form. Your challenge is to
    figure out the cipher by replacing the scrambled letters with the
    actual letters. As you go along, more and more of the puzzle will start
    to look like real words. Eventually, you should be able to
    solve
