## Information about "INTEXT MULTILINGUAL WORD PROCESSING"

    Whether you're a linguist, translator, student, or work for a
    international company, you're going to be glad you heard about INTEXT.
    INTEXT is the first shareware word processor created for worldwide use.
    
    Create documents in English and any of the following languages:
    Albanian, Arabic, Croatian, Danish, Dutch, Farsi, Finnish, French,
    Gaelic, German, Hebrew, Italian, Macedonian, Norwegian, Polish,
    Portuguese, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish.
    
    INTEXT supports all the functions you would expect to find on a full
    function word processor: search-and-replace, text block commands, text
    formatting commands, etc.  What makes it unique is that all the
    special characters and symbols for the languages are displayed on the
    screen and printed out on either Epson FX, LQ, or IBM Proprinter

     The Intext Multilingual Wordprocessor can be started in one of two ways
     depending on the type of graphic display card and monitor you are using
     with your personal computer (PC):
      ╔══════════════════════════════════╤═════════════════════════════════╗

            and when the prompt appears on the screen, enter:  INTEXT /C

     This information screen will not appear again unless you start the
     program by typing: INTEXT /I

     Before Epson LQ 24-pin users start Intext, they should enter: 24PIN

MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR SHAREWARE DISK. INSERT THE ORIGINAL DISK IN DRIVE A,
AND ENTER  DISKCOPY A: A:


1. Intext Disk Preparation

Intext is available directly from the software developers, shareware
distributor, and bulletin boards around the country. The disk(s) you
receive may be in one of three different forms. To distinguish between each
form, request a directory of the shareware disk (enter, DIR A:). Each form
is described below:

  1) Ready-to-run Intext language disk.

     A directory listing (enter DIR) will report about 33 File(s) or more.
     (The exact number may differ from language to language, and, shareware
     distributors may include a few extra files). Refer to the section
     Getting Starting in this manual.

  2) Intext language disk in compressed form.

     You will notice a couple of files only. Most of the Intext files will
     have been compressed into one larger file. Some additional files will
     be supplied by the distributor. Refer to the distributors instructions
     on how to prepare the software.

  3) Master shareware distributor disk, containing all Intext languages.

     You will notice 14 or more files, most of which indicating a
     particular language (for example, &ARABIC.ZIP, &EUROPE.ZIP, etc).
     Refer to the instructions below on preparing an Intext Language disk.


1.1  Master Shareware Distributor Disk Preparation

If you have successfully identified your shareware disk as the Master
Shareware Distributor Disk (see above), these notes will explain the simple
process needed to generate a ready-to-run version of Intext. Check your
system set-up below, and refer to the relevant section.

         1.2  Single 3.5" Floppy Drive Users
         1.3  Single 5.25" Floppy Drive Users
         1.4  Single 5.25" Floppy Drive Users with Ram Disk
         1.5  Dual Floppy Driver User
         1.6  Hard Drive User


1.2  Single 3.5" Floppy Drive Users

Use a copy of your original shareware disk. You will need at least 360K of
free disk space to prepare the ready-to-run version of Intext. If you are
not planning to use all the different language versions of Intext, you may
delete the relevant compressed language files. For example, if you do not
plan on using Arabic, and European, you can delete the files &ARABIC.ZIP
and &EUROPE.ZIP (Enter DEL &ARABIC.ZIP). Now refer to section 1.7
Un-Zip-ing Intext.


1.3  Single 5.25" Floppy Drive Users

It would help the preparation process if you are able to set-up in memory,
a 360K Ram disk (sometimes called a virtual disk). Refer to the next
section about setting-up a Ram disk.

Prepare a blank formatted 5.25" disk.  A high-capacity 1.2M drive is
advantageous. Replace the blank disk with Master Shareware Distributor
Disk. Now refer to section 1.7 Un-Zip-ing Intext. You will be prompted to
switch between the Master Shareware Distributor Disk, and the blank disk,
at least once for each Intext file (At least 33 times). Please be patient.


1.4  Single   5.25" Floppy Drive Users with Ram Disk

Your version of DOS may have the necessary program to set-up a ram disk. It
may be called RAMDRIVE.SYS, VDISK.SYS, RDISK.EXE, or RAMDISK.EXE. Check
your DOS manual, or program documentation for more information. You ram
disk will probably be assigned as Drive C.

To prepare your ready-to-run version of Intext, first prepare a blank
formatted 5.25" disk.  A high-capacity 1.2M drive is advantageous. First,
un-ZIP the Intext files to your Ram disk (See section 1.7, Un-Zip-ing
Intext), and then copy them back to your blank floppy (enter COPY C:*.*
A:).


1.5  Dual Floppy Drive Users

Prepare a blank formatted 5.25" disk.  A high-capacity 1.2M drive is
advantageous. Place the Master Shareware Distributor Disk in Drive A, and
the blank formatted disk in Drive B. Now refer to section 1.7 Un-Zip-ing
Intext.


1.6  Hard Drive Users

Assuming your hard drive is assigned as Drive C, at the DOS prompt, make a
new directory called INTEXT (enter MD \INTEXT). Change to the new directory
(enter
CD \INTEXT). Log-on to your floppy disk drive (enter A:), and refer to
section 1.7 Un-Zip-ing Intext.

Hard drive users may want the ability to switch between different Intext
language configurations. Simply copy the Intext configuration files to your
INTEXT directory (enter COPY &*.ZIP C:), and copy the PKUNZIP.EXE utility
there too (enter COPY PKUNZIP.EXE C:). To configure Intext for another
language, first ensure you are in the INTEXT directory on drive C. Then
uncompress ZIP file for that language, for example, PKUNZIP &ARABIC, and
press Y to affirm that you do want to overwrite existing files.


1.7  UN-ZIP-ing Intext

It is necessary to uncompress the Intext program followed by the language
characterization files. This two step process is achieved by 'un-ZIP-ing'
INTEXT.ZIP followed by ONE ZIP'ed language file. For example, to prepare a
ready-to-run Arabic program, (note that the .ZIP suffix is assumed), enter:


Single 3.5" Drive       Single 5.25" Drive     5.25" Drive with RAM Drive
                        Dual Floppy Drive      Hard Drive
(1) PKUNZIP INTEXT      PKUNZIP INTEXT B:      PKUNZIP INTEXT C:
(2) PKUNZIP -o &ARABIC  PKUNZIP -o &ARABIC B:  PKUNZIP -o &ARABIC C:

Some of the files in &ARABIC.ZIP are designed to overwrite and hence
replace those in INTEXT.ZIP.

At any time, you may change from one language configuration to another,
simply by uncompressing the language characterization files for the
required language. (For example, in the above example, to change from
Arabic to European, simply replace &ARABIC with &EUROPE in step (2).


2. Getting Started

To start the ready-to-run version of Intext, enter: INTEXT
Epson LQ 24-pin and compatible printer users will need to run a utility
before starting Intext. Just enter: 24PIN (and then enter INTEXT).

Context sensitive help is available at most Intext screens by pressing the
F10 key.


3. The Main Menu

Intext comprises three different modules: 1) Editing, 2) Printing, 3) File
utilities. The editing option allows you to create new documents, and edit
and modify existing documents. Once a document has been completed, the
print option allows you to specify different print styles (such as bold,
underline, etc), and then print the document. The file option allows you to
copy, delete, merge, and rename documents.


4.  Editing

From the Main Menu, press E to select editing. If this is the first time
you are using Intext, you may wish to load and optionally edit one of the
sample documents provided. For example, to load and edit the file
README.WP, just type the name README (the extension WP is included by
default). For more information on document names, press F10.


4.1  Editing Screen

Once the document has loaded, it will be displayed in the edit screen. The
top line is the command line. The bottom line is the status line. For a
summary of available commands, press F10 for HELP.


4.2  Language Selection

To discover how to select languages, and how the keyboard is configured,
select the pop-up keyboard (Press Shift-F10). You will be able to change
the keyboard to a new language AFTER you press Esc to return to editing
mode.


4.3  Command Line

Several commands are available from the command line. Press HOME to move
the cursor to the command line. Press F10 for a summary of available
commands. To save a document, at the command line, press Esc.


5  Printing

You must save a document in the editor before you can print it. Once it is
saved, you will be prompted whether you want to print it. Alternatively,
you can always print an existing document by pressing P for print at the
Main menu.


5.1  Epson LQ 24-Pin Users

If this is the first time you are using Intext, you will be prompted to
select a printer. If you intend to use an Epson 24-pin printer, you must
run a special utility program BEFORE running Intext. At the DOS prompt,
enter: 24PIN and then enter INTEXT.


5.2  Printer 'Types'

After the printer has been selected, you will be prompted to enter its type
(0-5). The 'type' describes the download character capabilities of your
printer. Press Enter to select the default setting. If you find that your
printouts are not entirely successful, reselect your printer (Press S from
the Print Menu), and try a different type. For more information on your
printer 'type', request more information on your printer (Press I from the
Print Menu). For a summary of styles available on your printer, select the
Explain option.


5.3  Printing

To print out your document, just select Print from the Print Menu.


5.4  Print Enhancing

If you wish to enhance your text with different print styles, select
Format. You may change any of the physical page characteristics, and/or
continue to more detailed formatting options (Press PgDn).

To embolden a whole line, enter the line number at the top of the screen.
Then enter a period and the style code for bold (for example .B). Other
line style options are available. Press F10 for more help.

To underline a single word, move the cursor to the word, and press F1 to
insert a blank style line. Move the cursor under the word, and enter the
underline style code (for example, AAAAAA).

Press Esc to save the formatting codes, and select Print to make a hard
copy.


5.5 Solving Printer Problems

1. If you have selected either the Epson FX, or, IBM Proprinter, you may
have selected the incorrect TYPE 1-5. Try each one (see section 5.2).

2. Your printer may not be 100% compatible with Epson of IBM download
character codes. Check in your printer manual that to download characters
requires the printer codes: Epson: Esc &       IBM:   Esc =

3. 24-pin printers that emulate Epson FX or IBM Proprinters will NOT work
since the latter are 9-pin printers.

4. Your printer must be connected to LPT1. Also check that your printer is
powered-up, on-line, and the cables are secure at both the printer and
computer ends. To check that it is, at the DOS prompt enter: DIR > LPT1:

5. Using a DIP switch, many printers give you a choice between download
characters and a printer buffer. Check your manual and printer that you do
have download characters selected.

6. Some memory resident program may be incompatible with Intext. Try
re-booting your computer with DOS on a floppy disk (so that no memory
resident program are loaded), and re-try Intext.

7. Some known incompatible printers include: Panasonic KXP-1080i, Toshiba
P321, HP Deskjet, HP LaserJet (Russian only. Requires additional driver).

8. European languages (except Danish, Dutch, and Portuguese) may work
correctly with 'incompatible' printers since they have the correct
character set built-in. If your printer supports the IBM extended character
set, there is no need for Intext to program the printer with non-English
characters.

9. 24-pin users MUST have run the utility program described in section 5.1.
