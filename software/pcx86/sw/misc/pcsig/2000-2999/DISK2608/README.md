         DEFINITION OF SHAREWARE			        
							        
         Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software
         before buying it.  If you try a Shareware program and
         continue using it, you are expected to register.  Individual
         programs differ on details.  Some request registration while
         others require it, some specify a maximum trial period.
         With registration, you get anything from the simple right to
         continue using the software to an updated program with
         printed manual.

         Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial
         software, and the copyright holder retains all rights, with
         a few specific exceptions as stated below.  Shareware
         authors are accomplished programmers, just like commercial
         authors, and the programs are of comparable quality.  (In
         both cases, there are good programs and bad ones!)  The main
         difference is in the method of distribution.  The author
         specifically grants the right to copy and distribute the
         software, either to all and sundry or to a specific group.
         For example, some authors require written permission before
         a commercial disk vendor may copy their Shareware.
  
         Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software.
         You should find software that suits your needs and
         pocketbook, whether it's commercial or Shareware.  The
         Shareware system makes fitting your needs easier, because
         you can try before you buy.  And because the overhead is
         low, prices are low also.  Shareware has the ultimate
         money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the product, you
         don't pay for it.
  
         DISCLAIMER - AGREEMENT
  
         Users of Painless Payroll must accept this disclaimer of
         warranty:  "Painless Payroll is supplied as is.  The
         author disclaims all warranties, expressed or implied,
         including, without limitation, the warranties of
         merchantability and of fitness for any purpose.  The author
         assumes no liability for damages, direct or consequential,
         which may result from the use of Painless Payroll."
  
         Painless Payroll is a "shareware program" and is provided
         at no charge to the user for evaluation.  Feel free to share
         it with your friends, but please do not give it away altered
         or as part of another system.  The essence of
         "user-supported" software is to provide personal computer
         users with quality software without high prices, and yet to
         provide incentive for programmers to continue to develop new
         products.  If you find this program useful and find that you
         are using Painless Payroll and continue to use Painless
         Payroll after a reasonable trial period, you must make a
         registration payment of $75.00 to Painless Accounting.  The
         $75.00 registration fee will license one copy for use on
  
                           PAGE 1




         any one computer at any one time, and you will receive a
         printed manual.  You must treat this software just like a
         book.  An example is that this software may be used by any
         number of people and may be freely moved from one computer
         location to another, so long as there is no possibility of
         it being used at one location while it's being used at
         another.  Just as a book cannot be read by two different
         persons at the same time.

         Commercial users of Painless Payroll must register and
         pay for their copies of Painless Payroll within 30 days
         of first use or their license is withdrawn.  Site-License
         arrangements may be made by contacting Painless Accountng.
  
         Anyone distributing Painless Payroll for any kind of
         remuneration must first contact Painless Payroll at the
         address below for authorization.  This authorization will be
         automatically granted to distributors recognized by the
         (ASP) as adhering to its guidelines for shareware
         distributors, and such distributors may begin offering
         Painless Payroll immediately (However Painless Accounting
         must still be advised so that the distributor can be kept
         up-to-date with the latest version of Painless Payroll.).
  
         You are encouraged to pass a copy of Painless Payroll
         along to your friends for evaluation.  Please encourage them
         to register their copy if they find that they can use it.
         All registered users will receive a copy of the latest
         version of the Painless Payroll system, and a printed
         manual.

         SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

         This program requires an IBM PC or IBM compatible computer
         with 512K RAM and a hard disk.

         INSTALLATION

         This program and installation routine are contained on two
         disks.  The first disk is labeled Installation Disk, and
         contains the install program.  The other disk contains the
         program files.

         The first thing you need to do is make a copy of each
         original disk.  Once this is done, use the working copies
         that you made.  Store the original disks in a safe place.

         To install Painless Payroll, simply place the disk labeled
         'Installation Disk' in A:drive and type 'A:PINSTALL' at your
         DOS prompt.  The installation routine will walk you through
         the process step by step, so just follow the instructions on
         the screen.

         Once this is done you are ready to use Painless Payroll.  To
         start the program you must change into the subdirectory you
         created through the install process, the default is PAP.  The
         command to change to this default subdirectory is CD\PAP.
         Once you are in the subdirectory type in PAP for the 
         registered version, or PAPD for the shareware version, this
         will bring you up to the Multiple Company menu.  Select the
         company you wish to run by pressing enter or the number
         associated with the company.  Once at the main menu use the
         arrow keys to move across and down the menu or type in the
         first letter or number of your selection.

                           PAGE 3




         OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

         The following are some of the keys available throughout
         Painless Payroll.  These keys are available only when you
         need that particular information.  The keys available will
         usually be displayed on the status line.

         ESCape - Allows you to exit.  Available almost everywhere.

         F1 - Help.  This will provide you with on-line help.  This
         feature is available anywhere in the program.

         F4 - Employees.  This provides a listing of all your
         employees sorted by code.

         F5 - Departments.  This provides a listing of all departments
         sorted by code.

         F6 - Banks.  This provides a listing of all banks sorted by
         code.

         F7 - Allotments.  This provides a listing of all allotments
         sorted by code.

         F9 - Pay codes.  This provides a listing of all pay codes
         sorted by code.

         F10- Tax Tables.  This provides a listing of all tax tables
         sorted by code.

         To select options off the main menu, use the arrow keys.  You
         may also press the first letter or the number of the option,
         whichever case it may be.

         OTHER THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW

         When listing information on the screen using the function
         keys, more information is available by using the arrow keys.
         For example, if you press F4 to list the employees, you will
         see the employee code and title on the screen.  By using the
         right and left arrow keys you will see more information such
         as employee name.  This works for just about all listings on
         the screen and for reports displayed to the screen.

         Also when doing a list on the screen with a function key, you
         are able to press the first character of the code, and the
         highlight will take you to the first code that begins with

         You can press the letter 'V' and you will be taken to the

         If you are in a field requiring you to input a code and you
         do a listing to the screen, you are able to paste the code
         into the field automatically.  For example, if you are in a
         field that requires an employee code, press F4 to list the
         employees and highlight the employee you need and press
         enter.  This will paste the employee code into the field for
         you.  This should work in almost all fields that require
         input that you are able to list valid entries.

         process to create the data files for the company.  You could
         also receive this message if an invalid path is entered and
         the data files are not found.

         GENERATION

         1.  Enter Time

         This option allows you to enter additional time for each
         employee. If you wish to simply calculate regular earnings
         you do not have to enter anything in this option. For example
         if you have setup the employee with a salary of $50,000 per
         year and a Semi-Monthly pay frequency. By simply choosing
         'Generate Payroll' will calculate the gross pay will all the

         code is enter all the payment information for that employee
         will be displayed. You now have to ability to enter 
         different paycodes for this employee. How gross pay is 
         calculated depends on the employee pay type. If the employee
         is 'S'alary or 'C'ommission any information entered through 
         this routine is added to their gross pay. If the employee is
         'H'ourly any information entered through this routine becomes
         their gross pay.

                           PAGE 5




         For example if the employee is 'H'ourly and works 45 hours, 
         of which 5 are overtime. You would first enter the paycode,
         for normal time, then 40 hours at the employees normal rate.
         Next you would enter the overtime paycode with 5 hours at the
         employees overtime rate.

         If the employee was 'S'alary and you wanted to pay them a 
         $500 bonus. You would enter the bonus paycode, then 1 for
         hours and $500 for the rate. The bonus will now be added to
         the employees regular earnings.

         To add paycodes press F3, to edit paycodes press F6, and to
         delete paycodes press F8. Press escape when you have entered

         UTILITIES

         1. Color Parameters

         This option allows you to customize your screen color
         attributes.  All possible color combinations will be
         displayed with a corresponding number.  Just enter this
         number in the option you wish to change.

         Following is a brief description of each option available for
         change.

                           PAGE 16





         Standard:  This is the color of all menus and data entry
         routines.

         Enhanced:  This will be the color of the fields currently
         available for input.

         Active:  This is the color to the current field, i.e., where
         the cursor is located.

         View:  This will be the color of the screen when displaying
         lists of clients, vendors, etc.  on the screen.

         Help:  This is the color of all help panels.

         Window:  This is the windows that pop up for various input
         options.

         Status:  This will be the color of the status line displayed
         at the top of the screen at all times.

         It will then ask if you want to set the intensity off.  If
         you set the intensity off, the blocked cursor will no longer
         be in a blocked form.  It will display the colors you chose
         and ask if these are the colors you wish to use.  If you
         answer yes it will save these as your colors.  If you do not
         like the colors you have chosen answer no and it will take
         you back to the color options and you may change them.

         2. Reindex Files

         This will go through all your files and reindex them and give
         you more disk space.  For example, when you delete 
         information, this information is actually still in the file
         but it is marked as deleted.  The program will not access 
         this information but it is still there.  Reindexing will get
         get rid of all records marked as deleted and pack the other
         records together giving you more disk space.

         3. File Sizes

         This option will display how many records are used for each
         file.  The Employee file contains the employees.  The Pay
         Record file contains the information entered through the
         enter time option.  The Bank file contains the different bank
         accounts.  The NetPay file contains all the deductions and
         earnings for each employee generated.  The Department file
         contains the departments.  The Pay code file contains all the
         pay codes.  The Allotment file contains the allotments.

                           PAGE 17




         4. Printer Set up

         Select the type of printer you have.  If your printer is not
         on the list select a printer compatible to yours.  Your
         printer manual will indicate the type of printers yours will
         emulate.  If you are unable to find a printer compatible with
         yours highlight OTHER and press enter.  This will allow you
         to enter in the proper normal and condensed decimal codes for
         your printer.  These codes may be found in your printer
         manual.

         must first select the format to modify or press F2 to create
         a new format.  Once in the format, F3 will delete the line
         you are on and F4 inserts a line above the line you are on.

         Press F5 for the setup options.  This first one allows you to
         indicate the number of lines per check.  If you enter 45
         lines and only fill out the format for 40 lines, the last 5
         lines will just be blank.  The print type lets you select
         condensed or normal print.  If you select normal you have 79
         columns to use.  Condensed will give you 131 columns.  The
         draw box will let you draw double or single line boxes.

         Press F10 to display all the fields that are available to
         print on the checks.  Highlight the desired field and press
         enter and it will then be put in the format surrounded by
         upside down exclamation points.  Any text without upside
         exclamation points surrounding it will be printed as text.
         Otherwise, it will pull the information from the data files.

         Press Escape to exit.  You will then have the option to save
         your changes.  If no changes were made, this option will not
         appear.  You may create as many formats as you wish.  You
         will always have the option to select from any one of the
         formats when printing the checks or editing the formats.

         7. Backup Data Files

         This option allows you to backup your data(dbf) files without
         leaving the program.  It will copy your files into another
         subdirectory on the hard disk.  It will prompt you to enter
         in the Backup Drive and Directory.  If you enter d:\backup as
         the backup drive and directory it will copy the data files to
         the the backup directory on the D:drive.  If an invalid
         drive\directory is entered no action will be taken.

                           PAGE 18




         8. Restore Data Files

         This option will allow you to restore your data(dbf) files
         without leaving the program.  It will prompt you to enter in
         the drive and directory to restore from.  Once the files are
         restored it will reindex the files. If an invalid drive\
         directory is entered no action will be taken.

    o  The PRINTED User's Guide may not be reproduced in whole or
       in part, using any means, without the written permission
