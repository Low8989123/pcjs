## Information about "ROMEO AND JULIET 2 OF 2 (#2422 ALSO)"

    ROMEO AND JULIET is a true classic.  But was it meant for only the
    elite few who can figure out what all those words and flowery phrases
    really mean?
    
    This program, from the author of the shareware program MACBETH, proves
    that Shakespeare can actually be understood and enjoyed by the non-
    Shakespearean fan!  Geared to aid students of English literature at the
    high school level, ROMEO AND JULIET accomplishes this seemingly
    impossible trick through the use of menu-driven quizzes and games,
    notes, and a `tour' through the Globe Theatre where the plays were first
    seen by audiences.
    
    As with his other programs, the author also offers his students The
    Competition! -- a chance to win prizes of cash and computer products,
    achievable only through a close knowledge of the play.  Definitely a
    win-win program!

Did you ever really understand ROMEO AND JULIET?  This program, from the
same author of the shareware program MACBETH, proves that Shakespeare,  
for the non-Shakespearean fan, can actually be understood and enjoyed!  
Geared to aid students of English Literature at the High School level,  
ROMEO AND JULIET accomplishes the seemingly impossible through the use  
of menu-driven Quizzes and Games, Notes, and a `tour' through the Globe 
Theatre where the plays originally were presented to the audience.
