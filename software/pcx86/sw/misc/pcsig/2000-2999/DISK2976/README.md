CARPENTER'S DREAM is the construction program for contractors,
carpenters, and homeowners. Use it to measure concrete, liquids needed,
truck loads, deck material, spacing between posts and railings, stairs,
windows, cross corner lengths, estimate for easy to complex roofs, math
calculations and conversions, etc. In short, CARPENTER'S DREAM has
everything for residential construction as well as commercial and heavy
industrial applications. Measurements are expressed in feet, inches, and
fractions of an inch; and angles as pitch.

Stan Veit in Computer Shopper Magazine says about CARPENTER'S DREAM, "No
doubt this software system will do for home owners and the
home-construction industry what VisiCalc did for accountants and
business people."
