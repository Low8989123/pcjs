SECTION A - INTRODUCTION
------------------------

     Retirement Planning is becomming more and more complex due to the 
     numerous changes in Tax Laws and the differenct types of retirement
     benefits available. Social Security, Personal Savings and Business
     Retirement Programs are usually what compromise the retirement benefits
     a person gets. Now since people are living longer, retirement benefits
     are of prime importance to most individuals. A big fear is outliving
     your income benefits. To add to the problem, most retirement programs,
     includeing IRA, 401K, and other company benefit programs do not have
     a defined retirement benefit (not even considering the impact of increases
     in the cost of living), but pay benefits depending on the results of the
     investment performance of the program. Future availablility of Social 
     Security benefits are also a question. 

     Individuals are more and more responsible to insure they have sufficient
     assets to support themselves in retirement. 

     This program is designed to help you to reach your retirement goal. You
     need to know where you are and if what your doing leads to your goal.
     By using this program all these questions can be answered. You can 
     monitor your progress as ofter as you like, because you have the tool
     to do it with this program. 

     This program is always being revised because of changes in the tax laws
     and improvement suggestions from users. 

     If retirement planning is important to you, then registration of this 
     program is a valuable asset for your retirement financial planning.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION C-1 - Program Narrative Presentation
--------------------------------------------

     First Financial Software has been providing professional financial
     planning software to professionals (Financial Planners, Stockbrokers,
     Insurance Agents, CPA's, etc.) since 1982. Our commercial program, FPLAN,
     covers all aspects of personal financial planning from investments to
     insurance. Because of the need for an organized approach to financial
     planning and to make it available to more people, we have decided to
     provide various FPLAN modules as Shareware.

     This Retirement Planner module is designed to assist individuals in the
     planning of their retirement. Retirement programs, IRA's, 401K's, etc.
     require active management by the individual to be able to achieve their
     retirement goals. This program will help you do that. You will know if
     your current programs will achieve your retirement goal or if not, what
     you need to do.

     The program was designed to be easy to use, even for those who do not
     have extensive experience with computers. The program Menus encompass
     all that you need to know to perform your own retirement analysis.

     (In the Demonstration Mode, Each Menu will be preceded by an explanation
      screen)

     If you find this program useful and would like more financial planning in
     this format, we have a few suggestions and requests.

     1. Notify your Shareware Distributor to let you know when new FPLAN
        Modules are available. If you register, we will notify you also.

     2. We can provide you a printed Total Preliminary Financial Analysis.
        You would submit a completed 8 Page Questionnaire, the Order Form,
        and a $30 fee. We will process your analysis and send you a report
        followed with a telephone discussion. (See Main Utilities Option 2).
        (Also See Section C-3-2)

     3. If your a financial planning professional or would like your advisor
        to consider using the Professional FPLAN Program, order the FPLAN DEMO
        KIT (See Main Menu Option 4) (Also See Section C-4).

     4. Since there are Financial Planning Professionals using FPLAN throughout
        the US from Hawaii to New York, we can place you in contact with the
        closest FPLAN user. They would be happy to discuss financial planning
        and give suggestions for implementation of financial programs.

SECTION D - RETIREMENT PLANNER MODULE
-------------------------------------
     We will now present the Retirement Planning Module. For the Demon-
     stration Version, the data will already be noted as an example. The
     Current Situation illustrates a monthly shortage of $ 148 at retirement
     for this person to reach their retirement goal. They would need to put
     away a lump-sum of $ 17,566 or a yearly amount of $ 3,203 for 7 years to
     attain their goal. The Proposed illustration notes that just by reducing
     their tax bracket, they can reach their goal without any other changes or
     additions. (You reduce a tax bracket by repositioning taxable assets to
     tax-free or tax-deferred items.)

     For the Automatic Presentation we will only view the module screen for
     Current and Proposed Situation. You should review all the attributes and
     print the Questionnaire and Illustration from the Regular or Non-Automatic
     Demo Mode.

     For the Demonstration version you can review all the attributes and
     print the Questionnaire and Illustration with the sample numbers noted.
     For your analysis, you need to be in the REGULAR MODE. Do this by entering
     the USER CODE 1234 at Utilities Option # 1.

   You can determine which MODE the program is in two ways:

      1. The MAIN SCREEN will have ONE COLUMN OF NUMBERS for CURRENT MODE.
         It will have THREE COLUMNS (CURRENT-PROPOSED-CHANGE) for the
         CURRENT VS. PROPOSED MODE.

      2. The UTILITIES/EDIT MENU heading (OPTION 2) will state - EDITING DATA
         FOR - (Mode the program is in).

   You would ALWAYS start with the CURRENT SITUATION MODE.

   You would enter the information AS IS and NOT AS PLANNED FOR to show the
   effects after the PROPOSED has been implemented. The QUESTIONNAIRE printed
   in this MODE will be a BLANK QUESTIONNAIRE.

   PROPOSED SITUATION is used once data has been entered already for the

   CURRENT SITUATION. Proposed data will be compared with the CURRENT to
   show the effect of the change. The QUESTIONNAIRE printed in this MODE will
   print CURRENT NUMBERS on the QUESTIONNAIRE for reference.
