    Post Office) and UPS (United Parcel Service) rate and fee
    calculations.

    package, and PONY EXPRESS will show you all the available rates and
    services. If you need to compare speed vs. cost. There's a function
    to display the ETA and the cost for each level of service.
    
    Numerous USPS rate types and options are supported, such as first class
    express mail-post office to addressee, priority mail, insurance, and COD
    fees. UPS options supported include next day air, 2nd day air, ground
    service insurance, and oversize package fees.

    as
    little as 9K of RAM when used with expanded memory or disk swapping.

	____________________________________________________________
	                                        
	
	Pony Express applies to all businesses especially smaller
	ones.  This overview will help you relate it to yours.
	We realize that the subject matter is a rather dry one so as
	a reward for reading this intro, we have included several
	important tips that everyone can use.
	
	Let's face it, as businesses and individuals we all use the
	Postal Service.  Privatize it; they need more competition,
	you say?  Well I don't know how many telephone bills you get
	each month but who wants more complexity in their life.
	Let's digress for a moment.
	
	Many years ago the H&R Block company was founded here in
	Kansas City by two brothers who realized that people might
	pay money to get their taxes done rather than stand in long
	lines at the IRS offices.  Several years ago, we had a
	similar thought while standing in line at the Post Office.
	After all, the Postal Service needs just one thing from you,
	the correct postage for the service you want performed.
	
	Pony Express does just that.  For individuals or small
	businesses, it will get you out of the lines and back in
	your office.  For large businesses, it can streamline your
	mail and shipping rooms.  Pony Express is a sophisticated
	program that knows what the window clerk knows.  We call it
	"A Civil Servant in a box" Tm.
	
	Before we go on let's look at the Postal Service for what it
	really is.  Forget about the bills and junk mail they bring
	you.  It's not their fault, they were hired to do that.
	
	The U.S. Postal Service is the largest delivery system in
	the world.  The system works well and it works hard.  Even
	on holidays when you don't see your letter carrier, internal
	processing continues and it never stops.  Every day the
	system moves over 450 million pieces of mail thru 29,000
	domestic Post Offices.  They are at every address in the
	nation almost every day.
	
	And U.S. Postal rates are the lowest in the world.  The junk
	mail is analogous to a commercial on television in that it
	helps keep rates lower.
	
	No system is perfect but if you agree that for us to make
	the changes we may want is a feat similar to changing the
	rotation of the earth then it just makes good sense to learn
	more about how the system really works.

	CHAPTER 1
	____________________________________________________________
	
	
	First let's take a minute to take the mystery out of the
	Postal rate types.
	
	
	                    FOR IMPORTANT STUFF
	
	     FIRST CLASS-   Letters
	     PRIORITY MAIL- Packages       (*first class-zone rated)
	
	
	                    FOR UNIMPORTANT STUFF
	
	     THIRD CLASS-   Letters
	     FOURTH CLASS-  Packages       (*parcel post)
	
	
	*Notice that we have bracketed the old names for these
	services because you will still hear some people refer to
	them this way.
	
	The above example is an easy way to mentally keep the
	services straight but it is somewhat oversimplified.
	While you and I may think in terms of letters and packages,
	the Postal Service really just looks at weight.  Don't
	worry, Pony Express thinks the same way.  In our example, we
	use the term "Letters" because First and Third Class rates
	refer to small weights.
	
	There are also options that you can use with these rate
	types.  "Special Delivery" gets delivered to you immediately
	upon receipt at your local Post Office.  "Registry" (that's
	how the Fed moves the nation's gold supply) means that the
	item is signed for and secured every step of the way.  A
	"Return Receipt" can be returned to you showing when, where,
	and to whom the item was delivered.  "Certified Mail" gives
	you proof of mailing and of course there are others.
	
	The beauty of this system is that you pay only for the
	options you need.  In addition, the rate structures are
	based on the distance the item travels rather than a single
	fee to send anywhere.  This is referred to as "Zone-Rated".

	                                                INTRODUCTION
	____________________________________________________________
	
	
	The bad news is that not all options apply to all rate
	types.  Some options feed on others and some are exclusive.
	When you use the Pony Express program, it watches every
	keystroke and applies the rules so you can think in terms
	of:
	               "Deliver it Sunday"
	               "It's worth $400.00 - Insure it!"
	               "I want a receipt"
	                    
	Pony Express figures zones, rates, option fees, and
	automatically applies discounts.  It also blocks out
	services that don't apply to your objective.  Remember, all
	you need to do is to affix the proper postage amount to pay
	for this transaction.
	
	Maybe now you can see why Pony Express helps sell a lot of
	postage machines.  If you don't have one, stamps work just
	fine.  Before we talk about other Pony Express features,
	here are some useful tips that can help anyone using mail
	services.
	
	1. The unsung hero of the Postal Service is Priority Mail.
	Priority Mail gets delivered to major cities within two days
	and outlying locations in three.  One of our customers saves
	$35,000 a year by doing this instead of expressing weekly
	sales reports to field salesmen.  For example, two pounds
	sent by Priority Mail is only $2.40.  You can even use it
	for letters and remember it also delivers on Saturday.
	Priority Mail stickers are available free from your Post
	Office.  Your item MUST display THIS STICKER (nothing else
	counts).  With this sticker and the proper postage, your
	item will receive expeditious delivery.
	
	If you're hesitant about using this service, I suggest you
	conduct your own test using Priority Mail with a Return
	Receipt so you can monitor the actual delivery date.  Many
	large companies are already doing this.
	
	2. Don't give your outgoing mail to the letter carrier when
	they deliver yours.  They have a whole day ahead of them
	before they get back to the Post Office.  You can easily add
	a day to the delivery by making this mistake.
	
	3. Drop off mail at a drop box but only one with a posted
	schedule.  Pay attention to the schedule because they are
	strictly adhered to.  Different boxes have different
	schedules so either shop the neighborhood or call the Post
	Office for schedules if you need flexibility.

	CHAPTER 1
	____________________________________________________________
	
	
	4. Do NOT use the mail receptacles inside the Post Office.
	These do not have posted schedules so they are emptied as
	time allows.  Use the drop box outside.
	
	5. Use the morning mail for important items.  Most drop
	boxes have a morning schedule so you might consider batching
	morning mail and sending it out with someone from your
	office (early lunch, delivery person, etc.)  Here's why:
	
	Mail processing occurs in Networks (cycles), morning and
	afternoon.  After mail is collected it must be faced,
	cancelled and sorted; then it's got a plane to catch.  Many
	of the planes are commercial aircraft so your letter is
	working with the same schedule that you as a passenger do.
	Keep that in mind on your next plane trip when you hear the
	"Thud" up front.  Yep, you guessed it, the U.S. Mail is on-
	board!
	
	Remember, if it's important get it to the boxes on time
	(close doesn't count).
	
	To get the most from the Pony Express program we recommend
	that you try different transactions and experiment with
	different options on the Rate Screen.  For options or
	services that are new to you, just use the help screens.
	It's really easy and you'll see not just how smart the
	program is but also how much more you know.  Next, decide
	which services and options you want to use.  Write down any
	questions you have and contact your local Postal Customer
	Service Representative to get them resolved.
	
	From then on use the Pony Express program to figure the
	postage.  Apply the postage, make sure items are properly
	marked and use the drop box or the caller window at the Post
	Office.  Stay out of the lines, save time, and save money;
	it's that simple!
	
	And of course when you do have to go to the Post Office try
	not to giggle at the people in line, it's not polite.
	
	Basing rates on the distance moved (Zone Rating) and paying
	only for the options you need gives you both flexibility and
	the lowest cost.  We already know that from the Postal
	calculations.  One company in the private sector also uses a
	similar structure for it's services.  Because of this
	similarity we have included support for the United Parcel
	Service.  If your company uses UPS then the Pony Express
	program will save you even more time.

	CHAPTER 1

	You probably also use and will continue to use Federal
	Express or other overnight delivery service.  Unlike Zone
	Rating, rate structures are pretty much based on a one price
	ships anywhere philosophy.  They have few rules and some
	options are built into the rate.  As a result, you get a
	rate card that is easy for anyone to understand and quick to
	use.  There's not much a computer can do to simplify that.
	
	What we have done is to help you where you needed help and
	by making better use of the Postal system you use every day,
	you can save both time and frustration.  Just another way to
	make money with the PC you already own.

	OTHER APPLICATION AREAS
	
	A lot of careful planning went into the design of the Pony
	Express program.  We took much of the knowledge of corporate
	mailing and shipping rooms and joined that with an intuitive
	program interface that anyone can easily learn and use.
	
	After you try Pony Express you may quickly see that there
	are other people in your company that should also be using
	it.
	
	Let's look at a couple of fictional situations to illustrate
	where Pony Express can really pay off.
	
	
	Scenario A:
	
	Dan Smith is a marketing manager for a small manufacturing
	company.  He needs to send a 65 pound display kit to another
	city 140 miles away.  Dan tells his secretary to make sure
	it arrives in time for the business show which is in a
	couple of days.  She quickly ships it using overnight air.
	
	With Pony Express, Dan's secretary interrupts the word
	processing application on her PC and activates Pony Express.
	Not only does she get competitive overnight air rates, but
	by using the Estimated Arrival screen, she sees that the
	shipment could arrive in one day using Fourth Class or UPS
	ground service.
	
	The cost savings from this one example could justify the
	total purchase price of the Pony Express Program.  Dan's
	secretary is then able to exit Pony Express and return to
	her letter, right where she left off.

	CHAPTER 1
	____________________________________________________________
	
	
	
	Scenario B:
	
	
	Jim Stokes is an account representative for a company that
	sells micro-computer hardware by mail order.  Most of his
	sales are made over the phone.  His current customer wants
	to know the total order charges so he can prepare his check
	to cover the COD amount.  Jim tells his customer that he
	will check with the shipping department and call him right
	back.
	
	With Pony Express, Jim could have finished the order, saved
	a long distance phone call and prevented the interruption to
	the shipping department.  Transactions also work in reverse,
	so if Jim's customer was a Pony Express user, he could have
	figured the total charges by himself.
	
	
	
	With Pony Express you can:
	
	     Quickly quote shipping charges, options and delivery   
	     dates internally or to customers.
	
	     Calculate inbound charges and lead times.
	
	     Set shipping charge standards for your own products.
	
	     Charge back user departments for mail and shipping     
	     services.
	
	     Maintain UPS log books.
	
	     Audit UPS billing.
	
	     Eliminate unnecessary expediting.
	
	
	
	As you learn more about Pony Express, you will be able to
	apply it to your own situations, so let's get started.

	                                             GETTING STARTED
	____________________________________________________________
	
	
	The program distribution diskette you received already
	contains everything you need to get started.  Thanks to a
	proprietary zone compression system developed by Melisco
	Marketing, the installation program will automatically
	configure the proper zone information that is unique to your
	area.  So don't worry about zone charts or rate schedules,
	just answer a few simple questions.
	
	Prior to installing Pony Express for the first time, you
	will need to make a copy of the Pony Express program
	distribution diskette.  You should always work from the copy
	and store the original in a safe place.
	
	If you need assistance in making the copy, you should refer
	to the DOS FORMAT and DISKCOPY commands in your DOS
	reference manual.
	
	To make the proper rate calculations, Pony Express needs to
	know the ORIGIN SECTION that you ship from. The origin
	section consists of the first three digits of the zip code.
	Keep in mind that if you move your business to a different
	origin section, you will need to re-install Pony Express.
	
	NOTE- If you're in a hurry to get started, then you will be
	happy to know that during installation, the origin section
	(question 1) is the only response that does not have a
	default answer.  You can always use the installation program
	to modify your responses at a later time.  The default
	answers are adequate for most users.
	
	Even in our compressed format, the various zone information
	files take over 130K of diskette storage.  However, after
	installation, the run-time data file ("PECONFIG.DTA") that
	supports your section will take-up slightly more than 2K of
	diskette storage.  This smaller data file is the one that
	Pony Express will use during program execution.
	
	During installation you will be asked to choose the PROGRAM
	MODE.  The mode that you choose should be based on your
	frequency of use and the hardware/software configuration of
	your computer.
	
	When the Pony Express program is active (doing work for
	you), it requires approximately 133K of your computer's main
	memory.  To help you get the most from both the program and
	your machine's resources, we have included four different
	program modes to give you maximum flexibility.

	CHAPTER 2
	____________________________________________________________
	
	
	Mode A allows you to use Pony Express as a stand-alone
	program.  It will use main memory only when active.  When
	you exit the program, all of your computer's main memory is
	returned to you.  It must be loaded each time it is used,
	the same way as most word processors, spreadsheet programs,
	etc..  This should be your choice if you plan to use Pony
	Express within an "operating environment" such as Microsoft
	Windows or DESQview.
	
	Mode R will keep the program memory resident.  After it is
	loaded the first time (after power-up) you can activate it
	by pressing the "Hot Keys" (discussed later in this
	chapter).  Unlike the other three modes, mode R does not
	return memory to you, even when the program is not active.
	This is the default mode.
	
	Mode S is similar to mode R but allows you to use extended
	memory (beyond 640K) or a hard disk as a swapping media.
	When the program is not active, most of the program is
	swapped (stored) on the swapping media.
	
	All but approximately 9K of main memory is returned to you.
	If your computer does have extended memory, then using part
	of it as a VDISK (see your DOS manual) and specifying
	program mode S is an ideal choice.  If you do not have
	extended memory, you can also use a hard disk.  Although
	swapping to a hard disk results in a somewhat longer time to
	activate, it is still very acceptable for most users.
	
	Mode E can be used by users that have a LIM (Lotus, Intel,
	Microsoft) EMS memory option installed.  Operationally, it
	works like mode S.
	
	Program modes R, E, S, of the Pony Express can be unloaded
	to free-up DOS memory for use by other applications without
	re-booting the system.  You can unload the Pony Express
	program by pressing ALT+U when the program is in use.
	**IMPORTANT**  BE SURE IF YOU ATTEMPT TO UNLOAD PONY
	EXPRESS, THAT IT WAS INVOKED FROM THE DOS PROMPT AND NOT IN
	THE MIDDLE OF ANOTHER PROGRAM.  ALSO, IF YOU USE OTHER
	MEMORY RESIDENT PROGRAMS BE SURE TO UNLOAD THEM IN A LAST

	INSTALLATION QUESTIONS
	
	Much of the following information is also provided in the
	help line at the bottom of the installation screen.
	
	1.  Origin section-
	Enter the first three digits of the zip code that you will
	be shipping from.
	
	2.  Program mode (R, A, E, S)-
	
	    Enter R if you want to use as a memory resident program.
	
	    Enter A if you want to use as a stand-alone program.
	
	    Enter E if you have Lotus/Intel/Microsoft EMS memory.
	
	    Enter S if you want to swap the Pony Express program
	     from and to your hard disk or to a VDISK (virtual disk,
	     also known as a Ram disk).
	
	Note- If you choose E or S you must be using DOS 3.0 or a
	later version.
	
	3.  Monitor default color-
	If you are installing for the first time we recommend that
	you use the default values.  This is discussed in more
	detail in Chapter 3.
	
	4.  Monitor snow check-
	Some color adapters (IBM color graphics for example) flicker
	during direct screens writes.  If you encounter this problem
	then you should respond Y to this question.
	
	5.  Show first-
	When you use the Pony Express rate screen and you press the
	F1 key, the shipment configuration details will be shown for
	UPS or USPS.  This response determines which one you see
	first.  For instance, if most of the rate information that
	you need is for UPS then you would use 1.
	
	6.  Return receipt type-
	This field is used to determine which rate to use for the
	kind of return receipt you will use for USPS shipments.

	____________________________________________________________
	
	
	7.  Commercial Insurance-
	If you are a frequent shipper, then you may have your own
	insurance to cover loss or damage to the items that you
	ship.  If you do, then answer Y.  If you plan to use only
	the insurance available from UPS or USPS then respond N.
	
	8.  Deductible to insure-
	You will be asked this question only if you responded Y to
	question number 7.  If you have a deductible amount that you
	would like to insure using UPS or USPS insurance, then enter
	that amount.  Whole dollars are assumed, so use the decimal
	point for fractional dollars.
	
	After you have completed the above questions, you will be
	asked if you have any changes.  Any response other than N
	will take you back to question number 1.
	
	
	SELECTING THE "HOT KEYS"
	
	If you selected R, E, or S as your program mode then you
	will be asked to select a hot key.  This is the combination
	of keys that you will press to activate (call up) the Pony
	Express program.  Your Hot Key selection should be one of
	the following.
	
	          Alt- A thru Z (except U or C)
	          Alt- 0 thru 9 or - or =
	          Alt- F1 thru F10
	          Shift- F1 thru F10
	
	Also make sure that you use keys that do not conflict with
	other memory resident programs that you own.
	
	NOTE- You will be asked this question twice in succession to
	verify that you are satisfied with your selection.
	
	
	DISK SWAPPING INFORMATION
	
	If you selected S as your program mode, then you will be
	asked for the drive and directory to use for disk swapping.
	Just press enter if you want to use the default.  If you
	have a VDISK with space available, it would be an ideal
	choice.  It is also possible to use diskette storage but
	this will result in poor performance.

	____________________________________________________________
	
	
	
	USING PONY EXPRESS
	
	
	Each time you power-up or re-boot your PC, you will need to
	load the Pony Express program into main memory prior to
	using it.
	
	PROGRAM INITIALIZATION
	
	In order to load (initialize) the program:
	
	NOTE- If you just finished installation, you may skip the
	next paragraph.
	
	The installed drive should be the default drive.  If you
	installed Pony Express on the diskette make sure that it is
	in the default drive.  Hard disk users should make sure that
	they are in the root directory.  If you are not sure then
	type CD\ and press the Return key.
	
	
	Type: PE
	
	Press: RETURN
	
	It will take a few seconds for the program to load and
	structure its configuration data.  If you selected mode A
	(stand-alone) as the program mode, then you will already see
	the Data Entry screen.  If you selected a mode other than
	mode A, then pay particular attention to the box at the
	bottom of your screen.  Any errors encountered during
	initialization will show-up there.  If you have error
	messages you can refer to appendix A.
	
	
	ACTIVATE PONY EXPRESS (applies to program modes R, E, S)
	
	Once you have initialized the program, you may call it up
	anytime (provided enough memory is available) by pressing
	the "Hot Keys" that you specified during installation.  If
	you just finished installation you should press them now.
	Keep in mind that the "Hot Keys" also act as a toggle to
	take you immediately back to your previous application from
	any Pony Express screen.

	____________________________________________________________
	
	
	MOVING BETWEEN SCREENS
	
	There are three layers of screens that support the Pony
	Express program.  By pressing F2 (function key 2), you can
	move forward from the Data Entry screen to the Rate screen.
	Press F2 again and you will move to the Estimated Arrival
	screen.  To go back to a previous screen, just press ESC
	(Escape key).
	
	NOTE- By pressing the ESC key when you are at the Data Entry
	screen, you will exit from Pony Express and return to your
	previous task.
	
	
	
	ADJUSTING THE SCREEN
	
	The screen may be adjusted to display in one of three
	different vertical positions.  This can be useful if you
	need to see information from a background screen.  Example-
	You've called up Pony Express from an order entry
	application and you need to see the ship-to zip code.  You
	can make this adjustment by pressing CTRL+PAGE UP or
	CTRL+PAGE DOWN.  This can be done at anytime as long as you
	are not in help mode.
	
	
	CHANGING SCREEN COLORS
	
	To change the screen background and text colors you must:
	
	Be at the Data Entry screen.
	
	All data entry fields should be cleared.  You can press F3  
	to do this.
	
	Press ALT+C.  The cursor will disappear indicating that you
	are in color change mode.

	____________________________________________________________
	
	
	
	Use the CURSOR UP/CURSOR DOWN keys to change the text color.
	Then, use the PAGE UP/PAGE DOWN keys to change the
	background color.  NOTE- Most monochrome monitors will not
	change with each key press so a little experimentation is
	necessary.
	
	NOTE- The color number that you have selected will show at
	the bottom of the Data Entry screen.  If you want to make
	this change permanently, then write this number down and use
	it as the monitor default color in the installation program.
	The change that you just made will stay in effect as long as
	the program resides in memory.
	
	Press the ESC key to select the color.  The cursor will then
	return to normal.

	DATA ENTRY FIELDS
	
	The left side of the Data Entry screen contains the
	following fields:
	
	To Section- (always required)
	
	You should enter the first three digits of the zip code that
	you are shipping to.  Sections are always checked for
	validity.
	
	Weights- Lbs or Ozs (always required)
	
	Enter the shipping weight in pounds or ounces or both
	(example 5 lbs, 2 ozs).  Valid pounds are between 0 and 70
	and valid ounces are between 0 and 16. The maximum total
	weight for a shipment must not exceed 70 pounds.
	
	Declared Value- (optional)
	
	Used for insurance fees and Registered Mail fees.  This
	should be the market value or replacement cost of the
	shipment.  The program uses this field to determine the fee
	for the amount of UPS and USPS insurance that you require.
	If during installation you responded Y to the commercial
	insurance question, then it will calculate the fees based on
	the Deductible to Insure, instead of the entire Declared
	Value.  Values up to $25,000.00 are supported.  Whole
	dollars are assumed.  Use the decimal point for fractional
	values.
	
	Note- In order to use Registered Mail, the Declared Value
	field must contain a value greater than zero.
	
	COD amount- (optional)
	
	This is the amount to be collected from the recipient at the
	time the shipment is delivered.  This amount should exclude
	freight.  The Rate Screen provides a separate column (Total
	COD) which totals this amount plus any shipping fees.
	Values up to $25,000.00 are supported.  Whole dollars are
	assumed.  Use the decimal point for fractional values.

	OPTION KEY STATUS
	
	
	The right side of the Data Entry screen shows the current
	status (Off or On) of the Option keys, these keys are
	explained in detail later in the chapter 5 section titled
	"Rate Screen".
	
	
	
	FUNCTION KEYS ACTIVE
	
	
	F5 - F10 are discussed in the "Rate Screen" chapter.
	
	F1- The help mode, shows a brief description of each data
	entry field.  Once you are in the help mode you may use the
	PAGE UP/PAGE DOWN keys to scroll information.  To exit help
	mode press the ESC key.
	
	F2- May be pressed anytime after a valid Section and Weight
	have been entered.  This performs the rate calculations and
	displays the Rate Screen.
	
	F3- Will reset all data entry fields to zero and return the
	status of any active option keys (F5 - F10) to Off.
	
	Remember- To exit the Pony Express program and return to
	your previous task just press the ESC key.

	____________________________________________________________
	
	
	RATE SCREEN
	
	Note- To access the Rate screen you must have already
	entered a valid section and weight on the Data Entry screen,
	then pressed F2.
	
	Pony Express will have already performed automatic zone
	lookup and rate calculations.  It will also have considered
	weight and optional insurance or COD requirements of your
	transaction.  For services that don't meet your objective,
	the rates will be flagged as -n/a- (not available).  If you
	choose additional options on this screen, Pony Express will
	continue to apply the rules, blocking inappropriate rates
	and determining the correct rates and fees.  The chargeable
	amount for each service is shown in the Basic Cost column.
	
	The Rate Screen also shows zone information (ZN) which is a
	real timesaver for anyone responsible for keeping a UPS log
	book.
	
	To the right of the Basic Cost column is the Total COD
	column.  This is the total of the COD amount that you
	entered on the Data Entry screen, plus the shipping
	charges that have been calculated for that service.  This
	column will also be flagged -n/a- if a particular shipping
	rate no longer applies.
	
	
	
	OPTION KEY MATRIX
	
	The right half of the Rate Screen is a matrix showing the
	Option keys available, not available, and in-use for each of
	the services. Three different characters are used in the
	matrix:
	
	 .  means that the option does not apply to this
	type of service.
	
	 -  means that the option does apply to this
	service but it is not currently being used.
	
	 + means that the option does apply to this service
	and it is currently in use.

	CHAPTER 5
	____________________________________________________________
	
	
	You can toggle the options On or Off by pressing the
	Option keys (F5-F10).  They are labeled above the column
	heading.  When an option is toggled On, two things happen:
	
	The Basic Cost and Total COD columns will now include the
	fee for this service.  The + will be shown in the
	appropriate Option column.
	
	Any service that does not support an option that you have
	selected will be flagged as -n/a-.
	
	
	
	By setting the Option keys, you are letting Pony Express
	guide you to the rates that are valid for your shipment.
	This helps take the guesswork out of what rate to use and
	when to use it.
	
	
	
	SHIPPING INFORMATION WINDOW
	
	This important feature shows all of the details of the
	current shipment.
	
	The Shipping Information Window is the first thing you see
	when you press the help (F1) key.  There are actually two
	windows, one for UPS and the other is used for USPS
	information.  Once you are in help mode you can:
	
	Press F1 again to see the second Shipping Information
	Window.  NOTE- If rates for both USPS and UPS are available,
	the first one that you see (when you press F1 the first
	time) is determined by your response to the "Show First"
	question during installation.  Example- A user who ships
	mostly with UPS would have responded with a 1 to the "Show
	First" question during installation.  As long as a UPS rate
	is available, the UPS Shipping Information Window would
	always appear first when F1 is pressed.
	
	
	Press keys 1-9, F5-F10.  Since you are in help mode you can
	use these keys to display help information about a service
	or option.
	
	To exit the help mode, press the ESC key.

	OPTION KEY - COLUMN HEADINGS
	
	Lg/P  (Oversize Package)
	When you choose this option, you should have a specific rate
	in mind.  Examples of oversize packages are:
	
	Priority Mail- A parcel weighing less than 15 pounds and
	measuring over 84" in length and girth.
	
	Fourth Class- A parcel weighing more than 35 pounds or more
	than 34" in length or more than 17" in width or height.  You
	should also use this option if you are shipping an item that
	is high in density (a paint can etc.), using Fourth Class
	mail.
	
	All UPS Rates- A parcel weighing less than 25 pounds and
	over 84" in length and girth.
	
	
	Rr/Ak (Return Receipt/Acknowledgment of delivery)
	
	This will add in the fee for a proof of delivery document
	that is to be returned to you when your shipment has been
	delivered to the recipient.
	
	The USPS Return Receipt is available in two types.  Both of
	them show to whom and when delivered, but only one shows the
	actual address where delivered.  The fee that Pony Express
	includes in the basic cost depends on which type (Return
	Receipt Type) that you specified during installation.
	
	The UPS Acknowledgment of Delivery (AOD) fee will be added
	into the applicable UPS Basic Cost when this option is
	selected.
	
	Sp-D (Special Delivery)
	The USPS special delivery fee will be included in the Basic
	Cost for rates that support this option.
	
	Sp-Hd (Special Handling)
	The USPS special handling fee will be included in the Basic
	Cost for rates that support this option.

	Cert (Certified Mail)
	The USPS certified mail fee will be included in the Basic
	Cost for rates that support this option.  Certified Mail
	provides the mailer with a receipt when the item is mailed.
	
	Regr (Registered Mail)
	The USPS registered mail fee will be included in the Basic
	Cost for rates that support this option.  Registered mail
	provides tracking for a shipment from acceptance to
	delivery.  To calculate the registered mail fee, Pony
	Express uses the entire Declared Value of the shipment.  The
	USPS insurance requirement is based on that same value
	unless you responded Y to the commercial insurance
	questions during installation.  If you did, then the
	insurance requirement is based on an amount up to the
	Deductible to Insure that you specified.
	
	
	FUNCTION KEYS ACTIVE
	
	F1- Pressing this key will put you in the help mode.  When
	you initially enter help mode, the first thing shown is the
	the Shipping Information Window.
	
	F2- Allows you to move to the next screen (Estimated
	Arrival).
	
	F3- Clears (turns off) any of the Option keys that are
	currently selected (toggled on).
	This works the same way as toggling off the individual
	option.  NOTE- Any fees associated with the Option keys are
	backed out of the Basic Cost and Total COD fields.  Also,
	any rates that were flagged -n/a- because of these options
	will be restored to their normal state.

	____________________________________________________________
	
	
	
	ESTIMATED ARRIVAL SCREEN
	
	This screen was developed to help you estimate how long your
	shipment will be in transit.  This can be very useful for
	zone-rated services such as UPS ground or USPS Priority Mail
	or Fourth Class.  There is a tendency sometimes to use an
	expedited service rather than taking the time to make our
	own estimations.  Frequent shippers usually make some quick
	mental calculations, but allowing for such variables as
	week-ends or the fact that the shipment may not go out for a
	couple of days, can make this a very difficult task.  Zone
	rated services give you the most for your shipping dollar
	because the rates are structured around the actual distance
	moved.
	
	When you are working with very tight delivery dates then you
	will probably want to use services such as USPS Express Mail
	or UPS Next Day Air or UPS 2nd Day Air.  These services are
	built around expedited delivery requirements.  Certainly,
	this costs more but if you're currently using these services
	then you already know how competitive they are with the rest
	of the industry.
	
	REMEMBER- YOU SHOULD ALWAYS ASK YOURSELF:
	
	     How much delivery flexibility do I have?
	
	     How far is the shipment going to travel?
	
	If you do that, you're in for some pleasant surprises.
	
	
	
	ESTIMATED ARRIVAL - THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW
	
	It may seem at first that estimating delivery is similar to
	predicting the weather.  To a certain extent that is true,
	otherwise there wouldn't be as much of a market for
	expedited services.  However, there are consistencies in
	work schedules, flight schedules, and truck routes that

	CHAPTER 6
	____________________________________________________________
	
	
	
	
	Pony Express goes way beyond rough distance calculations.
	It also makes allowances for such things as week-end pick-
	ups, delivery, and movement.  It is also Option key
	sensitive, so things like special delivery will improve the
	schedule.
	
	There are a couple of things to keep in mind.  First, the
	Estimated Arrival Screen makes no allowances for holidays.
	Secondly, it will let you use Sunday as a shipping day for
	USPS, unless you have chosen Option keys, COD or insurance
	that would require some mailers to go to the post office.
	Since the postal window is not open, we move your shipping
	day to Monday.  Without these exceptions, we assume the item
	is small and can be put in a collection box.  Sure it's
	common sense, but we thought you should know.  As long as
	you don't get "analysis paralysis" and use some common
	sense, we believe you will find that the Estimated Arrival
	Screen is a great tool to help you get more from
	your shipping dollars.
	
	
	SCREEN LAYOUT
	
	You can get to the Estimated Arrival Screen by pressing F2
	at the Rate Screen.  Looking at the Estimated Arrival
	Screen, you will notice that the left-most portion of the
	screen shows the same Basic Cost information as the Rate
	Screen. To the right of the Basic Cost column there are
	eleven column headings showing both the day of the week and
	the date.  The first column is always assumed to be the day
	that the shipment is ready to leave.
	
	
	THE SYMBOLS
	
	There are three different types of symbols used to show the
	estimated arrival:
	
	|  Used to show the day the shipment is able to
	leave your location.  Normally this will show under the
	left-most day/date column unless it must be moved forward to
	allow for Sat/Sun etc.
	
	>  This symbol always represents the most probable
	delivery day.

	                                    ESTIMATED ARRIVAL SCREEN
	____________________________________________________________
	
	
	[ ]  Used to show a range of delivery days with
	equal probability.  The left bracket means "from" and the
	right indicates "to".
	
	Dashes are used to connect these symbols along the
	horizontal line.
	
	VARYING THE SHIP DATE
	
	When you use the Pony Express program the first time
	(after loading the program into memory) the left-most
	day/date column will show today's day/date (providing the
	system date has been properly set).  Since the left-most
	column is always assumed to be the day available for
	shipment, this would indicate that it is ready for shipment
	today.  Many times, this will not be the case.  It could be
	too late in the day or you may need a day or two to process
	an order.
	
	By using the CURSOR RIGHT key, you can move the ship date
	forward up to 10 days.  Once you have advanced the ship
	date, you can backup 1 day at a time by using the CURSOR
	LEFT key or use F3 to immediately get back to today.
	Once you move the ship date forward it will stay there
	unless you specifically change it.

	APPENDIX A - ERROR MESSAGES
	
	
	DURING INSTALLATION
	
	
	Files are missing from the program disk-
	
	One or more files on the program disk has been corrupted.
	You should use the distribution copy of the program disk to
	make a new working-copy and then restart the installation
	procedure.
	
	
	Invalid drive spec-
	
	The drive letter that has been entered on the DOS command
	line is invalid.
	
	
	
	DURING INITIALIZATION
	
	
	Configuration file not available-
	
	The configuration file ("PECONFIG.DTA") must be located in
	the default directory.  If the file has been accidentally
	erased, you can re-run the installation program to create a
	new one.
	
	
	Error in SWAP file creation-
	
	You have selected S as your program mode and the drive that
	you specified as your swap drive doesn't have enough
	available space.  You should select a different drive,
	program mode or you should free-up space on the current swap
	drive.  There should be approximately 254K available on the
	swap drive.
	
	
	Not enough EMS memory available-
	
	You will probably want to select a different program mode.

	Either upgrade to a later version of DOS or select a

	____________________________________________________________
	
	
	
	APPENDIX B - PROGRAM COMPATIBILITY
	
	
	These considerations apply when you are using Pony Express
	in program modes R, E, S.
	
	
	SIDEKICK USERS-
	
	You should always load (initialize) the Pony Express program
	before you load Sidekick.  As with any memory resident
	program, you should make sure that there is no "Hot Key"
	conflict between the programs.
	
	
	LOTUS USERS-
	
	Lotus 1-2-3 release 1A does not use the BIOS to set the
	video mode.  This causes a problem for any memory resident
	program (including Lotus Metro) that attempts to save the
	Lotus screen.  Pony Express will operate correctly; however,
	it will not be able to properly restore the Lotus screen.
	This situation does not occur in newer versions of Lotus 1-
	2-3.
