track of your income and expenses?  MONEY WATCH can do this for you,    
by functioning like an electronic checkbook.  You enter income and      
expenses in the same manner as you would in your regular checkbook.     
Each entry consists of date, description/check#, category, and amount.  
MONEY WATCH sorts new and changed entries into the proper order based on
their date, and at the same time, will recalculate the balances, all    
with the push of a single key.                                          
                                                                        
MONEY WATCH can help you to estimate your future income needs.  By      
entering future income and expenses, you will be able to "look into

expected income.  Four types of printed reports are provided, by date   
and category, that can be used for your tax records.
