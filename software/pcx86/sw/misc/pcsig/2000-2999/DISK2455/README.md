## Information about "WINDOWS BOARD GAMES"

    This program is a sliding tile PUZZLE game that you can play with the
    mouse or keyboard.  In order to complete a scrambled image, the player
    slides tiles up and down or sideways.  The first tiles are easy to
    place, but as you get to the last tiles, it becomes harder.  There are
    three levels of play to keep you interested, and new images can be
    imported to make new puzzles.
    
    Nothing fancy about this one, it's just good old fashioned CHECKERS.
    But now you have a computer partner to help you pass an idle afternoon.
    The game can be played with either one player or two, and it has five
    levels of difficulty.
    
    TAIPEI is an ancient oriental game of skill and chance.  The game is
    played on a board and the object is to remove matching tiles.  It is
    much harder than it sounds as the board can be up to five tiles deep,
    and you will not always have a matching tile easily available.  The game
    has two modes, easy and expert.  Beginners will appreciate the hint
    function to get them going, and experts can play the more than 60,000
    different game boards for a real challenge.  You can also save your
    game so you can play at a later time.
