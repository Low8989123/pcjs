## Information about "THE ORDER PRO"

    If you run a mail order business, you know how important it is to track
    your daily operations.  Here's a menu-driven program that's
    specifically designed to completely automate the mail order business.
    This program is the successor to the earlier OFFICE PRO.  It offers a
    complete range of features including dBASE compatibility, order entry,
    inventory control, mailing labels, invoices, packing slips, accounts
    receivable, vendor tracking, financial reports, sales tracking
    reports, inventory reports, and back order reports.
    
    THE ORDER PRO comes with a succinct five-page ``getting started''
    manual.  It clearly directs the startup and walks you through the
    beginning steps. Whether your business is seasoned or just getting
    started, THE ORDER PRO can offer the kind of help that makes a
    computer pay for itself in time, money, and ease of use.
