Special Requirements: 640K RAM, and a hard drive. 80286 or better recomm
                                                                        
The SELL MORE SOFTWARE program is a personal computer system designed to
facilitate the marketing, sales, and administrative activities involved 
in selling computer software.  Created specifically for software        
developers and value-added re-sellers, the program helps to plan        
projects, track contact with prospects and clients, track support, and  
print custom letters and forms.                                         
                                                                        
The program saves you time by simplifying many routine tasks.  For      
example, when you enter a client's order, the program makes it easy to  
create a product label, mailing label, and invoice.  The revenue        
information is then passed to the general ledger module.                
                                                                        
The program's extensive set of reports help you to review trends in     
sales and support, plan future projects, control expenses, and manage   
your time more effectively.                                             
                                                                        
The SELL MORE SOFTWARE program is part of the Droege Software Series, a 
complete line of information management programs.  Some of the important
features are :                                                          
                                                                        
~ Complete contact histories.  The clients and prospects file maintains 
a record of each contact, thus preventing you from forgetting a client  
or his needs.                                                           
                                                                        
~ Next marketing step.  The program keeps track of the next contact date
for each client, thus assuring that you always know when to make the    
next call or send the next letter.                                      
                                                                        
~ Software support tracking.  The support record tracks support for each
client.  The separate error tracking record lets you keep up with       
problems and solutions.                                                 
                                                                        
~ Project planning.  The project planning module helps you track hours  
spent and status of each project.  It also helps to monitor expenses    
with the cost analysis report.                                          
                                                                        
~ Mail merge.  The mail merge feature automatically merges name and     
address records with your own letters.  The ability to rate your        
prospects simplifies mass mailings.  Laser fonts are supported, thus    
permitting high quality output.                                         
                                                                        
~ Reports.  The program's reports help you to manage your sales,        
marketing, and administrative functions.  Reports are listed in the     
functional checklist.                                                   
                                                                        
~ Flexibility.  The SELL MORE SOFTWARE program can be customized to fit 
your company's particular needs.
