The utilities solve many time-value financial problems encountered in   
business.  Typical problems are distribution of funds from a sum, money 
growth with or without deposits, IRA's, and many types of simple and    
complex loans.  The Selection Guide steers the Pelton user to the       
appropriate financial utility to make it easy to get a quick and        
accurate answer for almost any unknown quantity.  Full and abbreviated  
professional-looking schedules may be displayed or printed.  The program
is amazingly fast and truly easy to use.  A things-to-do list manager   
which you'll find useful, helpful, convenient, and fun is also included.
