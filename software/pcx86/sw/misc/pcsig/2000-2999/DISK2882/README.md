Disk Title: Crystal Caves                                               
PC-SIG Version: S1.01                                                   
                                                                        
Program Title: Crystal Caves                                            
Author Version: 1.0                                                     
Author Registration: $15.00 per volume/$30.00 per set                   
Special Requirements: 640K RAM, EGA, and a hard drive or 1.2 drive.     
                                                                        
Enter an underground world of treasures and traps.  This colorful EGA   
game rivals any commercial game with its arcade quality, puzzles and    
graphics. As Mylo Steamwitz, you'll enter cave after cave of adventure, 
gathering the treasures of each, while evading hazards galore!  CRYSTAL 
CAVES features the smoothest animated graphics ever seen in an Apogee   
game.                                                                   
                                                                        
The game begins with Mylo rocketing to the Altairian star system on a   
simple treasure hunt.  But what happens is far more dangerous than even 
Mylo bargained for.  He enters an underground world of chambers full of 
alien technology and traps.  Strange alien creatures and robots inhabit 
the caves, protecting the priceless crystals from money-greedy          
explorers.                                                              
                                                                        
Variety is evident in CRYSTAL CAVES.  On some levels Mylo will even walk
up-side-down!  Other levels have such low gravity that the recoil from  
Mylo's laser pistol can knock him into other dangers!  Some levels are  
without lights, and others are packed full of falling hammers,          
egg-dropping alien bats, free roaming slither eyes, web-shooting alien  
spiders, and much, much more.  Each level has all new graphics!         
                                                                        
There are three unique episodes to the CRYSTAL CAVES saga: "The Trouble 
with Twibbles" (shareware), "Slugging it Out", and "Mylo Verses the     
Supernova". Each episode has a unique story twist and graphics.  Can you
help Mylo strike it rich and quit his day job?                          
                                                                        
Each episode of CRYSTAL CAVES is $15, or you can order (and register)   
all three episodes for just $30.  As an incentive to ordering all three 
volumes, you'll also get the hints sheet, the cheat codes, and new      
bonus games from Apogee.  Plus, you'll be able to call the CRYSTAL CAVES
hints line or mail questions to Apogee for assistance.
