## Information about "TREETOP"

    This is a multi-functional hard disk file and directory manager that
    provides an easy-to-use interface to DOS commands. A tree structured
    graphic image of the disk directory structure is first displayed when
    running TREETOP, then a point-and-shoot user interface is used to
    execute commands and navigate through the hard disk. It's fast and
    user-friendly, featuring pull-down menus, on-line context-sensitive
    help, a user-installable setup and full mouse support.
    
    TREETOP helps you organize your files and directories so you can
    easily maintain your hard disk. You can rapidly search, sort, rename,
    add, delete or view files and directories with single key commands. The
    pull-down menus make changing the date/time stamp or file
    attributes easy. Files can be tagged by directory, filename, date/
    time, file attributes, entire logical hard drive, or any combination of
    these items. Once selected as a group, you can mass copy, print, sort,
    delete, or move these files from directory to directory or disk to disk.
    
    Temporarily shell to DOS, or execute any .COM, .EXE, or .BAT file on
    your drive from within TREETOP. The user-installable setup provides a
    means for entering the name of your favorite text editor so TREETOP can
    automatically run your editor when you choose to edit a file.

                             TREETOP INSTALLATION

     This installation describes how to load TreeTop onto your hard disk
     drive and modify your AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that it will run at its
     optimum performance.  TreeTop consists of three files that should be
     on your hard disk drive for proper operation and two other files that
     you may want to include for easy reference.  These files are listed
     below with a brief explanation for each of them:

               1) TT.EXE      - This is the main executable file that is run
                                when you execute TreeTop.
               2) TREETOP.HLP - This is the file that contains the online,
                                context sensitive help for TreeTop.  If this 
                                file is not on your hard disk drive, TreeTop 
                                will still operate properly, but you won't 
                                have any online help.
               3) TREETOP.PAR - This file contains the user defined setup
                                parameters for TreeTop.  It is not supplied 
                                on the master disk because it is created 
                                automatically by TreeTop when you save the 
                                setup parameters.
               4) TREETOP.DOC - This is a text file that has a copy of the
                                Purchase/License, Warranty, Ordering
                                Information, Order Form, and Installation 
                                Instructions.
               5) README.TXT  - This file contains the latest information on
                                TreeTop that may not be reflected in the 
                                bound manual.

     There are two requirements that must be met for TreeTop to operate
     properly on your computer. You must first copy the file TT.EXE to a
     directory on your hard disk drive that is included in the global path
     variable.  That will insure the execution of TreeTop from anywhere on
     your system.  The second requirement is that you set up an
     environment variable that instructs TreeTop to find its help
     (TREETOP.HLP) and parameter (TREETOP.PAR) files in the correct
     directory.

     The easiest way to accomplish this is to create a directory on your
     hard disk drive called TREETOP, then copy all of the above files to
     that directory.  You must also edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to include
     the directory TREETOP in the path command and set an environment
     variable that tells TreeTop where to find its files.  You can do this
     by following the steps outlined below:

               1)   Choose the drive on which you wish to install TreeTop. 
                    The following example assumes drive C:.
               2)   Now create the TREETOP directory by using the 
                    "make directory" DOS command, MD.  Note: After each 
                    command listed below, press <ENTER> to execute.
                        MD C:\TREETOP
               3)   You can now copy all the files from your master floppy to
                    the TREETOP directory using the DOS copy command.  If 
                    your master disk is in floppy drive A:, type
                        COPY A:*.* C:\TREETOP

                           TREETOP INSTALLATION cont.


               4)   You must also edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that each 
                    time you boot the computer TreeTop will know where to 
                    find its help and parameter files.  To do this, include 
                    the following line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
                         SET TREETOP=C:\TREETOP
               5)   The last thing you must do is edit the path command in 
                    your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to include the directory, 
                    C:\TREETOP;   in the path variable.

     You should reboot your computer when you have completed the above
     five steps.  After rebooting, you can run TreeTop by simply typing TT
     from anywhere on your system.  If you have setup TreeTop properly, the 
     TreeTop registration screen will no longer appear automatically each
     time you execute TreeTop.

     Note:  You should only edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file in a non- document
     ASCII mode (also known as DOS ASCII or text mode.) If you are not
     familiar with your autoexec.bat file or how to edit it, you should
     read your DOS manual and/or get some help from a knowledgeable
     person.  Most editors or word processors provide a way to edit files
     like autoexec.bat.  Check your editor or word processor manual if you
     are not sure.


                              INSTALLING A MOUSE 

     To use your mouse with TreeTop, you must first load the standard
     Microsoft (or Microsoft compatible) mouse driver.  There are
     typically two different ways to load a mouse driver.  The first and
     most common way is to include a line in your CONFIG.SYS file that
     instructs the operating system to load the mouse driver every time
     you boot.  The other way is to execute a .COM file from the system
     prompt or from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file that loads the mouse driver. 
     See the manual that accompanied your mouse for specific instructions
     on how to load your mouse driver.
