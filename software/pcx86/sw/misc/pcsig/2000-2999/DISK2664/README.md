Disk No: 2664
Disk Title: Pilot
PC-SIG Version: S1

Program Title: PILOT
Author Version: 1.1
Author Registration: $25.00
Special Requirements: A modem.

This is a good, fully funtional communcation program. With it you can
call other PC's, BBSs, information services (CompuServe), or main frames
to upload and download files.  PILOT also allows you to have your PC
receive calls.

This version of PILOT V1.1 contains the following features:

~ On-screen help features.  Function keys are defined on-screen.

~ ANSI Terminal Emulation.

~ Upload and Download file capabilities.

~ Supports the major file transfer protocols including XModem, XModem
  1K, YModem, YModem-g, YModem-g Batch, and Kermit.

~ Dump any incoming data directly to the printer at the same time the
  data information is being displayed to the screen.

~ Dump any incoming data directly to hard or floppy disks at the same
  time the information is being displayed to the screen.  The program
  gives you the ability to create different file names for the
  information that you are saving.

~ Supports the major extended modems such as Hayes,
  US Robotics HST, Telebit, MultiTech, GVC SM-96, Generic and others.

~ Supports Baud Rates from 150 to 38.4k.

~ The option to operate under a TSR (Terminate Stay Resident).  The TSR
  capability allows PILOT to pop-up on top of most applications on the
  market.  The software program you were running is frozen until you
  exit PILOT.  Example: If you are working on a Lotus spreadsheet, you
  have the capability to load PILOT without leaving Lotus, transfer or
  receive files and then return to Lotus without actually exiting the
  Lotus program.

~ Complete Host and Remote capabilities:
  1.  Answer calls.
  2.  Upload and download files.
  3.  Show files with wildcard capabilities in the current
      directory.
  4.  List sub-directories.
  5.  Change directories.
  6.  Make new directories.
  7.  Chat on-line with Host service.

~ Ability to emulate a BBS and receive calls.  Your PC can be left on to
  wait for a call from another PC, or a main frame.

~ Supports up to 9 serial ports (1 at a time).
