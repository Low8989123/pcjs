THE HOME AND BUSINESS LEGAL GUIDE AND FORMS GENERATOR is really three   
programs in one: It custom prepares legal documents from on-screen      
interviews, contains the full annotated text of important laws and      
regulations, and provides many nuts and bolts explanations of the law.  
                                                                        
Users can prepare more than 150 different custom legal forms for        
personal, business, real estate, estate planning, and living trust use, 
all of which have been written by an attorney/consumer advocate.        
Monthly data updates and FREE upgrades for one year are available to all
registered users.  The program prepares legal forms specifically for    
your needs based on answers to on-screen questions.                     
                                                                        
This program also features instructional tutorials that explain various 
legal problems in an easy-to-understand way. In addition, the tutorials 
feature an on-line dictionary and the ability to examine both full text 
of the laws and the explanation on screen.
