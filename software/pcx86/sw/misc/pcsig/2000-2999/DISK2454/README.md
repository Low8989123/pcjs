1.  General System Concepts

        The Church Visitation system (CVS) is designed to help you keep
        track of all your contacts.

        Within the Visitation System, you simply enter all your people.
        Each time a visit is made you can record the visit, or contact,
        along with pertinent information, and notes about the visit.


           ********************************************************


2.  What Happens On Each Screen.

        2.  Print Documentation - prints this documentation file.

        3.  Print Order Form - prints an order form.

    b.  Contacts Database

        1.  Overview

            The contacts database is a file of all your contacts.  They
            should be entered into the file by LAST NAME then FIRST NAME.

            Example:  Byxbe, Ronald

            This will insure that they display in alphabetical order.

        2.  Menu Keys

            e. Edit - allows you to change information about the contact.

               by entering part of the contacts name.

SELECT ==> s. Select - this will display all the visitation records for
               this contact.  If no records are found then a screen will
               be displated asking if you would like to add a new record.

               This option can also be selected by press the ENTER KEY.

               particular visit or contact.  This is generally were

               Help - displays a help screen.


            t. Tag - The tag option will tag certain records to be
               printed.  Only the records tagged will print.  There
               are three options when using the tag.  Current, All,
               and Selected.

               Selected Tag.  On this screen you will select certain
               fields to be tagged.  If you wish to ignore a certain
               field the leave the field blank.  Date fields are
               initialized to 01/01/80.  This is considered to be
               blank.

               After you have tagged the records you desire you
               can select the print option.

    e.  ReIndex Data Files

        This option should be taken if you delete a lot of records over
        a period of time.  "A Lot" can be defined several ways.  We will
        define it as 10% of the database or 10 to 50 records.

        The ReIndex option will remove all deleted records from the file
        and place the file back into sorted order.

    f.  Edit System Record

        This option is used to record the Name, Address, City of
        your church.  It is also where you input your monitor type.

3.  Problem/Error Resolution

    a.  System Locks up while loading
    b.  Error 100
    c.  Error 212
    d.  Corrupted Index File

    Correction to the above errors can be done by deleting all the index
    files for the program.  The system will rebuild the index files the
    next time you call it up.

    To delete the index files simply do the following.

    ===>  Go to the directory where you loaded the program

          cd\cvs    if cvs is the directory

    ===>  Delete all index files

          DEL *.IN?  <enter>

    ===>  Call up the program
