Disk No: 2693
Disk Title: BatchMaker Plus #2 of 2
PC-SIG Version: S1.1

Program Title: BatchMaker Plus
Author Version: 2.44
Author Registration: $27.95
Special Requirements: 384K RAM, Dos 3.0+, hard disk drive, CGA or better

BATCHMAKER PLUS has the convenience and versatility you've been looking
for in a hard disk management system, and at the right price.  This
action-packed software includes a menu-driven full screen editor for
building and changing batch files.  Cut and paste (even to and from
other files) and perform text searches.

Making batch files is simpler than you may think and using just three
DOS commands in your batch file will run most of your programs.

BATCHMAKER PLUS provides a complete DOS utility function with a double
directory menu display, similar to Norton Commander.  Manage your hard
disk with the press of a button -- Copy, Rename, Move, Erase, MkDir, and
RmDir.  Select and execute programs from the directory listing as well
as change a file's attributes, view text and binary files, and display
system information.  Disk functions can be selected from the menu --
Format, Chkdsk, Diskcopy, and Diskcomp.  There's even a pop-up DOS Quick
Reference so you never need to refer to the manuals.

BATCHMAKER PLUS includes a free program for figuring your savings and
loan accounts.  Figure a loan by payment or by loan amount.  Calculate
the amount needed to pay off a loan or plan for your future savings
needs.  A pop-up calculator is ready to help you with any calculations.
