Disk No: 2900                                                           
Disk Title: 4DOS  2 of 2 (also #1773)                                   
PC-SIG Version: S4.1                                                    
                                                                        
Program Title: 4DOS                                                     
Author Version: 4.0                                                     
Author Registration: $69.00                                             
Special Requirements: 475K RAM and a hard drive.                        
                                                                        
4DOS is designed to make DOS more powerful and easier to use by         
replacing your COMMAND.COM file with a new command interpreter.  You'll 
find 4DOS provides a wide variety of capabilities that regular          
COMMAND.COM can't -- like an enhanced DIR command, point-and-shoot file 
selection for any command, or the ability to completely redefine your   
system's commands.  It provides enhancements to most of the DOS commands
and introduces more than 40 new commands.  Yet 4DOS is fully compatible 
with COMMAND.COM.  You'll wonder how you ever got along with DOS alone. 
                                                                        
It is compatible with virtually all pc hardware and software, including 
most networks and most TSR (memory resident) programs.  It requires less
than 3K of RAM while applications are running (less than COMMAND.COM).  
                                                                        
4DOS is a "DOS shell" but is unlike most DOS shells on the market.  It  
doesn't isolate you from the DOS command line; it makes you more        
productive while working at the command line.  If you're tired of the   
limitations of DOS, you'll love 4DOS.
