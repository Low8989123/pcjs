## BTRIEV.BAS

```bas
' This SUBprocedure provides the interface between Spectra Publishing's
' PowerBASIC 2.00 compiler and Novell's BTRIEVE file system on PCDOS/MSDOS
' machines.

' In order to use the SUB, include its source code in your program with the
' $INCLUDE metastatement:     $INCLUDE "POWERBBT.BAS"

' Each time you wish to perform a BTRIEVE operation, use the CALL statement
' to call the SUB with the following parameters:

' CALL BTRV(OPERATION%, RETSTATUS%, FCBPOSBLOCK$, DATABUFFER$, _
'           DATABUFLEN%, KEYBUFFER$, KEYNUMBER%)

' where:  OPERATION% is the BTRIEVE operation code for the desired function.
'         RETSTATUS% is a BTRIEVE status code returned after the desired
'            function is attempted.
'         FCBPOSBLOCK$ is a 128-byte data area containing file control block
'            (FCB) and position information which must not be changed by
'            your program.
'         DATABUFFER$ is a data buffer used to specify special information
'            such as file specifications, key characteristics, etc.  Its
'            structure will be defined by your program with a FIELD
'            statement.
'         DATABUFLEN% is the length of the data buffer, DATABUFFER$.
'         KEYBUFFER$ is the key buffer.
'         KEYNUMBER% is the key number to be processed.

' Important note: The BTRV routine resets the currently-active PowerBASIC
' data segment to the default data segment (by executing a DEF SEG state-
' ment with no argument).  If you set a different segment with DEF SEG in
' your main program and then call BTRV, you will need to execute your DEF
' SEG statement again (after the call), if you wish to continue using your
' segment as PowerBASIC's data segment; otherwise, the default data segment
' will be active when BTRV returns to your main program.

Enclosed in this zip file you will find the following files.

Dotdisp.bas:
This program reads a text line, and generates a left scrolling
sign of large dots.

Clock.bas:
Reads computer system clock and displays time in large numbers.

Mload.bas:
Graphics demo program, loads the printed circuit card image.  Shows how
completed Deluxe Paint graphic images can be captured and displayed for
use by Power Basic.

Save_EGA.exe:
Save_Ega.exe was written by Mike Warot of Blue Star Systems.  Save_ega is
a TSR written in Turbo Pascal.  Save_EGA captures 640 x 350 graphic screens
as four separate bit planes which can then be loaded by Power Basic.
To load Save_EGA type Save_ega & press enter.  It is now loaded as a TSR.
Use shift print screen to activate capture.  It saves all images as EGA.color.
Be sure to rename the captured screens after each save.  Save_ega resaves with
the save name each time you press shift+print screen.

    Full source is included in for the main program and the two pbu's used to
    make this program.

    This official Spectra release explains Print Using and one difference in it
    from TB to PB. The bug is not in PB, but was in PB. Since you may have a
    workaround in TB, you may think PB is at fault. This also has a correction
    to the Reference Guide that is not covered in the ReadMe file on your
    PowerBASIC master disk.

     TOOLBOX TB TO PB DATABASE FIX PATCH

    Here are the changes that need to be made to the database toolbox files so
    that you may compile and run under PowerBASIC.  There are five "blocks" of
    changes that need to be made. The assembly routines that are commented in
    changes 2 and 4 need not be written into your code, but we suggest that you
    do so for future reference. Please call me if you have any questions or
    comments.  Good programming!

    This file contains PBPATCH.EXE, to allow you to install modifications, bug
    fixes, and enhancements to PowerBASIC.  This patch corrects problems with
    premature "out of memory" errors, CVF/CBCD/REMOVE$/REPLACE, public
    references from chained programs, single precision functions/fn's, and
    other fixes and enhancements.  It should be implemented by all users of
    PowerBASIC #2.00b, and is also available on disk from Spectra Tech Support.

    FindFile is a .pbu (with source included) that uses DOS functions to Find
    the first matching file to a filespec or filemask, and to find the next
    files until no more exist. A short demo, FF.Bas, is included along with a
    short README file.

    Title   : Exists, Findfile and see how to access strings.
    Keywords:
     STRINGSEGMENT STRINGPOINTER STRSEG STRPTR STRINGS


     This example includes the source code for a PBU file, and a demo with full
    remarks. Shown is how to access the new strings in PowerBASIC. These new
    ways are necessary because of the unlimited string space in PowerBASIC (no
    more 64k limit).
     Also shown is how this was accomplished in Turbo Basic.
     The demo, DemoEx.Bas (or DemoEx.EXE to see it run if you don't have
    PowerBASIC) is a simple sample to show how to access the unit.
