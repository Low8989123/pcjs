                         BERT'S DINOSAURS, Version 2.0

    BERT'S DINOSAURS is an enjoyable coloring program for children of 
all ages, but is especially useful for introducing young children to the 
computer. BERT'S DINOSAURS was designed by educators to be used by young 
children with a minimum of assistance by adults. As a coloring program 
BERT'S DINOSAURS is superior to many other children's coloring programs 
in that it allows the user to place the various dinosaurs, all in four 
different sizes, on a variety of backgrounds. This allows children to 
easily create their own picture before coloring. The opportunity to 
create their own picture will allow children to take pride in their 
unique creation. 

    When first started BERT'S DINOSAURS displays a title screen and then 
the drawing surface with eight buttons on the left. Children can operate 
the program with the mouse alone. A window is provided which allows 
children to write a short story about their picture using the keyboard. 
The fact that they created the picture will help provide the motivation 
to write about it. One of the best ways for children to learn to read is 
to write, even if their initial attempts include phonetic spelling which 
is not always correct. They will love creating a setting, writing their 
own story and printing out a copy. 

    Operation of BERT'S DINOSAURS is quite easy. The eight buttons are 
configured to do the following when the left mouse button is clicked on 
them: 

    1. SELECT A DINOSAUR.

        A. When beginning a new picture four small backgrounds are 
           displayed. The user clicks with the mouse on the selected 
           scene to have it drawn on the screen full size. 
        B. Next, a group of six sample dinosaurs are displayed. If the 
           stop sign is clicked on, no dinosaur will be selected and you 
           are returned to the drawing surface. If the down green arrow 
           is selected a second group of dinosaurs will be displayed for 
           possible selection. The up arrow returns to the first group 
           of dinosaurs. Clicking the mouse on any one of the dinosaurs 
           will select it. 
        C. The selected dinosaur appears in four different sizes. After 
           the dinosaur of the desired size is chosen, a rectangle 
           outlining its size will appear in the upper left. When the 
           left mouse button is held down on the rectangle it can be 
           dragged into its desired position. When the left mouse button 
           is released, the dinosaur will be drawn and any previously 
           drawn lines under it will be erased. This allows you to place 
           one dinosaur in front of the next. 

    2. SELECT A COLOR.

            When this button is clicked a group of thirty colors is 
        displayed. When a color is chosen it fills the crayon in the 
        button. This color will fill the portion of the picture clicked 
        on. Clicking outside the color box restores the screen with no
        action.

    3. DISPLAY THE WINDOW FOR WRITING A STORY.

            Clicking on this button displays a window where a story can 
        be typed. Along with the normal alphanumeric characters the 
        backspace and delete keys will erase characters. In addition the 
        left and right arrow keys will move the cursor to any position 
        in the window. The complete window is displayed, which consists 
        of 8 lines of 38 characters. Pressing the Enter key or filling 
        the entire 8 lines closes the story window.

    4. ERASE.

            This selection will erase the current drawing surface as 
        well as the story area. The user must verify the erase by 
        choosing a happy face for erase or sad face to cancel the erase. 

    5. SAVE.

            The drawing surface and story area can be saved by clicking 
        on this button and then selecting the save box with the arrow 
        pointing inward. While simple for adults, this function may need 
        explaining with young children. Care must be taken because 
        selecting the retrieve box with the arrow pointing outward will 
        load the stored image and story, erasing the one currently on 
        the screen. Only one image and story can be stored. Clicking
        outside the load/save box restores the screen with no action.


    6. PRINT.

            The image and story can be printed on three different types 
        of printers: Epson or IBM dot matrix printers that support 24 
        pin graphics and the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet series of 
        printers. Other printer brands that support these formats will 
        also be compatible. The user need only click on the type of 
        printer they have to begin printing. 

    7. UNDO.

            Clicking on this button erases the last dinosaur that was
        placed on the drawing surface. Misplaced dinosaurs can be removed
        with this command without effecting the image underneath.

    8. STOP.

            Selecting this button exits the program. After a support 
        shareware message is displayed, clicking the mouse will return 
        the user to DOS. 

    BERT'S DINOSAURS requires a VGA display and a mouse to operate. All 
of the files on the BERT'S DINOSAURS diskette must be in the same 
directory as the BD.EXE program, otherwise on startup the program will 
beep a few times, display the title and then do nothing as it will not 
be able to find the image files. 

                            REGISTRATION FORM

    Copies of this program may be freely shared with other users. 
Shareware users who find BERT'S DINOSAURS useful should support the 
author and register their copy. The form found below should be used for 
registration. Registered users will receive a copy of BERT'S DINOSAURS 
with current corrections, additional animals and scenes, improved speed 
and enhanced features. One enhanced feature allows printed output in 
color to Hewlett-Packard's inexpensive PaintJet Color Graphics Printer.

    The registration fee is $20. ($30. outside the United States.) 
Please include $2.00 for shipping and handling. A complete listing of 
the program, which is written in the newest version of Borland C++, is 
also available for an additional $20.00.
