Special Requirements: 448K RAM and a hard drive.                        
                                                                        
THE HOME AND BUSINESS LEGAL GUIDE AND FORMS GENERATOR is really three   
programs in one: It custom prepares legal documents from on-screen      
interviews, contains the full annotated text of important laws and      
regulations, and provides many nuts and bolts explanations of the law.  
                                                                        
Users can prepare more than 150 different custom legal forms for        
personal, business, real estate, estate planning, and living trust use, 
all of which have been written by an attorney/consumer advocate.        
Monthly data updates and FREE upgrades for one year are available to all
registered users.  The program prepares legal forms specifically for    
your needs based on answers to on-screen questions.                     
                                                                        
This program also features instructional tutorials that explain various 
legal problems in an easy-to-understand way. In addition, the tutorials 
feature an on-line dictionary and the ability to examine both full text 
of the laws and the explanation on screen.

Vendors who are ASP members in good standing are permitted to
distribute this program without further permission. However,
to be honest, fellow ASP members, we would really like to hear
from you (a card, a letter, your catalog!) All ASP vendors will
receive all major upgrades automatically. However, (again to be
brutally honest!) we ship same day ALL updates (even minor revisions
to the manuals) and upgrades to vendors who we know are carrying 
our program. Yes, all ASP members will get our programs, but, if 
you let us know that we are in your catalog we'll get it out to you 
the same day that it is released! Thank you, thank you, thank
you to all ASP members who are carrying our program. Let us know
how we can help.

Non-ASP vendors: Please call or otherwise contact us for
permission to distribute. And consider joining the ASP! We'll
tell you how!

ALL VEDNORS:

You are required to distribute all of our files. Other than
that we have a no hassle vendor policy!
