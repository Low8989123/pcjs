Special Requirements: 384K RAM.                                         
                                                                        
SYSTEM MASTER'S multiple menu pages in a 4-dimensional setup give it a  
unique look among DOS shells.  With 16 menu pages and over 300          
pre-defined menu items, this hard disk organizer is a must for PCs with 
multiple users and security levels.                                     
                                                                        
SYSTEM MASTER provides not only the standard SHELL options such as mouse
control, custom color setup, and screen blanking, but also timed        
execution of programs, parameter passing to menu options, and a great   
context sensitive help system.  Users can define over 85,000 menu items 
within the menu pages.                                                  
                                                                        
SYSTEM MASTER matches most commercial disk management packages in its   
documentation.  More than 100 pages of documentation provide the user   
with operating instructions as well as a brief description of how DOS   
commands have been implemented in SYSTEM MASTER.                        
                                                                        
Although SYSTEM MASTER doesn't have an automatic program search and     
install option, addition of new menu items isn't difficult (though not  
recommended for the novice).  The program does not currently support    
networks.

     SM_PURGE.EXE Utility - Documentation
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

     When you are operating SYSTEM MASTER and moving between menu levels
     and/or menu pages, SYSTEM MASTER creates a menu template file each
     time a new menu is entered if current menu data does not yet exist.

     SYSTEM MASTER creates an empty data file so that you can begin adding
     menu options immediately upon entering any specific menu.

     Since empty menu data files will tend to fill-up your hard disk very
     quickly, we have provided a utility program (SM_PURGE.EXE) to eliminate
     these empty, menu data files from your hard disk.

     SM_PURGE must be run from the command line or written into a menu option
     The SM_PURGE is part of the 'TOOLS' Special function in the Registered
     version of SYSTEM MASTER.

     SM_PURGE only deletes empty data files, so your valid menu data files
     will NOT be effected.

     SECTION 1   SYSTEM MASTER Introduction
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1.1   What is SYSTEM MASTER?

           SYSTEM MASTER is a Software Shell that will assist you in master-
           ing your day-to-day application accessing and data handling &
           collection chores very simply and very easily.

           The outright power of SYSTEM MASTER has been disguised within a
           beautifully structured user interface, which will allow even the
           most squeemish user to grasp the reigns of computing like an
           expert.

     1.2   Using This Documentation

           This document describes the features and functions of SYSTEM MASTER
           You will not require a great deal of technical knowledge to under-
           stand and operate SYSTEM MASTER, although an understanding of the
           intricacies of DOS will allow you to take special advantage of the
           SYSTEM MASTER features.

     1.3   Hardware Requirements

           The SYSTEM MASTER shell is designed to operate with color as well
           as monochrome computer systems.  It has been tested and has been
           proven to operate effectively on the following systems:

                              CGA
                              EGA
                              VGA
                              MVGA
                              MCGA

           SYSTEM MASTER will operate on systems with 384K memory, but 512 or
           640K is desireable.  At the present time SYSTEM MASTER can not take
           advantage of Expanded or Extended memory directly.  Mouse support
           is available within SYSTEM MASTER, but is not required.

     1.4   Installing SYSTEM MASTER

           To install SYSTEM MASTER, execute the following steps as presented.

           1)  Make a Sub-Directory on your hard disk.  Call it SM.

               C:\> md c:\sm <ENTER>

           2)  Log the SM directory.

               C:\> cd\sm <ENTER>

           3)  Place the SYSTEM/DOCUMENTATION diskette in the appropriate
               diskette drive, and unpack the SM_PROG.ZIP, SM_MENU.ZIP and
               the SM_DOCS.ZIP files.

               C:\SM\> A:\PKUNZIP A:\SM_PROG <ENTER>
                              -and-
               C:\SM\> A:\PKUNZIP A:\SM_MENU <ENTER>
                              -and-
               C:\SM\> A:\PKUNZIP A:\SM_DOCS <ENTER>

           All of the necessary system and configuration files should now be
           operational.  Proceed to section 1.5 to start SYSTEM MASTER.

     1.5   Starting SYSTEM MASTER

           SYSTEM MASTER may only be run from within the directory in which
           it resides.  If you attempt to run the shell from outside the
           SYSTEM MASTER directory, necessary setup files will not be located
           and error messages will be displayed.

           C:\SM\>

           You MUST use the following command to start SYSTEM MASTER:

           C:\SM\> sm <ENTER>

           The system will either work incorrectly or not at all if any of
           the other batch or exec files are run.

     2.1   What can I do with SYSTEM MASTER?

           With SYSTEM MASTER, you can create menus that can range from very
           simple and direct to extremely sophisticated and functional:

           You can set SYSTEM MASTER to load and execute your frequently used
           application programs.

           You can set SYSTEM MASTER to perform DOS command tasks with the
           touch of a key or the click of a mouse.

           You can set SYSTEM MASTER to only respond when authorized users
           have given appropriate security responses.

           You can customize the SYSTEM MASTER shell, as well as create
           your own menuing schemes.

           You can set SYSTEM MASTER to perform predetermined tasks - at
           specific times throughout your day, without the need to even be
           at your computer system.

     2.2   SYSTEM MASTER Key Features

           SYSTEM MASTER boasts a magnificent collection of features and
           power tools which include:

              SYSTEM MASTER allows beginning or mid-range users unfamiliar
              with the DOS environment to get the most out of the operating
              system in a controlled and comfortable way.

              SYSTEM MASTER can prompt the user for the input required to
              execute command files properly and effectively.

              SYSTEM MASTER can execute command files with input parameters
              preset into a menu option (static variables) or can utilize
              free-form input parameter passing (dynamic variables) for the
              ultimate in menu shell flexibility.

              SYSTEM MASTER will allow you to chain menus and menu options
              thru a special Command Processor built into the shell.

              SYSTEM MASTER comes outfitted with a current maximum of 85,536
              menu options that can be set to perform a multitude of tasks.

              SYSTEM MASTER has password-controlled access to the sensitive
              functional areas within the shell.  Areas like the Command
              Editor, User Profiles, Menu Jumping, and DOS Environment are
              protected by minimum acess level requirements.

              SYSTEM MASTER provides for AccessCode-controlled access to
              specific menu selections, each able to have a unique AccessCode.

     2.2   SYSTEM MASTER Key Features (continued)


              SYSTEM MASTER can also protect entire ranges of menu selections
              with AccessLevel controls which require users have an Access
              Level assigned to their user profile at least as high as the
              menu option selected.

              SYSTEM MASTER writes all command data into data files for
              added security.

              SYSTEM MASTER can execute menu selections by system Time & Date.

              SYSTEM MASTER normally removes itself from memory prior to the
              execution of menu option commands allowing maximum available
              memory to be available to applications.

              SYSTEM MASTER can be operated in resident mode which speeds up
              the return to SYSTEM MASTER after the execution of a command.

              SYSTEM MASTER provides on-line context-sensitive help at
              virtually every location within the shell.

              SYSTEM MASTER allows for easy modification of menu features
              such as screen colors, color palettes, system switches & screen
              display features.

              SYSTEM MASTER provides a screen blanking feature, to prevent
              imageburn, which replaces an inactive screen with a periodical-
              ly shifting user defined message.  Blanking interval is user
              selectable and the displayed blanking message is customizable.

              SYSTEM MASTER offers an on-line menu option editor which speeds
              up the menu option definition process dramatically.

              SYSTEM MASTER allows you to use your choice of the keyboard for
              moving around the shell or full mouse support coupled with the
              keyboard for accessing special areas.

              SYSTEM MASTER provides on-screen display of date and time.

              SYSTEM MASTER is written in assembler & Turbo Pascal and is not
              copy protected.

          Since SYSTEM MASTER was designed and written by a 'USER', it is a
          completely user oriented product. On-Line help screens and prompts
          walk you through every aspect of the package. A single keystroke
          (F1) will call up a Help window which will describe the item
          currently being accessed.

     SECTION 3   SYSTEM MASTER System Specifics
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

     3.1   SYSTEM MASTER Menu Structure

           The SYSTEM MASTER menu structure is extremely straight forward,
           but can become somewhat confusing to the novice user.

           The Menu Structure is Structured into what amounts to a
           4-dimensional array of menu options.  But don't let that scare
           you off.  Approximately 70% of your day-to-day operations will
           make use of only visible 2-dimensional structures. (i.e.  the
           6 menu boxes with 16 possible options in each).

           What Sets SYSTEM MASTER apart from the others is its ability
           to access any 1 of the 85536 defineable menu options with an
           absolute minimum of keystroking.  This is accomplished via the
           4-dimensional array structure which comprises SYSTEM MASTER.

           Let me define the 4 'dimensions' within the menu structure:

             Dimension 1 = The 16 possible menu options available within
                           a given menu box.

             Dimension 2 = The 6 possible menu boxes that can be utilized
                           within each SYSTEM MASTER menu.  (Each Menu Box
                           contains the 16 menu options from dimension 1).

             Dimension 3 = The 9 available menus that can be accessed thru
                           the Menu Select Function.  (Each Menu contains
                           the 96 menu options available in dimensions 1 & 2).

             Dimension 4 = The 99 available menu levels that are accessible
                           thru the Menu Select Function.  (Each Menu Level
                           contains 9 Menus with 96 Options within each to
                           comprise the 85,536 total available menu options).

     3.2   Menu Screen Layout

           The Standard Operating Mode Screen Display is the Screen
           which appears when you first load SYSTEM MASTER.

           Unless you are performing one of the SYSTEM MASTER
           functions, this is the display you will work in.

           At the top of the display (line #1),is the Title of the
           Currently active SYSTEM MASTER menu.  Following the Menu
           Title is a Code, which identifies the menu cell where the
           selection bar is currently located.  When SYSTEM MASTER
           is initially loaded, a location code of 'L01 M1 B1 O01' is
           displayed.  This code simply tells you that the selection
           bar is currently on 'L'evel '01', 'M'enu '1', 'B'ox '1',
           'O'ption '01'.  It's as simple as that.  As you move the
           Selection Bar you will notice that the location numbers

           within that area change to reflect the current location.

           At the end of screen line #1, is the current operating mode.
           The current mode may be one of the following:

           '   MENU   ' - When this mode is displayed, you are able to
                          move around the SYSTEM MASTER shell and
                          select 'MENU' options to execute.  This mode
                          is always current after exiting all other
                          system function except the 'HELP' function.

           '   HELP   ' - Although quite obvious, due to the large
                          'HELP' screen displayed, this mode shows you
                          that you are in help mode.  When the F1 key
                          is pressed this mode becomes active.

           '   EDIT   ' - When this mode is displayed, you are in the
                          Menu Option 'EDIT'or.  Here, you can change
                          add, or delete menu options from the shell.
                          When the F2 key is pressed while in 'MENU'
                          mode, this function is available.

           '   USER   ' - When this mode is displayed, you are in the
                          'USER' Profile Editor.  Here, you can change
                          add, or delete user profiles from the shell.
                          When the F3 key is pressed while in 'MENU'
                          mode, this function is available.

           '  LogON   ' - When this mode is displayed, you are prompted
                          to input your System LogON Password.

           '   JUMP   ' - When this mode is displayed, you are prompted
                          to input a menu cell coordinate.  When a cell
                          coordinate has been input SYSTEM MASTER makes
                          a 'Quick JUMP' directly to the specified cell.

           '   TOOL   ' - When this mode is displayed, you are able
                          to use a collection of SYSTEM MASTER special
                          tools.

           '   TIME   ' - When this mode is displayed, you are able to
                          view a Clock which displays the current system
                          Time & Date.

           '  SELECT  ' - When this mode is displayed, you are able
                          to 'SELECT' a different Menu of Menu Level.
                          When the F10 key is pressed while in 'MENU'
                          mode this function is available.

           On the second line of the menu display is a group of 6
           menu 'Pads'.  These 'Pads' are the headers to Menu Boxes
           which may be defined under them.

           On the left side on the 4th screen line is displayed the
           name of the currently LOGged User.  All security access
           levels are checked against the currently logged user's
           'User Profile'.

           On the right side on the 4th screen line is the Serial
           Number of the Program.

           On the 23rd screen line, 3rd from the bottom of the display,
           is an area which may be optionally defined to display a
           message describing the currently hilited menu option.  This
           message is defined within the 'Menu Option Editor' which
           is accessible using the F2 key.

           The bottom screen line contains a summary of valid function
           keys which cause the system to switch operating modes.  This
           list changes depending upon which system function you are
           currently accessing.

     3.3   SYSTEM MASTER Menu Access

           3.3.1     Accessing Menu Options

                     Accessing menu options is as easy as:

                     1) Sliding the mouse from side-to-side to select a menu
                        'Pad' then up-and-down to HiLite a menu option.  Once
                        the option is HiLited, it may be 'Selected' by either
                        pressing the left mouse button or by pressing the
                        'Enter' key on the keyboard.

                                  - or -

                     2) Using the 'Arrow' keys to move up-and-down & from
                        side-to-side to HiLite a menu option, then pressing the
                        'Enter' key or Clicking the left mouse button.

           3.3.2   Accessing Menus

                   There are 4 distict methods for accessing menus:

                   1)  Program a menu option with a '[J] nnnnnn' command to
                       perform the jump when the option is selected.  (This
                       method is primarily used for nesting of menus).

                   2)  While in 'MENU' mode, press the F7 key.  An input box
                       is displayed, and you are prompted to input a menu
                       option cell coordinate.  If the coordinate is within
                       the unsecured menu area,  jump immediately occurs.
                   3)  While in 'MENU' mode, press the F10 key.  This puts
                       SYSTEM MASTER into 'SELECT' mode.  You can move around
                       the menu shell by using the Up/Down Arrow keys, and
                       the PgUp/PgDn keys.  Press the <ENTER> key to enter
                       the selected menu, press the <ESC> key to return to the
                       original menu location.
                   4)  While in 'MENU' mode, pressing the PgUp/PgDn keys will
                       move you into the next highest/lowest menu.  As long as
                       the menu to be accessed is unsecured, the move is
                       immediate.

           3.3.3   Accessing Menu Levels

                   There are up to 99 Menu Levels accessible within SYSTEM
                   MASTER.  The actual number of accessible levels is user
                   defineable thru the SYSTEM MASTER Customization Options.

                   SYSTEM MASTER is distributed with all 99 menu levels
                   directly accessible.  To limit the number of accessible
                   menu levels select the 'SYSTEM MASTER Customization'
                   menu option from the initially loaded menu.  Next, move
                   the selection bar to the 'SETTINGS' menu pad and select
                   the 'Menu Level Access' option.  When the input box
                   appears, input the number of menu levels that users may
                   directly access/browse.  (range 1..99).

                   This Limiting of access allows you to secure more
                   sensitive items within menus that only you or a [J] menu
                   jump can access.

                   There are 3 distict methods for accessing menus:

                   1)  Program a menu option with a '[J] nnnnnn' command to
                       perform the jump when the option is selected.  (This
                       method is primarily used for nesting of menus).
                   2)  While in 'MENU' mode, press the F7 key.  An input box
                       is displayed, and you are prompted to input a menu
                       option cell coordinate.  If the coordinate is within
                       the unsecured menu area,  jump immediately occurs.
                   3)  While in 'MENU' mode, press the F10 key.  This puts
                       SYSTEM MASTER into 'SELECT' mode.  You can move around
                       the menu shell by using the Up/Down Arrow keys, and
                       the PgUp/PgDn keys.  Press the <ENTER> key to enter
                       the selected menu, press the <ESC> key to return to the
                       original menu location.

           3.4.1   F1  - Context Sensitive Help

                   Context Sensitive Help is available within
                   SYSTEM MASTER at virtually every phase of input
                   or operation.  When the 'F1' key is pressed a
                   help screen which explains the current opera-
                   tion is displayed for the user.

           3.4.2   F2  - Menu Option Editor

                   The SYSTEM MASTER Menu Option Editor allows
                   you to fully customize each of the 85,536 menu
                   options available within the shell.

                   (See Section 4 for a complete discussion of
                    the Menu Option Editor).

                   Access to the Option Editor may be Secured
                   by setting the Option Editor minimum Access Level
                   to 99 from within the SYSTEM MASTER Customization

                   Menu Option.

           3.4.3   F3  - User Profile Editor

                   The User Profile Editor allows you to assign a
                   level of accessibility to all persons using the
                   SYSTEM MASTER shell.  This Level of Accessibility
                   allows you to develop a menu shell that will
                   allow only those users with an AccessLevel equal
                   to or greater than a pre-determined setting
                   to select and use any given menu option.

                   For Example, Joe Smith has been assigned an Access
                   Level of 60.  If there are menu options that Joe
                   should NOT have access to those menu options can
                   be defined to allow access only to individuals
                   that 1) know the password & 2) have an access
                   level equal to or greater than the one defined
                   within the menu option.  So, to keep Joe out of
                   a sensitive menu option, assign a menu level
                   larger than 60 to the menu option.  Anyone who
                   may access that option must be assigned an access
                   level at least as great as the one defined into
                   the menu option.

                   Access to the User Profile Editor may be Secured
                   by setting the User Profile Editor minimum Access
                   Level to 99 from within the SYSTEM MASTER Custom-
                   ization Menu Option.

                   nates of the menu cell you wish to 'J'ump into.  The
                   menu cell coordinates are structured as a 6 digit
                   integer string (positions 1&2 specify the menu level -
                   position 3 specifies the menu number - position 4
                   specifies the menu box number - positions 5&6 specify
                   the menu option number).

           3.4.8   F8  - Special SYSTEM MASTER functions

                   Pressing the F8 key while in 'MENU' mode causes a

     SECTION 4   SYSTEM MASTER Command Editor
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The SYSTEM MASTER Command Editor is the system function that will
     assist you in harnessing the power of SYSTEM MASTER.  It will allow
     you to build the ultimate power base for your computing needs thru
     a multitude of editing features & shortcuts built into the Command
     Editor.

     4.1   Accessing the Command Editor

           The SYSTEM MASTER Security system is distributed inactive.
           If the Security System has been activated from the configuration
           menu, continue by reading the following:

           To access the Command Editor, you MUST Log onto SYSTEM MASTER
           by pressing the F4 key and entering your system password.

           After 'Logging' on to SYSTEM MASTER, you will be able to access
           the Command Editor by pressing the F2 key.

           Since the Command Editor is protected by access-level checks
           failure to LogOn, or modify the 'minimum access level system
           variable will cause SYSTEM MASTER to reject your request to
           access the editor.

           (See section 2 for Security Access Level discussion)
           (See section 7 for System Variable modifications)


     4.2   The Command Editor and the Keyboard

           When you are inside the Command Editor you will have access
           to various 'special' keys that were implemented to make
           command editing easier and quicker.

                   LeftArrow
                   RightArrow

                   F8
                   BackSpace

           4.2.1   LeftArrow

                   The LeftArrow key, if the current cursor position
                   is greater than position 1 of the current input
                   field, moves the cursor to the left 1 position.

                   The End key moves the cursor to 1 position past
                   the end of the currently displayed character
                   string.

           4.2.5   Del

                   The Del key deletes the character at the cursor
                   position and slides the balance of the string
                   to the right of the cursor to the left 1 position
                   to take the place of the deleted character.

           4.2.6   Tab

                   The Tab key, if the current cursor position
                   is less than the length of the current input field
                   moves the cursor to the right 5 positions.

           4.2.7   F8

                   The F8 key, is used while editing field data to
                   clear text from the cursor position to the end of
                   the current line.

           4.2.8   BackSpace

                   The BackSpace key, is used to delete the character
                   to the left of the cursor.  All characters under and to
                   the right of the cursor are shifted left 1 space.

     4.3   ADDing a menu option to SYSTEM MASTER

           To ADD a menu option, we mean ADD a completely new menu
           option to the shell.

           To ADD a menu option, you must first find the place within
           the shell you want the menu option to be displayed.

           The location can be virtually anywhere within the shell
           with 1 exception.  To allow the menu boxes to expand
           dynamically as options are added, the ADD command appends
           new options to the end of an existing menu box, or creates

           a new menu box if the menu box does not yet exist.

           So, to ADD a menu option to SYSTEM MASTER, you only need to
           locate a menu level, a menu and a menu box for the definition
           to be located in.

           After a menu location has been selected and the selection
           bar has been located within that menu box, or on the menu
           pad where a new box will be placed, you need to press the
           'F2' key.

           You now have a list of 11 editing options from which to
           choose.  Move the selection bar so that the 'Add Menu Option'
           line is hilited, and either press the <ENTER> key or click
           the left mouse button once, and an editing box will appear.
           Go to sub-section 4.14 for further information.

     4.4   EDITing a menu option in SYSTEM MASTER

           To EDIT a menu option, we mean EDIT an existing menu
           option in the shell.

           To EDIT a menu option, you must first find the location of
           the menu option to be edited and place the selection bar
           on that menu option.

           After the menu option to be edited has been located and the
           selection bar has been located on that menu option, you need
           to press the 'F2' key.

           You now have a list of 11 editing options from which to
           choose.  Move the selection bar so that the 'Edit Menu
           Option' line is hilited, and either press the <ENTER> key
           or click the left mouse button once, and an editing box will
           appear.  Go to sub-section 4.14 for further information.

     4.5   INSERTing a menu option into SYSTEM MASTER

           To INSERT a menu option, we mean INSERT a new menu
           option into a specific location within a menu box.

           To INSERT a menu option, you must first find the place within
           the shell you want the menu option to be displayed.  The
           location can be virtually anywhere within the shell with 1
           exception.  Since the menu boxes expand dynamically, you can
           INSERT a menu option only within a previously defined
           menu box.

           After the menu option to be inserted has been located and
           the selection bar has been located on that menu option,
           you need to press the 'F2' key.

           No field editing is involved with this option.

     4.7   CUTting a menu option from SYSTEM MASTER

           To CUT a menu option, we mean CUT a menu option from

           To COPY a menu option, we mean COPY the contents of a menu
           option from the shell and save contents to the option buffer.

           To COPY a menu option, you must first locate the option

           bar over it.

           selection bar has been located on that menu option, you need
           to press the 'F2' key.

           location can be virtually anywhere within the shell with 1
           exception.  The paste menu item option, when utilized, places
           the Pasted item at the cursor location, and pushes the current
           item at the cursor plus all other items below it in the menu
           down 1 line.  Therefore, you can not paste an item to the end
           of a menu box listing.

           After the menu option to be inserted has been located and
           the selection bar has been located at that location,

     SECTION 5   SYSTEM MASTER Tri-Level Security System
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

     5.1    Security System Overview

            The SYSTEM MASTER Tri-Level Security System will provide you with
            a fine array of System Security configuration possibilities.  The
            Tri-Level approach forces unauthorized users to defeat 3 levels
            of security to gain access to your system(s).

            You will first begin to create a secure environment by creating
            a 'User Profile' for each person who will have authorized access
            to your system. (See section 5.2 for details concerning the User
            Profile Editor).

            5.1.1   Level 1 - Personal Passwords

                    Within the User Profile record there is a 6 character
                    field for the entry of a Password.  The Password may be
                    from 1 to 6 characters in length.  (A nul password will
                    not be recognized at run-time).  This password should
                    be unique because it allows SYSTEM MASTER to recognize the
                    user on a first name basis.  It also reads the user's
                    'Access Level' and allows or denies access to specific
                    menu options base partly on the Access Level criteria.

            5.1.2   Level 2 - User Access Level

                    Within the User Profile record there is a byte field
                    for the Entry of a User Access Level.  The Access Level
                    value is read from the User Profile record at run-time
                    and allows or denies access to specific menu options
                    base partly on this criteria.  The User's Access Level may
                    be within a range of 0 to 99.  (0 = Access only to unpro-
                    tected options / 99 = Access to all options).

            5.1.3   Level 3 - Menu Option Access Code

                    Within each menu option definition record there is a 6
                    character field which completes the Tri-Level Security
                    system.  This Access Code, is used to further limit
                    access to menu options to only those individuals who
                    have satisfied the requirements of Security Levels 1 & 2
                    and who also know the 4 character code written into the
                    menu option record.

            For Example:

               Joe Smith has been given an access level of 60, and a password
               of JOES.  Upon entry to SYSTEM MASTER he MUST provide his
               password in order to access any of the menu options.  Assuming
               the proper password was entered, Joe may select a menu option.
               When Joe selects an option, the system compares Joe's access
               level to the minimum access level acceptable for anyone trying

     SECTION 5   SYSTEM MASTER Tri-Level Security System
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

               to access that option.  Assuming that Joe has an access code
               that is equal to or greater than the specified minimum, the
               system checks to see if the menu option requires that a
               access code be entered.  If access code IS required a box
               appears on the CRT and Joe is prompted to input the access
               code for the selected option.  If, and ONLY if, the proper
               access code is entered by the user, the menu option is
               executed according to the guidelines written into the
               option's command definition record.

            If at any time an improper password or improper access code
            are entered, or the Joe's access level is not sufficient,
            a three pulse error beep is emitted, and processing returns
            to the option menu.

     5.2    User Profile Editor

            The User Profile Editor is the heart of the Tri-Level Security
            approach.  Initial security checks utilize the information
            within the user profile record to verify access to the system,
            as well as to menu options within the system.

            Access to the User Profile Editor may be limited from within
            the SYSTEM MASTER Customization menu.  To Limit access to the
            editor, you should set the minimum access level for access to
            the editor to 99.  Then, be sure that only the custodian of
            the system (yourself) has an access level of 99 in his/her user
            profile.

            5.1.2   The User Profile Record

                    The User Profile Record consists of 12 data fields that
                    gather statistics about a user.  Only 3 of those fields
                    are currently used by the system, however.  The 'Name'
                    field, the 'Password' field and the 'AccLevel' field.
                    The other 9 fields will be utilized in future releases
                    of SYSTEM MASTER and can be completed if you desire.

                    A brief description of all 12 of the data fields follows:

                    5.1.2.1   'Name'  This field holds the

     6.1    DOS Primer

            A detailed description of DOS or its function would be a
            long and lengthy undertaking. So, in order to make this
            text as brief and meaningful as possible, each individual
            DOS command will be touched upon as it pertains to the
            SYSTEM MASTER command Processor.  (See the DOS Manual for
            your particular version of DOS for detailed descriptions
            of each of the following commands).


            DOS Commands (Listing)(DOS ver 3.3 specific)

            All DOS commands may be executed with the SYSTEM MASTER
            shell using batch conventions.  All DOS commands, above,
            flagged with an '*' must be run with a 'D' parameter when
            processing DOS commands with SYSTEM MASTER in Resident
            Mode.  All other DOS commands would use the 'N' parameter.
            (see the SYSTEM MASTER '[R]' command explanation in sub-
            section 4 of this  chapter).

            All Examples below assume that the DOS command resides in
            the current DOS search path.

     6.2    DOS Command Descriptions

            6.2.1   APPEND

                    We DO NOT RECOMMEND using the APPEND command with
                    SYSTEM MASTER.  This command causes SYSTEM MASTER
                    to operate eradically,  and may cause your system
                    to lock.

            6.2.2   ASSIGN

                    The ASSIGN command allows you to reassign
                    disk drive identification letters.  This tells
                    DOS that any I/O requests targeted for a
                    specified drive should be carried out on
                    an ASSIGNed drive.

                    Format:  [d:path]ASSIGN [x[=]y[...]]

                             [!]
                             [?] S Enter Drive to be Reassigned:
                             [!]
                             [?] S Enter New Drive Specification:
                             ASSIGN %1=%2
                             [L] C

                             Tells DOS that all I/O requests
                             targeted for the innitial drive spec
                             are to be sent to the assigned drive
                             spec.  (i.e. requests for A: sent to C:)

                    Exampl:  {{ Reset Previous Drive Assignments }}

                             ASSIGN
                             [L] C

                             Tells DOS to reset all drives to
                             their respective original identifi-
                             cations.

            6.2.3   ATTRIB

                    The ATTRIB command modifies disk file attributes
                    for a single file, for selected files
                    within a directory or for all files within a
                    directory level.

            6.2.4   BACKUP

                    The BACKUP command backs up one or more files
                    from one disk (usually a hard disk) to another
                    (usually a floppy disk).  The disks cannot carry
                    the same drive identifier.

     7.1    Batch Primer

            A detailed description of DOS or its function would be a
            long and lengthy undertaking. So, in order to make this
            text as brief and meaningful as possible, each individual
            Batch command will be touched upon as it pertains to the
            SYSTEM MASTER command Processor.  (See the DOS Manual for
            your particular version of DOS for detailed descriptions
            of each of the following commands).

     7.2    Batch Command Descriptions

            7.2.1   :label

                    The :label command is not a true command, but is
                    instead a tag to which GOTO instructions are
                    routed within a batch file. A 'label' can be any
                    valid label tag as described within your DOS manual.

                    Format:  :label

                    Exampl:  if NOT EXIST bogusfil.txt GOTO exitbatch
                             del bogusfil.txt
                             :exitbatch
                             cls

                             This example first checks for the existance of
                             a disk file called 'bogusfil.txt'.  If the file
                             exists, it is deleted.  if it does not exist,
                             processing jumps to the 'exitbatch' label and,
                             and the batch file clears the CRT and terminates
                             normally.

            7.2.2   @

                    The @ command is not a true command, but it is instead
                    a filter which allows batch commands to be executed
                    without displaying the batch commands on the CRT.
                    This command is available starting with version 3.3
                    DOS.  Using this command with earlier versions of DOS
                    will cause SYSTEM MASTER to operate incorrectly.

            7.2.3   %n

                    The %n command is not a true command but is instead a
                    means by which DOS passes input parameters to command
                    files which use them.  'n' can be any positive integer
                    value in the range 1..9 (SYSTEM MASTER requirement).

                    Other normal DOS Input parameter passing requirements
                    remain in effect.

            7.2.4   %string%

                    The %string% command is not a true command but is instead
                    a means by which program variables are passed to and from
                    the DOS environment.  'string' represents any valid
                    DOS Environmental variable assigned using the 'SET'
                    command.

     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

            7.2.5   CALL

                    The CALL command allows a batch file to be executed from
                    within another batch file without terminating the first
                    batch file.  This command allows batch files to be
                    processed as commands within other batch files.

                    Format:  CALL another.bat

                    This command is available starting with version 3.3
                    DOS.  Using this command with earlier versions of DOS
                    will cause SYSTEM MASTER to operate incorrectly.

            7.2.6   ECHO

                    The ECHO command has 3 functions:
                       1)  to turn echoing of screen commands ON.
                       2)  to turn echoing of screen commands OFF.
                       3)  to display a text string on the CRT.

                    Format:  ECHO ON

                    Format:  ECHO OFF

                    Format:  ECHO This String Will be Displayed!

            7.2.7   FOR

                    The FOR command allows repetitive execution (Looping) of
                    DOS commands.

                    Format:  FOR %%variable IN (set) DO command

            7.2.8   GOTO

                    The GOTO command allows branching within a batch file.
                    when a GOTO command is encountered in a batch file
                    processing continues at the 'label' specified.

                    Format:  GOTO label

                    Exampl:  if NOT EXIST bogusfil.txt GOTO exitbatch
                             del bogusfil.txt
                             :exitbatch
                             cls

                             This example first checks for the existance of
                             a disk file called 'bogusfil.txt'.  If the file
                             exists, it is deleted.  if it does not exist,
                             processing jumps to the 'exitbatch' label and,
                             and the batch file clears the CRT and terminates
                             normally.

            7.2.9   IF [NOT] ERRORLEVEL

                    The IF ERRORLEVEL command checks for errorcodes returned
                    from some DOS commands and provides those codes to the
                    batch processor.

                    Exampl:  replace bogusfil.txt a:\
                             IF ERRORLEVEL 2 then goto :exitbatch
                             :exitbatch
                             echo File Not Found

                             This example first attempts to replace a disk
                             file called 'bogusfil.txt'.  If ERRORLEVEL is 2,
                             processing jumps to the 'exitbatch' label, and
                             the batch file displays an error message and
                             terminates normally.

            7.2.10  IF [NOT] EXIST

                    The IF EXIST command checks for the existance or non-
                    existance of a disk file.

                    Exampl:  if NOT EXIST bogusfil.txt GOTO exitbatch
                             del bogusfil.txt
                             :exitbatch
                             cls

                             This example first checks for the existance of
                             a disk file called 'bogusfil.txt'.  If the file
                             exists, it is deleted.  if it does not exist,
                             processing jumps to the 'exitbatch' label and,
                             and the batch file clears the CRT and terminates
                             normally.

            7.2.11  IF [NOT] s1==s2

                    The IF s1==s2 command compares 2 strings for equality.

                    Exampl:  if %1==STEVE ECHO STEVE IS USING THIS SYSTEM

            7.2.12  PAUSE

                    The PAUSE command suspends processing of the batch
                    file until the user presses a key.  A Remark can be
                    tagged to the PAUSE command for command clarity.

            7.2.14  SHIFT

                    The SHIFT command allows input parameters to exceed the
                    DOS limit of 10 (0..9).

                    When the SHIFT command is used, %2 param becomes %1 ...
                    and the last defined parameter becomes nul.

           8.2.1   Timer Operation Instructions

                   8.2.1.1   [B]  Define Timer Break-out Sequence

                             The "Timer break-out" sequence allows you to
                             assign a user-defined series of key strokes
                             that can be used to exit an invoked timer
                             operation.

                             If a break-out sequence is to be defined, it
                             MUST be defined in the command set ahead of the
                             timer operation it will control.

                             A default sequence of ESC-E-X-I-T-ESC is prede-
                             fined into SYSTEM MASTER and is functional until
                             you override it with a definition of your own.

                             If you need to define a "secure" breakout se-
                             quence, use this command followed by six (6)
                             valid character codes in the format shown above.

                             If the [B] command is a requirement in your
                             command set, don't forget the key sequence you
                             used, because the default key sequence is dis-
                             abled during the timer operation.

                             (See Appendix 'F' for Valid Keycodes)

                                       The KeyCodeSequence must begin in
                                       character position 5 of the command
                                       string and be formatted as shown.

                             The "Calculate Input Parameter" command requires
                             2 Parameters to operate.  The 2 parameters MUST
                             be real numbers, and may be assigned directly
                             or collected with the [?] command.

                             When calculating input parameters, SYSTEM MASTER
                             automatically begins with 1 and increments a
                             parameter counter for each Calculate command
                             encountered up to a maximum of 9.

                                       parameters '%r1' and '%r2'.  These 2
                                       parameters may be assigned directly, as
                                       collected input parameters, or a
                                       combination of the two.

                             The "Include Option" command is a very special
                             SYSTEM MASTER command feature.  This command
                             allows you to 'Include' other menu option com-
                             mand sets into the selected menu option command
                             set.

                             You can create menu sub-options in various lo-
                             cations around the SYSTEM MASTER shell, and then
                             have SYSTEM MASTER collect those sub-options at
                             run time, and execute them as if the commands
                             were located within the selected option.

                             Note: Since you are limited to a maximum of 255
                                   total commands within a single selection,
                                   you should take care not to exceed this
                                   boundary.

                                   You can, although, terminate a menu selec-
                                   tion with the SYSTEM MASTER '[X]' command
                                   to 'Chain' and 'Execute' additional menu
                                   options.

                                   (see the '[X]' command in the Terminator
                                   Commands Sec.)

                                       This command would tell SYSTEM MASTER
                                       to load menu level 15, menu 7 and copy
                                       the contents of Menu box 4, Option 4
                                       into the selected menu option command

                                       '[I]' command occurred in the selected

                             The "Load & Execute" command is used at the end
                             of a command set to reload SYSTEM MASTER and
                             Execute a specified menu option, after current
                             command processing in DOS terminates.

                             Specifying the '[X]' command reloads SYSTEM
                             MASTER but does NOT display the system master
                             screen.  SYSTEM MASTER only loads the command
                             definitions, and then executes the specified
                             menu option.

                             This allows for virtually infinite 'Chaining'
                             of menu options and command sequences.

                                       This command would reload SYSTEM MASTER
                                       and execute the menu option in menu
                                       level 15, menu 7 on Menu box 4, Optn 4.

     SECTION 9   Menu Design & Construction
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

     9.1   Menu Design

           When designing a menuing system you should aim for a System which
           operates with the greatest ease and with the maximum of function-
           ality and flexibility.  It is with this goal in mind that we will
           proceed with this phase of the documentation.

           There are 2 ways in which to proceed from this point:
               1)  All-In-1 Approach
               2)  Modular Approach

           We will be discussing a file copying menu option throughout this
           section.  I will cover some of the processing possibilities of
           each approach.

           9.1.1   The All-In-1 Approach

                   The All-In-1 Approach involves including all of the com-
                   mands required to define a menu option into 1 menu option.
                   The All-In-1 approach is by far the most straight forward
                   method, but is not necessarily the most efficient.

           9.1.2   The Modular Approach

                   The Modular Approach involves the selective breaking up of
                   command sets into 'modular', reuseable command segments
                   that can be [I]ncluded into other menu options.  At some
                   point it may become necessary for you to utilize this
                   method, if your command sets become too large.  SYSTEM
                   MASTER's ability to process sub-command sets, puts it above
                   other 'menu systems' available today.

                   By utilizing the '[I]' SYSTEM MASTER Include command it is
                   very simple to create sub-command menu options, and call
                   them into another option at run-time.

                   9.1.2.1   Determining When to Utilize the Modular Approach

                             There are no hard and fast rules for you to follow
                             on this subject.  There are, although a few guide-
                             lines that will assist you in choosing when either
                             may be appropriate.

                             1)  If the proposed command set will require more
                                 than 255 characters to define (Add 1 char to
                                 each command line for determining its ultimate
                                 length).

                             2)  If the proposed command set has a multitude of
                                 configurations, it may be wise not to repeat a
                                 lot of command sets redundantly, as any minor

                                 revision to a processing method may cause a
                                 mountain of menu updating.

           In the Menu Construction discussion, we will cover both methods of
           menu design and then you will have the ultimate decision of utiliz-
           ing the method which best suits your requirements.

     9.2   Menu Construction

           The Menu Construction phase, involves the determination of the
           design method which best serves the purpose of the menu option
           being coded.  Either of the 2 design approaches can be used any-
           where in SYSTEM MASTER.  It is left up to your best judgement to
           use these options efficiently.  After the purpose of the menu
           option has been determined, and the best processing method has
           been decided upon, it is time to jump in and begin defining the
           commands for the menu option.

           9.2.1    All-in-1 Approach

                    The All-in-1 Approach means that all commands required to
                    perform a specific system task are located and defined
                    within a single menu option.

                    9.2.1.1   Defining Menu Options

                              The Definition of menu options is by far the most
                              difficult for me to explain to anyone.  Because
                              of the virtually infinite ways in which commands
                              are used, and data is manipulated, there is no
                              correct way to define the menu options within
                              SYSTEM MASTER.  We will, however, give you our
                              input as to the way the SYSTEM MASTER tool could
                              be utilized.

                              9.2.1.1.1   A Simple File Copying Option

                                          The Following Command set is a very
                                          basic command for copying file(s).
                                          When executed, you would be promp-
                                          ted for the name of a source file,
                                          and for the name for the target file.
                                          No Error Handling is implemented.
                                          After the copying operation has been
                                          completed, SYSTEM MASTER would be
                                          reloaded and the selection bar re-
                                          turned to the Directory option
                                          without any verification that the
                                          copy operation was successful.

           9.2.2    Modular Approach

                    The Modular Approach means that commands required to
                    perform a specific system task are broken into functional
                    tasks and located and defined throughout the system.

                    9.2.2.1   Defining Menu Options

                              The Definition of menu options is by far the most
                              difficult for me to explain to anyone.  Because
                              of the virtually infinite ways in which commands
                              are used, and data is manipulated, there is no
                              correct way to define the menu options within
                              SYSTEM MASTER.  We will, however, give you our
                              input as to the way the SYSTEM MASTER tool could
                              be utilized.

                              9.2.2.1.1   A More Advanced Copying Option

                                          The Following Command set is one that
                                          builds on the 2 samples provided in
                                          section 9.2.1.1.  Although similar,
                                          we are now going to implement error
                                          detection and handling routines.

                                          The Following Command set example is
                                          a lot more sophisticated than the
                                          examples found in 9.2.1.1.  When exe-
                                          cuted, you would be prompted for the
                                          name of a source file, and for the
                                          name for the target file.  If the
                                          Source file did not exist, or if the
                                          Target file did exist, a message
                                          would be displayed and the batch file
                                          would terminate, otherwise the copy
                                          operation would continue.  If the
                                          copy operation was unsuccessful, an
                                          error message would be displayed and
                                          the batch file would terminate.

                                          The Copy Operation Example #3 uses
                                          the SYSTEM MASTER '[I]' Include
                                          instruction and utilizes the modular
                                          design approach.

                                          This Operation uses 5 menu cells to
                                          define the necessary commands: The
                                          first is the menu option call, and
                                          the remaining 4 cells describe the
                                          error handling procedures.

     SECTION 9   Menu Design & Construction
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  In the above example, as the command set is processed,
                  each of the commands is interpreted by SYSTEM MASTER and
                  the appropriate actions are taken.  When the command pro-
                  cessor reads an [I] Include command, the menu cell,
                  specified by the 6 digit integer string it loaded from
                  the appropriate menu definition file, and its contents
                  are placed within the selected menu option's command set.

                  If the file 'SOURCE.FIL' was the response to the prompt
                  for the source file, and 'TARGET.FIL' was the response
                  for the target file, the following batch commands would be
                  written to a temporary file and executed:

                         if NOT EXIST SOURCE.FIL goto NOSRC
                         if EXIST TARGET.FIL goto ISTAR
                         copy SOURCE.FIL TARGET.FIL
                         if NOT EXIST TARGET.FIL goto NOTAR
                         :NOSRC
                         echo Source File Does NOT Exist...
                         echo Can NOT Continue Processing!!!
                         goto EXITBAT
                         :ISTAR
                         echo Target File Already EXISTS...
                         echo This File Must be REPLACEd!!!
                         goto EXITBAT
                         :NOTAR
                         echo Target File does NOT EXIST...
                         echo Operation was Unsuccessful!!!
                         goto EXITBAT
                         :EXITBAT
                         PAUSE Press any key to Continue...
                         cls
                         SML 011103






     By utilizing the SYSTEM MASTER commands in conjunction with DOS & Batch
     commands, the flexibility of SYSTEM MASTER is virtually limitless.

     When defining menu options, always weigh all of your configuration
     options carefully.  Doing so will almost ensure the results you are
     seeking.
