Disk No: 2677
Disk Title: Duke Nukem
PC-SIG Version: S1

Program Title: Duke Nukem
Author Version: 1.0
Author Registration: $15.00 for each episode or $30.00 for all three.
Special Requirements: 640K RAM, EGA or VGA, and a hard drive.

After the tremendous response to Commander Keen, Apogee's follow-up game
had to be really spectacular.  And Duke Nukem is just that--a superb
showstopper with over one Meg of animation and graphics, four times more
than Commander Keen had!

This is an arcade/adventure game that compares to the Sega Genesis home
systems.  (It's far superior to games typically seen on the Nintendo
home system.)

Duke Nukem also has four-way, dual scrolling playfields, and does it
better than any other IBM game.  Features: Large animated characters,
reflections, arcade sound effects, built-in hint mode, joystick support,
cinematic sequences, self-running demo mode, save/restore, high scores,
etc.

Rarely is a game released with such a well animated main character.
Duke Nukem does realistic somersaults and uses his grappling hooks to
hand-walk along ceilings.  Duke is a hero everyone will like.

Duke Nukem is rendered in vivid EGA graphics, with many special screen
effects.  As usual, Apogee offers two more episodes if players want to
continue their adventures with Duke.

This is truly a game that will demonstrate the graphical abilities of
your computer if you have EGA or VGA.  Get ready for a fun time as you
rescue the world from the latest madman, Dr. Proton.
