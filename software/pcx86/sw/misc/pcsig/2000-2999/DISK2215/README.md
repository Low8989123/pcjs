## Information about "ZEPHYR 1 OF 2 (2216 ALSO)"

    ZEPHYR is a fully relational, FoxPro-compatible database management
    system for non-programmers. Up to 25 databases can be manipulated
    simultaneously. Its performance is roughly 16 times that of dBase III
    and eight times that of dBase IV. Using a Mac-like interface,
    sophisticated database applications (including reports, labels, lists,
    and form letters) can be designed and generated in minutes, not
    months. ZEPHYR is the perfect database tool for both novice and
    experienced database users.
    
    SPECIAL NOTE: The Shareware version of ZEPHYR is completely
    functional but the accompanying FoxPro run-time supports only 120
    records.

SPECIAL NOTE:  The Shareware version of ZEPHYR is completely uncrippled;
however, the accompanying FoxPro run-time supports only 120 records.    
The author provides a $1 upgrade coupon with the Shareware version      
entitling the user to acquire an unlimited run-time for evaluation use. 
The unlimited run-time supports up to one billion records per data base.
Like all Shareware; following evaluation you are encouraged to register 
the program if it meets your needs.

                       Zephyr License

     Zephyr 1.0 is software owned exclusively by Ward Mundy
Software.  It is licensed for use by any individual or
company for a period of 90 DAYS to allow you to determine
whether Zephyr meets your needs.  After 90 days, a license
must be obtained before continuing to use Zephyr.  Details
are included in the documentation accompanying these diskettes.

     Zephyr is not "crippled" in any way; however, our license
agreement with Fox Software requires that the ShareWare version
be distributed with the FoxPro "DEMO" run-time.  It limits data
bases to 120 records.  A $1 upgrade coupon is included in the
documentation for users to order the unlimited run-time directly
from us.  Our license agreement specifies that we must personally
sell the application to provide the unlimited run-time. We think
you will agree that the $1 fee is not too "crippling" to end-users.

     You are authorized to make copies of this software for
others so long as the software is distributed in exactly the
form received on up to 2 diskettes.  You may charge a copying
fee not to exceed $10 so long as you inform the recipient
that (1) the fee is to recover your copying and administra-
tive costs and in no way compensates the author of the
program for his work, (2) the recipient is granted a limited
license to use the software under the terms outlined above
and does not own the software, (3) the recipient is expected
to obtain a license by paying the current license fee if the
recipient continues to use the product after evaluating it
pursuant to the evaluation license outlined above.

                   What is Zephyr Anyway?

     Zephyr is a full-featured, menu-driven, fully-relational
dBASE and FoxPro-compatible data base management system.
It permits even novice computer users to develop powerful
applications in minutes instead of months.  Virtually every
dBASE IV command and function is supported using a simple,
menu-driven interface supporting 25 relational data bases.

     Zephyr can handle data bases as large as 1 BILLION records
with as many as 256 fields per file.  Zephyr is roughly 16
times the performance of dBASE III and 8 times the performance
of dBASE IV.  It's Mac-like interface makes a manual virtually
unnecessary.  Even non-programmers can design very sophisticated
applications in just a few minutes.

     Both stand-alone and network versions of Zephyr are
available.  Registration entitles a user to a free version upgrade,
a soft-bound user's guide, and 90 days free technical support
either by phone, mail, or BBS.

     System requirements:  DOS 2.X or higher, and a 640K
PC/XT/AT/286/386 PC with at least 470K free RAM, and a hard
disk with 1.5MB free disk space.  Mono or color monitors O.K.
A mouse is supported.  Network versions require DOS 3.1 or
higher and 640K with a Net-BIOS compatible network.

     License fees:  $50 per single-user PC.  Additional network
stations are $30 each.  Shipping is $5 U.S. or $10 foreign.
