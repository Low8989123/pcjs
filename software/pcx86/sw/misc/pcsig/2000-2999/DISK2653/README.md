Let your creativity run free.  Use FINGER VGA to create and animate     
your next masterpiece. FINGER VGA is a color image processing, painting,
and animation program that works in VGA graphics mode (320X200 256      
colors).                                                                
                                                                        
Image editing features include cut, copy, paste, inverse, rotate, flip  
horizontally/vertically, and scaling to enlarge or reduce the selected  
image.  The drawing toolbox includes freehand drawing, line, rectangle, 
triangle, brush, spray, eraser, flush, dupArea, dupPoint, fill an       
enclosed region, and draw 3D pyramid. The curve drawing tools include   
bezier curves, circle, ellipse, arc, arrow, thick line and text with 4  
different scalable fonts.                                               
                                                                        
Text entry can be written either horizontally or vertically.  There are 
9 fill patterns which can be used to fill rectangle, circle, ellipse,   
pie, and plygon with up to 200 vertices. The screen zoom-in feature (fat
bit) is also proved to work on individual pixel at 16x or 64x level.    
                                                                        
Color image to grayscale conversion is also supported.  There are 256   
colors available for drawing and for background use. Files are loaded   
and saved in PCX format and can be printed to Laserjet in 300 dots/per  
inch density.
