A modern-day equivalent of flashcards, MATH FOR PRIZES is the perfect   
tool to improve addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.    
Focused learning is encouraged by the ability to enter a range of       
numbers to be tested. The program can show the problems with the        
answers, do random testing, and test for accuracy and speed. You can    
even play for prizes when additional incentives are at stake. MATH FOR  
PRIZES is a simple yet effective way especially for children to increase
math scores, but it can be for anyone who wants to do a quick brushup on
their simple math.

MATH FOR PRIZES is a program that is both distributed through
shareware channels as well as retail stores.  Shareware users 
that decide to use the program should register their copy.  
Users that register receive the following:

     1)  A validation number that permanently removes all
         registration reminder screens.
     2)  A printed manual
     3)  A disk containing the latest version of the program,
         if the program has been updated.
     4)  Notices of updates.
     5)  Information about other Software Masters' programs.
    
We have tried to make the registration fee extremely
reasonable.  If you decide to begin using the program on
a regular basis, we would appreciate it if you register
so that we may continue to distribute and support the
program.  We feel that as shareware products go, MATH FOR
PRIZES is an outstanding bargain.

                         GETTING STARTED


Congratulations on choosing to use MATH FOR PRIZES.  We think
you will find that the program is an extremely useful tool in
learning math.  The program is designed to make the learning
process fun, challenging and productive.

MATH FOR PRIZES is also extremely easy to use.  You will
probably master the program in a matter of minutes.  MATH FOR
PRIZES has tremendous educational value for novice computer
users.  MATH FOR PRIZES users will quickly find that a
computer is a tool to use, rather than a mysterious, complex
box of wires.

Some other features of the program are:

     o    Color/Monochrome -- You can choose between the two
          modes depending on your video card and monitor.  This
          flexibility is very helpful for laptops as well as
          for some monitors.

     o    Keyboard Assistance -- The bottom two lines of the
          screen will generally contain helpful hints as to
          which special keys are active and the result of
          using them.

     o    Text Sensitive Help -- If at any point in the program
          you are not sure what to do, you can press the F1 key
          to get on-line help on that item.

     o    Error System -- If an error should occur (damaged
          diskette, etc.) an error screen will appear indicating
          specifically what the problem is.  Although the
          resolution of the error is sometimes difficult, having
          the specific problem displayed will help us more
          quickly resolve the problem over the phone.


But enough, let's get on with the show!

                 INSTALLING/STARTING MATH FOR PRIZES


This program will run on computers with or without a hard
drive.  Also, the program will automatically adjust itself to
run on a color or monochrome monitor, depending on what you
have.  Finally, the program will run on any MS-DOS machine,
whether it be an XT, 286, 386 or 486.


Installing the Program on a Hard Drive:

   To install the program on your hard drive from the 
   "C:\" directory, type the command "MD MATHP" and press 
   <Enter> to create a directory called MATHP.  Then type 
   the command "CD MATHP" and press <Enter> to change to 
   that directory.  Next, place the MATH FOR PRIZES diskette 
   into the floppy (A:) drive, close the drive door and type 
   "COPY A:MATH.EXE" (where A: is the drive you are using) 
   and press <Enter>.  Finally, type "MATHP" and press 
   <Enter> to run the program.  You can remove the MATH FOR 
   PRIZES disk from the floppy drive and put it away in a 
   safe place.


Running MATH FOR PRIZES from a Diskette:

   If you are going to run the program from the diskette 
   (much slower than running it from a hard drive), put the 
   MATH FOR PRIZES diskette in the appropriate drive and 
   close the drive door.  Then type the drive letter "A:" 
   or "B:",( depending on which drive you are using), and 
   press <Enter> to switch to that drive.  Then type 
   "MATHP" and press <Enter> to run the program.

   The diskette should be left in the computer whenever 
   the program is running because the data you enter will 
   be stored there.  Leave the diskette in the drive until 
   after you have exited the program (by pressing the <Esc> 
   key).


If you get an "Open Error" Message:

   Most new computers have a file called "CONFIG.SYS" 
   which allows database files to be opened.  If you get 
   an "OPEN ERROR" message when you run the program, you 
   need to create the "CONFIG.SYS" file.  Although an 
   experienced PC user can quickly create this file, PC 
   novices should ask for help in creating this file.  If 
   you do not know anyone that can help you, please call 
   us and we'll walk you through the process.

Copying the Program for a Friend or Co-worker to Evaluate:

   You should copy only the MATHP.EXE file to the new 
   diskette.  All database files and system configuration 
   files will be created for the new user the first time 
   they run the program.  Copying files other than the 
   MATHP.EXE files causes problems for a new systems 
   manager, can cause corruption to the data, and may 
   prevent the program from running properly. In addition, 
   copying other files violates the agreement made with 
   Software Masters concerning the creation of evaluation
   copies, as well as pertinent copyright laws.


To create an evaluation copy, follow these instructions:
     
     If your program is installed on the hard drive:

        Place a blank, formatted diskette in the disk 
        drive and close the drive door.  
        Type: COPY C:\MATHP\MATHP.EXE A:, where A: is the 
        drive you are using, and press <Enter>.  
        The program will be copied to the floppy disk.

     If you are running the program from a diskette:

        You'll need a computer with two disk drives.  
        Place your MATH FOR PRIZES diskette in one (A:) 
        drive and a blank, formatted diskette in the 
        other (B:).  Type COPY A:MATHP.EXE B: and press 
        ENTER.  The program will be copied to the 
        diskette in the B: drive.  

                SYSTEM CONFIGURATION QUESTIONS


During the initial configuration, you will be asked whether you
have a printer attached to your computer.  You should either
press Y or N.  Entering Y will allow you to print out an invoice.
It serves no other purpose.

Next, you will be shown a reminder screen suggesting that you
read the UTILITIES--APPLICATION USAGE/SUPPORT screens before
exploring the program.  (It is OK to ignore this advice if you
just can't wait to get into the program, but you should go back
and read these screens soon thereafter!)

Finally, the program will automatically configure itself to the
type of computer and the speed at which your computer operates. 
The program will likewise configure itself to the type of
monitor and video card you are using.  These automatic
configurations will be saved and used throughout the life of
the program.

                           MAIN MENU

General Instructions

When the main menu first appears, you will notice that the bottom
two lines of the screen are generally reserved for "keyboard
assistance".  This area will contain instructions as to which
special keys are currently active.  You will also note that the
F1 key is generally available for help.

To select a menu option, you can either move to the option
using the up and down arrow keys and press Enter, or simply
press the letter for the desired menu option.  If you type the
desired letter, you do not need to press the Enter key as you
will advance directly to the next level.  Submenu selections are
made the same way.

Basically, the process is simple.  You should first decide
whether you want to work with ADDITION, SUBTRACTION,
MULTIPLICATION or DIVISION.  Next, you must decide whether you
want to be taught the information (SHOW ALL PROBLEMS), practice
the information (UNLIMITED PROBLEMS) or be tested on the
information (GO FOR THE PRIZE).  Whichever activity you decide
upon, you should then go the UTILITIES section to specify the
number ranges and other conditions you wish to concentrate on.

In other words, if your want to learn the "12 times" tables,
you should go to UTILITIES and restrict the first number to 12
and the second number to 0-12.  By doing so, you will see 12
multiplied by all the numbers 0-12.  Selecting 0-12 for both
numbers would also cover the 12 times tables, but the problems
would be mixed with other numbers (ie. 3 x 9, etc.).


    A - SHOW ALL PROBLEMS

        This menu option is for those that do not yet know the
        answers to the respective problems.  The program will
        take the user through all possible combinations at the
        user's pace.  To terminate this exercise, simply press
        the <Esc> key to return to the main menu.  Keep in mind
        that the method of restricting the problems to specific
        number ranges is through the UTILITIES section.

     B - UNLIMITED PROBLEMS

        This option will present the user with random problems
        that the user will have three chances to enter the
        correct answer before the program will provide the
        answer.  The problems will continue until the user
        presses the <Esc> key.  Keep in mind that the method of
        restricting the problems to specific number ranges is
        through the UTILITIES section.

    C - GO FOR THE PRIZE

        In this option, the user will be racing against the
        clock.  To win, the user must successfully answer
        all the random problems presented.  The provision
        above where the answer is provided after three
        unsuccessful attempts does not apply in this option.

        If the user wins, they will be prompted for their
        name.  The last five winners, with their statistics 
        will be displayed with the main menu for the whole 
        world to see!  Again, keep in mind that all number       
        ranges, time limits, amount of problems and prizes
        set up in the UTILITIES section.

                            UTILITIES

There are several submenus that are available by selecting the
UTILITIES menu.  The items are as follows:

A - APPLICATION USAGE/SUPPORT

    This menu option provides a general description of the
    program, licensing, copying, and support.  It should be
    read by all users.  If you have a printer attached to your
    system, this menu option can be used to print out a manual
    and/or registration form.

B - REGULAR AND PRIZE DEFAULTS

    This menu option allows for changes in the number ranges
    applicable to each section.  Also, the conditions for
    winning under the GO FOR THE PRIZE option are also
    specified here.  In other words, you can change the
    number of problems, the amount of available time, the
    size of the numbers and the prize for success.  When you
    have made the desired changes, simply press the <F7> key
    to save and exit.  You do not need to go through the
    entire list of options.

    When entering the number ranges, you will note a column
    for the A-RANGE and another column for the B-RANGE.  The
    two columns represent the two numbers in the math
    problems that will be displayed.  In other words, you
    can specify that the first number in the problems will
    be in the range 0-12 and the second number will be in
    the range 12-12.  By doing so, you will be presented 
    with problems like "3 x 12", 9 x 12, 1 x 12, etc., 
    where the first number can be anything from 1 to 12 and
    the second number will only be 12's.  By doing so, the
    user can concentrate on learning the "12 times tables".

    This concept may seem a little complicated, but it will
    provide you with much more power in tailoring the
    learning process.  After experimenting, you will soon
    get the hang of it.  NOTE: The B-RANGE number must be 
    at least as large as the A-RANGE number.
    
V - VALIDATE PROGRAM

    This menu option will only be displayed if the program has
    not been validated.  If you select this option, an
    Initialization Number will be displayed on the screen and you
    will be asked to enter the Validation Number.

    To obtain the validation number, you can print and mail the
    invoice (which lists the Initialization Number) from the
    APPLICATION USAGE/SUPPORT option or call us at (410)
    750-0577.
