## Information about "KINGDOM OF KROZ II & RETURN TO KROZ"

    RETURN TO KROZ is a fast-paced action/arcade style game which throws the
    player into a realm of dungeons and dangerous traps.  Collect whips,
    gems, scrolls, keys, and other magical items as you make your way down
    further into the depths of Kroz, avoiding or killing the "text" icons
    that want to steal your gems and, finally, your very life.
    
    RETURN TO KROZ is the first in a trilogy of games. Control your icon
    with the numerical key pad and press corresponding letters to use your
    whips and teleport scroll.  Warning -- this game is addictive fun --
    don't play if you have finals coming up or a business deal to close!
    Previous games by the author, Scott Miller, have won awards, and after
    trying your luck with RETURN TO KROZ, you'll understand why.
    
    In KINGDOM OF KROZ, you are in search of a priceless amulet that lies
    somewhere within the mystical kingdom.  Be careful, there are mysterious
    rooms and vicious monsters waiting for you.  You are armed only with a
    whip and your wits.
    
    As the intrepid explorer, you will venture through 25 unique levels of
    perils and treasures.  In this combination game of arcade action,
    strategy and adventure, each level is patrolled by as many as 1000
    monsters, all with a taste for your blood.  16-color graphics and sound
    effects add reality as you negotiate lava, rivers, earthquakes, pits,
    forbidden forests and more.
    
    Three skill levels and a random playfield generator insure that no two
    games will be alike.
