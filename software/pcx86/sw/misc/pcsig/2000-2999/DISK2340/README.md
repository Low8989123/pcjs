## Information about "PROGRAMMER'S PROPAK #2 (2339 ALSO)"

    PROGRAMMER'S PRODUCTIVITY PACK provides the utilities and reference
    most frequently needed by programmers.
    
    PROPAK provides you with:
    
    ~ A programmer's calculator that works in decimal, hexadecimal,
    binary, and octal, simultaneously.
    
    ~ Addition, subtraction, multiplication, integer division, and modulus
    mathematical functions.
    
    ~ SHL, SHR, ROL, ROR, SAL, SAR, RCL, RCR bit manipulation functions.
    
    ~ An ASCII color attribute chart.
    
    ~ A keystroke reference utility that returns both the BIOS scan codes,
    and the dBASE INKEY() values.
    
    ~ Keystroke recording and playback allowing up to 100 keystroke
    recordings of 1000 keystrokes each.
    
    ~ A screen grabber utility that grabs text from the screen and plays it
    back like a keystroke recording.
    
    ~ A screen capture facility allowing filtering for screen or printer.
    
    ~ Access to the DOS background PRINT facility.
    
    ~ A screen-blanking facility that will park your hard disk(s) while the
    screen is blanked.
    
    ~ A pop-up DOS shell capable of shelling to DOS from any program, with
    up to 600K bytes of memory available.
    
    ~ Complete control of all the hot keys, colors, sound effects, file
    extensions, memory usage, and more through PCUSTOM, the customizing
    program.
    
    All this in one smoothly integrated package.  PROPAK has tools which
    can run stand-alone, memory-resident (even with Sidekick), memory-
    resident with swapping, or as a background task in a multitasking
    environment.  Since PROPAK provides you with the ability to customize
    every detail, it not only helps you to be more productive, it gives you
    the freedom to adapt it your particular needs and preferences.
