WHY YOUR REAL ESTATE PARTNER?

Whether you're a homeowner financing your first home, or an investor
making informed decisions about multi-unit properties, YOUR REAL ESTATE
PARTNER can save you money.

YOUR REAL ESTATE PARTNER, a new software package, enables you to quickly
determine your best total investment, from purchase to resale. Cash
flows are adjusted for taxes and inflation so you can compare
properties and financing options.

     The tax law changes and slowing price increases have created a
different real estate market than we've grown accustomed to during the
1980's.  This market requires us to rethink our assumptions about real
estate and see our potential investments clearly.

     Most people, even realtors, don't have the time to evaluate the true
after-tax cost and benefit of different properties and financing options
during the hectic purchasing process.

     Typical savings from financing decisions alone are $300 to $7000 on a
$125,000 home owned for 4 years.  You can quickly evaluate five types of
mortgages.

     Your Real Estate Partner was designed with the novice in mind.  Its
user friendly and comes with an easy to read manual complete with real
estate definitions.

     For just $49, make the largest investment in your life the right
one.  Register today!

     Partner from the master diskette in the A drive to the C drive
