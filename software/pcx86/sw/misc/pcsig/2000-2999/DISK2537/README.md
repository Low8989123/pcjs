PC-SIG Version: S1.11                                                   
                                                                        
Program Title: Peruse: An ASCII and Binary File Reader                  
Author Version: 1.11                                                    
Author Registration: None.                                              
Special Requirements: None.                                             
                                                                        
A file viewer that does it all!  Now you can quickly and easily view any
size file, ASCII text or binary.  In fact you can even look at groups of
files and simply page through them.  Looking for a particular word or   
phrase?  Use PERUSE'S search functions.  Print the entire file you are  
viewing or just a portion of it.                                        
                                                                        
PURSUE can be customized to your computer.  It supports the 43/50 line  
modes on EGA/VGA, extended and expanded memory, and will run almost     
every command with a mouse.  In fact it can even be loaded as a memory  
resident program.  Next time you need to look through a lot of files,   
just put your feet on your desk, and let PURSUE do the work.
