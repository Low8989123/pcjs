## Information about "GOLF SCOREKEEPER"

    If it were just you and three close friends going out to the links once
    a week for a game of golf, keeping track of everyone's score would be
    easy. But if the rest of the men and women in your department, or the
    members of your club, found out about your weekends on the local
    courses, scorekeeping could get to be a burden. If this nightmare has
    come true, there's no need to sell your clubs for a skiing outfit.  Now
    there's GOLF SCOREKEEPER.
    
    Some of the features of GOLF SCOREKEEPER are:  The ability to record an
    unlimited number of players and courses in its definition area; Player
    history reports, either full history or by course; team definition and
    scorekeeping; player and course ranking reports and a
    foursome or fivesome report generator.  All players and golf courses
    defined are maintained in RAM for fast access and are shadowed on disk
    in case of any unexpected power loss.
    
    In addition to all this, GOLF SCOREKEEPER provides pull-down menus,
    special hot-keys, context-sensitive help screens and full mouse support.
    
    Probably the only thing GOLF SCOREKEEPER won't do is remind you to keep
    your head down.

                              GETTING STARTED, FAST
        
        This section is  included for those users that  are like myself -
        very impatient!  If you would  rather just start  up the software
        without reading  the whole manual, and use the  context sensitive
        help screens when you get stuck, then this is how you do it:
        
        First, make sure you have the files GOLFSKOR.EXE and GOLFHELP.HLP
        on your disk in the same directory. If you do, then type GOLFSKOR
        <RETURN> and you should be in business. When the golf scorekeeper
        first starts up it looks  for its setup file (GLFSETUP.DAT), this
        file contains all of the setup information for the program. Where
        it looks  for this file  is determined by  the system environment
        variable "GOLFDEFS".  If "GOLFDEFS" has  been defined by  putting
        the line:
        
                               SET GOLFDEFS=<PATH>
        
                         Example -> SET GOLFDEFS=C:\GOLF
        
        NOTE: Leave off the "\" on the end of the path
        
        in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file then  the golf scorekeeper will look in
        the defined path. If not, then  the golf scorekeeper will look in
        the current directory.  If no GLFSETUP.DAT file can  be found the
        program will automatically create  one with the default settings.
        Where this file is created is  also determined in the same way as
        where it looks for the file.
        
        Also at  startup time the program  will look on the  system for a
        mouse.  If one  is found  then the  mouse support  portion of the
        program is enabled. To use the mouse, just place the mouse cursor
        on the desired  item and click the left  button. The right button
        is interpeted as  <ESC>. The center button has  no effect in this
        application.
        
        Once  the program  is loaded  you  can  get help  at any  time by
        pressing the F1 key. If there is  more than one page of help on a
        paticular topic then the "PgDn"  prompt will appear in the bottom
        right  corner  of  the  help  window.  You  can  view the next or
        previous page(s) by pressing the PageUp or PageDown keys.
        
        I hope this short description has  helped you impatient users get
        started fast. If not then take this manual with you the next time
        you go to the restroom and read all about "The Golf Scorekeeper".

                                  INTRODUCTION
        
        Why I Wrote this Program -
        
        The need for this program stemmed from the company golf league to
        which I belong.  This league consists of two  man teams that must
        turn in a 9 hole score at  least once a week. The league has been
        in  existence  for  about  4  years,  and  when it first started,
        keeping up  with the scores was  no real problem. But,  this last
        season we had over 100 people  in the league, and keeping up with
        all of  those scores came to  be quite a burden.  Well, to make a
        long  story even  longer, I  was asked  to research some software
        that our league  could use to keep track of  all these scores and
        also possibly  rank the players for  an end-of-season tournament.
        Since none of the software that  I found really did everything we
        wanted it to,  I wrote "The Golf Scorekeeper"  to fill our needs.
        This is why  some of the features, like  the points calculations,
        are implemented the way they are.
        
        What This Program Does -
        
        There are  two main purposes  for this program.  The first is  to
        track  players  and  their  scoring  histories.  The second is to
        generate reports that make administering a golf league easier.
        
        The  first  of  the  two  purposes  is  accomplished  through the
        definition of  players to the  system. Along with  adding players
        their  are  also  functions  to  change  a player's league member
        status  and remove  players from  the system.  The other function
        needed to  accomplish the first purpose  is the course definition
        function. This allows the user to define different nine hole golf
        courses  to  the  system.  In  addition  to  defining players and
        courses to  the system the  user can also  create teams from  the
        list of defined players.
        
        The second purpose, administrative  help, is accomplished through
        the following reports:
        
                * Player roster  (All defined players)
                * Member roster  (Only league members)
                * Player history
                * Per course history
                * Team scores
                * Course rankings
                * Player rankings by points
                * Player rankings by average
                * Player A,B,C,D rankings
                * Player A,B,C,D,E rankings
                * Foursome generator
                * Fivesome generator
        
        These reports are discussed in detail later in the manual.

                         HOW TO USE THE GOLF SCOREKEEPER
        
        This  section of  the users  manual describes  in detail  how the
        program functions and what the user needs to know in order to get
        the most from The Golf Scorekeeper.
        
        Set-up Definition -
        
        In  this section  the basic  program setup  parameters and  their
        functions are covered.
        
        Points Equivalents,
        
        When  calculating the  number of  points a  player receives for a
        hole these are  the equivalents that are used.  Their is no point
        equivalent for double bogey and I don't think anyone will ever do
        better than a double eagle. In addition to the points equivalents
        the user can define a minimum and maximum number of points that a
        player  can  have.  When  defining  the  points equivalents it is
        important to remember how a  player's points are calculated. They
        are calculated in the following manner:
        
            When  a player  shoots more  than 2  points above  his/her
            current  points level  that level  is increased  by 2. The
            same  relationship holds  true  for  shooting less  than 2
            below current  levels. I realize that  this can cause wild
            swings in a player's points. I  am always open to new ways
            to  calculate   points.  It  should  be   noted  that  any
            historical or team reports  will use the currently defined
            points equivalents.
        
        The method for calculating points can be customized for a leagues
        particular needs. See the section on registration information for
        more details.
        
        # of Active Scores to Keep,
        
        In  this option  the user  defines the  number of  scores to keep
        active  for each  player. Once  that number  of scores  have been
        entered the oldest scores are written  to a backup file each time
        new scores are  entered. In choosing this number  the user should
        be aware  that the more scores  kept active the slower  the sytem
        will run  when doing a team  report. This is because  the program
        must search all the way through a player's score file in order to
        find the most recent score. The  default value for this option is
        20.  The reason  for this  is that  in order  to calculate a USGA
        handicap a player must have 20 recorded scores.
        
        Diagnostics,
        
        This  option  allows  the  user  to  turn  on  or  off  the  Golf
        Scorekeeper  diagnostics. These  diagnostics tell  the user  when
        records are being written to the  disk or printed to the printer.
        On  slower  computers  it  may  be  desirable  to  disable  these
        diagnostics.

        Colors,
        
        This  option allows  the user  to customize  the screen colors to
        suit  his/her  particular  taste.  In  the  event  the colors get
        totally out of hand the original colors option can be selected to
        restore the default colors. The colors selected will only be good
        for the active  session unless they are stored  to disk using the
        "Save Set-up" option.
        
        Header Text,
        
        This is the  header that appears at the top  of the screen and on
        every report. This  option allows the user to  define his/her own
        personal header.
        
        
        Data Files Path,
        
        This  is  the  path  that  the  Golf  Scorekeeper  will  use when
        searching for data files. This option  allows the user to run the
        Golf Scorekeeper from a directory  other than that containing the
        data.  The  path  is  good  for  all  data  files except the file
        "GLFSETUP.DAT". This is the set-up file for the Golf Scorekeeper.
        The user can  specify in which directory the  Golf Scorekeeper is
        to  find the  set-up file  by setting  an environment variable in
        his/her autoexec.bat. The syntax is:
        
                               set golfdefs=<path>
        
                         Example -> SET GOLFDEFS=C:\GOLF
        
        where <path> is the path without the trailing \.
        
        
        Player Definition -
        
        The player defintion portion of  The Golf Scorekeeper consists of
        three  parts; adding  players, changing  player's information and
        removing players.
        
        Adding Players - (Hot Key = F2)
        
        This will  allow the user  to add or  define a new  player to the
        system.  To  add  a  new  player  the  user  must provide certain
        information. This information is:
        
                   Player Number  - A number  unique to each
                   player. This  number is 9  digits and can
                   only contain numbers 0 - 9 in each digit.
                   A default  player number  will appear  in
                   this field that is unique and can be used
                   if  their is  no other  unique number  in
                   use.  (i.e. employee  number, SS number).
                   This  number  must  be  unique because it
                   will  be  used  as  a  file  name for the

                   player's history records.
        
                   First Name - The players first name.
        
                   Last Name - The players last name.
        
                   The first and last name are 15 characters
                   each.
        
                   Member  Status  -  If  this  player  is a
                   member of your league answer Y if not N.
        
                   Points  -  Enter  the  starting number of
                   points  this  player  must  make to break
                   even.
        
        Upon leaving  the Add A  Player window the  file GLFMEMBRS.DAT is
        automatically updated to reflect any  changes in the player data.
        If the diagnostics  are enabled the names of  the defined players
        will be displayed as they are written to the data file.
        
        Changing Player Information,
        
        Using this  option the user  can change the  basic information on
        each  player. The  only information  that you  are not allowed to
        change is the player's I.D. number.
        
        Removing Players - (Hot Key = F3)
        
        This  option allows  the user  to select  from the  player list a
        player to be removed. When a  player is removed he/she is deleted
        from the  player roster and  any data files  associated with that
        player are also deleted.
        
        Course Definition - (Hot Key = F4)
        
        This is the selection that allows  the user to define a course to
        the system.  The course name can  be up 30 characters  long. If a
        course name  that is entered  is already in  the system the  user
        will be notified  as such. All courses must  have a course rating
        entered, and  a par above 65.  No courses can be  deleted because
        they may have been used in  entering a score. If an actual course
        changes then a new course can be defined with a different name.

        Team Definition -
        
        When using the  Golf Scorekeeper to keep track  of league play it
        is necessary  to be able to  define teams from players  listed in
        the system.  This selection lets the  user perform that function.
        The teams  defined with this function  are stored in a  data file
        named  "GLFTEAMS.DAT". This  data is  used to  generate the  team
        scores  report. It  should be  noted that  players can be deleted
        from a team. This is done by  placing the cursor on a player that
        is already on a team and pressing <RETURN>. The user then answers
        YES to  the prompt. If all  the players on a  team are deleted it
        could leave a  gap in the team numbers. This  gap is left because
        the team  numbers are not  repacked. The report  will print fine,
        but the missing team numbers will not be printed.
        
        When the defined  teams are no longer needed  the user can select
        the "Clear Teams" function to erase all previously defined teams.
        All  this really  does is  delete the  file that  stores the team
        definition  data. Once  the data  has been  deleted it  cannot be
        restored.
        
        
        Entering Scores - (Hot Key = F5)
        
        This option  has no sub-menu.  This selection allows  the user to
        enter  scores for  defined players  on defined  courses. The user
        will  be asked  to select  a player  name from  the roster  list.
        Likewise  the user  must select  a course  from the  course list.
        After  making these  selections the  score entry  window will  be
        displayed. Scores  entered are limited  to single digits  on each

        Once the  score has been entered  the user will be  asked if this
        score should  be saved. If the  user selects YES then  this score
        will be stored in a data file. If NO is selected then the user is
        returned to the score card and  allowed to either make changes or
        <ESC> back to the main menu selection bar.
        
        If  the user  chooses to  save the  entered score  then a  second
        prompt will be displayed that asks if the score is a league score
        or not. A YES answer to  this question means that this score will
        be used to  update a player's point totals.  The point totals are
        used in league play to determine team winners. If the question is
        answered NO then this score will only affect the player's average
        NOT  his/her  points.  This   alternative  is  provided  so  that
        intermediate  scores  can  be  entered  between  official  league
        scores.  Players   who  want  to  develop   a  good  history  for
        calculating an handicap might use this option.

        a list of every course the selected player has ever played, along
        with his/her score on that course.  If the player has more scores
        on file than the defined active  number the user will be asked if
        all scores are to be printed or just the active scores.

        Team Scores - (Hot Key = <ALT>F3)
        
        This report will  list all teams in numeric  order along with the
        latest  scores for  each member.  The user  will be  asked for  a
        cutoff date when  running this report. If the  latest score found
        is older  than the cutoff date  entered then that player  will be
        flagged as a NOPLAY in the  report. In addition to the individual
        scores  the  report  also  contains  the  course the players last
        played along with  a team score. The team  score is calculated by
        adding the  relative scores of each  team member. Relative scores
        are  calculated based  on how  many points  a player  must get in
        order to  break even. (i.e.  If player John  Doe needs to  make 6
        points and  makes 8 then  his relative score  is +2) This  report
        should  only be  run after  all current  scores have been entered
        into  the system.  In addition  to the  team relative score, each
        player's relative score is also  listed. This is included because
        some  leagues let  each team  have a  possibility of winning more
        than 1 point. Points could be distributed as follows:
        
        One  point for  best team  relative  score,  and one  point if  a
        player's relative score is better than his/her counterpart on the
        opposing team.

        Average Ranking - (Hot Key = <ALT>F5)
        
        Like  the  "Points  List"  report  this  report  lists all of the
        currently  defined  players  sorted  by  their  current averages.
        Averages are calculated as a number +/- in reference to par. This
        calculation method takes into  consideration that not all courses
        are  par 36.  (i.e. if  John Doe  has a  +9 average  then he will
        usually shoot 9 over par)

        the report from  a list of players currently  in the system. Once
        this  has been  done the   players are  listed in  fivesomes that
        consist of A, B, C, D and E players. The players on each team are
        selected as follows:
        
                              The top A player
                              The bottom B player
