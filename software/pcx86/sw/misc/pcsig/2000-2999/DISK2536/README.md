Disk Title: Atlas of the World                                          
PC-SIG Version: S1                                                      
                                                                        
Program Title: Atlas of the World                                       
Author Version: 2.1                                                     
Author Registration: None.                                              
Special Requirements: A hard drive.                                     
                                                                        
What are the 565 tallest mountains in the world?  How about the deepest 
ocean?  There was a time when questions like these sent you scurrying   
off to the library to find an atlas.  That was before ATLAS OF THE WORLD
came to your computer.                                                  
                                                                        
ATLAS OF THE WORLD may not have maps of the world but it does have size 
and location of cities, countries, lakes, rivers, seas, oceans,         
mountains, and even meteor craters.  Print lists and rankings of        
continents, cities, oceans, and more.                                   
                                                                        
The ATLAS OF THE WORLD is not just a reference book, it's also a study  
aid.  With the included trivia game, you can quiz yourself on atlas     
trivia and current events.  Although ATLAS OF THE WORLD doesn't come    
with instructions, it's easy-to-use.
