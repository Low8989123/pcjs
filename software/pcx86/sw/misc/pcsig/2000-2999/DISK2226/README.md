## Information about "INVIEW"

    The key to INVIEW is its simple notepad metaphor.  Use like real pages
    in a notepad, making whatever entries you wish, in whatever format you
    like.
    
    Using hypertext technology, any entry on an INVIEW page can be
    linked to another INVIEW page, any DOS application and associated file
    such as word processors, spreadsheets, DOS commands, or even browsers
    that allow you to examine the contents of a word processing document or
    spreadsheet without loading the actual application.
    
    With INVIEW, you can access and organize your PC in a way consistent
    and in tune with the way you work.  Launch applications or quickly
    locate any file with INVIEW's high speed text search-and-retrieval. The
    built-in time manager traces your appointments and reminds you of
    upcoming events two minutes or two years from now.
    
    You'll never be at a loss for what to do next; INVIEW constantly
    indicates what state it is in and shows you the currently available
    functions.  A context-sensitive Help system explains the system as well
    as providing menu assistance.
