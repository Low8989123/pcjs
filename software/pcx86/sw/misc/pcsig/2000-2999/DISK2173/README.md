## Information about "INSANITY"

    A huge maze based adventure game where INSANITY rules. Find clues, solve
    puzzles, and try to stay alive in a place where the unexpected is
    common, and pandemonium is found at every turn.
    
    As you try to find the exit from INSANITY you'll encounter many strange
    things.  You'll meet a wizard.  Pass through the stars.  Collect
    ammunition to defend yourself against little red men.  Explore a castle
    and a church along the way.  Play games like seven card challenge or a
    fast paced soccer match.  Most things won't make sense, but if you can
    find a method to the madness, you could find the key to end your search
    for a way out of INSANITY.

│ WIZARD GAMES                               Shareware Releases - Summer 1990 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

WIZARD  is a programming collective based in Scotland, with a range of games all
available  only for the IBM PC (and compatibles) via mail order. WIZARD believes
that current PC games are overpriced and overpackaged (not to mention lacking in
imagination).  We are creating a series of unique and innovative games, designed
to  take full advantage of the size and power of IBM PCs and compatibles, and we
are marketing these primarily via the 'try before you buy' shareware method.

If you like any of our shareware releases, then please support us by registering
for  the  game  concerned. Registration costs £12 (US$20) per game, and entitles
you  to  the latest full enhanced registered version of the game concerned, with
LOAD  and  SAVE game facilities and other additional features. Registration also
puts you on our mailing list for information on Wizard releases - and there are
several of these a year!

System  requirements  for WIZARD releases are IBM PC/close compatible, with 512k
RAM  and  CGA/CGA  compatible  graphics  card. We have many reports of our games
being  run  successfully  on a wierd and wonderful variety of machines, eg Apple
Macs,  Hercules  graphics  machines,  etc  using  appropriate  DOS/CGA emulation
hardware/software.

What they say about Wizard Games:

'thanks for the work you are doing in the underdeveloped - yet overpriced -
PC games world' - P Walker,Bradford
'these are just the type of games I have been waiting for. Keep up the good
work' - C Meeks,London

Manage your own Formula 1 racing team! You are in charge of finances, hiring and
firing  of  drivers,  design  staff, and mechanics. You must select and purchase
cars,  engines,  and other items necessary for a succesful season. You start out
with  limited  money  with  which  to  build  up  your  teams,  and  must obtain
sponsorship, and negotiate loans.

Once you have a completed team, it's time to start racing! There are 16 races in
each Grand Prix international season, and you must try to qualify for each. With
a skillful  driver  you may win a race. With a good chief mechanic you could win
more.  If  you  have  an  experienced chief designer your car may last the whole
season.  And  if  you manage to put all the parts together, the constructors and
drivers championships await you!

Grand Prix is, to the best of our knowledge, the only game of formula 1 team
managment available. Its features include:

- run the season with one, or two (if finances allow) drivers.
- control finances, obtain sponsorship and loans (beware the loan shark!)
- control spending on car/engine development, and salaries
- select drivers from transfer market
- experience history, age, skill, temperament, for each driver

- graphs/charts of team/driver/competitors performance for the season, and for
  the game to date.
- customise team names
- slick presentation, colour, sound, easy and fast to operate
- on-line help and instructions

│ OLIGOPOLY                                             (c) 1990 Wizard Games │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

OLIGOPOLY  is  light-hearted  but detailed game of business management- you must
build  up  your business in the face of cut-throat competition: hire/fire staff,
build  factories,  set  prices  and  marketing  and  research budgets, deal with
strikes, and generally play at being a capitalist!

You have just inherited a business, called "USELESS LIMITED" from a sadistic
uncle of yours. USELESS ltd makes silly little devices called "Incomprehensible
Gadgets" which the general public seem to think are essential aids to modern
living (yes folks "no home should be without one").

"Oligopoly" is the state where a few companies between them dominate a market.
In the market for "Incomprehensible Gadgets" there are six companies including
you, and there is some limited foreign competition which will only get a
foothold in the market if the six companies are fairly incompetent.

CUTTHROAT ltd will concentrate on price competition, aiming for a low profit
margin on a high volume of sales.

TOPNOTCH ltd goes for good quality design and expects customers to pay premium
prices for it.

IMAGE ltd loves to promote itself, so concentrates on marketing, again
expecting premium prices for such a fashionable name...

STEADFAST ltd as rather boring and conservative and tries to survive by taking
as few risks as possible (you could say it depends on the boring conservative
core of the general public for its'' sales!)

SHADOW ltd copies you (except when you do really stupid things!), as they don''t'
have minds of their own (shame....).

So the aim of the game is to destroy the competition and get yourself a
complete monopoly of the market for "Incomprehensible Gadgets"

You have control over all aspects of USELESS ltd''s activities - production
of the gadgets, design and development of revised models, and selling and
marketing of the finished gadgets. You have a workforce to control and
factories and equipment to organise, buy and sell.

To help you run this business, you have a good computer system (programmed by
WIZARD, so it must be quite wonderful) giving you a variety of graphical and
financial information. It is up to you to figure out how to make sense of it
all!
