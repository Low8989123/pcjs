Definition of ShareWare



    Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software before
    buying it.  If you try a Shareware program and continue using it,
    you are expected to register. Individual programs differ on details
    -- some request registration while others require it, some specify
    a maximum trial period. With registration, you get anything from the
    simple right to continue using the software to an updated program with
    printed manual.

    Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software,
    and the copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific
    exceptions as stated below. Shareware authors are accomplished
    programmers, just like commercial authors, and the programs are
    of comparable quality. (In both cases, there are good programs
    and bad ones!) The main difference is in the method of
    distribution. The author specifically grants the right to copy
    and distribute the software, either to all and sundry or to a
    specific group. For example, some authors require written
    permission before a commercial disk vendor may copy their
    Shareware.

    Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. You
    should find software that suits your needs and pocketbook,
    whether it's commercial or Shareware. The Shareware system makes
    fitting your needs easier, because you can try before you buy.
    And because the overhead is low, prices are low also. Shareware
    has the ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the
    product, you don't pay for it.

Disclaimer - Agreement



    Users of LCD must accept this disclaimer of warranty:
    "LCD is supplied as is.  The author disclaims all
    warranties, expressed or implied, including, without limitation,
    the warranties of merchantability and of fitness for any purpose.
    The author assumes no liability for damages, direct or conse-
    quential, which may result from the use of LCD."

    LCD is a "shareware program" and is provided at no charge
    to the user for evaluation.  Feel free to share it with your
    friends, but please do not give it away altered or as part of
    another system.  The essence of "user-supported" software is to
    provide personal computer users with quality software without
    high prices, and yet to provide incentive for programmers to
    continue to develop new products.  If you find this program
    useful and find that you are using LCD and continue to use
    LCD after a reasonable trial period, you must make a reg-
    istration payment of $15 to Keith Ledbetter.  The $15
    registration fee will license one copy for use on any one
    computer at any one time.  You must treat this software just like
    a book.  An example is that this software may be used by any
    number of people and may be freely moved from one computer
    location to another, so long as there is no possibility of it
    being used at one location while it's being used at another.
    Just as a book cannot be read by two different persons at the
    same time.

    Commercial users of LCD must register and pay for their
    copies of LCD within 30 days of first use or their license
    is withdrawn.  Site-License arrangements may be made by con-
    tacting Keith Ledbetter.

    You are encouraged to pass a copy of LCD along to your
    friends for evaluation.  Please encourage them to register their
    copy if they find that they can use it.  All registered users
    will receive a copy of the latest version of the LCD system.

About the Program




   NOTE:  Be sure to read the HISTORY.DOC file for changes that were
          made in this version.


   LCD is a program designed to make changing directories much easier,
especially when you have a large hard drive with lots of different
partitions.

   LCD is a work-alike to Peter Norton's NCD command, but with one significant
difference.   LCD works "across all drives" by maintaining the directory
database of ALL drives on drive C:, instead of one database on each individual
drive like NCD does.   This means that you don't have to specify a drive letter
when changing to a directory on a different drive.



About the Syntax:

  LCD partial_directory_name : change to a directory
  LCD md directory_name      : create directory; update database now
  LCD rd directory_name      : delete directory; update database now
  LCD /scan  [drivelist]     : scan drives and build directory database
  LCD /qscan [drivelist]     : scan drives (ignore dirs with extensions)



Changing directories:

   LCD is used to quickly switch between directories across any of your
   hard drives.  You simply invoke LCD and give it the full or partial name
   of the directory you wish to change to.  For example, if you have a
   directory named C:\PROCOMM\DOWNLOADS, you could switch to this directory
   with the command:

                     C:> LCD down

   LCD will first try to do an immediate change to the directory name that
   you specify.  If that change works, LCD simply exits immediately. If it
   fails, then LCD looks into your directory database and tries to figure
   out the directory name that you wanted by doing fuzzy comparisons.  If
   more than one directory existed with the same partial name that you
   gave to LCD, it will display a scrollable dialog box on the screen
   containing all of the matches found.   Simply use the arrow keys to
   highlight the path that you want to change to, then hit <Enter>.



Scanning directories:

   The first time you execute LCD, you must specify the /SCAN parameter

                          Led's Change Directory                    Page 4


About the Program


   ("LCD /scan") which instructs LCD to scan all of your hard drives and
   build a file called LCD.IDX in the root directory of drive C.  You will
   need to periodically rescan all of your drives to add to the table any
   new directories that you have created.

   If you only want LCD to know about certain specific drives (ie: only
   non-network drives), you can specify a drive list after the /SCAN
   keyword.  To have LCD only scan drives C, E, F, and G, you'd do this:

                     C:> LCD /SCAN CEFG

   If you are sure that you don't have subdirectories which have an extension
   in their name (for example, C:\PROGRAMS.OLD\) then you can specify /QSCAN
   instead of /SCAN.  This causes LCD to scan almost 50% quicker than normal.



Direct database updating:

   You can also use LCD to create and remove directories with immediate
   database updating.   This means that you don't have to continually
   scan your drives to update the directory database.  LCD will create or
   delete the directory specified, and then update the LCD.IDX database at
   the same time.   For example, to create a directory on drive F: and put
   that directory in the database, you'd do:

                     C:> LCD md f:\test

   This ability comes in especially handy for users of command shells that
   allow aliasing, such as CED and 4DOS.  With these utilities, you can
   change the standard MD and RD commands to invoke LCD instead.  With 4DOS,
   you'd set up the aliases like this:

                     C:> alias md `lcd md %1`
                     C:> alias rd `lcd rd %1`
                     C:> alias cd `lcd %1`



The LCD environment variable:

   If you'd rather have LCD keep its LCD.IDX database somewhere other than
   the root directory of drive C:, you can specify the filename you want
   used in the LCD environment variable.  For example, if you'd like to
   keep the LCD.IDX file on drive D: in your UTILS directory, you would
   put "SET LCD=D:\UTILS\LCD.IDX" in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

 *---------------------------------------------------------------------*
 |    PCD - another quality, compact MSDos utility program from        |
 |                      Phil Nickell - NSoft Co.                       |
 *---------------------------------------------------------------------*
 | PCD is a utility program designed to make changing directories much |
 | quicker and easier.  This is especially significant with larger     |
 | drives with multiple partitions.                                    |
 *---------------------------------------------------------------------*


   PCD works in a manner similar to Norton's NCD command (a commercial
   product) and Led's Change Directory LCD command (another shareware
   product).  Two main ideas used by PCD were 'borrowed' from NCD and
   LCD.  I liked the 'fuzzy' searching used in NCD, and the
   multiple-drive function of LCD.

   PCD, I believe, has these advantages over the others:

     * PCD executable file size and memory requirements are very small,
       especially compared to Norton's product which has become bloated
       in recent releases.

     * PCD is a 'quiet' utility with none of the flash & fury of
       other products.  It just does its job and doesn't brag about it.

     * PCD works 'across all drives' in a manner similar to LCD. You
       don't have to specify a drive letter when changing directories.

     * PCD does 'fuzzy' best-match directory finding similar to NCD by
       using its directory database.  You can often specify just two or
       three letters of the directory and PCD will take you there.

     * PCD - the price is right.  See below.

   PCD /qscan [drivelist]       scan drives (ignore directories
                                with extensions - much quicker)



INSTALLATION.

   PCD consists of the single executable file PCD.EXE.  Copy pcd.exe to
   your hard drive.  It is a good idea to put it in a directory that is
   searched by dos (i.e. it is 'in the path').  That's all. Please read
   this .doc file that comes with pcd to fully understand the program
   and its various options.



FIRST things first: Scanning directories.

   The first time you execute PCD, you must specify the /SCAN or the
   /QSCAN parameter. This tells PCD to scan all of the available DOS
   'hard drives' and construct a file named PCD.IDX in the root
   directory of the first (lowest letter) hard drive.   If you use PCD
   to create and remove directories it will keep the database file
   properly updated. If you tend to use the DOS MD and RD commands to
   create and delete directories, you will need to occasionally
   re-scan your drives to update the database.

   If you only want PCD to 'know' about certain specific drives (i.e.
   only non-network and non-ramdisk drives) you can specify a drive
   letter list after the /SCAN or /QSCAN parameter.  To have PCD scan
   only drives C:, D: and E: you would do this:

        PCD /SCAN CDE

   If you don't have subdirectories with extensions on their names
   ( for example, D:\FILES.SAV\ ) then you can specify /QSCAN instead
   of /SCAN.  This causes PCD to scan much faster.



CHANGING directories:

   Use PCD to quickly switch to another directory.  For example, if you
   have a directory named D:\QMODEM\UPLOADS you can switch to it
   quickly with the command:

        PCD UPLOADS

   If you only have one directory named UPLOADS on your drives you may
   be able to switch to that same directory by using the command:

        PCD UP

   If you have two directories named UPLOADS, you can usually switch
   between them by just executing PCD UPL again. Since you are
   requesting a change of directory, the PCD fuzzy-matching algorithm
   gives extra 'weight' to finding another directory with a similar
   name rather than just staying in the current directory.

   Experience will tell you how much of a directory name you need to
   specify to make sure you get there.  The more of a directory name
   you specify the better the 'fuzzy matching' will work.  The matching
   algorithm is designed to work best when you use the first few
   characters of a subdirectory name.

   In all cases PCD will attempt to do an immediate change-directory to
   find the exact directory you specify.  If that fails then PCD will
   read the directory database file and use its best-guess matching
   algorithm to satisfy your request.



LISTING contents of database

   The /d (directory list) command causes a list of the directories in
   the database to be displayed.  Any character as a second parameter
   will cause the screen display to be paused each 24 lines waiting for
   a keypress.

        PCD /D                    display entire database
        PCD /D P                  display entire database with pauses
        PCD /D >DATA.LST          list of database is redirected to
                                  the file data.lst



IMMEDIATE database update:

   When PCD is used to create and remove directories it will update the
   database immediately.  This reduces the need to scan the drives to
   update the database. For example, to create a subdirectory named
   CHARTS on the C: drive you would do:

        PCD MD C:\CHARTS

   The directory will be created, and the pcd.idx database file will be
   quickly updated to include the new directory.  This feature comes in
   handy for users of command shells that allow aliasing, such as CED,
   ALIAS or NDOS.  With  those utilities, you can change the standard
   MD and RD commands to run PCD instead.  With ALIAS, you could set up
   the aliases like this:

        ALIAS MD  PCD MD %1
        ALIAS RD  PCD RD %1
        ALIAS CD  PCD %1 %2

   It is possible to 'fool' PCD by creating directories with PCD and
   removing them with dos, or vice-versa.  In these cases the PCD
   database will not be updated properly and will not reflect the true
   structure of the hard disk.  It is only necessary to scan the drives
   again to rebuild the database.



SPECIFYING a location of the PCD database file.

   You can force PCD to keeps its database file in a different location
   and in a differently named file.  The default is to use a file named
   PCD.IDX file in the root directory of the lowest-letter hard drive.
   If, for instance, you want to keep the database in the existing
   D:\MISC directory in a file name PCD.DAT you would set an PCD
   environment variable like this:

        SET PCD=D:\MISC\PCD.DAT

   PCD will then create and maintain its database in the
   d:\misc\pcd.dat file.  You would also want to put the set command in
   the autoexec.bat file so that it would automatically take effect
   when you started your machine.  After changing the default name or
   location of the database file with the environment variable you
   should re-scan to create a new database or copy the old database to
   the new location.
