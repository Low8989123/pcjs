The Story
---------

You are a freedom fighter -- a member of the resistance -- fighting against 
your country's tyrannical dictator and his henchman the Mad Scientist.

Your tiny country is dominated by two massive structures, the Tower and the 
Dome.  In the game Robomaze II (available from MVP Software) you conquered the 
tower and destroyed the Mad Scientist and his robots.

Your escape helicopter took off from the tower in search of the dome and the 
evil dictator.  With radio help from the Resistance, and after dodging several 
interceptor aircraft sent by the evil dictator's forces, you located the dome.  
Your helicopter safely touched down on a landing pad near the top and you 
quickly entered the dome.

Unfortunately in the confusion you left your gun in the tower.  Your armored 
suit has no special abilities outside of the tower.  You are defenseless!  But 
you vow to destroy the evil dictator and thus end the reign of terror currently 
in effect in your beloved country.

Good luck.  The Resistance is counting on your success.


Getting Started
---------------
                               Keyboard Commands

     Left arrow              Left
     Right arrow             Right
     Up arrow                Up
     Down arrow              Down
     SPACE                   Fire
     ENTER                   Select Weapon
      TAB                    Select Equipment
       F1                    Help Screen
       F2                    Display Score & Location
       F3                    Load Old Game
       F4                    Save Current Game
       J                     Joystick
       K                     Keyboard
       S                     Change Sound
       Q                     Quit Current Game (Return to menu)
      ESC                    Exit Program (Return to DOS)

Joystick commands are the same except for the following:

     Button A                Fire
     Button B                Select Weapon
     Button A+B              Select Equipment

When selecting a weapon or piece of equipment use the cursor keys or joystick 
and press the correct command key to finish your selection.  Games are saved at
the last occupied continue point.  Continue points are located frequently
throughout the game on various screens.  If the Stalker dies during game play
you will always be given a chance to continue.

                                       4

                                   The Dome

The dome is an incredibly large structure.  It occupies many square miles and 
is inhabited by various creatures.  Some are friendly but most are not.  The 
dome was constructed over a lake to provide water for the towns built by the 
inhabitants.  Pipes carry water to the towns and other structures.

You may enter most structures.  The entrances to some are hidden.  To discover 
the entrances to these you must listen to friends of the resistance.  You will 
find them hiding in caves and other places.  They may also tell you how to find 
weapons and equipment guarded by the inhabitants of the dome.

Some areas of the dome are sectioned off by doors.  To open these doors you 
must have a key of the corresponding color.  You must have a pass card to open 
security doors.  White doors and secret passageways open without keys.  Opening
Chests also requires keys of the corresponding color.

                                    Weapons

Following the letter W on the upper left of the screen is a weapons list.  When 
you begin the game this list is empty because you have not yet acquired any 
weapons.  When you discover a weapon it will appear on the list.  There are 
four different weapons you may discover.  The sword and axe have unlimited 
ammo.  The bow and pistol have limited ammo, which must be used carefully.  
Twice during the game you must use the pistol to blast away objects blocking
your path.  So use the pistol carefully.  There is a Bob's Ammo store where
you can purchase more ammo.  The number of shots remaining appears under the
weapon.

                                   Equipment

You must find two pieces of equipment.  These are body armor -- for smashing 
rocks that block your path -- and a flashlight.  Equipment will appear 
following the letter E at the top middle of the screen.  You must select body 
armor, not just pick it up.

                                   Treasures

Money bags -- use money to buy more ammo from Bob
Dollar signs -- give you $1,000
Half heart -- adds health
Heart -- adds more health
Full hearts -- brings your health to its current maximum
Health vial -- raises your health maximum and brings health to the new maximum
Life -- adds a life to the game
Freeze clock -- stops all enemies for a short period
Zap -- kills all enemies with poor armor that are on the current screen
Green key -- opens green doors
Red key -- opens red doors and chests
Pass card -- opens security doors

                                Hints and Tips

To progress faster in the game use the power mode.

To receive the secret codes to activate the power mode, which gives you
double hearts, double money, and double firepower, send a self-addressed,
stamped envelope to MVP Software.  Or just register the game!

Follow the hints given you by the members of the resistance.  Go into every 
cave you see.  Other entrances are hidden in stumps, dead trees, rock piles, 
along walls, and underwater.

                                Specific Hints

1. To get the axe, find the woodsman's house.  Find bows and arrows in a secret
room under a stump.

2. To get the green key in the upper NE corner, visit the witch first.

3. You will need the body armor to get the second sword in the underwater 
penguins' kingdom and the pistol from the man in the fence in Fort Doom.

4. Use the pistol to break down green boulders blocking important doorways.

5. Look for a secret entry into the tomb.  Then find the secret passageway into 
the inner room, and find the hidden red key.

6. You must destroy the dragon to get the pass key.



                               If You Need Help

A special hint book is available directly from MVP Software for those
players who would like detailed hints.  It will give you a complete
walk-thru of the game.  This hint book is available for $4.95.  You
need not be a registered user to purchase the hint book.
