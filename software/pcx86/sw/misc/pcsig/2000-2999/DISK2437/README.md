## Information about "DOUBLE TROUBLE AND NYET"

    Anyone who loves puzzles will spend many hours trying to figure this one
    out!
    
    DOUBLE TROUBLETM is a deceptively simple, yet challenging puzzle for
    young or old.  Starting from a scrambled position, the user rotates two
    intersecting circles of colored balls, grouping them into four color
    groups.  As the color groups are formed, the two intersecting circles
    promptly break up color groups already formed.  Eventually, the balls
    will be grouped into their proper positions, completing the puzzle
    successfully.  Try again, but for a lower score!  The program counts
    each key press taken to move the balls into position.  Help is
    available at a key stroke!
    
    If you haven't yet acquired Tetris, here's your chance to buy a
    "Tetris"-like program through shareware.  The object of the game is to
    pack a 2-dimensional box with block-shaped figures as they come falling
    down from the computer sky.  Try hard not to leave any spaces, but don't
    despair.  You'll get it in time!
    
    This game appeals to both computer game veteran and novice alike (it is
    quite addictive!).  Once you think you're pretty hot stuff, NYET
    challenges you to make the game harder -- drop those blocks faster!  Now
    see what you can do!

                                     NYET
                                  Version 1.1 


                                  How To Play

        Randomly shaped pieces drop from the top of the screen.  Your job is 
to arrange them as they fall so that you can drop the greatest number of 
pieces into the available volume.  You maneuver the pieces by rotating them 
and moving them horizontally.  If you have arranged the pieces so that a solid 
row of squares is formed horizontally, that row will be eliminated, giving you 
some breathing room. 

        Your score is a function of three factors: the current level, how 
quickly you place the pieces, and whether you are peeking at the next piece.

        You choose your starting level at the beginning of the game.  After 
that, your level increases every time you eliminate 10 rows, except that if, 
for example, you start at level 3, you will stay at that level until you have 
eliminated 30 rows.

        You can improve your score by instantaneously dropping pieces as soon 
as you have them properly aligned. 

        If you are peeking at the next piece, your award for getting a piece 
down will be decreased by about one-third.  You may find this is worth the 
price. 


                                About The Game

        I claim no credit for inventing this game; that was apparently 
done by A. Pajitnov and V. Gerasimov in the Soviet Union.  They called the 
game TETRIS.  My version of the game was originally also called TETRIS, but 
has now been renamed NYET.  

        Although I did not invent the game, I did write this implementation 
from scratch (using Turbo Pascal Version 4.0).  I did it mainly for the hell 
of it, but I improved on the original where I thought it needed it.  The two 
main improvements are the ability to run on monochrome screens (although it 
looks better in color) and a more responsive feel.  I also used the movement 
keys that are used in the commercial version of the game, although I 
personally prefer the original movement keys.  (In fact, you can use the 
original movement keys as well; i.e., to move left, 7 or J; to rotate, 8 or K; 
to move right, 9 or L; to peek ahead, 1 or M; to drop, 4 or Space Bar.)  
Finally, my version should work at the same speed no matter how fast your 
processor is; I have heard that that is a problem with the commercial version. 

















                                  
                         Changes Made for Version 1.1

        1.  The most obvious change is the name, from TETRIS to NYET.

        2.  The sound effects routines were rewritten so that they should 
sound the same regardless of processor speed.  In addition, a sound toggle was 
added. 

        3.  In version 1.0, the pieces were dropped at about the same 
(impossibly high) rate at the 2 or 3 highest levels.  The incrementation has 
been made rational in version 1.1.  Also a minor bug in the drop routine (an 
occasional "stutter" in the drop rate probably unnoticed by anyone but me) has 
been fixed.

        4.  In version 1.0, entry of a string of spaces after a new high score 
could sometimes cause the computer to lock up.  That has been fixed. 

 

        This program is freeware, subject only to the restriction that it is 
not to be sold commercially.  I would, however, appreciate comments, bug 
reports, and suggested improvements for future versions.  My CompuServe ID is 
71600,521.
