TRAINBALL is a model train layout pinball game for all age groups.
Create layouts with switches, tunnels, bumpers, and other features.
Three trains can be designed with up to seven cars to a train.  Objects
on the user-designed screen affect the direction of the trains, which
can fire missiles at other trains.  Switching is randomly controlled by
the computer but train speed is controlled by the user.  If any of the
trains collide, there is an explosion and the game ends.

TRAINBALL comes with two track layout files and three train files.
Select from the existing files, edit them, or create your own.  Creating
screen layouts and trains can be difficult and confusing for those
unfamiliar with ASCII characters.  These files give inexperienced users
an opportunity to practice and learn.
