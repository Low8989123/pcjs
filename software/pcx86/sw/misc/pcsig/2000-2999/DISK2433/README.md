EBONIZE INK SPRAY                                                 Ed Pruitt

Ebonize Ink Spray is about the best thing I have run across to reduce the
cost of operation of my computer system. I now pay less than a dollar for
a re-inked ribbon. The ribbons are used on my Diablo daisy wheel printer
normally cost about $5.95-6.95 each. With a can of EBONIZE Ink Spray,
I can re-use the same ribbon over several times. I have not kept up with
the actual re-use I can get from one cartridge, but I believe it to be about
twenty times before the cartridge begins to get cranky about hanging up.
Some ribbons may not stand  as many re-inkings as Diablo, and some could
get more. Considering the cost of a new cartridge, twenty re-inkings is good.
EBONIZE ink spray reduces my cost of operation from about $120 per twenty
ribbons to a nominal sum of only $15-$21. The $15 if you consider I already
have a used ribbon to re-ink, and $21 if I have to purchase a new ribbon
before I begin.

EBONIZE Ink Spray has not caused any problems except at first I did not
use enough EBONIZE, and the resulting printout was spotty.
By trial and error the correct amount was soon determined. I have
learned that too much is not likely.  Over-inked ribbons work fine if they
dry a few extra days. The EBONIZE ink is formulated for dot matrix printers.
It contains low solid content, to avoid clogging the print heads, and has a
lubricant to make the print heads wires slide easily. Prior to EBONIZE, I
used several products including stamp pad ink, and NCR ink. Both of these
are clay based inks. These are OK on a daisy wheel printer, but would wreck
dot matrix print head. The high solid content of these inks would ruin a
print head faster than you could say dot matrix.
Several people use WD-40 to loosen the dried ink in their ribbons.
I have heard of some with Star printers damaging print heads. Seems the
solvent in WD-40 loosens the glue that holds the print wire guide ruby in
place. It then falls out. Considering the Star print head is one of the
lower cost print heads to replace at about $50 + Installation WD-40 may
not be such a bargain.
I have just recently started using a C-ITOH printer, and a Toshiba 24 wire
printer. They both re-ink just as well as the Diablo but the ribbons do not
last as long. The Smaller contact area of the print wires compress the fabric
and it does not absorb the ink as well.

Using the EBONIZE ink spray is simplicity itself. Use a utility knife to
work around the lid at the seam. I have found some Diablo brand ribbons
are welded or glued at the seam. This presents a problem sometimes opening
the cartridge. On occasion I have broken the cover. Usually it breaks at the
front, leaving part of the cover on the bottom. The cover has to be put
back on it's matching bottom. When re-inking several cartridges at a time
I have to make sure I get the right cover for the bottom. One other minor
the problem encountered is the possibility of re-inking my hands while handling
the re-inked ribbon cartridge. A little Isopropol Alcohol will remove the ink.
Some Plastic or Latex gloves eliminates this problem.
I always re-ink the ribbons in a throw away box, so the overspray does not
ruin the dining room carpet. Lately I have been re-inking the cartridges
outside. Considering the cost of printouts, and ribbons I have been very
happy with my several cans of EBONIZE. I have even re-inked cartridges for
friends. The Epson cartridges are about the easiest to open. They simply
snap off. The Diablo Branded ribbons are the hardest to get open since
they are glued or welded. I have even re-inked a spool ribbon off my TI-820.
I cannot recommend spool re-inking. The ribbon is tightly wound on the spool,
and does not accept ink readily. I have unspooled the ribbon into a box, and
sprayed the ribbon, then rewound the spool. I have also drilled holes in the
spool and sprayed the ribbon through the holes. I do not recommend either
method because both seem to get more ink on me than on the ribbon. In a
crunch it works, but better leave the re-inking to cartridges.

At $14.95 per can of EBONIZE it seems high at first. But considering each
can will re-ink 20-25 cartridges and a typical cartridge costs from $5.00 up
the can will pay for itself in two-three re-inkings. On some of the more
expensive cartridges costing $20-$40 each it is a real bargain. In todays
economy I had much rather save a few bucks on a ribbon, and spend it on
more software or hardware. The EBONIZE allows my computing expendatures go
farther. I have been able to upgrade my computer instead of spending my
dollars on the output of the printer, and then throwing the expensive plastic
cartridge away simply because the ink was gone.

EBONIZE Ink spray is available from E.A.P. CO. at P.O. Box 14, Keller, Tx.
It costs $14.95/ can with $2.00 shipping. You may call (817) 498-4242 or
