This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
700 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'GO' at the
DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy access
to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.

The Narc utility, newly instituted with the tenth edition, allows you to
look directly at all the compressed program files on the CD without
having to download the program to your hard disk.  So if you want to
look at the programmer's notes or on-line documentation before using
valuable hard disk space, you can.

The PC-SIG Encyclopedia of Shareware is included on the disk, and a
printed copy of the book is included so you can peruse the available
programs from the comfort of your favorite chair.  All the programs are
logically divided into one-hundred twenty categories making it easier to
find just the right software.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed

by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word in the program
description.  A new utility, Narc, is implemented so you can look at the
program files and the author's on-line documentation without having to
first copy the program to your hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and
Narc, you can quickly find the program you want and review it to be
sure, without ever having to run it from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

## QUE.TXT

{% raw %}
```
The Print Que for Windows
Purpose:  The normal procedure for printing a document in Microsoft Excel
and Word for Windows involves waiting for the application to send the entire
document to the Print Manager before the next document can be created or 
loaded. This program is designed to allow the users of these programs to 
create a list of the documents and/or spreadsheets to be printed, which 
THE QUE will then print.  

Hardware/Software Requirements:  
IBM Compatible 286 or 386 Computer
Microsoft Windows version 3.0 or higher, running in Standard or 386 Enhanced 
Mode.
Microsoft Excel version 3.0 or higher
Microsoft Word for Windows version 1.1 or higher
MS DOS version 3.3, 4.01, or 5.0  (untested on other versions)

Installation:  Copy the QUE.EXE, VBRUN100.DLL, and WNDFIND.DLL files into the WINDOWS 
directory. (for this version of THE QUE, these files must be in a directory 
named "WINDOWS")

Operating Conventions: THE QUE, like other Windows applications, is made up 
of Drive, Directory, File, and Text Boxes and Command Buttons.  These controls 
can be operated in several ways, including mouse, keyboard, or a combination 
of the two. 

Mouse operation: 
To operate a Drive List Box click on the down arrow on the right side of the 
box to make the list appear below the box.  If there are more drives than can 
be shown, use the scroll bars to advance the list.  To select the correct 
drive Double - Click on it.  Selecting directories and file names uses a 
similar process, except that the lists are visible without using the down 
arrow.  After a directory is selected, its icon will change from an image of 
a closed file folder to one of an open folder, and the icons for any parent 
directories will also be shown as open folders.  To operate the different 
command buttons, click on them.  

Keyboard Operation: 
Operation of the controls with the keyboard is done by first selecting the 
control to be operated on, using the "TAB" key to move among the program 
controls. (Combining "SHIFT" and "TAB" causes backward movement through the 
controls.)  When a box is "active,"the first item in its list will be 
highlighted and have a dashed line around it.  When a button is "active," a 
dashed line will appear around the command in the center of the button.  
To operate the Drive List Box after selecting it, hold down the "CTRL" key 
while pressing the "DOWN ARROW" key.  When the list of drives appears below 
the box, use the arrow keys to highlight the desired drive and press the 
"ENTER" key to register your selection.  As in mouse operation, directories 
and files are selected in the same way as drives, except that there is no 
drop down list.  To operate a Command Button after selecting it, press the 
"ENTER" key to start the command.

Mouse/Keyboard Combination:  The Text Boxes on the setup screen are the only 
controls that can be operated using a combination of the mouse and the 
keyboard.  To enter the program path, click the mouse cursor on the line 
where a directory path is to be entered, the type in the desired path.  

Initializing THE QUE:  When THE QUE is opened for the first time, an 
initialization screen will appear. If using a mouse, click on the round 
"button" next to one of the application names, then either type in the 
appropriate directory path or select the drive, directory(s), and file name 
for the application as explained above.  Repeat the process for the other 
application.  If not using a mouse, Select the button for one of the 
applications as explained above. Either type in the directory path for the 
application or select the drive, directory(s), and file name for the 
application as explained above.  Repeat the process for the other 
application.  

Program Operation: Use the mouse or keyboard to select the drive, directory, 
and file names of the documents and/or spreadsheets that are to be printed.  
Select a file either by double-clicking on its name or by clicking once on 
the file name and pressing the "Add" button on the right side of the screen.  
Files can be removed from the que by selecting the filename in the "Files in 
the Que" box and pressing the "Delete" button.  When the list in the "Files 
in the Que" box is correct, press the "Start Que" button to put THE QUE into 
operation.  

NOTE: If files in the que are saved on a floppy disk, that disk must be in 
the drive while THE QUE is operating.  

Limitations:  
  File access in this version is limited to the default filename extensions 
that are created by the program (ie "xls" or "doc"). 
  If Windows is run in conjunction with any of the popular screensavers, 
disable the screensaver before running THE QUE. 
  If THE QUE is being run on a machine that has low memory (1 megabyte), 
close or disable all possible applications and remove wallpaper or 
complex patterns from the desktop to improve efficiency.  (THE QUE will open 
and close all necessary applications as it operates.)
  The biggest limitation at this time is that the paper orientation selected 
under printer setup must match the formatted orientation of the document.  
(This limitation does not apply to spreadsheets using printers that allow the 
paper orientation to be set in the Page Setup dialog box in EXCEL 3.0.  One 
such printer is the HP Laserjet III printer.)
  The unregistered version of this program is limited to a maximum of three 
files in the que at a time.

Registration:  The author request that shareware user limit the trial of this 
program to 30 days To register this program send $25.00 to:

Arthur S Chadbourne
133 Parker Street
Lowell MA 01851

Registered user of this program will receive a floppy diskette containing 
a version of THE QUE with the ability to list twenty-five files for printing 
and without the "nagware" reminders present in the shareware version of the 
program.

Acknowlegements:  I would like to thank several people for their support and 
advice.  These people have been vital to the successful completion of this 
program and its documentation.  The first person that I have to thank is my 
wife Gini for the original idea for the program.  Next I want to thank Andy 
Tarbell for all of his suggestions for improvements and enhancements to the 
program (I'll probably be old and bald before I get them added).  I want to 
thank Ken Tarbell who kept asking me for the program before it was done.  
Finally I want to THANK Jonnathan Zuck For his advise and his WFIND function.

USER'S GUIDE

Just copy the program (SCAP.EXE) to your Windows directory. You
can launch it by Program Manager's (F)ile (R)un steps. Or you can
first install the program icon in one of Program Manager's folder
and start the software by double click the icon. You can find how
to do these in Windows User's Guide.

After you start SCap, you can first select the destination either
to the Windows clipboard, a printer, or a file by click on one
of the menu items under Destination menu title. Currently, we only
support Windows 3.0 bitmap format file output (.BMP).

To capture an image, select an item under Capture menu title.
Depends on what image you want to capture, you can choose any one
of the following menu items:

Screen - capture the whole Windows screen image.
Area   - capture an area image on the Windows screen.
Window - capture a window image.
Client - capture the client area of a window (no border, title, and
         menu bar).

Some notes:

1. During the screen capturing, the SCap window will be hidden and
   the application that is activated before you started SCap will
   activated again. After the capturing is done, the SCap will
   reappear and become activate window.
  
2. After you select Area menu item to capture an area image, the
   mouse cursor will change to crosshair. You can now use mouse to
   drag an area to capture the image.

3. After you select Window or Client menu item to capture window
   image, the window that is current pointed by the mouse cursor
   will be enclosed in a bold rectangle. Just move the cursor to the
   window you want and click the left mouse button, then the window's
   image will be captured.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

				 -------

				   by
			       Tom Roberts

		WinInit will initialize the Windows 3.0 desktop
		from a list of applications and window sizes read
		from WIN.INI.  Application windows will be moved
		to the specified position and size on the screen,
		and shown or iconized, as specified.

			  Version 1.0,  August 6, 1991


WinInit is a simple Windows application to set up the initial desktop based
upon a list of applications and window sizes read from WIN.INI.  WinInit is
expected to be executed only during Windows initialization, though it can
be executed at any time.  In keeping with its simplicity, WinInit must be
manually installed, including manual editing of WIN.INI.


			     INSTALLATION
			     ------------

To install WinInit, first copy the WININIT.EXE file to a convenient
directory within Windows' PATH; the directory \WINDOWS may be used.
In these instructions, \WINDOWS is assumed.

Next, WIN.INI must be edited. This may be done using any text editor,
including Windows Clipboard or System Editor.  WIN.INI is normally located
in the \WINDOWS directory (the System Editor will always find it for you).
WIN.INI is divided into sections separated by lines of the form:

	[section-name]		(starts in Column 1)

Find the [windows] section; it is usually first. Look for two lines:

	load=			(possibly followed by a list of programs)
	run=			(possibly followed by a list of programs)

Delete the list of programs on each of these lines, and add WININIT.EXE
to one of them (use D:\path\WININIT.EXE, if necessary):

	load=WININIT.EXE	(Program Manager will appear normally)
    OR
	run=WININIT.EXE		(Program Manager will appear as an icon)

NOTE: WININIT.EXE should appear ONLY ONCE in the "load=" and "run=" lines;
the other line should not contain any programs.  The choice of which line
to use will determine how the Program Manager window is displayed during
Windows startup, as described above.  Basically, WinInit gives you better
control over the automatic startup of Windows applications; it replaces
the functionality of these two lines in WIN.INI.

Now move to the END of WIN.INI.  Add the following lines:

	[WinInit]		(start in column 1)
	win1=1 0 0 250 300 clock.exe

The first line introduces the section for WinInit.  The second line tells
WinInit to execute clock.exe, move it to a window with origin (0,0) and
size (250,300) [units are pixels], and show it with ShowWindow state 1
(which is SW_SHOWNORMAL - i.e. a normal window).

Save the file WIN.INI to disk, and restart Windows.  Windows should start up,
and display the clock in the upper left corner of the screen.  The Program
Manager window should also appear, icon or normal, as selected above.

If all is well, you can re-edit WIN.INI, placing whatever programs you wish
into the WinInit section of WIN.INI.  The format of WinInit lines is (note
that "[]" indicate optional items - DO NOT type the brackets):

	win1 = Start X Y Dx Dy [D:\path\]command.exe [arguments]

Where:

	win1		indicates the window to WinInit: win1 - win63.
	Start		indicates the initial ShowWindow status:
				1=normal, 2=icon
	X		is the X coordinate of the upper left corner, pixels.
	Y		is the Y coordinate of the upper left corner, pixels.
				(0,0) is the upper left corner of the screen;
				X increases to the right, Y increases down.
	Dx, Dy		are the size of the window, in pixels.
	command.exe 	(plus optional drive and path) is the command.
			NOTE: You can use normal DOS .EXE and .COM programs,
			as well as Windows applications and .PIF files;
			DOS programs will only start up as icons, even if
			Start is 1.  Windows will follow the DOS %PATH% to
			find the file. The extension, however, MUST be given.
	arguments 	are the optional arguments for the command.

Commands will be executed in numerical order, not necessarily the order they
appear in WIN.INI.

Note that unless the command is a .PIF file, Windows will set its current
directory to be the directory in which the program was found; this may help
avoid using absolute pathnames in the arguments.  For .PIF files, Windows
uses the Start-up Directory field from the .PIF file.

WinInit can be executed at any time; it will read WIN.INI and launch the
programs listed, and then exit.  As this is rarely (if ever) used, WinInit
has no icon of its own.

		       X World Clock   Vers. 0.95              11/04/1991
	

 World Clock with eXtended setup for all time displays, time zones and
 alarms to any city or country in the world. 
 

 Install
 
 Copy XCLOCK.EXE, XCLOCK.CFG and XCLOCK.DAT to a directory with the
 VBRUN100.DLL for Visual Basic Applications. 
 You need this file to run this application, it is also available 
 on CompuServe (MSLANG Forum /VB).

 Start the Windows Program Manager and install XCLOCK.EXE like other
 Windows applications: choose New and use Browse feature to select
 directory and XCLOCK.EXE file.
 
 On Runtime Error ("File not found") make shure, that XCLOCK.CFG file 
 is in the same directory as XCLOCK.EXE file. 

 
 Setup

 Choose Set from menu of X World Clock.

 Set Local :  Set the Local Time to a certain Time Zone.
              This is stored in XCLOCK.CFG file and
              restored on next start of XCLOCK

 Set Clock :  Set System Clock by Windows Control Program.

 Mouse DblClick on a timer :    Set local time to this time zone
 (if enabled in Special Menu)   for temporary use, not saved to config file

 Local Time Zone is displayed by a different color of date and time.
 Name of City / Country is signed by an asterisk.


 
 Edit Time Zones
 
 1. Select Normal or Special Setup
    Normal Setup: Select time difference in hours only for ordinary use.
    Special Setup: Additional selection for minutes.

 2. Mouse DblClick on City Label:
    
    In SETUP Window:

    - Insert or select City, Country, Company Name ....  (max 14 Char.)
    - Select time difference to Time Base 
      (default London Time = Greenwich Mean Time)

    "Add new entry" saves new entry to XCLOCK.DAT (set time difference before !).
    "Delete entry" deletes selected entry from pulldown list and data file. 

    You must know the time difference / time zone (pay attention to date) if       
    you choose others than defaults. (see example in setup window)
    This feature is also very usefull to edit time zone / time difference 
    changes for summer and winter times.

    For this release you have to look for those time zones. Users of XCLOCK
    are invited to support this world clock with their own XCLOCK.DAT Files or
    messages to Windows Forum at CompuServe. 

    Please send also time settings for different cities and countries in the 
    world to the author (see About Window). Settings will be available in next     
    release as a list of cities and countries you select in setup window. 


 Edit Time Base

 If you prefer any other basic time zone than London Time, you can edit this 
 in a setup window (use special menu, set time base). 
 
 For example, set New York Time as Base Time Zone. Let New York Time 10:00 so   
 Time in Los Angeles is 07:00, you have to set time difference as -3, Time in   
 Paris is 16:00, set time difference to 6.


 Time Display at Icon

 Mouse Click on City Label and minimize xclock to icon shows City and related   
 time at icon. City and time display are saved on exit (if conf.)
 XCLOCK is loaded in Windows as an icon with time display if you edit 
 WIN.INI file using notepad or sysedit: 
 
 load=c:\windows\utils\xclock.exe 
 
 (if you have xclock.exe in a subdirectory "utils" of the windows directory 
  on drive C:)
 

 Alarm Setup

 Mouse Dblclick on Alarm Clock: Set Date, Time, City and Alarm Message in 
 Alarm Window.
 Alarm settings will be written to config file (if confirmed) for use in next  
 Windows session.
 If alarm times has passed between two Windows sessions, you will get the   
 alarms when XCLOCK starts.


 Reset

 Reset sets XCLOCK to default time settings (see Reset Window)


 Help
 
 Summary Help Window, also certain help windows for setup
