Disk Title: BuyAHome                                                    
PC-SIG Version: S1                                                      
                                                                        
Program Title: BuyAHome                                                 
Author Version: 1.4                                                     
Author Registration: $29.95                                             
Special Requirements: None.                                             
                                                                        
Fixed rate, adjustable rate, points, closing costs -- these days you    
have to be a banker to figure out if you can afford a home.  That was   
until BUYAHOME was developed.                                           
                                                                        
First you enter loan information: loan amount, down payment, type of    
loan (fix rate, adjustable rate, price level adjusted, and two step     
loans are supported), closing costs, and points.  Then, enter expenses  
like insurance and property taxes.  Finally, enter in your income and   
tax information.  BUYAHOME then calculates the costs of owning the home,
projected payments, and your potential loan approval rating.  You can   
change any of the numbers and recalculate the loan information to do    
"what-if" analyses.  When you're finished, you can get a detailed       
printout of your information.                                           
                                                                        
BUYAHOME takes all the mystery out of buying a home and applying for a  
loan.  These are the same calculations loan officers do.  Now you can do
them at home.
