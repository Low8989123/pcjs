Disk No: 2697
Disk Title: EGA Screen Designer
PC-SIG Version: S1

Program Title: EGA Screen Designer
Author Version: 10/90
Author Registration: $15.00
Special Requirements: EGA.

EGA SCREEN DESIGNER turns your keyboard or mouse into a drawing pen and
your EGA monitor screen into an easel.  With EGA SCREEN DESIGNER, you
can draw your own pictures using graphics primitives such as lines,
circles, and boxes.  Use the numeric keypad or mouse to draw or move the
cursor around the screen.  Create eight different graph styles, save
your pictures and graphs to disk for future editing, and print your
pictures and graphs on any Epson-compatible dot-matrix printer.

Use the menu system or the Quick Command keys to operate EGA SCREEN
DESIGNER.  The Pen menu items include:  Move, Draw, Erase, Pattern, or
Pen Width (which can be 1, 3, or 5 pixels).  Select the Shapes menu for
options such as:  Circle, Rectangle, Ellipse, Curve, or Line.  Create
eight different graphs.  Choose from two types each of horizontal bar,
vertical bar, and line graphs as well as three-dimensional bar graphs
and pie charts.

EGA SCREEN DESIGNER supports all printers that emulate the FX/LX/MX/LQ
series of Epson printers.  This includes most of the dot-matrix printers
on the market, and a few laser printers.  Choose to print in Portrait,
Landscape, or Oversize Portrait mode.

EGA SCREEN DESIGNER also includes a Pattern Editor Program, which can be
used to change the patterns used by EGA SCREEN DESIGNER for filling in
graphics images.  The pattern is displayed in an eight-by-eight box, and
you can change the color of each individual pixel by simply pressing the
space bar.
