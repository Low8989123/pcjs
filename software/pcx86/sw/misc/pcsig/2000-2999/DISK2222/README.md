## Information about "NOTEABLE, COMPU-NERD"

    NOTEABLE is an easy to use program which teaches music students the
    notes of both the treble and bass music scales.  It does so in a
    "competitive game" format, giving scores for quick and accurate
    recognition of notes.  One can even compete with oneself, trying to
    improve previous scores.  The top ten high scores are kept for each
    separate scale.  NOTEABLE may be used in both personal and professional
    environments.
    
    COMPU-NERD is a tongue-in-cheek diagnostic program used to determine
    whether or not the user has the dread malady COMPUTERUS-NERDITIS or
    BOZOITIS-JERKONUS. These terrible and sometimes lethal diseases creep
    up on one unexpectedly. By answering a few, simple questions the user
    can determine if he has either disease, its progress and the remedy for
    the current stage of development. This is a sure winner at computer
    club meetings and parties, or just to show off a bit of the absurd to
    your friends and prove that computers can be used for more than
    spreadsheets or Galaxy Noids.
