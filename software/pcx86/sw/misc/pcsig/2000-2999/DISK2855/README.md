Special Requirements: Two floppy drives recommended.                    
                                                                        
REXL - LAZARILLO DE TORMES is a great study aid for both the Spanish    
literature student and for anyone who wants to brush up on their        
Spanish reading skills, with the added benefit of becoming familiar with
one of the great Spanish classics.                                      
                                                                        
The author of this program has employed a unique and very practical     
method for study and comprehension of the famous and sometimes difficult
piece of Spanish literature, LAZARILLO DE TORMES. Having provided the   
complete book in text form, the author includes the translation of      
individual words and/or idiomatic expressions to lend understanding to  
the writing of the anonymous pre-1600 novelist.                         
                                                                        
Not only is the book automatically or manually translated for you,      
exercises are included for reading improvement training. One method     
enlists, at your request and at the speed you designate, words covered  
up to push the reader to read at a rate higher than he or she would     
normally achieve. Also available is a tachistoscope option, an exercise 
intended to increase the reader's visual span (the number of characters 
he or she can read in a single fixation of the eyes). An impressive     
program, REXL - LAZARILLO DE TORMES is more than worth its registration 
fee.
