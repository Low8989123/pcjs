## Information about "PROFESSIONAL CAM CAD"

    PROFESSIONAL CAM CAD guides the novice or engineer through the complex
    calculations required to design cams. A cam is a rotating piece that
    imparts motion to a roller moving against its edge, transforming this
    rotary motion into a translating or oscillating motion. Requirements
    imposed on cams vary from machine to machine due to the speed changes
    and type of equipment they are to be used in. PROFESSIONAL CAM CAD
    helps you to select eight different motion contours from a table.
    
    Various styles of cam contours are available in PROFESSIONAL CAM CAD.
    Harmonic, Cycloidal, 3-4-5, Polynomial, Constant Velocity, Matching
    Constant Velocity, and dwells are included. Input one motion contour
    for a sector and incorporate another motion for another sector in the
    same cam.
    
    PROFESSIONAL CAM CAD will display the exact contour of the cam and
    allow you to view the cutter path. See the final shape using the
    cutter/cam follower of your choice. If necessary, re-plot the cam
    before actually manufacturing it, saving countless expensive hours of
    development time.
    
    PROFESSIONAL CAM CAD does the hard work for you. It provides eight
    different displacement profiles for your selection, calculates the
    profiles, displays the contour of your cam and will even save the
    profiles to disk for future reference.
