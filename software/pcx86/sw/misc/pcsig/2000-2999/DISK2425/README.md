                                       Introduction

            PowerBatch  is a  Shareware product.  Shareware is  a distribution
            method,  not  a  type of  software.  With  Shareware you  get  the
            ultimate  money-back guarantee...if you don't use the product, you
            don't pay for it.

            Shareware  is not  free  software. Copyright  laws  apply  to both
            Shareware  and  commercial  software,  and  the  copyright  holder
            retains  all rights,  with a few specific  exceptions as stated in
            this  document.  Shareware authors  are accomplished  programmers,
            just like commercial authors, and the  programs are of  comparable
            quality.  (In  both cases,  you will  find good  programs and  bad
            ones!)  The main difference is  in the method of distribution. The
            author specifically grants  the right  to copy and distribute  the
            EVALUATION  VERSION  of  the software  to  anyone  as long  as  no
            remuneration  is  received for  the distribution  of the  software
            unless permission is granted in writing by the author.

            Shareware  distribution  gives  users a  chance  to  try  software
            before  buying it.  If you  try a  Shareware program  and continue
            using  it,  you are  expected to  register the  software with  the
            author.  With registration, you will receive the latest version of
            the  software  without the  evaluation titles  and messages.  With
            shareware you  are able to try the software on  your computer with
            your  own set  of peripherals,  the only  way to  know if  it will
            function  in your own  environment. After deciding that PowerBatch
            is a  software product that  you will  use, then and only  then do
            you  pay for it.  The ultimate trust from the  author! When you do
            pay for  the software,  you pay  only for  the  software, not  for
            advertisement  for the software which can cost many times what the
            software actually costs.

            CSD,  Inc.  is   a  member   of  the   Association  of   Shareware
            Professionals  (ASP).   ASP wants to make  sure that the shareware
            principle works for you. If you are unable to  resolve a shareware
            -related  problem  with  an ASP  member by  contacting  the member
            directly,  ASP may be able to help. The ASP Ombudsman can help you
            resolve a  dispute or  problem with  an ASP  member, but does  not
            provide  technical support for  members' products. Please write to
            the  ASP Ombudsman at P.O.  Box 5786, Bellevue, WA 98006 or send a
            Compuserve message via easyplex to ASP Ombudsman 70007,3536.

            While CSD has  no immediate plans to move, businesses do move from
            time  to time.  Since shareware tends  to remain on  some bulletin
            boards without  update  for many  years, if  the shareware  author
            does  move, you may experience a problem in contacting the author.
            You may also contact ASP  to learn of the  current address of  any
            ASP member if you experience this problem.

            MS-DOS is a trademark of Microsoft Corporation.
            IBM and PC-DOS are trademarks of IBM Corporation.

            Liscense Agreement
            ------------------

            By  installing  PowerBatch  on  your  system,  you  indicate  your
            agreement  to the  following terms and  conditions. If you  do not
            agree  to these  conditions, you  should not  install and  use the
            PowerBatch   System.  POWERMAK,  SMLMODEL,  and  the  accompanying
            supporting  programs  and   documentation  will   be  collectively
            referred to as PowerBatch.

            Users  of  PowerBatch must  accept  this disclaimer  of  warranty:
            "PowerBatch is supplied as is.  The author disclaims all
            warranties,  expressed or  implied, including, without limitation,
            the warranties of  merchantability and of fitness for any purpose.
            The   author  assumes   no  liability   for  damages,   direct  or
            consequential, which may result from the use of PowerBatch."

            PowerBatch  is a "shareware program"  and is provided at no charge
            to the user  for evaluation.   Feel free  to share the  EVALUATION
            COPY with your friends, but please do not give  it away altered or
            as  part of  another  system.   The  essence  of  "user-supported"
            software  is  to  provide personal  computer  users  with  quality
            software  without high  prices, and  yet to  provide incentive for
            programmers  to continue  to develop  new products.   If  you find
            this  program useful  and find that  you are using  PowerBatch and
            continue to  use PowerBatch after a 30 day trial  period, you must
            make  a  registration payment  to Computing  Systems Design,  Inc.
            (CSD, Inc.).   The registration fee  will license one copy for use
            on  any  one computer  at  any one  time.    You  must treat  this
            software just like a book.   An example is  that this software may
            be used  by any number of people and may be  freely moved from one
            computer  location to another, so  long as there is no possibility
            of  it  being  used at  one  location  while it's  being  used  at
            another. Just as  a book cannot  be read by two  different persons
            at the same time.

            Commercial  users (every user except personal users) of PowerBatch
            must  register and  pay for their  copies of PowerBatch  within 30
            days  of first  use or their  license is withdrawn.   Site-License
            arrangements  may be made  by contacting Computing Systems Design,
            Inc. (CSD, Inc.).

            Anyone  distributing PowerBatch for  any kind of remuneration must
            first  contact Computing Systems  Design, Inc.  (CSD, Inc.) at the
            address  on the  title page for  authorization. This authorization
            will  be automatically  granted to distributors  recognized by the
            (ASP)  as adhering  to its guidelines  for shareware distributors,
            and such distributors  may begin  offering PowerBatch  immediately
            (However Computing Systems Design, Inc.  (CSD, Inc.) must still be
            advised  so that  the distributor can be  kept up-to-date with the
            latest version of PowerBatch.).

            You  are encouraged to pass an EVALUATION COPY of PowerBatch along
            to  your  friends  for  evaluation.    Please  encourage  them  to
            register their  copy if  they  find  that they  can use  it.   All
            registered  users will  receive a  copy of  the latest  version of
            PowerBatch.  Distribution of registered  copies of PowerBatch is a
            violation of copyright laws.

            To register your copy of PowerBatch, print the file  REGISTER.FRM,
            complete  this form, and send  along with your registration fee to
            CSD,  Inc.  You will  receive the  latest version  of the  program
            along  with the latest documentation. The fully registered version
            of  the program  removes all references  to evaluation. Registered
            users will receive notice of  all updates made to  the program and
            these  updates will be supplied  to registered users for a nominal
            charge.  Every effort will be made to supply updates to registered
            users at the lowest possible cost.

            If  you  need  to  submit an  invoice  to  your  accounts  payable
            department,   print  the   form  INVOICE.FRM   and  fill   in  the
            appropriate blanks.

            Registration Fees And What You Get
            The   evaluation  version  of  PowerBatch  contains  100%  of  the
            capabilities  of  the  registered  version.   Those  who  register
            PowerBatch will  receive the latest  release of  the software  and
            documentation  and will  receive update  offers in  the mail  at a
            minimal cost  as they  become available.  CSD maintains copies  of
            innovative batch  files submitted  by users  and will  include the
            best of these batch files along with the registered software.

            The  registration fee  for PowerBatch is US  $30. Price is subject
            to change without  notice but will  be guaranteed through December
            1990. If  payment is by check, these  funds must be  drawn on a US
            bank.  Unfortunately the  processing of  non-US checks  can  be as
            much as $20 and we cannot afford this type  of transaction. We are
            continually  looking   for  innovative   ways   to  serve   non-US
            customers.

                                   Concept Of Operation

            PowerBatch  is a  compiler for batch file  "type" commands. At the
            present  time there  are 35  PowerBatch commands  which will  work
            only in  a  PowerBatch source  file (they  will not  execute in  a
            standard  DOS batch  file). Any  valid executable  command (.EXE &
            .COM) as  well as  any of  the  DOS intrinsic  commands are  valid
            within  a PowerBatch  source file  and will  be  "compiled". These
            .EXE,  .COM  and DOS  intrinsic commands  will be  executed via  a
            shell  and  the PowerBatch  .EXE program  will continue  execution
            with  the next  compiled statement following  the shelled command.
            There   are   two   main   modules   supplied   with   PowerBatch;
            1)POWERMAK.EXE  and  2)SMLMODEL.MDL. PowerMak  reads,  parses  the
            source  file,  and compiles  the source  extracting routines  from
            SmlModel.  The result  is a  completely standalone  .EXE file that
            executes  without  SmlModel or  PowerMak.  The increase  in  speed
            comes from  the use  of  the PowerBatch  commands as  the DOS  and
            executable modules will  not be executed any faster. Most  notable
            is  the  increase  in  speed  dealing  with  screen  writes.  Many
            capabilities  are provided in  PowerBatch commands that simply are
            not available with standard DOS commands.

                                    Why Use PowerBatch

            There  are  four major  reasons  for  using a  compiled PowerBatch
            program:
                 1)  The  resulting  program  will  almost  certainly  execute
                    considerably  faster.   While  it  might  be  possible  to
                    construct  a compiled  PowerBatch  program that  does  not
                    execute faster, it would have to  consist entirely of pre-
                    existing executable modules.
                 2) PowerBatch  commands provide  a  considerable increase  in
                    flexibility and power over conventional batch files.
                 3) PowerBatch  programs  cannot  be  changed  without  making
                    machine   code   modifications.  This   means   additional
                    security for distributed batch files.
                 4)  PowerBatch  programs  can  be  created  quickly  for  the
                    PowerBatch command set is a very high level language.

            PowerBatch commands fall into 5 classes of commands;
              1) Commands which  provide systems  information. These  commands
                 provide  the current  color settings,  the current  date, the
                 current  time, check  for  the  existance  of a  valid  drive
                 letter,  and commands  which  check for  the  existance  of a
                 directory or a file.
              2)  Commands  which  control  the  flow of  the  batch  program.
                 Execute  different  portions of  the batch  program based  on
                 existance  or non-existance of directories  or files. Compare
                 the contents  of one  variable with the  contents of  another
                 variable  or a constant and execute different portions of the
                 batch program based on the results of the compare.

              3)  Commands  which  control the  way  text  is printed  on  the
                 screen.  Change any portion of the screen to any valid screen
                 color,  cause a message to  blink on the screen, or highlight
                 a message in reverse video.
              4)  Commands which provide  string manipulation. Change a string
                 to all upper  case characters, or  all lower case characters.
                 Extract  a  portion  of a  string  such  as the  first  three
                 characters or the last  four characters. Build  a new  string
                 from  two  existing  strings  by  concatenation  of  the  two
                 strings.
              5)  Commands which  deal with screen writing  and input from the
                 keyboard.   These  commands   are  the  main   power  in  the
                 PowerBatch system.  Directly  address  any  position  on  the
                 screen and move the cursor to that position to  read or write
                 text. Automatically center  a message  or title on any  line.
                 Draw boxes  around portions of  the screen  to enhance screen
                 appearance. Read  a single key  from the  keyboard, read  the
                 response to a query that only  accepts a yes or  no response,
                 read  a  string  of  characters  from  the  keyboard  with  a
                 specified  maximum length,  and read  keys from  the keyboard
                 automatically changing the characters to upper case.

                                       Installation

            Installation is  accomplished by executing  the PBInstal  program.
            It  seemed only  fitting that this  install program be  a compiled
            PowerBatch  program. I  believe this  to be  the epitome  of self-
            installing  software.  The  two  main   modules  POWERMAK.EXE  and
            SMLMODEL.MDL must  be located  in the  DOS  path to  allow you  to
            compile  PowerBatch programs  from any  directory on  your system.
            PowerBatch  may be run  on a system  as small  as a  single floppy
            drive system with 128K. There  will be some limit to the number of
            source statements that  may be compiled on  a system this small as
            memory  is  dynamically  allocated as  compilation  progresses.  A
            source  file of  several hundred statements  can be compiled  on a
            small machine.

            PowerBatch may  be installed  from either  drive A, B,  or a  hard
            drive.

            If the PowerBatch source is  on a floppy disk, you may execute the
            install procedure by:

              1) If your  current drive  is the  A: (or  B:) drive then  enter
                 PBInstal <enter>.
              2)  If you current  drive is other  than A:  (or B:)  then enter
                 A:PBInstal <enter> (or B:PBInstal <enter>).

            If you  are installing PowerBatch from  a fixed disk drive such as
            C:, then  make the directory  which contains the PowerBatch source
            the  current  default  directory.  For  example  if  you have  the
            PowerBatch  source in  a directory  named C:\TEMP,  then at  a DOS
            prompt enter

            CD \TEMP <enter>
            PBInstal <enter>

            You  will  first  be  asked to  enter  the  directory  name  which
            contains the PowerBatch source. Next you will be asked to enter  a
            directory name  on your  DOS  path where  the PowerBatch  compiler
            will be placed.  POWERMAK.EXE and SMLMODEL.MDL  will be  placed in
            this  directory. Before  you begin the  installation process, know
            the name of a directory which is on the DOS  search path where you
            will  place these  two files. The  install program will  not allow
            you to  place the  compiler  in  a directory  that is  not on  the
            search path.

            Now  you will be asked  to enter a  directory name where you would
            like  the documentation,  informational, and  example files  to be
            placed. This directory does not  have to be on  your DOS path.  If
            this  directory  does  not  exist,  PowerBatch  will  create  this
            directory   for  you   if  you   desire.  The   documentation  and
            information files will be placed in this directory.

            The  first  time that  you run  the PowerBatch  compiler, it  will
            customize  itself for the computer  on which you are running. This
            process takes about  a minute and  will not run  again. Take  this
            opportunity  to learn about the shareware distribution process and
            how to  register PowerBatch if  after taking it for  a test drive,
            you  feel  you  would  like  to  add  it  to  your  collection  of
            utilities.

                          Constructing A PowerBatch Source File

            Use  your favorite  text editor to  create a printable  ascii file
            containing   PowerBatch  source   commands  and   DOS   executable
            commands.  A printable ascii file  is one that may be typed to the
            screen  (ie type  myfile.pwr <enter>)  and the  results printed on
            the  screen contain  only the  file  contents. Most  files created
            with  a word  processor are not  printable ascii files  unless you
            specify an ascii file output option.

            Compile  your  source  statements  to  create  a  .EXE  executable
            module. This is done using the POWERMAK compiler. The syntax is:

                 POWERMAK MyFile [OutFile] [+M]

            PowerMake assumes  the extension of the  input file to be .PWR (ie
            MYFILE.PWR)  and will  create an output  file of MYFILE.EXE  if no
            OutFile  parameter is specified. The  input source file may be any
            DOS name  of your  choice(including the  extension). You may  also
            specify an output file name of your choice but the extension  will
            always  be .EXE.  If you do not  enter the input file  name on the
            command line, the  program will prompt you  for the name. You must
            at this time enter the complete name including the extension.

            If you wish  to generate a  list of all  literals, variables,  and
            labels  used in your PowerBatch  program, add +M to the end of the
            command  line.   This  variable  map  will   be  written  to   the
            POWERBAT.ERR file.

            If the compiler finds no compilation  errors, the compiled version
            of  your  source file  will be  generated. For  an explanation  of
            compilation   errors,  see   the  section   entitled  "Compilation
            Errors".  Compilation errors  appear  on your  screen as  they are
            encountered and they  are written  to a  file named  POWERBAT.ERR.
            The  entire  source  code  is scanned  each  time  you  compile  a
            PowerBatch  program (ie  the compiler does not  stop when an error
            is found, but attempts to identify all errors on each pass).  This
            means  that  some errors  will be  the result  of previous  errors
            found in the source.

                                   PowerBatch Commands

            Commands,  Variable  Names, and  Labels  are not  case  sensitive.
            Everything  on the command source  line is converted to upper case
            except  a literal  which is enclosed within  quotes. Either single
            quotes(')  or double  quotes(") may be  used to denote  a literal.
            Literals   which  are  numeric  such  as  color  values,  variable
            lengths,  etc. should not be enclosed in quotes. The compiler does
            evaluate  each  literal  (both alpha  and  numeric)  in  the  same
            manner. The  evaluation process is  1) remove leading and trailing
            quotes if any,  2) attempt  to convert literal  to numeric, 3)  if
            numeric conversion  is successful,  consider it  a  number, 4)  if
            numeric  conversion is  unsuccessful, consider  it  alpha numeric.
            This  means that internally  an operand of 3 and  "3" will both be
            numeric.

            A  semicolon which  is not enclosed within  quotes or a  part of a
            command is used to denote a  comment. Semicolons which are part of
            a command must not be  preceded by a space.  A comment begins with
            a  semicolon which follows a space not within quotes. Comments may
            appear  anywhere  on the  command  line,  but  everything after  a
            semicolon on a  command line  is ignored. A  comment may begin  in
            column 1 by placing the  semicolon in column 1.  The following are
            NOT comments:

              path=d:\;c:\util;c:\wp
              path   "d:\;c:\util;c:\wp"
              WriteLine   "Punctuation may be used within quotes;"

            These ARE comments:

              Variable    ColorSave,3 ;save the original color
              SetVar      Msg, ErrMsg ;set Msg to "Invalid input; re-enter"

            The starting location on the command line  of the command and  the
            operands is  not important and tabs and spaces may  be freely used
            for readability.

            Variable names and command  labels may be any length in the source
            command   but  are  significant   only  through  the  first  eight
            positions.

            Variables, Literals, and Labels

            A variable is a location  in memory that you  allocate and give  a
            name and a maximum length.  Anytime you refer to the "name" of the
            variable, you are referencing  the memory locations  set aside for
            this  variable. Variable names give  you an easy way to manipulate
            data  internally within  the computer. The  following are examples
            of variables:
              Variable    CharIn,1
                    This  variable  gives  the name  "CharIn"  to  one  memory

                    position. It  will be used to hold one character responses
                    from the keyboard by the user. 

              Variable    PBDir,79
                    This  variable appears  in the PBInstal  program and holds
                    the  name of  the directory where  the PowerBatch compiler
                    will  be placed.  It is composed  of the drive  letter and
                    directory   entered  by  the   user  in  response  to  two
                    questions during the installation process.

              Variable    CompName,35,"The ABC Company"
                    This  variable reserves  35 positions in  memory and gives
                    these  locations   the  name   CompName.  The   PowerBatch
                    compiler  also places the  initial value "The ABC Company"
                    in  the first  15 positions of the  variable. The value of
                    this variable  may be changed  by later  processing in the
                    program.

              Variable    MsgClear,20,"                    "
                    This  variable contains  20 spaces and  is named MsgClear.
                    It  will be  used to "clear"  or overwrite with  spaces an
                    error message in  your program. Once you have displayed  a
                    message  to the user, it should be cleared as you continue
                    with  the  program.  This  is  done  by  overwriting  with
                    spaces.  Having  a variable  with  the correct  number  of
                    spaces makes this task easier.

            There  are two  predefined variables  in each  PowerBatch program;
            ERRORLEVEL  and DOSERROR. The ErrorLevel variable and the DOSError
            variable are updated  each time an  external command  is executed.
            If  you execute a program  which sets an  error code on exit, this
            error  code  will  be in  ERRORLEVEL.  The  use of  ERRORLEVEL  in
            PowerBatch  is equivalent  to the use of  ERRORLEVEL in a standard
            DOS batch  file. If you  execute an  external command(program) and
            that  command does  not terminate normally,  the variable DOSERROR
            will  be set  to  the DOS  error code  assigned  by  the operating
            system.  It  is  good practice  to examine  the  DOSERROR variable
            after executing an external command.

            Literals are  very much like variables  which have a  value but no
            name.  Literals are  used in PowerBatch commands  when you wish to
            pass an actual  value to the command  instead of a variable.  Note
            in  the following  examples that literals  containing numbers only
            are  not  enclosed  in quotes  and  literals  containing  any non-
            numeric  characters are  enclosed  in  quotes. If  you  specify  a
            number  as a  literal either convention is  acceptable (3 or "3").
            If  you specify  alphabetic characters,  the quotes  are required.
            For readability, and  ease of entry,  numeric literals  usually do
            not contains quotes. Examine the following examples of literals:

              Center      "Installation Program",1
                    This  command   will  center  the  literal   "Installation

                    Program" on  line 1 of  the screen. The text "Installation
                    Program"  must  appear somewhere  in  the program  and  it
                    appears as a literal. It will  occupy memory positions and
                    will have a value but you may not reference this value  by
                    name.  By instructing the  compiler to write this literal,
                    the  compiler automatically  creates the  memory locations
                    and  initial value but gives  it no name.  The 1 is also a
                    literal in this command.

              WriteAt     12,3,Msg1
                    There are  two literals  in this  command. The  numbers 12
                    and  3 are both created  as literals. In this command they
                    specify the column and row location where the string  Msg1
                    will  be written.  Again, the compiler  creates the memory
                    locations and values  for these literals, but no names. If
                    you  were  to  write  another  command  such  as  the Beep
                    command  which specifies that the system speaker will beep
                    at  a certain  frequency for  3 times,  the compiler  will
                    find  the  previously defined  literal  "3" and  use  this
                    value instead of creating another literal.

              Beep        ErrTone,8,3
                    This  is  the  Beep command  referenced  in  the  previous
                    example. The beep  command will cause the speaker to sound
                    at  a  frequency of  ErrTone for  .8 second  and repeat  3
                    times.  The "3" literal will use the  same memory location
                    reference  as  the WriteAt  command used  in the  previous
                    command (ie another literal will not be created).

            Labels  are names of a particular place in your PowerBatch program
            that  you will  go to without executing  the previous command. You
            go  directly to this location in the program from another location
            in  the program based on a decision you have  made in the program.
            Examples will help explain:

              ReadYN      "Do you wish to continue [Y/N] ",InChar
              Compare     InChar,"Y",,,GetDrive
              Halt        999
              ;end the program if user enters "N"
              Label       GetDrive
                    This  group of  commands writes the message  on the screen
                    and asks  the user  to input either  Y or  N (the  command
                    will  only accept these  two characters). A comparision is
                    then  made to  a literal "Y" and  the compare command will
                    jump  to the  location in the program  named GetDrive if a
                    "Y"  was entered  or will execute the  next command if "N"
                    was entered.

              GoTo        NextCmd
              .
              .
              .

              Label       NextCmd
                    In  this most straightforward  use of  the label, the user
                    simply  uses the GoTo command and jumps unconditionally to
                    another point in the program.

            External  commands  are entered  just as  PowerBatch commands  are
            entered.  If you  enter an external command  and this command uses
            command line parameters, these parameters may be  passed as either
            variables  or literals.  Remember that  if  the parameter  is  not
            numeric, it must be enclosed in quotes or it will be  treated as a
            variable. Examples:

              Variable    InChar,1
              ReadYN      "Do you wish a directory ",InChar
              Compare     InChar,"Y",NextSec,NextSec
              DIR         "/W"

              Variable    PgmName,12
              Write       "Enter the name of the program to compile "
              ReadStr     PgmName
              TPC         PgmName, "/ddebug"

            This  third example of external  commands show the  use of the two
            predefined  variables,   ERRORLEVEL   and   DOSERROR.  After   the
            execution  of  "TestPgm",  we  examine  DOSError  to  find  if the
            program  executed OK (Possibly there  was not enough memory or the
            program  could not  be found on  the DOS path).  After determining
            that the  program executed  OK, we  examine the  exit code set  by
            "TestPgm"  to determine  the flow  of the  remainder of  our batch
            file. This exit code will be found in the variable ERRORLEVEL.

              Variable    MsgLine,80
              .
              .
              TestPgm     "Parm1 Parm2"
              Compare     DOSError,0,,,RanOK
              WriteLine   "TestPgm did not execute properly...terminating"
              Halt        DOSError
              Label       RanOK
              Compare     ErrorLevel,1,Chk2,,Option1
              Concat      MsgLine,"Unexpected return code of ",ErrorLevel
              Halt
              Label       Option1

            Note:  PowerBatch  programs may  be executed  by other  PowerBatch
            programs as  external commands.  An option of the  PowerBatch Halt
            command  is  to  set the  DOS  errorlevel.  You could  then  "pass
            parameters"  from  one  PowerBatch  program  to  another  via  the
            ERRORLEVEL variable.

            Command line  parameters may  be passed  to a compiled  PowerBatch
            program. These command line  parameters must be defined at compile
            time and  have special variable names. Up to 16  parameters may be
            passed  to  a  PowerBatch program  and  their  names are  CLP%1  -
            CLP%16.
            If you  wish  to  pass  parameters on  the  command line  to  your
            PowerBatch program, define the variables  in your source  and when
            you  run  the  compiled program,  any  parameters  entered  on the
            command line will be in the defined variable. Example:

              Source for SMARTCPY.PWR

              Variable    CLP%1,79    ;source file
              Variable    CLP%2,79    ;target file
              Variable    InChar,1
              ReadYN      "Shall I copy the files for you [Y/N] ",InChar
              Compare     InChar,"Y",NoCopy,NoCopy
              COPY        CLP%1, CLP%2

              SMARTCPY  FILE1 FILE2 will execute the DOS copy command and copy
            FILE1 to FILE2 if the user responds Y to the question.

            Changes To Your Computer's Environment Area
            Your  computer memory contains a special area of memory called the
            "Environment  Area".  This special  area  of memory  contains  the
            values  assigned to  variables  that  are  available  to  the  DOS
            operating system  or to  any application program  running in  your
            computer.   These  values   remain  unchanged  until   DOS  or  an
            application program changes  them as long  as the  power is on  to
            your  computer. DOS maintains  special values  in this  area which
            the operating  system uses. Your current  path and current  prompt
            configuration  are two of  these values. These values are normally
            set  with  the  DOS PROMPT  or  PATH  command. If  an  application
            program   like  a  compiled  PowerBatch  program  executes  a  DOS
            command,  it is done via a "shell" or another copy of your command
            processor  (normally COMMAND.COM)  which is started  to handle the
            execution  of these  DOS commands.  When a  shell is  started, DOS
            creates a  copy of  the environment  area for this  new shell  and
            makes   the   environment   values   available   to   the   shell.
            Unfortunately, when the shell is terminated (when the DOS  command
            is  complete) this copy of  the environment is erased from memory.
            If you execute a PROMPT, PATH or SET [Variable] command, the  copy
            of  the environment created for the shell to run the PROMPT, PATH,
            or  SET command is updated and immediately erased when the command
            is  finished.  PowerBatch  provides you  a  means  to  update  the
            permanent copy  of the environment area with the commands SETPATH,
            SETENV, PROMPT.

            Command Notation
            In  the  description of  the  commands  which follow,  that  which
            appears  within brackets  [ ] is  optional and all  other operands
            are required.  Any  time a  screen color  may  be  specified in  a







            Page 15                     PowerBatch                     Page 15

            command such as

              CLEARLINE LineNumber,ForegroundColor,BackgroundColor

            the  single attribute which is  used in many color conventions may
            be  substituted for  the  pair of  color attributes.  For example,
            foreground color 4 (red), background  color 1 (blue), is identical
            to  color attribute 20 and  the CLEARLINE command may be specified
            EITHER as 

              CLEARLINE 14,4,1
            or
              CLEARLINE 14,20

            to  clear  line  14 on  the  screen  to  red  foreground  on  blue
            background.  For  this reason  anytime  that  the operand  pair of
            foreground  color, background color  is required, the single color
            attribute  may be substituted for  the pair. The compiler will not
            detect  missing background  color attributes but  will assume that
            the foreground is the composite value.

            Command Syntax
            The  number which  is immediately  under the  command name  is the
            line  number in  the DEMO1 file (printed  in the examples section)
            which uses this command.

            ?COLOR        VarName1, VarName2, VarName3
            (25) Retrieve  the current  color attributes  from the  system and
                    place  the  current  foreground  color  in  VarName1,  the
                    current  background color  in VarName2,  and the composite
                    attribute in VarName3.

                 Ex:   Variable ForeColor,3
                       Variable BackColor,3
                       Variable ColorAttr,3
                       ?Color   ForeColor,BackColor,ColorAttr

                    Retrieve  the current foreground, background and composite
                       color  values and  place  in  the variables  ForeColor,
                       BackColor, and ColorAttr repectively.

            ?CURRDIR      VarName1, VarName2
                 Retrieve the current drive and  directory from the system and
                    place  the  current  drive in  VarName1  and  the  current
                    directory  in VarName2. The  contents of VarName1 prior to
                    execution of this command  control which currently  logged
                    drive  is searched for  the currently logged directory. If
                    ?CurrDir finds a valid drive letter  in the first position
                    of VarName1,  then the  contents of VarName2  will be  the
                    currently  logged directory  of that  drive. If  the first
                    position  of  VarName1  does not  contain  a  valid  drive
                    letter, then  VarName2 will contain  the currently  logged







            Page 16                     PowerBatch                     Page 16

                    directory  of the  current drive. In  either case VarName1
                    will  contain  the drive  and  VarName2 will  contain  the
                    directory.

                 Ex:   Variable    CurrDrive,2
                       Variable    CurrDir,79
                       Set         CurrDrive,"A"
                       ?CurrDir    CurrDrive,CurrDir
                       Set         CurrDrive,""
                       ?CurrDir    CurrDrive,CurrDir

                 In the first usage of ?CurrDir,  assuming that the  currently
                    logged directory  on the  A drive is  the root  directory,
                    CurrDrive  will contain  "A" and CurrDir  will contain "\"
                    after  the  execution of  ?CurrDir. In  the second  usage,
                    assuming that the  currently logged  drive is  D: and  the
                    currently   logged   directory  on   the   D:   drive   is
                    "\UTIL\EXEC", CurrDrive will contain  "D" and CurrDir will
                    contain "\UTIL\EXEC" after the execution of ?CurrDir.

            ?DATE         VarName1, VarName2, VarName3, VarName4
            (26) Retrieve  the current date from  the system and place the day
                    of  the week  in VarName1, the month  in VarName2, the day
                    in VarName3, and  the year in VarName4. VarName1 should be
                    defined  as 9  long, VarName2 and VarName3  as 2 long, and
                    VarName4 as 4 long.

                 Ex:   Variable DOW,9
                       Variable Mo,2
                       Variable Da,2
                       Variable Yr,4
                       ?Date    DOW,Mo,Da,Yr

                    Retrieve  the current  date and place  the component parts
                       in  their respective  variables. Place  the day  of the
                       week  in DOW (ie Saturday),  the month number in Mo (ie
                       06), the day of the  month in Da (ie  29), and the year
                       in Yr (ie 1990).

            ?DIREXIST     VarName1, Label1 [,Label2]
            (159)         Literal1,Label1 [,Label2]
                 Check  the system for  the existance  of the  directory whose
                    name appears in VarName1 or in Literal1. If the  directory
                    exists  jump to the  command immediately following Label1,
                    if the  directory  does  not exist,  jump to  the  command
                    immediately following Label2.

                 Ex:   ?DirExist   InpStr,DirOk,BadDir
                       ?DirExist   "C:\",DirOK,BadDir
                       ?DirExist   InpStr,,BadDir (next command if exists)
                       ?DirExist   InpStr,DirOk   (next command if not exist)
                 In  the first example if  the contents of the variable InpStr
                    exists then  goto label DirOK, if it does not  exist go to
                    the  label BadDir. In the  second example we check for the
                    existance  of  a literal  with a  value of  "C:\". In  the
                    third example, if the  contents of InpStr  exist we  "fall
                    through"  to the  next instruction, if  the directory does
                    not  exist  we jump  to the  label BadDir.  In the  fourth
                    example, if the directory  name in InpStr  exists, we jump
                    to  the label DirOK, if  it does not exist we fall through
                    to the next command.

            ?DISKSPACE    VarName1, VarName2, VarName3
            (184)         Literal1, VarName1, VarName2
                 Query  the disk  Drive specified  by the  first  character of
                    Varname1 and  place the  total disk capacity  in bytes  in
                    VarName2  and  the unused  bytes  in VarName3.  Since  the
                    command looks at only  the first character of VarName1 (or
                    Literal1),  VarName1   may   contains   strings  such   as
                    "C:\UTIL".
                 Ex:   Variable    DirName,79
                       ReadStr     DirName  (user enters "c:\util")
                       Upper       DirName  (changes to "C:\UTIL")

            ?DRIVEEXIST   VarName1, Label1 [,Label2]
            (145)         Literal1, Label1 [,Label2]
                 Check  the system  for VarName1 as  a valid drive  letter. If
                    the  drive  is  valid, jump  to  the  command  immediately
                    following  Label1, if  the drive is not  valid jump to the
                    command immediately following Label2.

                 Ex:   ?DriveExist DrvNum,GoodDrv,BadDrv
                       ?DriveExist "A",GoodDrv,BadDrv
                       ?DriveExist DrvNum,,BadDrv

            ?ENVSTR       VarName1, VarName2
                          Literal1, VarName2
                 Retrieve  the contents  of any environment  variable from the
                    system  environment  area.  The  name  of  the environment
                    variable  is placed  in VarName1  or entered as  a literal
                    and  the  contents of  the  environment variable  will  be
                    placed  in VarName2. Ensure that VarName2 has been defined
                    sufficiently  long enough  to contain the  contents of the
                    environment  variable. If VarName2 is not long enough, the
                    environment variable will be truncated.

                 Ex:   Variable    EnvValue,255
                       Variable    EnvName,4,"path"
                       ?EnvStr     "prompt", EnvValue

            ?FILEEXIST    VarName1, Label1 [,Label2]
            (172)         Literal, Label1 [,Label2]
                 Check  the system  for the specified  file name. If  the file
                    exists, jump to the command  immediately following Label1,
                    if  the  file  does  not  exist,   jump  to  the   command
                    immediately following Label2.

                 Ex:   ?FileExist  FileName, Label1, Label2
                       ?FileExist  "C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT",StartOK,NoStart
                       ?FileExist  FileName,,Label2

            ?INPATH       VarName1, Label1 [,Label2]
                          Literal1, Label2 [,Label2]
                 Compare the contents  of VarName1 to the system search  path.
                    If  VarName1  is contained  within the  path  jump to  the
                    command  immediately  following Label1,  if the  file does
                    not  exist  jump  to  the  command  immediately  following
                    Label2. Use this command  to determine if  a directory  is
                    specified in the DOS search path.

                 Ex:   DOS search path contains "C:\UTIL;C:\WORDPROC;D:\"
                       Variable    InString,79
                       Write       "Enter your directory name "
                       ReadStr     InString (user enters "c:\wordproc")
                       Upper       InString (change to "C:\WORDPROC")
                       ?InPath     InString,PathOK,BadPath

                       ?InPath     "C:\UTIL",,BadPath   (compare literal)

            ?TIME         VarName1
            (27) Retrieve  the  current time  from  the  system  and place  in
                    VarName1. The format of the time is hh:mm:ss xm.  VarName1
                    should be defined as 11 long.
                 Ex:   Variable CurrTime,11
                       ?Time    CurrTime (now contains 11:24:14 am)

                 Sound  the system speaker  with a tone of VarName1 frequency,
                    for  a length  of VarName2 tenths of  a second, and repeat
                    VarName3 times.
                 Ex:   Beep  800,5,3

                    The first  example sound the system speaker at a frequency
                       of 800 hz  for half a second (.5) and repeats twice for
                       a  total of 3 times.  The second example will sound the
                       system speaker at a frequency equal to the contents  of
                       the  variable ErrFreq for BeepLen tenths of a second(s)
                       for a total of ErrTimes.

            BLINK
            (82)
                 Cause  all text that is written to the  screen to blink using

                    Write the message "Not a valid entry" at  column 15 on row
                       4  using the  current color definition.  Reset the text
                       color  to  the  value  it  contained  before specifying
                       blinking text. Wait 3.5 seconds and clear the message.

            (36)          Lit1, Lit2, Lit3, Lit4, Lit5 [,Lit6]
                 Draw  a  box  (frame) on  the  screen  whose upper  left  co-
                    ordinates  (X,Y) are VarNm1, VarNm2, and whose lower right
                    co_ordinates  (X,Y) are VarNm3, VarNm4. Draw the box using
                    a  line  in foreground  color VarNm5  on background  color
                    VarNm6.

                    The  first  example  draws  a  box whose  upper  left  co-
                       ordinates  are the  contents of  the variables  ULX and
                       ULY  and whose lower left co-ordinates are the contents
                       of  the variables  LRX and LRY. The  box border will be
                       the  contents  of  BoxFore (red)  on  a  background  of
                       BoxBack  (black).  The  interior of  the  box  will  be
                       unchanged  (ie it  is  not  cleared  nor is  the  color
                       changed).  The second  example draws a  box whose upper
                       left  co-ordinates are  5,3 and  whose lower  right co-
                       ordinates are  75,20. The box  border is drawn in white
                       on  black. The third example  draws a box with the same
                       co-ordinates  and uses the composite color attribute of
                       112 (white on black). See ClearBox command.

            BREAKON
                 Provides a  capability to exit  from a  PowerBatch program by
                    pressing  the  combination  of  keys  (Ctrl  -  Break)  or
                    (Ctrl - C). The default value  set at the beginning of any
                    PowerBatch  program  is  BreakON.  To  keep  a  user  from
                    exiting   a  running   PowerBatch  program,   execute  the
                    BreakOFF  command. If sections  of the  program are  to be
                    protected and  other sections not,  surround the  sections
                    with pairs of BreakON...BreakOFF commands.

            BREAKOFF
                 Disables   the  ability  to  stop  a  PowerBatch  program  by
                    pressing  the   (Ctrl  -   Break)  or  (Ctrl   -  C)   key
                    combinations.  The default  value set at  the beginning of
                    any PowerBatch program is BreakON.

            CENTER        VarName1, VarName2
            (42)          Literal1, Literal2
                 Center the text in VarName1 on line VarName2.

                 Ex:   Variable InpStr,25,"PowerBatch"
                       Center   "PowerBatch",2
                       Center   InpStr,2

                    Both  versions  of  this  example  will  center  the  name
                       "PowerBatch" on line 2 of the screen.

            CLEAR         VarName1 [,VarName2]
            (28)          Literal1 [,Literal2]
                 Clear  the  entire screen  to foreground  color VarName1  and
                    background color VarName2.

                 Ex:   Variable ColorAttr,3,112   ;define white on black
                       Clear    4,1
                       Clear    112
                       Clear    ColorAttr
                    The  first example  clears the screen to  red on blue. The
                       second and third examples clear  the screen to white on

            CLEARBOX      VarNm1, VarNm2, VarNm3, VarNm4, VarNm5 [,VarNm6]
            (37)          Lit1, Lit2, Lit3, Lit4, Lit5 [,Lit6]
                 Clear  the interior of  the box whose upper left co-ordinates
                    (X,Y)  are  VarNm1,  VarNm2  and  whose  lower  right  co-
                    ordinates  (X,Y) are VarNm3, VarNm4. Clear the interior of
                    the  box to  foreground color VarNm5  and background color
                    VarNm6. This command  clears the "inside" of the box,  not
                    the lines which describe the box.
                 Ex:   Variable ULX,2,5     ;upper left col value
                       Variable ULY,2,3     ;upper left row value
                       Variable LRX,2,75    ;lower right col value
                       Variable LRY,2,20    ;lower right row value
                       Variable BoxFore,2,4 ;foreground color red
                       Variable BoxBack,2,0 ;background color black
                       Box1     ULX, ULY, LRX, LRY, BoxFore, BoxBack
                       ClearBox 5,3,75,20,112

                    In  this example we define  the upper right and lower left
                       co-ordinates of the box as well  as the colors  BoxFore
                       and  BoxBack. We  draw  the box  with a  red line  on a
                       black  background.  The  ClearBox  command  clears  the
                       interior of the box to white on black.

            CLEARLINE     VarName1, VarName2 [,VarName3]
                          Literal1, literal2 [,Literal3]
                 Clear the  line number specified  by VarName1 to a foreground
                    color of VarName2 and a background color of VarName3.

                 Ex:   Variable    Red,1,4
                       Variable    Blue,1,1
                       Variable    RedOnBlue,2,20
                       Variable    CurrLine,2,12
                       ClearLine   12,Red,Blue
                       ClearLine   CurrLine,RedOnBlue

                    Both  examples of the  ClearLine command  clear line 12 on
                       the  screen to red foreground color and blue background
                       color.

            COLOR         VarName1 [,VarName2]
            (38)          Literal1 [,Literal2]
                 Set  the  default  color to  foreground  color  VarName1  and
                    background color  VarName2 or optionally  set the  default
                    color attribute to VarName1.
                 Ex:   Variable RedOnBlue,2,20
                       Color    4,1
                       Color    MenuClr

                    Both  examples set  the default color  to red on  blue for
                       any  text written to  the screen without specific color

                 Compare   the  contents  of   VarName1  to  the  contents  of
                    VarName2.  If VarName1  greater than VarName2  jump to the
                    statement  following   Label1.  If   VarName1  less   than
                    VarName2  jump  to  the  statement  following  Label2.  If
                    VarName1  equal VarName2  jump to  the statement following
                    Label3.   If  the  contents  of  the  first  two  operands
                    (VarName1,  VarName2, Literal1,  or Literal2)  are numeric
                    then   a  numeric   compare  is  performed   otherwise  an
                    alphabetic   compare   is  made.   (If   19   is  compared
                    alphabetically to  2, then 2 is greater than 19;  if it is
                    compared numerically, 19 is greater than 2.)

                 Ex:   Variable InChar,1
                       Variable Yes,1,"Y"
                       Variable No,1,"N"
                       GoToXY   4,23
                       ReadYN   "Incorrect entry...Continue [Y/N] "
                       Compare  InChar,"Y",NoIn,NoIn,YesIn

                       Compare  InChar,Yes,,,YesIn   (Not Y falls thru)

                       Compare  InChar,"Y",NoIn,NoIn (Y falls thru)

                    In  the  first example  of the  Compare command,  variable
                       InChar  is  compared  to  literal  "Y".  If  InChar  is
                       greater than  "Y" then  the program  will  jump to  the
                       label NoIn;  if InChar  is less than  "Y", the  program
                       also  jumps to  the label NoIn;  if InChar is  equal to
                       "Y",  the program will continue processing at the label
                       named  YesIn.  In  the  second   compare  command,  the
                       variable  InChar is compared  to the variable Yes which
                       has an  assigned value of "Y".  If the variable  InChar
                       contains anything but  "Y", the program  continues with
                       the  next instruction after  the compare command (it is
                       said  to  fall through);  if InChar  contains "Y",  the
                       program  will jump  to the  label YesIn.  In the  third
                       compare  command, variable  InChar is  compared  to the
                       literal  "Y".  If  the  variable  InChar  contains  "N"
                       (ReadYN  prevents any  entry but  Y  or N)  the program
                       jumps  to the  label NoIn  otherwise it  continues with
                       the instruction after the compare command.

            CONCAT     VarName1, VarName2 [,VarName3]
            (116)      VarName1, Literal1 [,Literal2]
                 Concatenate  the  string  in  VarName2  with  the  string  in
                    VarName3 and place the result in VarName1. If VarName3  is
                    not  present then concatenate  the string in VarName1 with
                    the string in VarName2 and place the result in VarName1.
                 Ex:   Variable    OutMsg,78
                       Variable    ErrMsg," is not a valid Drive letter."
                       Variable    DriveLtr,1
                       WriteAt     6,17,"Enter your source drive letter "
                       ReadUpKey   DriveLtr
                       ?DriveExist DriveLtr,DriveOK
                       Concat      OutMsg, "[19] ", DriveLtr
                       Concat      OutMsg, " is not a valid Drive letter."
                       WriteAt     5,23,OutMsg

                    In  this example we  ask the  user to input  a valid drive
                       letter  and  verify  this  drive  with  the ?DriveExist
                       command.  If  the drive  is  not valid  we  concatenate
                       "[19]"  (the  error  number)  plus   the  drive  letter
                       entered by the user into the  variable OutMsg. We  then
                       concatenate the error  message (" is not a valid  Drive
                       letter.")  onto  the  contents  of  OutMsg. The  result
                       would  be something  like "[19] L is  not a valid Drive
                       letter."

            GOTO       Label1
            (152)
                 Jump to the statement identified as command label Label1.
                 Ex:   GoTo  Error
                       GoTo  EndOfPgm

            GOTOXY     VarName1, VarName2
            (57)       Literal1, Literal2
                 Move  the cursor to the  column (X) specified in VarName1 and
                    row (Y) specified in VarName2.
                 Ex:   Variable CurrX,2
                       Variable CurrY,2
                       GoToXY   CurrX, CurrY
                       GoToXY   12,6

                    In  the first example the  cursor is moved to the location
                       specified  by the contents of variable CurrX and CurrY.
                       In  the second  example,  the cursor  is  moved  to the
                       location specified by two literals "12" and "6".

            HALT       VarName1
                       Literal1
                 Halt the  batch file  processing and  set  DOS errorlevel  to
                    VarName1.
                 Ex:   Variable Error14,2,14   ;define Error14 as "14"
                       Halt     99
                       Halt     Error14

                    In the  first usage  of the Halt  command, the  PowerBatch
                       program  is halted and the DOS errorlevel is set to 99.
                       In  the second usage the  program is halted and the DOS
                       errorlevel  is set to  the contents of variable Error14
                       ("14").

            LABEL      LabelName
            (34) Define  a location  in the list of  commands that will enable
                    execution  to  begin  immediately following  this  command
                    without    necessarily   having   executed   the   command
                    immediately  prior to the  Label. Jump immediately to this
                    location  in  the command  stream. See  the discussion  on
                    labels at the beginning of this section.

                 Ex:   Label    MatchErr
                       Label    EndOfPgm

            LENGTH     VarName1, VarName2
            (129)      VarName1, Literal1
                 Calculate the  length of the  string in variable VarName2 and
                    place the result in VarName1.
                 Ex:   Variable InString
                       Variable StrLen
                       WriteAt  12,14,"Enter your current directory "
                       ReadStr  InString (user enters c:\util)
                       Length   StrLen, InString  (StrLen will contain 7)

            LOWER      VarName1
            (104)
                 Change the alphabetic characters in VarName1 to lower case.
                 Ex:   Variable InString,25
                       ReadStr  InString (user enters C:\UTIL)
                       Lower    InString (now contains c:\util)

            MIDSTRING  VarName1, VarName2, VarName3, VarName4
            (114)      VarName1, Literal1, Literal2, Literal3
                 Extract  a substring of VarName2 beginning at offset VarName3
                    into VarName2  for  a length  of VarName4  and place  this
                    substring in VarName1.

                 Ex:   Variable Path,79
                       WriteAt     1,2,"Enter Drive and Directory name "
                       ReadStr     Path  (user enters C:\UTIL)

            NORMAL
            (84) Change  the current color attribute(s) back to the definition
                    prior to the execution of a BLINK or REVERSE command.

                 Ex:   Color    20    ;set default color to red on blue
                       Blink          ;changes to blinking red on blue (148)
                       WriteAt  2,24,"Incorrect...re-enter!"
                       Normal         ;resets color to 20
                       Beep     800,8
                       Wait     35    ;pause 3.5 seconds
                       WriteAt  2,24,"                    "   ;clear     error
            msg

                    This  is an example of  a typical error routine. The color
                       attribute  is  changed   to  blinking  with  the  Blink
                       command.  The error  message is  written and  the color
                       attribute  is changed  back to its  original value with
                       the  Normal command. The  speaker is "beeped" and after
                       a wait  of 3.5  seconds, the  error message  is removed
                       from the screen.

            PROMPT     VarName1
                       Literal1
                 Change  the  current  value  of   the  prompt  to  the  value
                    specified in VarName1 or in Literal1.

                 Ex:   Prompt      "$p$g"
             
            READKEY    VarName1
            (59) Read a single key  from the keyboard and place the result  in
                    VarName1.

                 Ex:   Variable CharIn,1
                       GoToXY   1,14
                       Write    "Enter the drive letter for output ",4,1
                       ReadKey  CharIn

            READSTR    VarName1
            (109)
                 Read  a string of characters from the keyboard until the user
                    presses  the enter  key. Any  number of  characters may be
                    read up  to the maximum  length specified  for VarName1 in
                    the Variable statement.

                 Ex:   Variable    InString,12
                       ReadStr     InString    (12 chars max will be read)

            READUPKEY  VarName1
            (144)
                 Read a single character from the  keyboard, changing the case
                    of any alphabetic  character to upper case and place  this
                    upper case character in VarName1.

                 Ex:   ReadUpKey   CharIn

            READYN     VarName1, VarName2
            (29)       Literal1, VarName2
                 Write the  message found  in VarName1  at the  current cursor
                    location and wait for a  single key to be entered from the
                    keyboard. Force the user to enter either  a "Y" or "N" and
                    place the upper case "Y" or "N" in VarName2.

                 Ex:   Variable    Msg4,35,"Invalid filename...Continue  [Y/N]
            "
                       ReadYN      "Invalid     filename...Continue      [Y/N]
            ",CharIn

                       ReadYN      Msg4,CharIn

                 In  both usages  of the ReadYN command,  the message "Invalid
                    filename...Continue  [Y/N] "  will  be displayed  and  the
                    program  will wait  for a response  from the user.  If the
                    user enters any characters  other than "Y",  "y", "N",  or
                    "n"  the  system  speaker  will  sound  and  the  user  is
                    prompted  again  for  input. At  the  completion  of  this
                    command,  the variable  CharIn will contain  either "Y" or
                    "N" (always upper case).

            REVERSE
                 Change  the  text  attributes to  "reverse  video".  This  is
                    accomplished  by swapping  the foreground  and  background
                    attributes. This command is "undone" by using NORMAL.

                 Ex:   Color    20    ;red on black
                       Reverse        ;color is changed to black on red
                       WriteAt  1,15,"Press Escape To Continue"
                       Normal         ;color is now red on black

            SETENV     VarName1, VarName2
                       Literal1, Literal2
                 Set  the  value  of the  environment  variable  specified  in
                    VarName1  or Literal1  to the value  specified in VarName2
                    or Literal2.

                 Ex:   Variable    VarName,7,"MONITOR"
                       Variable    VarValue,5,"color"
                       SetEnv      VarName, VarValue
                       SetEnv      "Monitor","color"

            SETPATH    VarName1
                       Literal1
                 Set  the current  path to the value  specified in VarName1 or
                    the value specified in Literal1.

                 Ex:   Variable NewPath,40,"d:\;c:\util\exec;c:\dos"
                       SetPath  NewPath
                       SetPath  "d:\;c:\;"

            SETVAR     VarName1, VarName2
            (31)       VarName1, Literal1
                 Set the value of VarName1 to the contents of VarName2.

                 Ex:   Variable ErrCode,3
                       Variable FileName,79
                       SetVar   ErrCode,99
                       SetVar   FileName,"C:\CONFIG.SYS"

                    In the  first usage  of the  SetVar command, the  variable
                       ErrCode  is set  to "99" and the  second usage sets the
                       variable FileName to "C:\CONFIG.SYS"

            UPPER      VarName1
            (101)
                 Change the alphabetic characters in VarName1 to upper case.

                 Ex:   Variable InString,25
                       WriteAt  14,25,"Enter your directory name "
                       ReadStr  InString    (user enters c:\util)
                       Upper    InString    (changed to C:\UTIL)
                       ?InPath  InString,GoodDir  (path is always upper case)

                    In this example,  the user is prompted  for a path name to
                       be  entered. The  path name  is to  be compared  to the
                       system  path for  validity. Since  the contents  of the
                       system path  are always  in upper case,  we change  the
                       InString variable to upper case prior to comparision.

            VARIABLE   VariableName, MaxLength [,InitialValue]
            (1)  Define  a variable  to PowerBatch.  All variables  used in  a
                    PowerBatch  program must have been defined with a VARIABLE
                    command. VariableName is  the name which  you give to this
                    variable  and the means by which you refer to the variable
                    in other PowerBatch  statements. This variable may contain
                    any  number of  characters up to  MaxLength and is  set to
                    the  initial value of  InitialValue. See the discussion on
                    variables at the beginning of this section.
                 Command line  parameters  passed  to  a  compiled  PowerBatch
                    program must  be defined  as variables. Up  to 16  command
                    line  variables  may be  passed to  a compiled  PowerBatch
                    program  and they  are defined  as CLP%1..CLP%16.  See the
                    example MOVE1 or MOVE2.

                 Ex:   Variable    DayOfWeek,9
                       Variable    ErrMsg1,25,"Invalid directory name."
                       Variable    InString,80,""
                       Variable    PauseTime,2,50
                       Variable    CLP%1,12       (command line parameter %1)

            WAIT       VarName1
            (119)      Literal1
                 Cause the  execution  of a  PowerBatch program  to pause  for
                    VarName1 tenths of a second(s).

                 Ex:   Wait        5           (pause half a second)
                       Wait        PauseTime   (pause 5 seconds)

            WRITE      VarName1, VarName2 [,VarName3]
            (58)       Literal1, Literal2 [,Literal3]
                 Write the string contained in VarName1 at the current  cursor
                    location using  color attributes  foreground VarName2  and
                    background  VarName3.  In  the  absence  of  VarName2  and
                    VarName3  use the current  color attributes. The string is
                    not  followed by a carriage return, line feed pair (ie the
                    cursor  is not  moved to  the first  position of  the next
                    line).

                 Ex:   Write    "Enter your password ",0,7
                       Variable ErrMsg1,25,"Invalid directory name."
                       Variable ErrClr,3,112
                       Write    ErrMsg1,ErrClr

            WRITEAT    VarName1, VarName2, VarName3 [,VarName4] [,VarName5]
            (46)       Literal1, Literal2, Literal3 [,Literal4] [,Literal5]
                 Write   the  string  contained  in  VarName3  at  column  (X)
                    contained  in VarName1  and row (Y)  contained in VarName2
                    using   the  foreground   color  attribute   contained  in
                    VarName4 and the  background color attribute contained  in
                    VarName5.  In the  absence of  VarName4 and  VarName5, use
                    the current color   attributes. The string is not followed
                    by  a carriage  return, line feed  pair (ie the  cursor is
                    not moved to the first position of the next line).
                 Ex:   Variable TitleClr,3,112
                       Variable CurrX,2
                       Variable CurrY,2
                       Variable CompName,25,"The ABC Company"
                       WriteAt  15,3,"The ABC Company",TitleClr
                       WriteAt  CurrX,CurrY,CompName

                    In the  first usage  of the  WriteAt  command the  literal
                       "The  ABC Company"  is written at column  15, row 3. In
                       the  second  usage,   the  contents  of  the   variable
                       CompName  ("The ABC Company")  is written at the column
                       location specified  by the contents  of variable  CurrX

                       and at  the row  location specified by the  contents of
                       variable CurrY.

            WRITELINE  VarName1 [,VarName2]
            (195)
                 Write  the string contained in VarName1 beginning in location
                    1 of the  line number  specified in  VarName2. Follow  the
                    string  with a carriage return line feed pair (ie move the
                    cursor  to the  first position of  the next line).  In the
                    absence  of  VarName2  write the  string  at  the  current
                    cursor location.

                 Ex:   WriteLine   "Please read these instructions ",7
                       WriteLine   Msg5

                    In the first usage of  WriteLine the message  "Please read
                       these  instructions " is  written beginning in column 1
                       of  row  7. In  the second  usage the  contents of  the
                       variable  Msg5  is  written beginning  at  the  current
                       cursor  location. In both cases a carriage return, line
                       feed  (position  cursor at  the first  position of  the
                       next line) is written.

                                    Compilation Errors

            Compilation  errors are printed on  the screen and also written in
            a  file named  POWERBAT.ERR (If  you have  a split  screen editor,
            view  the source  in one screen part  and the errors  in the other
            part).  If  the  source line  is  available,  the source  line  is
            printed  above the error preceded by the line number count. Source
            lines  are not  available during the  second pass of  the compiler
            which may generate "Label not defined" and "Variable not  defined"
            errors.

              "Not a valid command" -  This error is generated  when the first
                 word  on the  command line  is not  a PowerBatch  command and
                 contains more than 8 characters.

                 Example:
                    13 Directory name checked here.
                    [DIRECTORY] Not a valid command

                    Probably should be ;Directory name checked here

              "Missing variable" -  A command contains less than the  required
                 number of operands.

                 Example:
                    21 ?Color   ForeColor,BackColor
                    [] Missing variable

                    Variable for the composite color byte is missing.

              "Expected a variable  Name" - A string  was found in an  operand
                 that may contain only a variable name.

                 Example:
                    10 ?Time "Current Time"
                    [Current Time] Expected a variable name

                    The current time may only be placed in a variable.

              "Quoted   literal  not   terminated"  -   A  single   quote  was
                 encountered within a source line.

                 Example:
                    9 Center "Move Command,5
                    [] Quoted literal not terminated

                    Closing quote should precede comma.

              "Invalid  max  length  specified"  -  The second  operand  of  a
                 variable  definition should specify the maximum length of the
                 variable. The value found was not numeric.

                 Example:
                    3 Variable  CompName,"The ABC Company"
                    [The ABC Company] Invalid max length specified

              "Variable not defined" -  A reference to a variable was made  in
                 the  source file  but the variable  was not defined  with the
                 Variable command.

                 Example:
                    [CURRDATE] Variable not defined

              "Duplicate  variable" - The same variable name has appeared 2 or
                 more times in a Variable definition statement.

                 Example:
                    7 Variable  CompName,25
                    [COMPNAME] Duplicate variable

              "Duplicate label" - The same  label name has appeared  2 or more
                 times in a Label definition statement.

                 Example:
                    16 Label    Step2
                    [STEP2] Duplicate label

              "External command >" - This  is not an error  message, but is  a
                 check  to alert  you to  each command  found in  a PowerBatch
                 source  file  that will  be treated  as an  external command.
                 External  commands are DOS intrinsic commands, .COM, and .EXE
                 commands or programs (even PowerBatch  compiled programs) and
                 .BAT  (standard DOS  batch files) that are  to be executed by
                 PowerBatch.

                 Example:
                    External command > 12 DIR     (DOS directory command)
                    External command > 29 MYPROG  (Executable module MYPROG)

                           Removing PowerBatch From Your System

            While  we  believe  that  PowerBatch  is  a  batch  compiler  that
            everyone should own, we recognize that there are some who feel  it
            is not a  program they will use on  a regular basis. For those  of
            you in that minority,  we have provided a program to easily remove
            all PowerBatch modules  from your  system. To  remove all  modules
            from  your system  that were  supplied on  the  PowerBatch install
            disk, enter

              DELETEPB <enter>

            You  will be asked  if you wish  to remove  all PowerBatch modules
            from  the  currently logged  disk. If  this is  the correct  disk,
            enter Y. If it is  not the correct disk, enter  N and the  program
            will  terminate. (You  should  move  to  the disk  containing  the
            PowerBatch  modules.)  You  will next  be  asked  if you  wish  to
            confirm  each deletion. If you reply (Y)es, each time a PowerBatch
            module is found,  you will  be asked  if you  wish to delete  this
            module. If  you reply (N)o,  the modules will  be deleted as  they
            are found without your intervention.

 CATALOG DESCRIPTION

 Add power to your batch files with PowerBatch. Create batch files that execute
 with the speed only a compiled program can deliver.

 Standard batch functions plus over 40 additional commands provide you with the
 capability to create professional screen displays with boxes, colors, direct
 cursor positioning, and keyboard input capability.

 Validate drives, directories, files, and paths before your batch file attempts
 to copy or use data. Retrieve environment variables, current date, current
 time, disk capabilities, and free space and make intelligent decisions within
 your batch files using the string and numeric comparison commands.

 Create variables and constants to be used in any of the PowerBatch commands,
 even DOS commands!

 Need to create a batch file that cannot be exited by pressing break (or any
 key)? PowerBatch gives you an option at compile time to create a batch file
 that cannot be exited by pressing the break key. Great for consultants who
 need to create for clients batch files that cannot be modified or misused.

 PowerBatch gives you:
     1) Commands which provide systems information. These commands provide the
          current color settings, the current date, the current time, check for
          the existance of a valid drive letter, and commands which check for
          the existance of a directory or a file.
     2) Commands which control the flow of the batch program. Execute different
          portions of the batch program based on existance or non-existance of
          directories or files. Compare the contents of one variable with the
          contents of another variable or a constant and execute different
          portions of the batch program based on the results of the compare.
     3) Commands which control the way text is printed on the screen. Change
          any portion of the screen to any valid screen color, cause a message
          to blink on the screen, or highlight a message in reverse video.
     4) Commands which provide string manipulation. Change a string to all
          upper case characters, or all lower case characters. Extract a
          portion of a string such as the first three characters or the last
          four characters. Build a new string from two existing strings by
          concatenation of the two strings.
     5) Commands which deal with screen writing and input from the keyboard.
          These commands are the main strength in the PowerBatch system.
          Directly address any position on the screen and move the cursor to
          that position to read or write text. Automatically center a message
          or title on any line. Box commands draw borders around portions of
          the screen to enhance screen appearance. Read a single key from the
          keyboard, read the response to a query that only accepts a yes or no
          response, read a string of characters from the keyboard with a
          specified maximum length, and read keys from the keyboard
          automatically changing the characters to upper case.

 UPDATES

 Updates will be furnished automatically to any vendor to whom registrations
 can be traced.
