          =================
          Some Definitions:
          =================

          You've probably heard the terms "public domain", "freeware",
          "shareware", and others like them.  Your favorite BBS or disk
          vendor probably has many programs described by one or more of
          these words.  There's a lot of confusion about and between these
          terms, but they actually have specific meanings and implications.
          Once you understand them, you will have a much easier time
          navigating the maze of programs available to you, and
          understanding what your obligations are, or aren't, with each
          type of program.

          Let's start with some basic definitions.

          "Public domain" has a very specific legal meaning.  It means that
          the creator of a work (in this case, software), who had legal
          ownership of that work, has given up ownership and dedicated the
          work "to the public domain".  Once something is in the public
          domain, anyone can use it in any way they choose, and the author
          has no control over the use and cannot demand payment for it.

          If you find a program which the author has explicitly put into
          the public domain, you are free to use it however you see fit
          without paying for the right to use it.  But use care - due to
          the confusion over the meaning of the words, programs are often
          described by authors as being "public domain" when, in fact, they
          are shareware or free, copyrighted software.  To be sure a
          program is public domain, you should look for an explicit
          statement from the author to that effect.

          "Copyrighted" is the opposite of public domain.  A copyrighted
          program is one where the author has asserted his or her legal
          right to control the program's use and distribution by placing
          the legally required copyright notices in the program and
          documentation.  The law gives copyright owners broad rights to
          restrict how their work is distributed, and provides for
          penalties for those who violate these restrictions.  When you
          find a program which is copyrighted, you must use it in
          accordance with the copyright owner's restrictions regarding
          distribution and payment.  Usually, these are clearly stated in
          the program documentation.

          Maintaining a copyright does not necessarily imply charging a
          fee, so it is perfectly possible and legal to have copyrighted
          programs which are distributed free of charge.  The fact that a
          program is free, however, does not mean it is in the public
          domain - though this is a common confusion.

          "Shareware" is copyrighted software which is distributed by
          authors through bulletin boards, on-line services, disk vendors,
          and copies passed among friends.  It is commercial software which
          you are allowed to try before you pay for it.  This makes
          shareware the ultimate in money back guarantees.


          ======================
          The Shareware Concept:
          ======================

          Most money back guarantees work like this:  You pay for the
          product and then have some period of time to try it out and see
          whether or not you like it.  If you don't like it or find that it
          doesn't do what you need, you return it (undamaged) and at some
          point - which might take months - you get your money back.  Some
          software companies won't even let you try their product!  In
          order to qualify for a refund, the diskette envelope must have an
          unbroken seal.  With these "licensing" agreements, you only
          qualify for your money back if you haven't tried the product.
          How absurd!

          Shareware is very different.  With Shareware you get to try it
          for a limited time, without spending a penny.  You are able to
          use the software on your own system(s), in your own special work
          environment, with no sales people looking over your shoulder.  If
          you decide not to continue using it, you throw it away and forget
          all about it.  No paperwork, phone calls, or correspondence to
          waste your valuable time.  If you do continue using it, then -
          and only then - do you pay for it.

          Shareware is a distribution method, NOT a type of software.
          Shareware is produced by accomplished programmers, just like
          retail software.  There is good and bad Shareware, just as there
          is good and bad retail software.  The primary difference between
          Shareware and retail software is that with Shareware you know if
          it's good or bad BEFORE you pay for it.

          As a software user, you benefit because you get to use the
          software to determine whether it meets your needs before you pay
          for it, and authors benefit because they are able to get their
          products into your hands without the hundreds of thousands of
          dollars in expenses it takes to launch a traditional retail
          software product.  There are many programs on the market today
          which would never have become available without the Shareware
          marketing method.

          The shareware system and the continued availability of quality
          shareware products depend on your willingness to register and pay
          for the shareware you use.  It's the registration fees you pay
          which allow us to support and continue to develop our products.

          Please show your support for Shareware by registering those
          programs you actually use and by passing them on to others.

          Shareware is kept alive by YOUR support!


          ==================
          The Virus Problem:
          ==================

          We've all heard the horror stories about computer viruses.
          Unfortunately, we have also heard lots of conflicting statistics
          and opinions.  When it comes to the virus problem there is a lot
          of confusion among users and even developers.

          The sad truth is that some unscrupulous publishers of anti-virus
          products are using half-truths, overdramatizations, and outright
          fabrication to promote sales of their products.  They delight in
          manipulating statistics to support their marketing efforts.
          While not illegal, these snake-oil tactics are certainly not
          ethical.

          To make matters worse, the media has frequently promoted the
          misinformation promulgated by these unscrupulous individuals
          rather than the straight facts.  While the misinformation may be
          more interesting than the actual facts, the media is not doing
          the computer industry any favors by spreading inaccurate
          information.  To be fair, many newspapers, magazines, and news
          networks are beginning to realize which "virus experts" are
          reliable and which "experts" say whatever is in their own best
          interest.

          One of the most interesting myths that has been promulgated by
          these snake-oil salesmen is that BBSs (Bulletin Board Systems)
          and Shareware programs are a major source of virus infections.
          This is interesting since one of the individuals who makes this
          claim, also distributes his virus detection system as Shareware.
          Some corporations are now afraid of Shareware and BBS activity
          because of this misinformation.

          In the October 11, 1988 issue of PC Magazine, publisher Bill
          Machrone's editorial was entitled "Shareware or Scareware?".  In
          his article, Bill Machrone points out "The truth is that all
          major viruses to date were transmitted by commercial [retail]
          packages and private mail systems."  That sounds a little
          different than the claims being made by less knowledgeable
          journalists.

          Let's consider for a moment, the distribution differences between
          retail software and Shareware software.  Company XYZ releases a
          new version of its retail software product.  At the same time


          Shareware and the ASP                                Page 4 of 12


          .............                                    SHR-WARE.DOC


          that company XYZ ships tens of thousands of copies to its retail
          distribution channels, it also ships 30,000 updates to loyal
          users.  Most of those loyal users will receive the update within
          a few days of each other.  This can be a big problem if the
          update happened to be infected with a virus.

          "Not likely", you say?  It has already happened!  Several times!
          There have been seventeen (17) major incidents of virus and
          trojan horse problems in retail software.  Some of these
          incidents affected tens of thousands of users.

          What about Shareware?  To date there has been one case of a
          shareware author shipping an infected product.  The virus was
          detected by the disk vendors and the problem was corrected
          immediately.  No users were infected.

          "But it makes sense that programs which are passed around have a
          greater chance of virus infections, doesn't it?"  Think about it.
          Who has the most to lose if viruses were spread by BBSs and
          Shareware programs?  The BBS operators, Shareware disk vendors
          and the Shareware authors, of course.  Because of this, reputable
          BBS operators, disk vendors and Shareware authors are very
          careful with the programs they handle.

          Think about it.  Hundreds (even thousands) of BBS operators and
          disk vendors are carefully examining the programs they receive
          and distribute.  Their business depends on it.  This means that
          any given Shareware program can go through hundreds (even
          thousands) of checkpoints where the program is carefully
          examined.  If a problem is found the word spreads incredibly
          fast.  News travels "on the wires" even faster than the
          proverbial small town gossip.  Programs have disappeared almost
          overnight as a result of this highly efficient communication
          network.

          If a Shareware program has been around for a few months, it has
          been checked for virii and trojan horses many more times than any
          retail software could hope to be checked.  Retail distributors
          don't check the disks they sell.  Even if the publisher checks
          their masters for virii (few do), that is still far less than the
          scrutiny to which Shareware programs are subjected.

          There's something else to consider.  Most retail distributors
          have a return policy.  What do they do with packages that are
          returned?  They shrink-wrap them and resell them, of course.  How
          can you be sure that you are the first person to purchase the
          package you just bought at your friendly neighborhood computer
          store?  You can't.  On the other hand, most shareware authors
          erase, reformat, and reduplicate the disks that are returned to
          them.  Which do you think is safer?

          Bill Machrone's article in PC Magazine goes on to say "It's time
          to recognize that there's nothing to fear in shareware.  As a
          distribution medium, it saves you money and helps you try out new
          genres of software with minimum risk."

          Does this mean that we should all start buying Shareware instead
          of retail software?  Not at all (although few Shareware authors
          would object).  Let's face it, more data has been lost to power
          failures and spilled cups of coffee than all virii, trojan
          horses, and worms combined!  An even bigger threat is plain old
          human error, a mistake, a wrong key press, turning off the power
          while files are open, and so forth.  Accurate information and
          common sense (regular backups) are the best defenses against lost
          data.

          Sure, the virus problem is real.  Virii exist.  But shunning
          Shareware is not the answer.  Shareware and BBSs are, quite
          simply, NOT a major source of virus infections.  Some
          corporations have even banned Shareware entirely because of fear
          of infections.  This is not only unreasonable, it is also
          expensive.  Think how much they could save in software costs if
          they would only try software before they buy it!

          Is there anything you can do to help protect yourself from virus
          infections?  Absolutely!  Fortunately, the best preventive
          measures are also the least expensive!

          If you need informative, accurate and practical information,
          please read the treatise on "Computer Virus Myths" written by Rob
          Rosenberger and Ross M. Greenberg.  This treatise is available as
          a text file on many BBSs and online services.  It not only gives
          you the facts, it also provides the best overall strategy for
          protecting your computer system.


          Don't let fear stop you from saving money on software.  Don't let
          fear prevent you from trying some of the best software available.
          Shareware is an important market for software.  Take advantage of
          it.  You'll be glad you did!

          =================================================

          In the early days of Shareware there were no real standards.
          Independent authors had no efficient way to learn from each other
          or to work together to improve the overall image of Shareware.
          There was no system in place to ensure that users were treated
          fairly and professionally.  There was no way for users to find an
          address for an author who had moved.  In short, the Shareware
          community was disorganized and each author did things the way he
          or she thought was best.  It was clear that if Shareware was ever
          to become a viable and respected marketing alternative, there had
          to be some standardization.  There had to be some guidelines to
          best serve the users.

          In 1987 a handful of Shareware authors founded the Association of
          Shareware Professionals (ASP).  In forming this industry
          association, these Shareware authors had several primary goals in
          mind, including:

              o  To inform users about Shareware programs and about
                 Shareware as a method of distributing and marketing
                 software.

              o  To foster a high degree of professionalism among Shareware
                 authors by setting programming, marketing, and support
                 standards for ASP members to follow.

              o  To encourage broader distribution of Shareware through
                 user groups and disk dealers who agree to identify and
                 explain the nature of Shareware.

              o  To assist members in marketing their software.

              o  To provide a forum through which ASP members may
                 communicate, share ideas, and learn from each other.

          The newly formed Association of Shareware Professionals worked
          together to draft a code of ethics for all present and future
          members.  This code of ethics included several requirements that
          soon became very popular among users (customers), including:

              o  A member's program (evaluation version) could not be
                 limited (crippled) in any way.  In the true spirit of
                 Try-Before-You-Buy, users must be able to evaluate all the
                 features in a program before paying the registration fee.

              o  Members must respond to every registration.  At the very
                 least they must send a receipt for the payment.

              o  Members must provide technical support for their products
                 for at least 90 days from the date of registration.

          A new system was put in place to help ensure that users were
          treated fairly and professionally.  If a user was unable to
          resolve a problem with a member author then the user could
          contact the ASP Ombudsman with their complaint.  The Ombudsman
          would then try to help resolve the dispute.  For more complete
          details regarding the Ombudsman, please refer to the "ASP
          Ombudsman Statement" below (page 9).

          As of February, 1991, the ASP had over 300 author members and
          almost 200 vendor members, with new members joining every week.


          ======================================
          Contacting ASP Members Via CompuServe:
          ======================================

          There is an easy and convenient way to speak directly to many ASP
          Members (both authors and vendors).  Visit the Shareware forum on
          CompuServe.  Simply type "GO SHAREWARE" - or "GO SHARE" - from
          any CompuServe ! prompt.

          Here you will be able to talk to the authors of your favorite
          Shareware programs, learn about other programs, ask questions,
          make suggestions, and much more.  We'd love to meet you online,
          please come visit us today!

          =======================
          Author Address Changes:
          =======================

          People move.  Forwarding orders expire.  What can you do?

             "I got a copy of a Shareware program written by an ASP Member.
             I sent in the registration fee and the post office returned my
             letter saying that it was undeliverable.  Now what do I do?"

          If the author has moved then chances are very good that you have
          an old version of the program.  This is another situation that
          the ASP can help you to resolve.  ASP Members are required to
          keep the ASP informed of address changes.  If you need to obtain
          the current address for a member, simply write to the following
          address:

             ASP Executive Director
             545 Grover Road
             Muskegon, MI  49442-9427
             U.S.A.

          or send a CompuServe message via CompuServe MAIL to ASP Executive
          Director 72050,1433.


          ========================
          ASP Ombudsman Statement:
          ========================

          This program is produced by a member of the Association of
          Shareware Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure that the
          Shareware principle works for you.  If you are unable to resolve
          a Shareware-related problem with an ASP member by contacting the
          member directly, ASP may be able to help.  The ASP Ombudsman can
          help you resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member, but
          does not provide technical support for members' products.

          Please write to the ASP Ombudsman at:

          For More Information:
          =====================

          If you would like to learn more about the Shareware phenomenon,
          there are several excellent sources of additional information.
          Two of the best books ever written about Shareware are described
          below.

                       Announcing an Outstanding Book/Disk NEW
                           from Dvorak*Osborne/McGraw-Hill

                         Dr. File Finder's Guide to Shareware
                         ------------------------------------

                            by Mike Callahan and Nick Anis
                              Foreword by John C. Dvorak

          Includes One 5 1/4" Disk with Dr. File Finder's Favorite
          Shareware Programs:  Qmodem 4.2, BackMail 1.10, dCOM 3.44, and
          many more.

          For All IBM PC & Compatibles.

             "[Mike's] book distills thousands of hours of his online
             search for the crown jewels of Shareware into one usable
             guide.  As such, it may be the most valuable computer book
             you'll ever buy."
                --Jack Rickard, Publisher, Boardwatch Magazine

             "No one combines Dr. File Finder's comprehensive knowledge of
             the Shareware genre with his good taste in software. This is
             sure to be the definitive place to look for insight and
             program information."
                --Barry Simon, Former President of the Association of
                Shareware Professionals, PC Magazine Columnist, and
                Coauthor of Stackey, Batutil, and Ctrlalt

             "GREAT!  Every PC user will find something of value within
             these pages.  This book will save you a bundle."
                --Alfred Glossbrenner

             "If I were going to buy only one computer book, this would be
             it."
                --Tom Scott, Publisher, Telecomputing Magazine

          Nobody knows Shareware like the illustrious Dr. File Finder,
          known  off line as Mike Callahan.  Now, in Dr. File Finder's
          Guide to  Shareware, you can learn about dozens of leading
          Shareware programs,  including where and how to get them.  In the
          true spirit of Shareware, this book/disk package includes a disk

          full of top programs that you can try out yourself before
          registering.  Send in the card at the back of the book and you'll
          get two additional disks with more software.

          Shareware:  "Try Before You Buy" Software:
          ------------------------------------------

          Perhaps you've read Rob Rosenberger's well known and highly
          acclaimed treatise on the computer virus problem.  If you liked
          that article then you'll love his excellent book on Shareware.
          This book is a must for anyone who is interested in Shareware,
          what to look for (and look out for), and where to find it.  In
          this book, shareware author and writer Rob Rosenberger delves
          into the very heart of Shareware, telling you who developed the
          concept and why.

          You'll know why these programs:  * undercut the price of retail
          software * helped bring down the use of copy protection schemes *
          receive numerous editorial and reader survey awards * generate
          more sales than retail software in some cases * make retail OS/2
          software developers so nervous * are falsely accused of spreading
          computer "viruses".

          Rob shows you where you can find good Shareware.  You'll learn to
          beware of companies that make money by abusing the "try before
          you buy" concept.  And you'll discover where Shareware is heading
          in the near future.

             concept and history of Shareware.  I'm pleased to say there is

Limited Distribution License:
-----------------------------


    o  The PrintPlus package - including all related program
       files and documentation files - CANNOT be modified in any
       way (other than that mentioned in the following paragraph)
       and must be distributed as a complete package, without
       exception.  The PACKING.LST text file contains a list of
       all files that are part of the PrintPlus package.

    o  Many BBSs customarily add a small text file
       (advertisement) to each archived file.  This text file
       describes the BBS and tells people that the file was
       down loaded from that particular BBS.  Other BBSs add a
       small one-line message with their BBS name and phone
       number into the compressed file, which will display when
       the file is uncompressed.  Either of these methods of
       mentioning your BBS are acceptable and may be used,
       provided the program and documentation is otherwise
       unmodified and complete.


    o  Lambert Klein prohibits the distribution of outdated
       versions of the PrintPlus package, without written
       permission from Lambert Klein.  If the version you have
       obtained is over twelve (12) months old, please contact us
       to ensure that you have the most current version.

    o  Licensee shall not use, copy, rent, lease, sell, modify,
       decompile, disassemble, otherwise reverse engineer, or
       transfer the licensed program except as provided in this
       agreement.  Any such unauthorized use shall result in
       immediate and automatic termination of this license.

BBS Update Program:
-------------------

Most BBSs have standard procedures for acquiring new files.  They
get them from other boards, new programs are up loaded by users,
etc.  This is good because most authors cannot afford to mail
disks or upload files to thousands of BBSs.  However, some BBSs
prefer to obtain programs directly from the authors.  If you
would like to obtain programs directly from us, automatically,
then please help us to cover the cost.

If your BBS would like to receive automatic upgrades to any of
our products, directly from us, then please refer to the
information below.  Due to the time and expense we are generally
unable to upload directly to a large number of Bulletin Board
Systems.  However, we are able to mail updates on disk (in a
sealed envelope) to many BBS's.

If your BBS would like to receive automatic updates then please
take advantage of our BBS Update Program.  Under this program you
can receive updates for an entire year for only $10 per program
(this helps to offset our costs).

To receive updates, simply send us a letter with the name and
address of your BBS, your mailing address, the name of the person
we may contact (preferably the SYSOP or CO-SYSOP), the program
(or programs) for which you would like to receive updates, and a
check or money order for $10 for each program (for countries
outside of North America please add an additional $10 per
program).  Payment in U.S. funds drawn on a U.S. bank only,
please.


The BBS Update Program is available for the following products
(as of May, 1991):

   PrintPlus   File printing program Plus.

NOTE: All BBS's participating in our BBS Update Program will
      automatically receive any NEW programs which we may release
      while their BBS Update Program is in effect.

The BBS Update Program is only intended to help us cover our
expenses in those cases where a BBS desires to obtain the program
directly from us.  If you have other standard ways to obtain
programs, then you may not want to use our BBS Update Program.

Thank you for your support!

          documentation provided with registered versions to be free of
          defects in materials and workmanship for a period of sixty days
          from the date of registration.  If Lambert Klein receives
          notification within the warranty period of defects in materials
          or workmanship, and such notification is determined by
          Lambert Klein to be correct, Lambert Klein will replace the
          defective diskette(s) or documentation.

          The entire and exclusive liability and remedy for breach of this
          Limited Warranty shall be limited to replacement of defective
          diskette(s) or documentation and shall not include or extend to
          any claim for or right to recover any other damages, including
          but not limited to, loss of profit, data, or use of the software,
          or special, incidental, or consequential damages or other similar
          claims, even if Lambert Klein has been specifically advised of
          the possibility of such damages.  In no event will
          Lambert Klein's liability for any damages to you or any other
          person ever exceed the lower of suggested list price or actual
          price paid for the license to use the software, regardless of any
          form of the claim.

          Lambert Klein SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES,
