         DEFINITION OF SHAREWARE

         Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software
         before buying it.  If you try a Shareware program and
         continue using it, you are expected to register.  Individual
         programs differ on details.  Some request registration while
         others require it, some specify a maximum trial period.  With
         registration, you get anything from the simple right to
         continue using the software to an updated program with
         printed manual.

         Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial
         software, and the copyright holder retains all rights, with a
         few specific exceptions as stated below.  Shareware authors
         are accomplished programmers, just like commercial authors,
         and the programs are of comparable quality.  (In both cases,
         there are good programs and bad ones!)  The main difference
         is in the method of distribution.  The author specifically
         grants the right to copy and distribute the software, either
         to all and sundry or to a specific group.  For example, some
         authors require written permission before a commercial disk
         vendor may copy their Shareware.

         Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software.
         You should find software that suits your needs and
         pocketbook, whether it's commercial or Shareware.  The
         Shareware system makes fitting your needs easier, because you
         can try before you buy.  And because the overhead is low,
         prices are low also.  Shareware has the ultimate money-back
         guarantee -- if you don't use the product, you don't pay for
         it.

         DISCLAIMER - AGREEMENT

         Users of Painless Accounting for Windows must accept this
         disclaimer of warranty:  "Painless Accounting for Windows is
         supplied as is. The author disclaims all warranties,
         expressed or implied, including, without limitation, the
         warranties of merchantability and of fitness for any purpose.
         The author assumes no liability for damages, direct or
         consequential, which may result from the use of Painless
         Accounting for Windows."

         Painless Accounting for Windows is a "shareware program" and
         is provided at no charge to the user for evaluation.  Feel
         free to share it with your friends, but please do not give it
         away altered or as part of another system.  The essence of
         "user-supported" software is to provide personal computer
         users with quality software without high prices, and yet to
         provide incentive for programmers to continue to develop new
         products.

         If you find this program useful and find that you are using
         Painless Accounting for Windows and continue to use Painless
         Accounting for Windows for a reasonable trial period, you
         must make a registration payment of $99.00 to Painless
         Accounting, Inc.  The $99.00 registration fee will license on
         copy for use on any one computer at any one time, and you
                                  PAGE 1

         will receive a printed manual.
         You must treat this software just like a book.  An example is
         that this software may be used by any number of people and
         may be freely moved from one computer location to another, so
         long as there is no possibility of it being used at one
         location while it's being used at another.  Just as a book
         cannot be read by two different persons at the same time.

         Commercial users of Painless Accounting for Windows must

         transaction number consisting of the month and day of the
         posting. ie, MM/DD. This information is held in the Ledger
         until the Ledger is posted, and is then distributed
         throughout the Chart of Accounts and Financial Statements.


                                  PAGE 7

         enter a Transaction Code. This is any unique code that

         B) Ledger Account Activity Report

         The posting process updates the Ledger account balances. Once
         this process has been run, you will not be able to edit the
         transactions. This process will update your Financial
         Statement balances.  You will first be asked to verify that
         you wish to run this process, then you will be asked to
         select the month you  want to post. For example, if you enter
                                  PAGE 8

         'January' only transactions with a date of 01/DD/YY will be

         This option allows you to enter computer or manual checks.
         Computer checks are checks that will be printed by Painless
         Accounting and manual checks are hand written checks.

         You will first be asked to enter a transaction number.  This
         is any unique number that identifies a given check. If you
         wish to edit a previously entered check and are not sure of
         the transaction number you can select the  'Browse...'
         button. You will then be able to enter the check number,
         check date, check amount, vendor code, check type, and check
         memo. If the vendor code is found on file the vendor address
         will automatically be displayed, if the code is not on file
         or if the code is left blank you can enter any address you
         wish. If you are unsure of a vendor code you can select the
         'Browse...' button and all vendors currently on file will be

         distribute the amount into a maximum of four accounts. Simply
         enter the Chart of Account number and the description will
         automatically be displayed. You must then enter the amount
         that is to be distributed to the account. After you have

         check amount) you can select the 'OK' button.

         When you have entered all your check information simply
         select the 'Cancel' button.


         B) Print Unposted Checks

         starting and ending check numbers to re-print. You will then
         be prompted to enter the starting check number to print.

                                  PAGE 9

         will be prompted to enter the bank balance. This is the
         balance from the bank statement you receive from your bank.
         The checkbook balance displayed on the screen will be taken
         from your checking account balance in the Ledger. This will
         only include transactions that have been posted to this
         checking account. After your bank balance has been entered,
         all checks written through the checks option that have been
         posted will be displayed on the screen. It will also display
         any receipts you have received through the cash receipts and
         invoice options. Remember these checks and deposits are only
         displayed if they have been posted. You can now select the
         appropriate button at the bottom of the screen for each
         transaction listed. Select 'Cleared' if the check has cleared
         your bank.

         F) Statement Text

         zero. You will be prompted to confirm that you want to run
         this process. Next, you have the option to have the data
         placed  into historical files. If you place the data into the
         historical files, you can print reports from this data at a
         later time.


         B) Invoice End of Month
         This option will simply match up invoices and payments. If
         the balance of a given invoice is zero, then all the
         transactions for that invoice will be removed from the file.
         For example, if you have invoice 208 for $250.00 and a
         payment to invoice 208 for $250.00, both transactions will be
         removed from the file. Once these items are removed  from the
         file they will no longer appear on the Client Aging and
         Client Statements


         C) Ledger End of Year
         This option will clear all revenue and expense accounts and
         place the balance into your profit -and-loss account. You
         will be prompted if you wish to purge the Ledger Historical
         File, Check Historical File, Invoice Historical Files,  and
         if you would like to zero your budget figures.  You will then
         be asked for your profit-and-loss account. This must be a
         capital account.
