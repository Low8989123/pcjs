## Information about "QHELP"

    QTEXT turns your ordinary text files into standalone, instantly
    executable .COM program files.  Any user can easily view their
    contents simply by typing the file's name -- just like any other file
    ending with .COM.  Screens pause where you want them until the you're
    ready to continue, at which point the screen clears and the next
    section is displayed.
    
    QHELP transforms your text into a menu-driven environment.  By a
    simple, one-word key at the head of the file, you determine whether the
    user will be offered the opportunity to print out the file in a
    professionally-formatted manner, complete with a header line
    containing useful information (page and section numbers, date of last
    file revision and title of your choice).  You can also give your users
    the choice to display or print the entire file or only chosen sections.
    Files can be printed complete with a title and table of contents.
    
    If you're the de facto ``computer expert'' for your family or office,
    preparing such files offers you the chance to thoughtfully provide your
    knowledge and advice in an organized, easily-used format.
