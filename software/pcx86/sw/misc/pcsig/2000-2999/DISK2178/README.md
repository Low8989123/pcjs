## Information about "SBAS GENERAL LEDGER"

    Finally, an easy double entry bookkeeping system designed around a
    general ledger! SBAS (Small Business Accounting System) lets a small
    company track income and expenses and print reports on demand.
    
    SBAS doesn't have modules for receivables, payables, and payroll, but
    instead uses the general ledger system to perform these tasks.
    Consequently you can't print invoices, but it does keep everything
    simpler.
    
    Its on-line help screen is very helpful. And it automatically checks
    for valid account numbers during entry and allows new accounts to be
    added during entry.
    
    Installing the program isn't difficult. The manual and program
    provide the information to set up your books in a short period of time.
    Easy-to-read reports can be produced as needed. The system uses a five-
    digit account numbering system, and the manual suggests a certain way of
    setting up the accounts, but you can change it if you want.
    Overall, this is a good accounting package for businesses that
    don't need all the modules.

If you do not need a full blown accounting program then SBAS may be     
the program for you. SBAS [SMALL BUSINESS ACCOUNTING SYSTEM] is a       
double entry bookkeeping system which is designed around a general      
ledger.  SBAS enables a small company to track income and expenses      
and to print reports on demand, which is something that more expensive  
program do not always allow.                                            
                                                                        
SBAS does not contain the modules for receivables, payables, and        
payroll, but instead uses the general ledger system to perform these    
tasks.  Consequently you cannot print invoices.  On the other, SBAS     
will keep track of your income and expenses easily and it allows you    
to print numerous reports whenever you need them.  On line help screen  
is very helpful during those frustrating time.  SBAS also automaticly   
check for valid account numbers during entry and new accounds may be    
added during entry.                                                     
                                                                        
Installing the program is not difficult.  The manual and program        
provides the information to set up your books in a short period of      
time.  Once done, reports can be produced as needed and they are more   
than adequate and easy to read.  The system uses a five digit account   
numbering system, and the manual suggests a certain way of setting up   
the accounts, but you can change it if you want.                        
                                                                        
Overall, this is a good accounting package for those not needing all    
of the additional modules.

              The SBAS GENERAL  LEDGER  is  a  easy  to  use  program.  Our
              program  is  designed for the small company that need an easy
              to use basic accounting program.  We have attempted  to  make
              all  of  the  menus  self-explanatory.  A  basic  bookkeeping
              knowledge is helpful to use the program. On line help screens
              are available for the first time on Version 1.5.  Where  they
              are  available  you  will  see  'F2  = HELP' displayed on the
              screen.

              The program is a double  entry  system,  therefore  for  each
              credit  entry  or  entries there must be an offsetting debit.
              The program posts each entry  after  it  is  entered  so  the
              balances  are  always up to date.  This allows you to view or
              print an Income Statement of Balance Sheet at any time during
              the accounting period.  Please refer to Appendix A  for  some
              information  on basic bookkeeping.  In the event you have any
              accounting questions you should contact your  accountant  who
              prepares your Income Tax returns.

              Do not use the Master disk you purchased except to make a
              work copy of the program and files. (See Page 3). Also see
              page 11 for some ideas for setting up your SBAS GENERAL
              LEDGER books.

              The single most important  portion  of  the  program  is  the
              setting  up the Chart of Accounts.  You must exercise a great
              amount of care in establishing the  Chart  of  Accounts.  The
              Chart  of Accounts will determine what your financial reports
              will  look  like.   The  order  of  the  Chart  of   Accounts
              determines the order of the account printing on the financial
              reports.  Certain  accounts  in  your file will be for report
              titles, headings and totals, and skipping to a new page.

                   The  Chart  of Accounts is completely user defined.  The
              Account  number  may  be  up  to  five  digits.  If  you  are
              presently  using  a  three  or  four  digit account number we
              suggest that you simply add zeros at the end of  your  number
              to create a five digit number.  A sample Chart of Accounts is
              contained  in  APPENDIX B.

                   In our sample Chart of Accounts we are using the
              following:
                            ASSETS                 10000-29999
                            LIABILITIES            31000-39999
                            EQUITY                 49900-49999
                            INCOME                 50000-51990
                            EXPENSES               60000-69995

                   Refer to Appendix B for our sample Chart of Accounts.

                   However, you may use any numbers of your choice provided
              they  are in the sequence of:  Assets,  Liabilities,  Equity,
              Income, Expenses.

         PAGE -1-







                   The chart of  Accounts  requires  that  you  define  the
              account type,  report type,  normal balance for each account.
              In addition,  you must indicate  the  total  level  for  each
              'total'  account.  The  program allows you to have up to four
              total levels on your Balance Sheet.  This would be three  sub
              totals  and  an  overall  total  of  your  Assets and of your
              Liability/Equity.  The total level you choose also determines
              the column in which the totals  will  print.  On  the  Income
              Statement  the  print columns are predetermined.




                               ACCOUNT TYPE
                               ------------
                   This will requires each account be identified as:

                        0     Posting Account  (accepts detail data)
                        1     Title Account    ( Type 1,2,3,4 do not
                        2     Total Account    (   accept detail data
                        3     Heading Account  (
                        4     Retained Earnings (Current Year)

                                          Type 1
                 Title Accounts will identify the  main  sections  of  your
              financial reports,  ie.  ASSETS, LIABILITIES, EQUITY, INCOME,
              and EXPENSE.

                                          Type 2
                  Total Accounts will identify  when  and  where  you  will
              print  your  subtotals  and totals on your financial reports.
              The program allows for up to four levels  of  totals  on  the
              Balance Sheet. Refer to a later section  which  discusses  total
              levels in more detail.

                                          Type 3
                  Heading Accounts will identify the  subsections  of  your
              financial  reports,  ie.  Cash in Bank,  Accounts Receivable,
              Fixed Assets, Current Liabilities, etc.


                                          Type 4
                   Retained  Earnings  Account.  The programs requires that
              you identify one(and only one) account  as  account  type  4.
              The   program,   when   printing   the   Balance  Sheet  will
              automatically calculate the Current  Year  Retained  Earnings
              and  reflect  the amount in this account.  Your Balance Sheet
              will not be correct if you fail  to  include  the  Type  4  -
              Retained Earnings.

                                       REPORT TYPE
                                       -----------

                   Each record in your Chart of Accounts must be identified
              as  either  to  appear on the Income Statement or the Balance
              Sheet.  All Income Statement Accounts must be Report Type '1'
              and all Balance Sheet Accounts must be Report Type '2'.

         PAGE -2-






                                    NORMAL BALANCE
                                     --------------

                   The program requires that all Asset and Expense Accounts
              be identified as having a normal debit balance:  Code 1.  All
              Liability,  Equity, and Income accounts must be identified as
              having a normal  credit  balance:  Code  2.  All  Assets  and
              Expense  accounts must be identified as having a normal debit
              balance.


                                       TOTAL LEVEL
                                       -----------

                                      BALANCE SHEET

                   The  Balance  Sheet  will  have three columns of numeric
              information.  The first column will print the posting account
              amounts,  and the level 1 total  amount.  The  second  column
              will  print  the level 2 total amount.  The third column will
              print the level  3  total  amounts  and  the  level  4  total
              amounts.  The  use  of a level 4 total will cause the program
              to print a single line before the total amount, a double line
              after the total amount and eject to a new page.


                                     INCOME STATEMENT

                   This report is primarily pre-defined so far as where  on
              the  report  your  columns  will  appear.  Total accounts are
              required at the end of your income accounts and at the end of
              your expense accounts.  These should be identified  as  Total
              Level  3.  This  identification  is necessary should you at a
              later date decide to upgrade to Version 2.0+.

                               GETTING STARTED

                   The first and most important item is to make a work copy
              of the program disk,  then put the original disk  in  a  safe
              place.  The Original Disk should be used only for making work
              copies of the  program  disk.  To  make  a  work  copy  place
              original  disk in drive A and a blank formatted disk in drive
              b:

                       Copy gl.exe b:/v        (If hard disk copy to the
                       Copy  *.dbf b:/v         appropriate directory/sub
                       Copy  *.ntx b:/v
                       Copy  *.mem b:/v

              Be  sure  your config.sys contains the following:  files = 20
              buffers = 15.  Refer to your DOS manual for setting up and/or
              modifying your config.sys.




                   This program is designed to work on a  computer  with  a
              floppy drive, or on hard drive.  Refer to your DOS manual for
              setting up a Hard Disk sub directory.

              If you are using a floppy system place your new work disk  in
              drive A.  A> GL {return}.


                 FOR HARD-DISK SYSTEMS a set-up may be as follows:
               Root directory
                    |--ACTG (sub directory)(do not use root directory)

                         Enter Choice   --


              From this menu you select the type of transaction you wish to
              record.  When you select one of the 'Enter' programs a screen
              format will appear.  At the top left of your screen  it  will
              identify  the type of transaction you are about to enter.  On
              the top right of the screen will appear the fiscal period  to
              be  used in recording these transaction.  (This fiscal period
              may be changed by  selecting  '1'  GENERAL  INFORMATION  FILE
              MAINTENANCE from the main menu.)

              Near  the  top  right  of  your  screen  will appear the open
              balance of the journals you are entering.  In the  event  you
              did not 'zero' out a prior journal,  the open balance will be
              displayed.  You should have  previously  prepared  an  adding
              machine total of your receipts and/or disbursements which will
              verify  the  total  after  all the activity has been entered.
              Near the bottom of the screen will appear seven (7) items  to
              be  completed in recording the transaction.  In the event you
              make an  error  in  entering  any  item  you  will  have  the
              opportunity   to  correct  the  information  after  you  have
              completed entering the seven items.  The  only  exception  to
              this  is  your cannot change an account number.  In the event
              there is an error in the account number, your must delete the
              entry (selection 99) and reenter the entire entry.  The  Cash
              Receipts  program  will allow you to enter only in the CREDIT
              field of the format.  The DEBIT entries must  be  entered  as
              negative   amounts.(INCLUDING  OFFSET  TO  CASH).   The  Cash
              Disbursements program will you to enter  only  in  the  DEBIT
              field of the format.  The CREDIT entries (INCLUDING OFFSET TO
              CASH) must be entered as a negative amount.

              This  program  allows  you  to  have  multiple bank accounts,
              therefore the  program  DOES  NOT  automatically  offset  the
              entries to a Cash Account

              Remember this is a double entry system  which  requires  that
              the  debits and credits total must agree for your books to be
              in balance.  You should not offset to Cash  each  entry,  but
              make  on  entry  for  the  total  after all activity has been
              entered.

              The Journal Entry program allows  you  enter  both  DEBITS  &
              CREDITS  on the screen format.  You must exercise care on the
              Journal Entry format to be sure you  are  correctly  entering
              the DEBIT & CREDIT amounts.  If 'REF',  'Date', 'Description'
              or Comment fields are left blank they  will  default  to  the
              previous entry.  DO NOT ENTER BOTH A CREDIT & DEBIT AMOUNT ON
              A  JOURNAL  ENTRY.  THE PROGRAM WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY IF
              YOU ENTER BOTH A DEBIT AND CREDIT AMOUNT ON  THE  SAME  INPUT
              SCREEN. If you have properly entered your Journal Entries the
              total at the top right of the screen will be ZERO.

                            GENERAL LEDGER - CURRENT MONTH

                   The General Ledger may only be a  printed  report.  This
              report  should be run after you have entered all of your Cash
              Receipts,  Cash Disbursements,  and Journal Entries  for  the
              current  accounting period.  Normally you would run the Trial
              Balance before this report to be sure all  of  your  accounts
              are  in  balance.  This  report  will  start with the closing
              balance  of  the  previous  month,  and  detail  all  of  the
              transactions  of the period.  Each detail transaction will be
              identified by date,  transaction number,  and source  of  the
              transaction.  The  source codes are:  Cash Receipts 11,  Cash
              Disbursements 12,  Journal Entries 13.  In the event you have
              a  question  on  any  detail  item the transaction number and
              source  will  enable  you  to  quickly  locate  the  original
              transaction.

                              GENERAL LEDGER - YEAR-TO-DATE

                   This General Ledger - Year-To-Date may only be a printed
              report.  This  report is similar to the Current Month General
              Ledger,  except each account starts with the beginning of the
              fiscal year balance,  and details all of the transactions for
              the year.  The same information is printed on the  report  as
              the Current Month General Ledger.

                   NOTE:  This  report  may  only  be  run  after  you have
              completed all of your monthly reports and  run  the  "END  OF
              ACCOUNTING PERIOD" program.

              sections for preparation of the Chart of Accounts and General
              File  Maintenance  Information   for   the   information   in
              formatting  the  Balance  Sheet  to your specifications.  The
              Balance Sheet may  be  either  previewed  on  the  screen  or
              printed.

                                 END OF ACCOUNTING PERIOD

                   This program is run after you have printed and carefully
              reviewed all of  your  monthly  reports.  This  program  will
              transfer  all  of the monthly detail information to the year-
              to-date History file and erase the same information from  the
              monthly  detail  file.  In  addition  the account master file
              will be updated to reflect the  start  of  a  new  accounting
              period.  If you fail to run this procedure at the end of each
              accounting    period    subsequent   Cash   Receipts,    Cash
              Disbursements and Journal Entry  Journals  will  contain  all
              information  to  date.  Further  the current month portion of
              your Income Statement will include all information to date.

                                     FISCAL YEAR END

                   This program is run only at the end of your fiscal  year
              after all of the monthly reports and the Year-to-Date General
              Ledger  have  been  completed.  Each  of  the  aforementioned
              reports should be reviewed carefully for accuracy before this
              program is run.  This program will erase all  of  the  detail
              for  the  fiscal  year  and change information in the Account
              Master file for the new fiscal year.  We recommend  that  you
              DO  NOT  run  the  procedure  until after your Accountant has
              reviewed your financial reports and is satisfied that all  of
              the information is correct for Income Tax Purposes. See 
              comments at end of sample chart of account.

              event  you  wish  to use it for testing or ?:  This should be
              done on a separate or new work disk.

              Use the following DOS commands.
                     1.  Rename Master.dbf Mstr.dbf

              MAKE FREQUENT BACK UP COPIES OF YOUR DATA FILES.
                  You should make frequent back  up  copies  of  your  data
              especially  when  you  spend  a large amount of time entering
              data.  We recommend that in addition, you make a back up copy
              at the end of each accounting period during the year.

              Sometimes in the course of computer events your  index  files
              become corrupted,  and you can not get the proper information

                             SOME BASIC BOOKKEEPING THOUGHTS

              We  are  not  your  accountant  and  we  do not pretend to be
              experts in the field.  Whenever,  in doubt you should  always
              check  with  your  Public Accountant who does your Income Tax
              Returns.  Income Tax returns is one of the main  reasons  for
              keeping  complete and accurate books of record.  This program
              will provide detail listings of your activity, however in the
              event you are audited the IRS may  want  to  see  the  actual
              documents,  such as the cancelled check or a receipt.  If you
              are audited the detail  listings  provided  by  this  program
              should greatly assist the situation.

              In  the  simplest terms bookkeeping is made up of a series of
              debit and  credit  entries.  In  the  broadest  sense  Debits
              usually  are:  ASSETS and EXPENSES.  Credits usually are your
              LIABILITIES, EQUITY and INCOME.  The total Debits must always
              equal  the  total  Credits.  If  not,  your  books  will  not
              balance.   The   Balance   Sheet  consists  of  your  ASSETS,
              LIABILITIES and EQUITY.  The  Income  Statement  consists  of
              your Income and Expenses.


              INCOME:  Income  or  revenue  is  your sales.  In your record
              keeping it is essential you distinguish between money  coming
              in  which  constitutes  Income.  Money  coming  in  from your
              initial investment or loans to the business  are  not  Income
              for  Tax Purposes.  A sale of a Capital Asset must be treated
              differently the  Income  from  your  product  sales.  When  a
              Capital Asset is purchased (equipment,  furniture, etc) it is
              subject to depreciation.  The depreciation  expense  must  be
              periodically  entered  in  your  books.  A  separate detailed
              record  of  Capital  Assets  should   be   maintained.   Your
              Accountant can advise you on the best acceptable depreciation
              method for your Federal and your State Income Tax returns.

              EXPENSES:  All  expenses  recorded  on  your  books  must  be
              'ordinary and necessary' to the operation  of  the  business.
              Personal expenses paid by the business are not deductible for
              Income  Tax purposes.  See the above paragraph for additional
              information on depreciation.

              PROFIT:  Income less Expenses will  be  the  profit  of  your
              business.  Some  non-cash  deductions,  such as depreciation,
              are deductible for Income Tax purposes.  Most small  business
              maintain  their  books  on  a  Cash  Basis,  however  if your
              Accountant has determined it is best for you  to  be  on  the
              Accrual  Basis  be  sure  your Accountant explains all of the
              ramifications the both methods of accounting.
