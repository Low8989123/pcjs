## Information about "CURVE DIGITIZER (HERCULES) 2OF2 (2068)"

    CURVE DIGITIZER is a completely professional, two-dimensional CAD/CAM
    drawing tool for the personal computer. The interactive help screen,
    detailed documentation, and six menu screens make it easy to operate.
    
    ~ Direct hi-resolution printer output with controllable width, length,
    resolution and an option for reverse field-printing.
    
    ~ A wide-printer output option for printers with carriages up to 16"
    wide.
    
    ~ A versatile line thickness controller has been added to the Select
    command. This allows for double lines, poly lines or filled lines with
    a selectable density.
    
    ~ Distance and angle, or delta x & y readouts are available.
    
    ~ Advanced features; e.g., scaling & rotation, hatching and area
    calculations of irregular polygons.
    
    ~ A user-defined plotter driver routine is included.

           C U R V E    D I G I T I Z E R    V E R S I O N   4.0

                UPGRADES TO CURVE DIGITIZER SINCE VERSION 3.0

                         PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS


    *  THE DIGITIZER CALIBRATION PHASE HAS BEEN SIMPLIFIED.

    *  A FASTER COMPILER AND PROGRAM MODIFICATIONS NOW YIELD A 55%
       INCREASE IN REFRESH SPEED.

    *  SEVERAL COSMETIC ERRORS HAVE BEEN CORRECTED.

    *  ADVANCED FEATURES, E.G., SCALING & ROTATION ADDED TO THE SYMBOL
       COMMAND.

    *  A USER-DEFINED PLOTTER DRIVER ROUTINE IS AVAILABLE.

    *  HERCULES VIDEO (DMA) RESPONSE TIME IMPROVED. PREVENTS CERTAIN
       SCREEN ANOMALIES EVIDENT WITH CERTAIN HERCULES CLONE CARDS.

    *  EXTENDED THE [ESC] KEY USAGE TO INTERRUPT SCREEN REFRESHING AND
       PRINTER OR PLOTTER OUTPUT EVEN DURING `LAYERS' MODE.

    *  ARC COMMAND FEATURES READOUT OF START & END ANGLES AND RADIUS.

    *  LAYER COMMAND FEATURES SINGLE-KEY SELECTION OF UP TO 10 PATH
       DIRECTORIES.

    *  A BYPASS OPTION WHICH PRECLUDES RESAVING THE INITIAL LAYER FILE.

    *  FORMATTED DISKETTES NO LONGER NEED A FILE ON DISK TO BE USED AS A
       DATA DISK.

    *  FOR COMPUTER SYSTEMS WITHOUT HARD DRIVES AND HAVING, AT LEAST, 2
       FLOPPY DRIVES, A DRIVESPEC CAN BE ENTERED FOR THE AUTODIMENSIONING
       DISK. THIS SAVES CONSIDERABLE DISKETTE SWAPPING.

    *  THE LAYERS MODE SAVES FILE(S) ONLY IF CHANGES ARE MADE.

    *  DIRECT HI-RESOLUTION PRINTER OUTPUT WITH CONTROLLABLE WIDTH,
       LENGTH, RESOLUTION AND AN OPTION FOR REVERSE FIELD-PRINTING.

    *  A WIDE-PRINTER OUTPUT OPTION FOR PRINTERS WITH CARRIAGES UP TO 16".

    *  AUDIO EFFECTS NOW HAVE 3 LEVEL SETTINGS: OFF/MIN/MAX WHICH ARE
       TOGGLED WITH A NEW [!] KEY.

    *  THE [ESC] KEY ALLOWS INSTANT EXITING FROM HELP MENUS. THE HELP
       PACKAGE NOW INCLUDES BI-DIRECTIONAL PAGING THROUGH ALL SCREENS.




    *  A VERSATILE LINE THICKNESS CONTROLLER HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE SELECT
       COMMAND. THIS ALLOWS FOR DOUBLE LINES, POLY LINES OR FILLED LINES
       WITH A SELECTABLE DENSITY.

    *  READOUTS FOR DISTANCE AND ANGLE OR DELTA X & Y READOUTS AVAILABLE
       USING THE [^] KEY.

            USING CURVE DIGITIZER`S CUSTOMIZED PLOTTER USER DRIVER


If your plotter (or compatible) is not listed in the configuration menu, there
may be a user driver for your plotter on the Autodimensioning disk (#2). To
utilize the user driver, from the Plotter Menu in the Configuration, press the
ESCAPE key. You will be prompted for the name of the user driver for your
plotter. Enter the name (do not add the extension .DEV) and press RETURN.
Continue configuring the program as you normally do.

Some of the current drivers are:

          DMP7      ---   HOUSTON INSTRUMENTS DMP-7
          AMDEK100  ---   AMDEK DXY-100
          CX4800    ---   C.ITOH CX-4800
          PANASONI  ---   PANASONIC VP-6801
          WX4671    ---   WATANABE WX-4671
