Special Requirements: None.                                             
                                                                        
POPDBF is a utility program which provides "Instant Access to dBase     
Files" at the press of the hotkey.  It is a memory resident program     
which takes a minimal amount of memory, but can also be run in          
non-resident "pass-thru" mode.  Using PopDBF you can browse, edit,      
append, delete and search records.  You can also delete, pack, or zap   
database files.                                                         
                                                                        
Some of POPDBF's other features include: view index expressions (.IDX,  
.NDX, .NTX), copy structure, print file structures, print only selected 
fields, print only records which meet search, search entire record or   
selected field(s), and much more.                                       
                                                                        
POPDBF is so intuitive that even a novice user needs only to know the   
hotkey.  However, context sensitive help is available just by pressing  
F1.                                                                     
                                                                        
If you need access to any dBase .DBF file, you need POPDBF!

          PERMISSION TO DISTRIBUTE
          ========================

          Our sending  this disk to you and  the letter that accompanies it
          constitutes the approval of  Bowen Software for your distribution
          of PopDBF as part of your shareware library. If you have obtained
          this  from another  source, (not  directly from  Bowen Software),
          please write or call for our explicit permission.  We further ask
          that  you send  us  a copy  of  your standard  written  materials
          (catalogs or flyers) which clearly explain the shareware concept,
          the need  for users to register  products they use,  and the fact
          that the price of  your disks is a copying fee  only and does not
          constitute  payment  for  the  product. The  material  must  also
          differentiate between shareware and public domain software.

          You may  distribute PopDBF as is.  That is, on one  disk with all
          files in an uncompressed format.   Optionally, you may distribute
          them  on one  disk using  a compression  format such  as the  ZIP
          format.  If  using the later method,  you MUST leave the  READ.ME
          and  VENDOR.DOC files in  an uncompressed format.   Regardless of
          distribution method, you MUST distribute all the files together.


          ASP
          ===

          If you are not  already a member, we strongly  recommend that you
          consider  becoming  an  Approved  Vendor of  the  Association  of
          Shareware Professionals  (ASP). For  more information on  the ASP
          vendor program, contact the ASP at:

                    Association of Shareware Professionals
                    Vendor Certification Committee
                    P.O. Box 5786
                    Bellevue, WA  98006

          The  ASP vendor program reduces the workload for both authors and
          vendors,  and helps  give  customers confidence  that  reasonable
          standards are met in the distribution of shareware products.
