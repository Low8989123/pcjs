## Information about "DPROG"

    DPROG, a dBase III programming tool, creates programs and writes user
    manuals from your screen designs. A "must have" program for anyone
    who uses (or wants to use) dBase III or Clipper.
    
    DPROG is a cluster of three programs controlled by a main menu. DPROG
    is a screen designer, the heart of the system. Simply draw the screen
    exactly as you want it, identify the fields (also very simple), and
    everything else is automatic. DPCOMP takes the screen layout you have
    created and produces all of the needed dBase III files. Then DPDOC
    prints out a 30-page step-by-step guide to your new database system.
    
    DPROG is extremely easy to use and it produces impressive results while
    requiring very little knowledge of dBase. The step-by-step

                                     What is dPROG?
                                     ______________


   dPROG is a dBase programming utility that allows you to generate screens,
   format files, validation files, databases, entire systems and their
   documentation with very little work.  dPROG is composed of five main
   applications: the system integrater, the screen designer, the compiler, the
   documenter and the system converter.

   The system integrater (DPSYS) is a menu system which controls the use of the
   various functions.  It also allows you to specify the paths used for input
   screen files, output systems files and executable modules.

   The screen designer (DPROG) allows you to design screens and if desired,
   build entire applications by drawing a screen and describing the system
   parameters and the fields on your database.

   The compiler (DPCOMP) converts your screens, system description, and field
   descriptions from DPROG into dBase III+ code.  You will need either dBase
   III+, Runtime +, or a dBase compiler such as Clipper to run this system.

   The documenter (DPDOC) generates user documentation based on the information
   you described in dPROG.  A user's guide tailored to your new system is one of
   the components.  Using information you gave to dPROG, dPDOC tailors the
   manual to include the programmers name, copyright notice, system name and
   description, field names and descriptions, and more.  The manual is a full
   walk through and users guide for the end user on how to use your system.

   The converter (DPCONV) uses files created by a background utility (DPCLIP) to
   convert your existing applications into dPROG systems.

   dPROG version 1.31 (this version) is distributed as "shareware".  If you like
   this product, you should send $39.95 to University Research, Inc.  In
   exchange for this, you will receive version 2.0 (which will not be
   distributed as shareware), printed manuals, and be registered to find out
   about future versions and other utilities developed by us.

   dPROG version 2.0 expands the capabilities of version 1.  Version 2 allows 64
   fields on a screen, screen painting and coloring, line copies within the
   screen designer and more.  Version 2.0 is currently available.












dPROG dBase Programmers Guide.  Getting Started.                  Page 3










   dPROG version 3.0 is in development.  It will allow the use of up to 8 files,
   and enable you to develop relational applications. It will also have several
   other major enhancements over version 2.0.  Version 3.0 should be available
   October 1988 for a small upgrade charge for all registered version 2.0 users,
   or available at a higher price for new users.

                              How to use this manual
                              ______________________
   
   This manual is designed to help you understand and use the dPROG system.  If
   you follow each step exactly as written, it will demonstrate how an actual
   system is developed.
   This manual is broken up into sections on: Starting dPROG, the help screen,
   etc.  Under each section there are steps describing procedures and the proper
   responses.  What you should do is left justified, the computer's response is
   directly following and indented.
   Please try to follow each step in order to better understand the system.  If
   you have any questions about the terms used check, the glossary in the dPROG
   reference manual.

   Function keys F1-F5 and F10 each control a system function.
   
   F1 Starts dPROG the screen designer.  This will allow you to create your
      screens and describe the fields used on each screen.
   F2 Runs the compiler, this will convert the screen you designed with dPROG
      into dBase source code.
   F3 Runs the documentation generator.  This program will create a custom users
      manual for your new system.
   F4 Starts the conversion program.  To use this program you must first 'clip'
      a screen from an existing application using dPCLIP.  The file generated by
      dPCLIP can than be converted using dPCONV to a screen file for the dPROG
      system.
   F5 Allows you to set the system parameters.  With this function you can
      change the drive and path used for the input screens, output programs, and
      dPROG system programs.
   F10 Exits the system and returns to DOS.

   Lets get started using dPROG.

   Press F1
        The dPROG introduction screen containing the copyright notice appears.
        To exit the introduction screen press carriage return, otherwise this
        screen will automatically disappear after 10 seconds.
        

   Press carriage return
        A blank design screen appears on the screen of your computer.  Stop for
        a moment and look at this screen.
        The bottom line is called the status line.  It contains information
        about the function of the program.  Any questions or error messages
        generated while designing a screen appear here, as well as any replies
        you may make to questions.
        Notice on the left side of the status line 'R: 1 C: 1 L:80' appears.
        This tells you the cursor is in row 1, column 1 and the screen lock
        column (more about that later) is column 80.
        On the right of the status line is 'F1 = HELP'.  This is a reminder that
        if you press F1 the help screen will appear.
        If you are using version 2 of the program, also on the right is a
        literal 'PAINT OFF' showing that the screen painting function is
        currently off.  The color of the 'PAINT OFF' is white on black
        indicating that painting will be white foreground colors on a black
        background.

                                    _______________


   Press F1
        A help screen appears (see below).  The function keys are listed with a
        description of their functions.  In the center of the screen is a
        reminder that if you press F1 again you will get to the special
        character set.  Below that are indicators which show that you can repeat
        the last character by pressing Ctrl and PgUp, PgDn, right arrow or left
        arrow. To exit from the help menu you would press Esc.

                                   Designing a screen
                                   __________________


   The cursor is currently in row 1 column 1, the top left corner of the screen.
   The status line on the bottom of the screen shows R:1,C:1.


   Type 'IDNO' (without the quotes).
        IDNO appears in columns 1 through 4 in the first row of the screen.
        This is a screen constant.  This is a screen literal which will always
        be displayed when this screen is used.

   Press space
        The cursor moves one space to the right.  R:1 C:6 appears on the status
        line showing that you are in row 1 column 6.

   Press F5
        A small block appears on the screen.  This is a field block.  A field is
        a place where variable data will be placed.  This data may come from a
        database file or be calculated from other data.  Since this field
        contains only one field block, it is currently only 1 position in
        length.

   Press left arrow
        The cursor moves onto the field block.  On the status line at the bottom
        of the screen F: 1 L: 1 appears on the right side.  This indicates that
        this is field number 1 and has a length of 1 position.

   Press the space bar
        The computer beeps and the cursor does not move.  You cannot put screen
        constants (letters, spaces, special characters, etc) on a field.  The
        computer is reminding you of this.

   Press right arrow
        The cursor moves to the right one space.  It is now no longer on the
        field block, but next to it.  The status line shows R:1 C:7 and the
        field information disappears.

   Press F5 four times
        The field is now 5 field blocks long.  Whoops, we missed.  I wanted the
        field to be only four positions long.  To shorten an existing field,
        press the backspace key at the end of the field or press the Del key
        from within a field.

   Press Backspace
        The last field block of the group is erased and the field is now only
        four positions long.

   Press Return
        The cursor moves to the next line.  The status line shows R:2 C:1.  You
        are now positioned under the screen constant IDNO.

dPROG dBase Programmers Guide.  Getting Started.                  Page 11










   Type 'NAME' (without the quotes)
        NAME appears on the screen under IDNO.  You have generated another
        screen constant.

   Press space
        This places a space after the screen constant NAME.

   Press F5 until you have 30 field blocks
        You can stop every once and a while and check the field size by putting
        the cursor on one of the blocks in the field and looking at the L:nn
        field on the status line.  If there are too few, put the cursor after
        the last block and continue pressing F5.  If there are too many, press
        backspace or Del to remove some of the blocks.

   Press carriage return
        The cursor goes to row 3.

   Type 'ADDRESS' and a space.
        ADDRESS appears on the screen.

   Press F5 30 times to create another field
        This field will contain the first line of the address.

   Press carriage return
        Go to the next line.

   Move the cursor to just under the first block of the field ADDRESS.
        By using the space bar or the right and left arrow keys, move the cursor
        to under the first block of the field ADDRESS.  The status line should
        read R:4 C:9

   Add another field of 30 field blocks
        You have just added the second address line field.

   Move the cursor to row 5 column 29
        You are about to add a 10 byte field for the zipcode.

   Create a 10 position field for zipcode
        It should align with the end of the fields above it.

   Move the cursor to row 5 column 26
        You are about to add a 2 position field for State.

   Create a 2 position field for state.

   Move to row 5 column 9
        You are about to add a 16 position field for City.

   Create a 16 position field for city
        That is the last field for this screen.

                             ______________________________


   You are about to learn how to insert and delete columns on the screen.


   Press Home
        The cursor moves to row 1 column 1.  The status line reflects this.

   Move the cursor to the first block of the ID field.
        The status line should indicate row 1, column 6.

   Press Ins
        The field for the ID number moves one space to the right.  The Ins key
        moves any data from the cursor to the lock column one position to the
        right.  Any screen constants being forced past the lock column (normally
        column 80) will be lost.

   Press Ins twice more to place the field block over the address field.
        The field block aligns itself over the address field blocks.

   Move the cursor to the NAME field.
        You are about to move the NAME field over the ADDRESS field.

   Press Ins 4 times.
        The NAME field moves over the ADDRESS field, but one position too much.
        Next you will use the Del key to pull the field back to the left.

   Press Del
        The NAME field moves back to the left one position.  Your screen should
        now have the fields aligned.

                              Inserting and deleting rows
                              ___________________________


   Press Home
        The cursor is back at the upper left of the screen.

   Press F1 for the HELP screen.
        Notice that the help screen says that F3 inserts a line.

   Press F3
        You have just inserted a line at the top of the screen and pushed the
        remaining lines down one.  If there was a line at the bottom of the
        screen it would have been pushed off the screen and lost forever.
        Also notice that all function keys work from either the screen design
        screen or the help screen (with the exception of F1, more about that
        later).  If you had pressed F3 on the design screen it would have
        inserted a blank line just as it did from the help screen.  If you can't
        remember which function key inserts a line (or any other function) press
        F1 for help.  A function key pressed on the help screen (except for F1)
        will act upon the screen design screen.

   Press F4
        This deletes the line you have just inserted.  The F4 key will delete a
        line and remove any fields on that line.

   Press F3
        We needed that blank line, this will put it back in.

   Move the cursor down to row 2
        You are in front of 'IDNO'

   Press Ins twice
        You moved the line over two positions to the right.

   Move the cursor down another line
        We are going to move this line over 2 positions too.

   Press Ins twice
        The line with 'NAME' moves over two positions.

   Keep doing this for the remainder of the lines containing data.

                                Using special characters
                                ________________________


   Press Home
        The cursor moves to row 1 column 1

   Press F1 for HELP
        The HELP screen comes up.  Notice the line that says 'To select from
        Special character set. Press F1 again'.

   Press F1 again
        A screen labeled 'dPROG Special Character Set' appears.  Notice the
        cursor is on a character that looks like the upper left corner of a box
        made up of double lines.  Look at the bottom of the screen where it
        tells you to move the cursor and press return to choose a character.

   Press carriage return
        The upper left corner of a double lined box appears on the screen design
        screen.  This is the special character you said to copy.  Also notice
        that the cursor has moved right one position.  Whenever you insert a
        character from the special character set the cursor "drops" the
        character on the design screen and moves one position to the right.

   Press F1 twice
        You get to the special character set again.

   Press right arrow
        You moved the cursor from the box corner character to the horizontal
        double line.  You are about to select the horizontal double line.

   Press return to select this character
        The double line appears on the design screen next to the corner box
        character.  You are building a double lined box around the screen you
        just designed.  You could keep hitting F1 twice and pressing carriage
        return to continue forming the upper part of the box, but this would
        take a long time.  Next we'll learn to repeat characters.

   Press Ctrl right arrow
        Keeping the Ctrl key pressed, press the right arrow key (on the numeric
        keypad).  This repeats the last character selected and moves the cursor
        to the right.  Notice that a second horizontal double line appears and
        the cursor moves to the right one position.

   Continue pressing Ctrl right arrow until you get to row 1 column 41 (watch
   the status line)
        You have drawn the upper line of a double lined box.

   Press F1 twice
        The special character set appears again.  Move the cursor to the upper
        right corner of a double lined box.


dPROG dBase Programmers Guide.  Getting Started.                  Page 15










   Press return
        You have drawn the top of a box.

   Move the cursor to R2 C42.
        You are ready to draw the side of the box.

   Press F1 twice
        The special character screen appears again.

   Point at the vertical double bar.

   Press carriage return
        The side of the box starts forming.  Because the cursor moved to the
        right, you must position the cursor down one line and left one column.

   Move the cursor to R3 C42
        You are ready to draw the side of the box.

   Press Ctrl PgDn until you get to R7 C42
        You have drawn the side of the box

   Get the lower right side of the box from the special character set.

   Place it on your screen.

   Finish drawing the box around your data.
        The Ctrl PgUp key repeats the last character selected and moves up one
        line (row).  The Ctrl left arrow key repeats the last character selected
        and moves the cursor to the left.

                                  Describe your fields
                                  ____________________


   Now that you have drawn the screen and built the fields you need to describe
   the fields.  You can name the field and describe where the data comes from
   (file or calculation).  If the data comes from a file, you must specify which
   file and the type of data (numeric, logical, date, character) contained in
   this field.  If it's numeric, how many decimal positions are needed.  You may
   also specify the low and high ranges for the data, describe any calculation
   for this field, and give editing and initialization data.


   Move the cursor to the first field block of the IDNO field.
        We are about to describe the IDNO field.

   Stop for a second and look at the screen which has just appeared.

   Leave the FIELD NUMBER alone, press return or tab. Leave the SAME AS field
   alone, press return or tab.  The cursor moves to FIELD NAME.  We will now
   change the name of the field from F_1.

   Type 'IDNO' and press return.
        F_1 changes to IDNO.  The next field we will change is description.

   Press return or tab until you reach the description field.

   Type 'Customer Number'
        The description changes to Customer Name.  This is the last change
        needed for this field.  We will now go to the next field.

   Press PgDn
        The data for the next field (Name) appears on the screen.

   Change the field name to 'NAME' and the description to 'Customer Name'

   Press PgDn
        The field changes to address line 1

   Change field name to 'ADD1' and description to 'Main Address Line'

   Press PgDn and change the field name to 'ADD2' and the description to 'Second
   Address Line'

   Press PgDn
        Notice that the next field being displayed is the zipcode field.  This
        is because we entered the fields in zipcode, state, city order.  We will
        fix the ordering of these fields later.  For now we will set the field
        name and description.

   Change name to 'ZIPCODE' and description to 'Zip, Zip+4, or other format'

   Press PgDn
        The state field displays.

   Change the name to 'STATE', and the description to '2 digit state', and in
   the picture field type in '!!'.
        The picture !! is a dBase function which will convert any data inputted
        to upper case.  If you do not know about dBase pictures, there is an
        explanation in the dPROG reference manual.

   

   Change the Edit field to %%FIND(STATE,STATE)
        This causes the finished application to look up the state the user
        entered on a database named STATE using an index named STATE and only
        allow records which exist on the STATE database to be allowed into this
        field.  The STATE database is distributed with the dPROG system.
        

   Press PgDn
        The city field shows.

   Change the field name to 'CITY' and the description to 'Customer's city'
        You have now finished the last field.  There is other field description
        information which you did not fill in, but instead took the default.
        Later we will see what these other values do.  Next you will save your
        system and create the programs and files needed.  Hang in there, we are
        almost done.

        The first field is 'SYSTEM'.  This is the name of the system you wish to
        generate.  The default is the last system you worked on with dPROG.
        The second question is 'REPLACE DATABASE?  (If one exists)'.  The
        default is 'N'.  If you are making modifications to a screen design and
        wish to keep the existing data on your database, leave this alone.  If
        you wish to create a new empty database, change this to 'Y'.  If there
        is no database, one will be created no matter what you enter here.
        Below the questions is the line 'PRESS F1 TO CREATE SYSTEM, F10 TO
        EXIT'.  If you press F1 the system will be generated.  If you press F10
        you will exit to DOS having done nothing.

   Press F1
        A list of programs and databases display as they are created.  When

                                _______________________


   Now that you have created your system, you will need a users manual for the
   end user (or yourself) on how to use your new system.  Rather than having a
   generic manual on disk, there is a dPROG program which will create a user
   manual for you.  You will now run that program and create the users manual.


   From the dPSYS menu press F3 or from DOS type DPDOC and press return
        A screen appears (see below) asking three questions.  You have to

   device to 'A:name'), but for now we will leave these alone.
   Below the questions notice the line 'Press F1 to print, F10 to exit'.  If you
   press F1 the printing will start.  If you press F10 you will exit without
   printing.

   drive and a blank formatted floppy into the B drive, otherwise just place the
   blank formatted floppy into the B drive.

   Type 'COPY dp*.bin B:' and press return
        The default screen images copy to the B drive

   Type 'COPY maillist.* B:'
        Your new system copies to the B drive.

   Type 'COPY work.* B:'
        Since you named your database work, you must copy the database file(s)
        to the B: drive.

   Type 'COPY DPSORT.* B:'
        The sort/select subsystem copies to the B drive.

                                   Reordering fields
                                   _________________


   You may have noticed that when entering and updating data with your system
   that you had to enter zipcode then state then city.  This order should have
   been city, state, zipcode.  The problem is that you entered the fields in
   zip, state, city order when you created your system.  In this case this is a
   problem, but you might want a special ordering of the data in your system.
   This feature allows you to order the fields in a different way than you have
   them displayed on the screen.  For now though, lets fix the order of the
   city, state, zip fields.


   Restart dPROG
        You can start dPROG from DOS by typing DPSYS, pressing return, and then
        pressing F1. You can also start dPROG by typing 'DPROG' and pressing
        return from the DOS prompt.
        dPROG starts.  Press return (or wait 10 seconds) for the intro screen go
        away.  The screen design screen appears.

   Load your existing system.
        In order to change the system, you will have to reload it.

   Press F10
        The Clear, Dir, ... message appears on the status line.  We want to
        reload an existing system so we will choose Load.

   Press L
        The status line asks for the filename.

   Type A:MAILLIST
        We want to reload the MAILLIST program.  The program loads and the
        screen you built displays.

   Move the cursor to the city field.
        We will look at the fields that are out of order.

   Press F6
        This displays the field attributes.  Notice that the field number for
        city is 7.

   Press PgUp
        This displays the field attributes for State.  Notice that this field
        number is 6.

   Press PgUp
        Zipcode appears.  Notice that the field number is 5.

   Think!
        We want city to be field 5, state field 6, and zipcode state 7.  We need
        only change the order of fields 5 and 7.  To reorder a field you need
        only change the field number on the screen being displayed.  The field
        is the moved to that position and all fields with a higher order are
        pushed down 1.  Therefor, to fix this ordering we need change field 5 to
        field 7 and the other fields will be reordered.  We then need to
        exchange fields 5 and 6.  The following example demonstrates this:
        City = 7, State = 6, Zip = 5
        Go to zip and press 7.  Zip becomes 7, city and state move back 1.
        City = 6, State = 5, Zip = 7
        Go to City and press 5.  City becomes 5, and state moves down 1.
        City = 5, State = 6, Zip = 7

   Type 7 for the field number
        The fields reorder.  City is now 6, state 5, and zipcode 7.

   Move to City and press 5.  City is now 5, State 6, and Zipcode 7.

                        Adding new fields to an existing system
                        _______________________________________


   You will add 3 new fields to demonstrate numeric data entry and calculations.


   Position the cursor to under the CITY field
        We are about to add 3 new fields.

   Press F5 8 times
        A new field of length 8 is created.  You have just added a new field to
        the existing system.

   Move right one space
        We will add another field.

   Press F5 8 times
        You have created another field.

   Move right one space and press F5 8 times
        Your third new field.

   Move the cursor to the first of the three new fields
        You will now change the field descriptions of the fields you created.

   Press F6
        The field description screen shows.  You will make this field the amount
        of money sent from the customer.

   Change the Field Name to SENT, the type to N (numeric), decimal positions to
   2, description to Amount Sent, picture to 99999.99 and the initial value to
   0.

   Press PgDn
        You move to the second new field.  This field will contain the dollar
        amount received for their order.

   Change the Field Name to ORDERED, the type to N (numeric), decimal positions
   to 2, description to Amount Ordered, picture to 99999.99 and the initial
   value to 0.












dPROG dBase Programmers Guide.  Getting Started.                  Page 26










   Press PgDn
        You move to the third new field.  This will be the difference between
        the amount sent and the amount ordered.

   Change the Field Name to Diff, the File/Display/Calc field to C (to define a
   calculation field that is not on the database), the type to N (numeric),
   decimal positions to 2, description to Difference, picture to 99999.99, and
   the calculation field to SENT-ORDERED.  This causes this field to be
   calculated from the Sent and ordered fields.

                                Deleting existing fields
                                ________________________


   Next we will change the NAME field to 3 fields, first name, middle initial,
   and last name.


   Move the cursor to column 59
        You are going to set the lock column to allow you to modify the fields
        without having to redraw the box.

   Press F2
        The lock column changes to column 59.  Notice the change on the status
        line (L:59).

   Move the cursor to the NAME field
        This is field 2, length 30.  See the F:2 L:30 on the status line.

   Press Del to shrink the NAME field to 13 positions
        You will change this field to first name.

   Move the cursor to column 44
        You are about to add a middle initial field.

   Press F5
        You have added the middle initial field.

   Move over one column
        You are about to add the last name field.

   Press F5 13 times
        This is the last name field.

   Position the cursor on the first name field
        You need to change the field names for the new fields and move the
        middle initial and last name fields to positions following the first
        name fields.

   Press F6
        The field description screen appears.

   Change the field name to Fname

   Press Esc
        Your design screen returns.

   Move the cursor to the middle initial block.

   Press F6
        The field description screen appears.


dPROG dBase Programmers Guide.  Getting Started.                  Page 28










   Change the field name to MI

   Next, change the field number to 3
        This causes the field MI to be after the Fname field.

   Press Esc
        Your design screen returns.

   Move the cursor to the last name field.

   Press F6
        The field description screen appears.

   Change the field name to Lname.

   Next, change the field number to 4
        This causes the field Lname to be after the MI field.

                                Indexes and your system
                                _______________________


   Your old system was kept in no specific order.  We will make the new system
   keep the data in order by last name, first name and middle initial.


   Position the cursor to the Fname field
        Make this the second part of the key (the first part is Lname.)

   Press F6 and move the cursor to the File/Display/Calc field.
        Change the File/Display/Calc field to 1 to specify the second part of
        the key.  Keys are numbered from 0 through 9.  The first part of a key
        is 0, the last part is 9.

   Change File/Display/Calc to 1

   Press PgDn
        The MI field displays.  We will make this the third part of the key.
        Again, the third part of a key is part 2.

   Change File/Display/Calc to 2

   Press PgDn
        The Lname field displays.  We will make this the first part of the key.
        The primary part of the key is 0.

   Change File/Display/Calc to 2
        This changes the last of the key parts.

                                 Rebuilding your system
                                 ______________________


   Now that you are done modifying your system, you need to save it to disk.


   Press F10
        A message "Clear dOs Dir Load Parms Save Quit" appears on the status
        line. dPROG waits for your reply.

   Press S
        A message appears on the status line saying 'A:MAILLIST'.

   Press return
        A screen file (MAILLIST.SCR), field description file (MAILLIST.FLD),
        binary image file (MAILLIST.BIN), and system parameter file
        (MAILLIST.SPM) are created.  The status line blinks 'SAVING'.  If there
        are any problems, a message will appear on the status line.  You have
        now saved your modified system description.


                                     Exiting dPROG
                                     _____________


   Now that you are done, you will exit back to either the dPSYS menu or DOS
   (whichever you started from).


   Press F10
        A message CLEAR,DIR,LOAD,PARMS,SAVE,QUIT appears on the status line.
        dPROG waits for your reply.

   Press Q
        This causes you to quit dPROG and exit to DOS.  If you had made any
        changes to the screen or parameters without saving, you would have been
        asked if you are sure that you wish to quit.


                                 Rebuilding the system
                                 _____________________


   You will need to rebuild the programs and databases needed for the system you
   have changed.









dPROG dBase Programmers Guide.  Getting Started.                  Page 31










   Type DPCOMP and press return
        This starts the system compiler.  A screen displays showing two
        questions, with defaults.
        The first field is 'SYSTEM'.  This is the name of the system you wish to
        generate.  The default is the last system you worked on with dPROG.
        The second question is 'REPLACE DATABASE?  (If one exists)'.  The
        default is 'N'.  Since we have changed the number and size of fields and
        added indexes, you will need to change this field to Y.
        Below the questions is the line 'PRESS F1 TO CREATE SYSTEM, F10 TO
        EXIT'.  If you press F1 the system will be generated.  If you press F10
        you will exit to DOS with nothing done.

   Change the Replace Database field to Y.

   Press F1
        A list of programs and databases display as they are created.  When
        DPCOMP is done, you are returned to DOS.


                                Documenting your system
                                _______________________


   Now that you have modified your system, you will need a new users manual for
   the end user (or yourself) on how to use your new system.  You will now print
   a new users guide.

   Type DPDOC and press return
        A screen appears which asks three questions.  You have to specify the
        system to be documented, the input doc file, and the output device.
        Notice that all three questions are filled in.
        The default system is the last system you worked on.
        The default doc file is 'UGUIDE.DAT'.
        The default output device is 'LST:'.
        You may change any of these (for example to print to disk change the
        output device to 'A:name'), but for now we will leave these alone.
        Below the questions notice the line 'Press F1 to print, F10 to exit'.
        If you press F1 the printing will start.  If you press F10 you will exit
        without printing.

   Press F1
        The manual starts printing on your printer.
   

   This ends the Getting Started manual.  For more information on how to use
   specific features of dPROG, consult the reference manual.

Special Requirements: Hard drive, dBase III or Clipper.                 
                                                                        
dProg is a dBase III programming tool.  It creates programs and writes  
users manuals from your screen designs.  It is a "must have" program for
anyone who uses (or wants to use) dBase III or CLIPPER.  dProg consists 
of three programs controlled by a main menu.  'DPROG' is a screen       
designer and is the heart of the system.  Using DPROG you simply draw   
the screen exactly how you want it, identify the fields (also very      
simple), and everything else is automatic.  'DPCOMP' takes the screen   
layout you have created and produces all of the needed dBase III files  
(.PRG, .DBF, etc.). Then 'DPDOC' prints out a 30 page step-by-step guide
on how to use your new database system.  dProg is extremely easy to use 
and requires very little knowledge of dBase to run, yet it produces very
impressive results. The documentation provided is also excellent,       
showing how to use each of dProg's functions step-by-step.
