## Information about "HOUSEHOLD REGISTER"

    Wouldn't it be great if you had a complete inventory list of all your
    household items?  HOUSEHOLD REGISTER gives you just that.  It
    maintains a detailed list of your household possessions.  Each
    inventory item is automatically stored by location, category, and
    owner.  The pop-up menus can be easily customized for the location (24
    selections), category (24 selections), and owner (8 selections)
    fields.  And these menus can be turned off, if desired, and entries
    made by typing data directly into the three fields rather than making
    selections from a menu.
    
    Each inventory database can contain 99,999 items and there can be an
    unlimited number of databases.  On-screen help is available for each
    screen and help lines are automatically displayed for each data entry
    field.
    
    HOUSEHOLD REGISTER provides printed reports that can be sent to the
    screen, printer, or a disk text file.  Inventory records can be
    printed
    on 3 x 5 index cards or on Rolodex cards.  A detailed summary report
    can be printed showing the number and value of items by
    location, category, or owner.  A warranty list can be printed
    showing the warranty expiration date for all warranteed intems.

are used to implement the different instructions can usually be found in your
printer manual, they may be listed in decimal, hex, ASCII or all three.

For example the instruction characters to make an Epson MX/RX/FX/LQ print bold
are the "ESC"  character followed by an "E".  Each of the following correctly
define this sequence:
                        DECIMAL      27  69
                        HEX          1B  45
                        ASCII        ESC  E
                  or    ASCII        ^[  E

After entering the on/off codes for your printer press F10 to exit the data
entry. Next press S)elect and your printer definition will be written to a
file for use by Household Register.

WELCOME TO HOUSEHOLD REGISTER:
------------------------------

Household Register (HR) is the premier home inventory program
for IBM-PC users.  Each database can hold up to 99,999 items,
and HR can use an unlimited number of databases.  Each item in
your inventory is categorized by location, category and owner.
The program offers complete database management functions and
full featured report printing.  Reports can be sent to the
screen, printer or a disk text file.  Reports can be printed on
continuous form index or rolodex cards.  An inventory valuation
report prints your complete inventory and a summary of total
items and total value by category, location or owner.  This
program will prove invaluable for organizing your possessions
for reporting purposes in case of loss, theft or a natural
disaster.

The program is extremely easy to use, menu driven and can be
customized to fit your needs.  The program features pop-up
menus on the data entry screen for the category (24 selec-
tions), location (24 selections) and owner (8 selections)
fields.  You can easily change the selection items in the pop-
menu fields to fit your situation.  Also for those who don't
like pop-up menus, the menus can be turned off and you can
enter data into the fields by typing.  The pop-up menus can be
easily turned off and on from within the program.

Household Register also provides on line help screens about the
major program functions and a help-line is provided for all
data entry fields throughout the program.


INSTALLING HOUSEHOLD REGISTER ON SYSTEMS WITH A HARD DISK:
---------------------------------------------------------- 
The diskette that your copy of Household Register was distrib-
uted to you should not be used for running the program.  You
should first make a back-up copy of the distribution disk and
then install Household Register on either your hard or floppy
disk system.

We recommend that you create a sub-directory that will contain
the Household Register program and associated files.  The
following DOS commands will create a sub-directory for House-
hold Register:
                 C>CD\
                 C>MD\HR

Once you have created the new sub-directory, select the new
sub-directory by entering:
                 C>CD\HR

Insert the Household Register distribution disk into drive A.
Next, copy the contents of the Household Register distribution
diskette onto your hard disk by executing the following com-
mand:
                  C>COPY A:*.* C:

To run Household Register type HR and the program will load.

INSTALLING HOUSEHOLD REGISTER ON A FLOPPY DISKETTE:
---------------------------------------------------

Please don't use Household Register distribution diskette to
run the program.  Make a back-up copy of the distribution disk
prior to proceeding.  Refer to your DOS manual for details if
you are unfamiliar with disk copying procedures.  Using your
backup copy of the distribution disk, type HR at the DOS prompt
and the program will load and run.


GETTING STARTED:
----------------

After typing HR a shareware notification screen is displayed,
just press any key and then the Household Register Main Menu is
displayed.  We recommend the following to familiarize yourself
with the program:
                 
1.  Select Item # 7 from the Main Menu to print out the on-disk
users manual.  The program is very straight forward and easy to
use but having the printout of the manual may be helpful if you
have a question over some feature.

2.  If you have an old type CGA color card installed you may
notice some screen flickering, if this is the case select item
#2 from the Main Menu and the install Video Screen will be
displayed.  On this screen press S to cycle to snow, then press
function key F10 to save the set-up to a parameter file. Next
press ESC to exit the screen and then press 9 on the Main Menu
to exit Household Register. Re-start Household Register by
typing HR and the screen flicker or snow will have disappeared. 
The Install Video Type/Colors screen also can be used to change
some colors used in the program, but for now we recommend that
you use the default selections.  You can experiment with the
color scheme at a later time.

3.  If you have an Epson or Epson compatible printer, you can
skip this step.  Next install your printer for use with House-
hold Register.  Select item #4  "Install Printer" from the Main
Menu.  As of the time this is being written, the program only
has built support for Epson printers but by the time you read
this you may be able to select from several printers.  Press H
for help from the printer installation screen to get the
details on installing any printer for use with Household
Register. Basically, if your printer is not Epson compatible,
you will have to find in your printer manual the codes to turn
on and off the following: (1) Normal Print (Can be 10 or 12
characters per inch); (2) Compressed Print (Must be 15 Charac-
ters per inch or greater); (3) Bold or Emphasized Print; (4)
Underline.  Now for those of you who can't find the codes or
don't have a printer manual, you still should be able to print
all the reports, except the index cards and rolodex cards.  Use
the printer installation screen, add your printer and leave
blank the on/and off codes.  Select your printer from the
installation screen so the blank codes are saved to the printer
definitions file.  If you can manually select compressed print
on your printer, you can print on the index and rolodex cards. 
Manually place your printer in compressed mode prior to print-
ing the cards.


4.  We have included a sample data file with the program for
you to use to get quickly familiarize yourself with all the
features of the program.  To use the sample database, select
item #1 "Update Household Register" from the Main Menu, the
program will load and the the file selection screen is
displayed.

Press return to load the sample datafile and enter the main House-
hold Register program.  When you get ready to start your own
household datafile, press ESC at the on the file selection screen
and enter a name for your datafile.  The screen will display the names of
up to 16 data files, however if you have more than 16 data
files and you want to load one that's not displayed, press ESC
and enter the file name.

Once you've loaded the sample datafile, use all the features of
the program, add,  edit, delete some items. Use the report
screen to print out all the different reports.  You probably don't
want to use your index/rolodex cards for sample data, but you
can print using regular computer paper to see how the output will
look on the cards.  Use the selection screen to select specific
items for reports.  See how fast the Find function can locate
items.

5.  After you have familiarized yourself with the operation of
Household Register, press Q to quite, next you should customize
the program for yourself and family.

6.  From the Main Menu Screen select item # 2, "Edit Menu
Descriptions".  Use this selection to customize the location,
category and owner menus to fit your household. After this is
complete you can re-enter the main program and start entering
your household possessions into the program.

7. We hope that you enjoy using the program, we encourage you
to fill out the comment form included with the manual, if you
would like to see some changes or should discover a bug.  We
welcome the comment form even if you decide not to register.

              POWER TO THE SHAREWARE CONCEPT
