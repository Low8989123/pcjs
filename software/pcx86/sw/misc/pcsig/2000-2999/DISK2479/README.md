## Information about "MED#1 2 OF 3 (#2478, #2480 ALSO)"

    MED#1 is a new medical office management system that will increase
    efficiency in the daily administration of the business side of your
    medical practice.  It is designed with special features unavailable in
    other medical systems and is very 'user friendly'.  MED#1 is one of the
    easiest systems to use, especially if you are already acquainted with

    through operations with simple one-key functions that follow the logical
    progression of your normal routine.
    
    No special forms are required for printing.  All reports will be printed
    on 8 1/2" by 11" standard stock paper.  Custom statement forms, and the
    standard insurance HCFA-1500, are available through MEDshare, but the
    system will print without them.

    time.
    
    ~ Instant access to account/patient ledger information to help collect
    at time of office visit.

    practice.  It's faster, more accurate and opens you up to the
    opportunities of future technical advances. So what are you waiting for,
