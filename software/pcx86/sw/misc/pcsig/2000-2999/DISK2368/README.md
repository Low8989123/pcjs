## Information about "C++ TUTOR 1 OF 2 (#2369 ALSO)"

    C++ TUTOR is a comprehensive tutorial for the C++ programming language
    which assumes the user has a moderate amount of programming
    experience.
    
    The C++ source code is included to illustrate how to use C++ in a
    practical sense. This example is meant to be studied, compiled, and run
    by the student.
    
    All of the points of C++ language, including properly-structured
    programming techniques, are covered at the elementary level.  The
    description and instruction are applicable to Borland's implementation
    of C++.
