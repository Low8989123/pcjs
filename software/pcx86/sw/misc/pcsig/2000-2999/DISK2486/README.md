Author Registration: $25.00                                             
Special Requirements: 270K RAM and ANY video board                      
                                                                        
SOFF BALLS was designed to make life easier for anyone who keeps records
for a softball team, baseball team, or even a whole league.  You enter  
game results and SOFF BALLS keeps all the statistics.                   
                                                                        
SOFF BALLS is easy to use.  At the beginning of the season you enter    
team names and rosters.  As each game is played, you enter the game     
score and statistics for each player.  The program lets you display or  
print the team's or player's current hitting statistics.                
                                                                        
Though SOFF BALL does not produce standings for leagues, it tracks the  
following statistics for 20 teams and up to 9,999 players: TAB, OAB, H, 
R, D, T, HR, SAC, B, SO, SA, BA.
