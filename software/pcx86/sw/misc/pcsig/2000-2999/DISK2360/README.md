## Information about "MEGADRAW"

    MEGADRAW is designed to create 12-frame animation sequences which can
    be incorporated into any program.  MEGADRAW can write self-standing
    QuickBasic code (for CGA and EGA) which you can then insert into your
    own program, modify and use as you wish.  These animation sequences can
    be used by any language.
    
    In addition to animation, this program can be used to create
    typefaces/fonts.  Having your own typeface adds a level of
    professionalism not found in many programs.  Create fonts in multiple
    colors and, if you like, animate them.  Stunning business or game
    graphics can be created by having full color text move around the
    screen.

Megadraw is a program designed to create 12 frame animation sequences   
which can be incorporated into any program.  Megadraw can write         
self-standing Quickbasic code (for CGA and EGA) which you can insert    
into you own program, modify and use as you wish. Furthermore, the      
animation sequences can be used by any language.                        
                                                                        
Animation is created by rapidly drawing 12 different images in          
succession, one on top of the other.  This is the same technique        
used in commercial (i.e. television) animation.  The core of the        
program is the drawing section, where the user draws each frame of      
his/her sequence, and then places it somewhere in the sequence of       
12 pictures (A-L).  Many different functions are available, such as     
moving the image up, down, left or right, changing a color in the       
drawing (i.e. light blue-->dark blue), or even performing               
mathematical functions between pictures (XOR pictures 3 and 5).         
                                                                        
The help system is very comprehensive and is found by pressing          
the F1 key.  A list of all the Megadraw functions and their keys is     
given.  For more information on a Megadraw function, press the          
relevant key for that function, for example press the 'A' key for       
information about animation, the 'j' key about joystick use, or F1      
for information about the program (help about help).                    
                                                                        
In addition to animation, this program can be used to create Typefaces  
(fonts).  Having you own typeface for your program adds a level of      
perfection not found in most programs.  In addition, unlike normal      
typefaces where the character is entirely the same color, your          
characters can be a mix of colors.  I have never seen a font maker      
(commercial or shareware) which gave the possibility of creating fonts  
in multiple colors.  In addition, because this is an animation program, 
you can also make your fonts MOVE. Stunning business or game graphics   
could be created by having your full color text move around the screen.

                          Megadraw 4.0
              General Introduction and Instructions


     Megadraw is a program designed to create 12 frame animation
sequences which can be incorporated into any program.  Megadraw can
write self-standing Quickbasic code (for CGA and EGA) which you can
insert into you own program, modify and use as you wish. 
Furthermore, the animation sequences can be used by any language.

     Megadraw requires an Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) or better
(i.e. VGA) display to run though it can create animation that will
work on computers with EGA and CGA.

     Animation is created by rapidly drawing 12 different images in
succession, one on top of the other.  This is the same technique
used in commercial (i.e. television) animation.  The core of the
program is the drawing section, where the user draws each frame of
his/her sequence, and then places it somewhere in the sequence of
12 pictures (A-L).  Many different functions are available, such as
moving the image up, down, left or right, changing a color in the
drawing (i.e. light blue-->dark blue), or even performing
mathematical functions between pictures (XOR pictures 3 and 5).

     The help system is very comprehensive and is found by pressing
the F1 key.  A list of all the Megadraw functions and their keys is
given.  For more information on a Megadraw function, press the
relevant key for that function, for example press the 'A' key for
information about animation, the 'j' key about joystick use, or F1
for information about the program (help about help).  

     Though I realize many users like to have a text file with all
the instructions, Megadraw was designed for people who like to get
hands-on a program as quickly as possible, without having to read
lengthy documentation beforehand.  Megadraw was made to be fun to
use, so go ahead and have fun using it!  Please note that
registered users are provided with an on-disk text file of all the
documentation, complete bound and printed documentation, in
addition to the on-line documentation present in the shareware
version.

     The best way to learn Megadraw is to try it, to fool around
with it.  The program has just about every function one would need
to create animation frames, most of which you will never need. 
However, they are provided to give you many possibilities in
animation.  Some, such as the mathematical functions between
images, are unique to this program and are not to be found in any
program; commercial, shareware or otherwise.  This function may not
seem immediately useful, but it can produce extremely interesting
color effects unmatched anywhere.  Again, the rule is to
experiment, to try all the effects and determine which ones you
like.
    In addition to animation, this program can be used to create
Typefaces (fonts).  Having you own typeface for your program adds
a level of perfection not found in most programs.  In addition,
unlike normal typefaces where the character is entirely the same
color, your characters can be a mix of colors.  I have never seen
a font maker (commercial or shareware) which gave the possibility
of creating fonts in multiple colors.  In addition, because this is
an animation program, you can also make your fonts MOVE. Stunning
business or game graphics could be created by having your full
color text move around the screen.  

     This program was originally developed to complement another
Logika program which made a running television display for a
college TV station.  (this program is for sale--for more
information, please write)  Megadraw created animation which was
incorporated into the television display.  For example, Megadraw
created an ad with a little boy flying a kite.  The kite had the
message "Watch BCTV" emblazoned on it, with the whole kite AND the
words shaking in the wind while the boy ran across the screen.  The
possibilities for visual impact are tremendous.  An example of the
typeface possibilities is provided on the disk with the Quickbasic
ALPHA.BAS program.  

     This program was completely written in Quickbasic 3.0.
Registration costs $40.  Registered users of this program receive
the following: (1) the previously mentioned Documentation text
file (2) updates of Megadraw are mailed to registered users as
they become available (3) Complete printed, bound documentation (4)
a variety of complementary program and assorted goodies to help the
animation artist are included with the registration packet. 

     The source code to this program is also available for an
additional $40.  Users are welcome to modify the program to fit
their needs as long as they do not distribute their modified copy.

     We are currently in the process of upgrading Megadraw so that
it can write self-standing Assembly Language code which could then
be LINKed to a programmer's library and used directly in any
language.  The idea is to make animation creation available to the
programming amateur.  All registered users will receive a free copy
of this upgrade as soon as it becomes available.

     Be sure to include your name, address and phone number with
your registration check.  Please make checks payable to John
Buckman.  Logika also carries several other shareware programs. 
These are available for free if you send two 5 1/4 inch disks in a
postage paid envelope to the address below.  

     If you have any comments or questions about Megadraw or any
other Logika product, please feel free to write. Thank you for your
support of the Shareware concept,
