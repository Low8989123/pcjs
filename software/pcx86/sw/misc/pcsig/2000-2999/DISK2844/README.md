Here's a program for those ''wannabe'' jugglers who've kept putting off
breaking those eggs or tossing those balls. But now there's no excuse.
Learn how to juggle with your computer.  You say, "my computer?" That's
right. 3 BALL JUGGLER, a rather unique program, uses animation to teach
you the basics of three-ball juggling, common mistakes made by
beginners, and some techniques of advanced juggling. A challenging
arcade game is thrown in for more fun.
