About FrankTimesFrankTimes font is my first real font production project.  It's a Type 1 serif font, somewhat like the traditional Times font, but with a different attitude and effect.       It carries a nearly complete character set.  It works well as either a text font or a headline font.     The font is named for The Franklin Times, the newspaper that allowed me the lattitude to expand my career in desktop publishing.  Many thanks to them.		 Please Distribute this font among family and friends, but be sure to enclose this "Read Me" with it.  This font is shareware... please help support future productions by mailing a check to:Jim Pearson101 Sterling CourtFranklinton, NC  27525Comments are appreciated:  America OnLine Address: UrsaBearThanks To Altsys, for their wonderful Fontographer application.... The manual is well written, and the tutorial is good for beginners and old hands alike.Coming soon to a billboard near you.....   an engraved font named "WakeWeek".Thanks.
