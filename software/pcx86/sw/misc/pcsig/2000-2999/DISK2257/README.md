## Information about "TURBO-SCREEN SYSTEM"

    A tool for Turbo Pascal programmers who wish to develop screen I/O
    procedures quickly, TURBO SCREEN SYSTEM generates source code directly
    from ``screen panel'' files which you can design.  The generated code
    will handle field editing, cursor movement, placement of messages and
    prompts, and passing field values to appropriate variables within the
    program.  In addition to the application code, sample code for calling
    the generated procedures is also created.  This makes integration into
    your main program easier.
    
    Screen panels conform to the Common User Access terminology (IBM SAA)
    that some programmers may already be familiar with, but is intuitively
    logical if they are not.  Using this program will virtually eliminate
    common development bugs and help a programmer maintain consistent
    standards throughout all applications.

The Turbo-Screen System, by THE CONNELLY BROTHERS, is a utility package
that builds Screen Panels to support programs written with Borland's
Turbo Pascal Versions 4.0 or 5.0.  For more information concerning
installation and use, please read the file called TSS.MAN which is The
Turbo-Screen System Documentation and User's Manual.

Turbo-Screen was conceived as a means to get programs running quickly
while spending minimum time developing the screen panels for those
programs.  Turbo-Screen generates Pascal code that performs the Common
User Access for your application code.  Common User Access (CUA) is
terminology used by the IBM Systems Application Architecture (SAA).
Even though Pascal is not a language that is accepted within SAA, we
have tried to keep our general terminolgy compatible with the concepts
and terminology of SAA.

The Turbo-Screen System (Hereinafter called TSS) was developed to allow
the easy definition and implementation of screen panels.  Implementation
requires the TSS abilities to:

1. Locate and place messages, and Entry or Menu panel variables (fields
to be editted or chosen) on the screen.

2. Control the editing of the panel fields through the positioning of a
cursor with Cursor-Movement/Editing functions (called Key-Functions).

3. Pass the panel field values to variables within the main program.

The TSS System contains a CODE GENERATING PROGRAM program that generates
Pascal procedures that interface your Menu Design (through a Menu Design
File that you build) into a main Pascal program. The Turbo-Screen System
also produces sample test code as an example of menu inclusion in a main
program.  This test code allows the user to quickly test menu and entry
panel ideas.
