## Information about "LIBERTY BELL SLOT AND WHEEL"

    LIBERTY BELL SLOT is very simple.  You pull the handle and watch three
    barrels roll.  Match numbers three across and score points.  The sound
    and action is very much like an actual slot machine.  The graphics are
    good considering it doesn't use anything other than ASCII characters.

Here are a couple of fun video games that don't require graphics of     
any kind--they use all ASCII characters to create a slot machine and a  
"Wheel-of-Fortune" type guessing game.

TECHSTAFF's WHEEL is an excellent version of the popular TV game show.  
You spin the wheel (actually a bar in this game) and watch the dollar   
values, ``free spin'', and ``lose a turn'' markers slide by. You choose 
vowels and consonants until you can solve the puzzle being displayed at 
the top of the screen.  Everything but Vanna White.
