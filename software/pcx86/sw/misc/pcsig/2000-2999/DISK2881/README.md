Journey into an Aztec pyramid and survive the adventure of a lifetime!  
No other game forces you to die in order to complete it!  That's just   
one of many incredible plot twists in this excellent puzzle-oriented    
arcade/adventure game.                                                  
                                                                        
In PAGANITZU you'll guide your character, Alabama Smith (Al), into a    
vast and dangerous Aztec pyramid. Indiana Jones never had it so tough!  
Inside, you'll confront traps of increasing perplexity, and creatures   
you never dreamed existed.                                              
                                                                        
This is a genuine adventure--not just a series of levels to conquer.    
You can follow different routes to achieve the winning goal.  In fact,  
you can finish PAGANITZU and still have missed many of the game's       
intriguing situations or animated sequences.                            
                                                                        
In part one, "Romancing the Rose", Al discovers that the ancient Aztec  
pyramid, known as "PAGANITZU", holds many dark secrets.  Al             
inadvertently releases a spirit of immense power, who's desire is to    
ravage the world.                                                       
                                                                        
Part one is shareware. The rest of the trilogy, "The Silver Dagger" and 
"Jewel of the Yucatan," are available through registration. Each part   
has new puzzles, new graphics, and stunning story surprises.  You won't 
be bored!
