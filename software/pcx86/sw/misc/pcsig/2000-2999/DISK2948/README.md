PC-SHERLOCK is a "brain" game involving logical reasoning and deduction.
You and your PC play against each other to deduce each other's secret   
number. PC-SHERLOCK presents your PC as an extremely intelligent player 
who is tough to win against. Of course, every advantage is given to the 
human player to ensure that good players can really win against the PC. 
Surprisingly, the game becomes more and more exciting as you learn to   
apply your logic in a more skillful manner. Of course, PC-SHERLOCK is   
random and there is no fixed strategy or formula to win. So it remains  
exciting even after thousands of plays.
