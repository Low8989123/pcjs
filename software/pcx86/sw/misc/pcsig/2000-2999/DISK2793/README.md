Special Requirements: Windows 3.0 or a desktop publisher.

KIDPIX is a collection of children's drawings that have been adapted for
displaying on your computer using Windows 3.0.  The drawings are in 16
color bitmapped format and are suitable for use as "wallpaper" with
Windows 3.0.  The pictures come in both .BMP and .PCX format and can be
displayed by any graphics program that can handle these formats.  The
drawings are similar, in style, to those found in children's books. A
collection of twenty drawings is provided for your enjoyment: a flower,
pig, pumpkin, fish, cat, rooster, puppy, snowman, farm house, a
Christmas drawing, and several others.

The KIDPIX collection of drawings are easy to display. Simply open the
file and select a drawing by either pressing the Enter key or clicking
the mouse.  The drawings can be edited, adding your own special touches,
and saved away on the file for later viewing.  Even though the drawings
are in a child's format, eg. stick people, they can be enjoyed by any
age level.
