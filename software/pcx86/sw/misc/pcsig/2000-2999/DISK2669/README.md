         The BigBox contains eighteen educational games.  To select a
         game from the BigBox, just press one of the letters A
         through R.
         
         To quit the BigBox and return to DOS, press a "+" or the Escape
         key. 
         
        
         Game number one -- Game A 
         
         The first game drills letter matching. 
         
         The BigBox displays an upper case letter.  The player tries
         to press the upper case key matching this letter. 
         
         If the player presses a non-matching key, he'll receive an 
         audible warning.  He'll receive a hint -- and a second 
         chance. 
         
         If he misses again, the BigBox cycles through to another
         upper case letter. 
         
         If the player matches the letter successfully, he'll receive 
         an audible award -- plus a "ticky" mark in a tote box on the 
         screen.  He gets two ticky marks on a successful first guess 
         and one for a successful second guess. 
         
         Once the player fills his tote box with ticky marks, the 
         BigBox breaks away to a cartoon scene with dancing ...
         little things.  The BigBox then returns to upper case
         drilling. 
         
         Press a "+" or Escape at any point to quit this first game and 
         return to the main "BigBox" menu.

        
         Game number two -- Game B 
         
         The first game drills upper and lower case letter matching. 
         
         The BigBox displays a lower case letter.  The player tries
         to press the upper case key corresponding with this lower 
         case letter. 
         
         If the player presses a non-matching key, he'll receive an 
         audible warning.  He'll receive a hint -- the proper upper 
         case key -- and a second chance. 
         
         If he misses again, the BigBox cycles through to another
         lower case letter. 
         
         If the player matches the letter successfully, he'll receive 
         an audible award -- plus a "ticky" mark in a tote box on the 
         screen.  He gets two ticky marks on a successful first guess 
         and one for a successful second guess. 
         
         Once the player fills his tote box with ticky marks, the 
         BigBox breaks away to a cartoon scene with dancing ...
         little things.  The BigBox then returns to lower and upper
         case drilling. 
         
         Press a "+" or Escape at any point to quit this second game and 
         return to the main "BigBox" menu.
         
        
         Game number three -- Game C 
         
         The third game is a memory / problem solving drill. 
         
         The BigBox displays a series of ten doors.  They are number
         "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", and "0".  This 
         number sequence corresponds with the number keys on the top 
         of the alphabeteic keyboard.
         
         The BigBox displays a picture of an object in the center of
         the screen.  The player tries to guess which door conceals a 
         matching object.
         
         The player can open a door by pressing that door number.  The 
         door opens for a moment, revealing the object behind the 
         door.
         
         If the objects match, the player receives an audible award 
         and the door disappears.  If the objects don't match, the 
         door closes.
         
         In either case, another object appears on the center of the 
         screen.  The matching process continues.
         
         
         As the player remembers which doors conceal which objects, 
         the doors will gradually disappear.  When the last door is 
         opened and matched successfully, the screen cycles through a 
         kaleidescope of colors while a siren wails.
         
         The game then resets and another ten doors appear.
         
         Press a "+" or Escape at any time to return to the main 
         BigBox menu.
         

         Game number four -- Game D
         
         Game number four is a counting game.
         
         Players see a number of objects on the screen (between 1 and 
         9 objects will appear).  They must press the number key that 
         describes the number of objects on the screen.
         
         If they press the wrong key, they'll receive an audible 
         warning, a hint -- and a second chance.
         
         If they guess wrong again, they'll recieve another audible 
         warning, plus a short repeating drill to reinforce the proper 
         number.  A new set of objects then appear on the screen.
         
         If the player selects the proper number, he's rewarded with an 
         audible trill. 

         Press a "+" or Escape at any time to return to the main 
         BigBox menu.


         Game number five -- Game E

         Game five is a numeric sequence game.  Players are drilled in 
         number relationships on a number line.  The numeric keys on 
         the top of the alphabetic help serve as a number line 
         mneumonic.

         Players receive a starting number between 1 and 9.  They must 
         first select the proper number just less than the given 
         number.  They'll receive a hint if they guess wrong.

         They must then select the next number greater than the given 
         number.  Again, they'll receive a hint if they guess wrong.

         When both lesser and greater numbers are selected, the rest 
         of the number sequence displays in a graphic manner that 
         reinforces the sequential number relationship.

         Press "+" or Escape to return to the main BigBox menu.


         Game number six -- Game F

         Game number six is an addition drill.

         Players first see an addition problem displayed in the form:

                       3
                     + 4
                   ------
                       ?

         They must try and select the proper answer.

         If they're incorrect, the program displays graphic objects in 
         the amounts that correspond with the problem.  

         For example, the hint for the above problem may be three 
         sneakers displayed above four sneakers.  The player may count 
         the objects to find the proper answer.  This drills the 
         player in counting -- it also drills the player in 
         identifying patterns of numerical groups.

         If the player misses the problem twice in a row, he'll 
         receive the correct answer.  It will repeat several times as 
         reinforcement.

         When the player selects the proper answer, he'll receive an 
         audible reward.

         In both cases, the game then cycles with a new addition 
         problem.

         Once the player correctly solves 12 problems, he'll receive a
         flashy graphics reward.

         Press a "+" or Escape to return to the main BigBox menu.

        
         Games number seven through ten -- Games G through J
         
         These four modules are sets of reading drills.  Each of the
         four modules contains 26 unique words.  These drills should 
         be played with a monitoring helper (like Mom or Dad!), although
         I've heard that many little users will honestly rate themselves
         on whether or not they know the displayed word!

         Just to keep the game fresh, you can add your own custom word
         lists. See the section on "CUSTOMIZING WORD LISTS" later in this
         document.

         The player receives a word.  If he reads the word properly, 
         then press the "+" key.  The player receives an audible 
         award, plus a brightly colored object pops up on the screen.

         If the player misses the word, press any other key.  This 
         word goes back into a stack of missed words.  It will not be 
         displayed again until the player goes through the list of all 
         26 words.

         Once the player goes through all 26 words, the missed words 
         will begin to repeat.  When the player successfully reads a 
         word, the word is dropped from the missed stack.  If the 
         player misses a word again, it goes back into the stack.  
         However, it will not repeat until all of the other missed 
         words are displayed.

         This process continues.  Since missed words return to the 
         stack, players get the chance to drill on the words they have 
         the most problems reading.  Since words don't repeat until 
         all of the other words have passed, players don't get bored 
         with the same words.

         Once the player reads all 26 words (and fills the screen with 
         26 rewards), he's rewarded with flashing lights, a siren 
         wail, and a cartoon of dancing teddy bears.  The game then 
         begins over again.

         Press a "@" or the Escape key to return to the main BigBox
         menu. 
         
        
         Games number eleven through fourteen -- Games K through N
         
         These four modules contain reading and memory drills.
         Each module contains 20 recommended "sight" words for pre-
         primer through first grade.  These drills can be monitored 
         or they can be played alone.  (You can add your own custom
         words -- see "CUSTOMIZING WORD LISTS")

         Four boxes (numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4) flash on the screen.
         Each box covers a word.  One at a time, each box vanishes for 
         two seconds, revealing the word underneath.

         The player then receives a word on the bottom of the screen.  
         This word matches one of the words behind the boxes.  The 
         player must guess which box hides the matching word. 

         The player presses a number from 1 through 4.  The matching 
         box vanishes and reveals its word.  

         If the words do not match, the computer buzzes and the box is 
         replaced.  The drill chooses a new word for the player to 
         match (although it may be the same word).

         If the words match, a siren wails for a moment.  Both words 
         display for two seconds.  Then both words disappear.  The 
         vanished box is NOT replaced.  The drill chooses a new word 
         for the player to match.

         In this manner, each of the four boxes vanishes as the player 
         successfully matches words.

         When all four boxes disappear, the drill "trills" and colors 
         flash on the screen.  The four boxes reappear, with four new 
         words -- one behind each box.  The game continues as above. 

         Each time the player clears the screen of boxes, a "ticky" 
         mark appears on the screen.  There are twenty words to match.  
         The player matches four words per screen.  Therefore, the 
         player must clear five screens to match all of the words.  
         The "ticky" marks help keep track of how many words remain.

         Once the fifth screen of words is matched, the drill breaks 
         away to a Mardi Gras parade!  

         After the parade, the drill begins again with the twenty 
         words.

         At any time, press the "+" or the Escape key instead of a 
         number key to return to the BigBox menu.


         Game number fifteen - game "O"
         

         This game starts off with a package, a laser matter
         transmitter, a power requirement, and a destination state on 
         a map of the United States. 

         For example, it might take "25 pellets of power" to
         transmit a package to Oklahoma -- and you start off with zero 
         pellets!

         Every time you press the space bar, 2 power pellets are
         added to your current power level.  You must try and match 
         the required power rating to successfully transmit the 
         package.

         When you're ready, press the "G" key to try and transmit
         the package.  (Note:  There's no way to back up!  If you pass 
         up the required power amount ... well, you'll just have to 
         take your chances!)

         The package will successfully transmit if you're within
         two pellets of the required amount.  You'll see the package 
         load into the transmitter, you'll hear the matter transmitter 
         warming up, you'll see and hear the laser beam transmit the 
         package across the United States ... then you'll see your 
         package appear in it's destination state!
            
         If you're over or below the two power pellet cushion,
         you'll either fall short in the Atlantic Ocean or ... you 
         might BLOW UP the matter transmitter!  (Not to worry -- 
         there's plenty more where that came from!) 

         This module helps introduce the states of the U.S. and their
         geographic position.  It helps little users learn to count by 
         two -- and also to watch a target value and notice when 
         you're too low or too high!  Finally, it introduces the 
         notion of vectors -- the concept that a line has a value 
         depending on its direction and length.

            Press the "+" or the Escape key to return to the BigBox
         main menu. 
            
        
         Game number sixteen -- game "P"
         

         Game "P" is identical to game "O" except that you count
         pellets by fives instead of by twos.  Also, the power 
         requirements are higher (the packages are heavier!)

         This game starts off with a package, a laser matter
         transmitter, a power requirement, and a destination state on 
         a map of the United States.

         added to your current power level.  You must try and match 
         the required power rating to successfully transmit the 
         package.

         When you're ready, press the "G" key to try and transmit
         the package.  (Note:  There's no way to back up!  If you pass 
         up the required power amount ... well, you'll just have to 
         take your chances!)

         The package will successfully transmit if you're within
         four pellets of the required amount.  You'll see the package 
         load into the transmitter, you'll hear the matter transmitter 
         warming up, you'll see and hear the laser beam transmit the 
         package across the United States ... then you'll see your 
         package appear in it's destination state!
            
         If you're over or below the four power pellet cushion,
         you'll either fall short in the Atlantic Ocean or ... you 
         might BLOW UP the matter transmitter!  (Not to worry -- 
         there's plenty more where that came from!) 

         This module helps introduce the states of the U.S. and their
         geographic position.  It helps little users learn to count 
         by five -- and also to watch a target value and notice when 
         you're too low or too high!  Finally, it introduces the

         Game number seventeen -- game "Q"
         

         Game "Q" differs from game "O" in that YOU pick the state!
         
         When the game begins, the state of "Washington" is the
         selected state.  Every time you press the spacebar, the 
         selected state will advance (roughly north to south, west to 
         east).  Once you get to Maine, it will cycle back to 
         Washington.

         When you're satisfied with the state, press the "G" key.
         The game will now operate just like game "O".

         After you mail your package (either successfully or
         unsuccessfully), you'll again select a state.  Your 
         beginning choice will be the state you just used.

         Press the "+" or the Escape key to return to the BigBox
         main menu. 


         Game number eighteen -- game "R"
         

         Game "R" differs from game "P" in that YOU pick the state!
         
         When the game begins, the state of "Washington" is the
         selected state.  Every time you press the spacebar, the 
         selected state will advance (roughly north to south, west to 
         east).  Once you get to Maine, it will cycle back to 
         Washington.

         When you're satisfied with the state, press the "G" key.
         The game will now operate just like game "P".

         After you mail your package (either successfully or
         unsuccessfully), you'll again select a state.  Your 
         beginning choice will be the state you just used.

         Press the "+" or the Escape key to return to the BigBox
         main menu.

         **NEW ** Customizing Word Lists

         This version of BigBox gives you the ability to customize
         the word lists.  You must run the standalone utility,
         WORDLIST.

         WORDLIST lets you select whether you want to customize
         one of the four 20 word lists or one of the four 26 word lists.
         You can re-select several times to alter every one of the
         lists.

         Make sure you are in the subdirectory containing your copy
         of BigBox.  Then type WORDLIST at the DOS prompt and
         press the Enter key.

         You're prompted for either the 20 word list, the 26 word list,
         or you can quit.  Enter a 1 to select the 20 word lists, enter
         a 2 to select the 26 word lists, or enter a 3 to quit and
         return to DOS.  Press the Enter key after you type the proper
         number.

         Once you've selected either 1 or 2, you must identify which
         of the four possible word lists you wish to change.  If you
         want to back without changing anything, enter a 0 to return
         to the previous selection.

         Otherwise, enter either 1, 2, 3, or 4 and press the Enter key.

         You now will see each of the words in the current list.
         You'll run through the words one at a time.  At each word,
         you're prompted for a Y or an N -- do you want to change the
         word?  If you press N, you continue on to the next word.

         If you press Y, you're prompted for the new word.  Type the
         new word and press enter.  You'll then continue on to the next
         word.

         Once you've cycled through the possible words, WORDLIST
         will save the word list.  You'll return to the menu where you
         can select the 20 word list, the 26 word list, or exit to DOS.
