case the password is forgotten. The only file that is needed to load 
in case of a forgotten password would be the original INITIAL.DAT since 
the password is somewhere in the file. As FINANCIER Plus is shipped a 
password is not required. This is because it is initially set to 0000. 
If you are using a password and decide to stop using one simply set it 
to 0000.

This feature displays a complete instruction manual. The manual is shown
in a window that can be maximized, moved around, or closed with the 
system menu. Use the cursor keys or the Page Up and Page Down keys to 
navigate the document.

FINANCIER Plus uses a text editor to display all calculations. This 
makes it easy to manipulate, save, and load. The mouse can be used 
to highlight text by positioning the cursor over the area to select, 
holding down the mouse button, and dragging the cursor over the text.
The selected text will invert. The Edit operations such as Cut & Paste 
can be used with the selected text.

Standard editing keys such as Page Up, Page Down, Delete, and Insert
can be used for navigating the current document.

Eight BUTTONS are included at the top as shortcuts to the most commonly
used features. Equivalent selections can be made from the pull-down
menus. Appropriate shortcut key combinations can be used where applicable.

When FINANCIER is first run a file named "INITIAL.DAT" is loaded
with the last calculation values. This file is updated when you 
exit the program with the "Close" menuitem under File.

The budget section uses a file named "BUDGET.DAT".

The trend analysis sections use a file named "TREND.DAT".

NOTE: These files must be in the same directory as FINANCIER Plus for 
proper execution. As the files fill with data the user may want to copy 
or rename the file and start over with a fresh file. This can be 
accomplished using the Copy or Rename options under the File menuitem 
of the File Manager. 

The most recent calculation is always shown at the top line of the editor. 
Other features  follow the WINDOWS 3.0 (tm) operating standards. 

When using one of the search functions wildcards can be used.
       
       *   will match 0 or more instances of a character 
       ?   will substitute for one instance of a character
       @   will match exactly 1 alphabetic character
       #   will match exactly 1 numeric character

When FINANCIER Plus is FIRST executed, the program starts in a normal
fashion. If the password is set and saved then whenever the program
is executed, the user will be prompted for the password. 
       
To iconize FINANCIER Plus simply click the minimize button in the upper 
right corner of the window.  The scroll bars can be used to scroll up, 
down, left, or right in the window. The BUTTONS at the top of the window 
are shortcuts for menuitems also contained in the pull-down menus. These 
can save several steps when invoking a function. 

Since calculations are written to the text editor, the user can manipulate 
the data as required. A series of calculations may be performed and saved 
for a later date.  Files  are saved in ASCII which can be used in many 
other programs.

When tax time rolls around use the checkbook ledger and stock portfolio 
to organize your yearly expenses.  The sophisticated search functions 
will make this easy and quick.

AMORTIZATION
------------
Described as a systematic reduction of an asset or debt over a
period of time. An example might be the reduction of a loan
principle on a monthly basis. 

ORDINARY ANNUITY
----------------
An annuity entails installments either in receipt or payment,
where all are of equal amounts. When these receipts or payments
are made at the end of the period it is called an ordinary
annuity. Some examples might be rent, annuities from insurance
companies, and pension plans.

SINKING FUND
------------
Examples of this would be interest income and dividend income.
Sinking funds are cash amounts or assets which are periodically
put into a fund. This fund would be gathered for a specific
reason, such as to retire stock or to pay off a debt when it
reaches maturity.

TREND ANALYSIS
--------------
Trend analysis is a tool used to make predictions based on a two
variable input. An example of this might be future sales based
on the average monthly sales over the past year. The technique
employed is a linear least-squares method.

RULE OF 78'S
------------
The Rule of 78's is used by banks to develop an amortization
schedule. Under this technique a borrower pays more interest
during the beginning of the loan. As the borrower has less debt
the amount paid in interest also becomes less. Interest can be
saved by prepaying. The Rule of 78's is also referred to as the
Sum of the Digits. The interest is equal to 12/78ths of the
annual interest for the first month, 11/78ths of the annual
interest for the second month, etc...

ACCRUED INTEREST
----------------
This is simple interest like that earned on a savings account.
The calculation of interest is based on the principle amount
only. 

COMPOUND INTEREST
-----------------
Compound interest is usually interest charged on an account
where the annual interest rate is compounded at regular
intervals (e.g. monthly). The new interest payment will include
the principle plus interest earned on the principle during the
last interval. An example of this type of interest might be
credit card accounts. 

BOND
----
Bonds, issued by the government or corporations, are
certificates of debt. They guarantee payment of the original
investment including interest by some predetermined date. Bonds
are rated based on investors perception of risk.

A secured bond is backed by collateral which can be sold if the
issuer fails to comply with interest or principle payments.

A convertible bond allows the exchange for other securities by
the same issuer at some date in the future.

Use FINANCIER PLUS to calculate amortization schedules or many other    
financial situations. Schedules and other calculations are shown in a   
text editor that can be manipulated to suit the user's needs. Balloon   
payments and Add-in can be included with schedules. The user can ask    
"What-if" questions such as term determination, present value           
determination, and interest iteration. Rule of 78's can also be used for
calculations. Need to know accrued or compound interest on a sum of     
money? FINANCIER PLUS can determine these along with bond present value,
annuities, sinking fund, discount yield, and future value. The trend    
analysis section makes predictions based on W/Y data.                   
                                                                        
Need to organize? FINANCIER PLUS includes a budget section, calculator, 
calendar, titler, and text editor. The text editor includes             
cut/paste/copy/search and many other editing commands. Need to know the 
number of days between two dates or what day of the week corresponds to 
a calendar date? FINANCIER can find the answer.
