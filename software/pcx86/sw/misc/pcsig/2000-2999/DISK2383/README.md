## Information about "THE HELPER"

    Create hypertext-like programs and Help files to be used as
    information documents for interrelated topics, or as controller
    programs in their own right.   Nice features include: many Help
    screens; easy movement between categories; backtracking; animated
    screens using time-delay overlays; text search, print screens; window
    size control; position and colors for each page; program cursor to
    execute specific DOS commands or shell (for menu programs, auto-
    installation routines, etc); use files independently or interface to
    Turbo Pascal for context-sensitive help and user-specified functions.
    
    Note that you do NOT require Turbo Pascal to use The Helper, although
    sample TP programs are supplied to demonstrate how you can add the Help
    files to your own programs.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION.

Three descriptions of THE HELPER are included here, for catalog listings.
They may be edited if required, provided the edited version remains accurate.


The Helper v3.2 - Creating Help screens and hypertext files
============================================================

Long Description
-----------------
The Helper is a fully integrated package for creating hypertext-
like programs and help files, which can either be used independently
or incorporated into Turbo Pascal programs. Features are:

  *  Create a "Help file" from an ASCII text file, and compile it
     into an interactive hypertext document. This can be used as
     an information document for inter-related topics, or as a
     controlling program in its own right.

  *  Each file is divided into categories of information, with
     a number of pages (screens) per category. Scroll within a
     category, or flip between pages and categories with cursors;

  *  backtrack through previously-selected categories;

  *  animate the screens by using time-delay overlays;

  *  search for text;

  *  print some or all of the Help screens;

  *  set window size and position individually for each page,
     with full color control on each page;

  *  cursor actions can be programmed to execute specific DOS
     commands, or enter a DOS shell (for sophisticated menu
     programs, auto-installation routines, etc).

  *  The Helper itself contains masses of help screens to guide
     you through all the features and aspects of the program
     while you develop your own applications.

  *  sample Help files are supplied as demonstrations and
     tutorials to illustrate most of the features of The Helper.

In addition, if you write Turbo Pascal programs you can add
access to the Help files to them, with the above features plus:

  *  entry from your program into any specific category of the
     Help file (for context-sensitive help) or automatic entry
     into the most recent category used;

  *  exit and re-entry for your own user-specific functions,
     activated either by global "hot keys" or from a cursor bar
     within the document. These user functions could be anything
     from sounding the bell to running another application,
     returning to the controlling Help file on completion.

Note that you do NOT require Turbo Pascal to use The Helper. However,
if you are a Turbo Pascal programmer you can incorporate access to your
compiled Help files directly into your programs. Sample Turbo Pascal
programs are supplied to demonstrate how easy it is to do this. In its
simplest application only 2 or 3 lines of source code are required.

Medium Description
-------------------
With The Helper you can create hypertext-like programs and help files,
which can be used independently or incorporated into Turbo Pascal programs.
An ASCII text file is compiled into an interactive hypertext document.
Once compiled it can be used as an information document for inter-related
topics, or it can become a controlling program in its own right.
Major features are:

Masses of help screens for all the program's features.
Flip between categories with cursor bar.
Backtrack through previously-selected categories.
Animate the screens by using time-delay overlays.
Search for text, and print some or all of the Help screens.
Set window size, position and colors individually for each page.
Cursor actions can be programmed to execute specific DOS commands,
  or enter a DOS shell (e.g. menu programs, auto-installation routines).
Sample Help files are supplied as demonstrations and tutorials.

In addition, if you write Turbo Pascal programs you can access the Help
files directly from them, including context-sensitive help and global
"hot keys" or cursor selection for activating user-specific functions.
These could be anything from sounding a bell to running another
application, returning to the controlling Help file on completion.

Note that you do NOT require Turbo Pascal to use The Helper. However,
sample Turbo Pascal programs are supplied to demonstrate how easy it is
to add the Help files to your own programs. In its simplest application
only 2 or 3 lines of source code are required for full access to a Help
file for your program, including all the features listed above.

Short Description
------------------
Create hypertext-like programs and help files to be used as information
documents for inter-related topics, or as controlling programs in their
own right. Masses of help screens;  Easily flip between categories;

A) DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAM
==============================

  The Helper v3.2 - Creating Help screens and hypertext files
  ------------------------------------------------------------

  With The Helper you can create hypertext-like programs and help files
  with the following features:

    *  a "Help file" is created from an ASCII text file, and this Help file
       is then compiled into an interactive hypertext document. The compiled
       file can be used as an interactive information document where various
       topics can be selected using the arrow keys and a cursor bar, or it
       can become a controlling program in its own right, or a combination
       of both.
  
    *  each Help file can have up to 254 categories of information, with up
       to 254 pages per category (though the shareware version is limited to
       a total of 64 pages). Use PgUp and PgDn to page up and down within a
       category, or flip between pages and categories using highlighted
       cursor options;

    *  backtrack through previously-selected categories;

    *  animate the screens by using time-delay overlays;

    *  search for text;

    *  print some or all of the Help screens;

    *  the window size and position can be individually set for each page,
       with full color control on each page;

    *  auto-sensing of color or mono video cards, to set colors accordingly
       (separate color sets can be specified for color or mono cards);

    *  cursor actions can be programmed to execute specific DOS commands, or
       enter a DOS shell (these features let you create sophisticated menu
       programs, auto-installation routines, etc).

    *  The Helper itself contains masses of help screens to guide you through
       all the features and aspects of the program while you develop your own
       applications.

    *  several sample Help files are supplied to demonstrate most of the
       features of The Helper.

  In addition, if you are adding the Help to your Turbo Pascal programs,
  you can have:

    *  entry from your program into any specific category of the Help file
       (for context-sensitive help) or automatic entry into the most recent
       category used;

    *  exit and re-entry for your own user-specific functions, which can be
       activated either by global "hot keys" or from a cursor bar within
       the document. These user functions could be anything from sounding
       the bell to running another application, returning to the controlling
       Help file on completion.

  Note that you do NOT require Turbo Pascal to use The Helper. However, if
  you are a Turbo Pascal programmer you can incorporate access to your
  compiled Help files directly into your programs. Several sample Turbo Pascal
  programs are supplied to demonstrate how easy it is to do this. In its
  simplest application only 2 or 3 lines of source code are required for full
  access to a Help file for your program, including all the features listed
  above.


B) LIMITATIONS
===============

  The shareware version of The Helper is limited to a total of 64 pages
  per Help file. The full version supplied to registered users can have
  up to 2000 pages, and even this limit can be exceeded if necessary.


C) REQUIREMENTS
================

  Required:  IBM-PC or compatible.


D) LIST OF PROGRAM FILES
=========================

  go      .bat    Start-up and installation batch file
  go      .txt    Text file used by go.bat
  helper  .bat    Batch file for running The Helper
  helper  .exe    The Helper program
  helper-s.hlp    Help file for helper.exe
  usehelp .exe    Program for using your own Help files
  install .hlp    Help file used for installing The Helper
  animate .hls    Animation demonstration text file for The Helper
  demo?   .hls    More demonstration text files
  demo?   .pas    Demonstration Turbo Pascal programs
  dosshell.tpu    Turbo Pascal 4 unit
  help    .tpu    Turbo Pascal 4 unit
  library .tpu    Turbo Pascal 4 unit
  readme  .doc    Read this file first
  catalog .doc    Program description, for a catalogue listing.


E) REGISTRATION
================

  Registration is US$38-00 or Aus$50-00.


F) HOW TO START THE PROGRAM
============================

  Type GO for a guided installation onto a hard disk, or..
  Copy all files to your hard disk if you have one. You can run from
  a floppy disk if you need to, but disk operations will be slower.

  The program automatically detects color or mono video cards and sets
  some of the colors accordingly. So if you have a color video card with
  a mono screen some of the colors may seem strange, or invisible. If that
  happens, use the command-line parameter /M to force the use of the mono
  color set.   ie. type   HELPER /M    at the DOS prompt.

  The program is normally started by typing:
  HELPER     (press Enter) at the DOS prompt.

  Command-line parameters can be added:
  HELPER [fn] [/M]      fn = filename to edit,  /M = force mono colors.
