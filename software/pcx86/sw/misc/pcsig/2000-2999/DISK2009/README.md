## Information about "OVERLORD  DISK 2 OF 3 (2008, 2010 ALSO)"

    OVERLORD can help you manage your apartment building, condominium, club,
    parking garage, church, homeowners association, or any other type of
    organizations that tracks members by a "unit" such as a lot or apartment
    number, license number or serial number.  OVERLORD is a multifunction
    program designed to help you organize and control your member records
    and accounts.
    
    OVERLORD prepares and prints bills with an optional late charge feature,
    percentage or dollars.  You can specify the current balance above which
    late charges should be billed.  You can specify different late charges
    for billing and for delinquencies.  You can do the billing all at once
    for all clients or you can use cycle billing and specify the billing
    interval period by month, quarter, half year and year, you can do mixed
    interval billing for each account.
    
    You can send customized letters to clients; spelled contract start and
    expiration dates, current balance, and lien or deposit amount are
    imbedded within the text.  Choices for salutation can be selected.  You
    can choose to print on your own preprinted stationery or have the
    program generate the letterhead for you.  You can do selective mailing
    to clients, based on contract dates, current balance, deposits or liens,
    etc.  Generate mailing labels or print addresses on envelopes.  All
    mailings are prepared to fit window envelopes.  If the user has a hard
    drive, an audit trail is automatically activated showing current user,
