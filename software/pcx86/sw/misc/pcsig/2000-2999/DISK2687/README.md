IN-CONTROL is a well-rounded business prospect/contacts and activity-   
tracking system. It provides a Rolodex, activities list, management     
reports, expense reports and an appointments tickler.                   
                                                                        
Everything is on-line with fast search capabilities.  You get 60 on-    
line help screens, and has a unique built in zip code\area cross referen
feature.  The Rolodex features names, addresses and notations retrieval 
and a graphic ``layer-in'' ability which lets you temporarily merge mail
lists. In addition, it is network-ready.  The system also includes:     
appointments tracking, expenses, graphics, free-form data search,       
labels management and reports.  A built-in telephone dialing system     
uses your modem and frees your phone for incoming calls.  A built-in    
proposal and invoice generator is provided.  The program standardizes   
your prospecting and follow-up information and converts forgotten       
verbal commitments into a focused daily list of appointments and        
callbacks that nets you extra business.                                 
                                                                        
IN-CONTROL requires registration after you have placed 50 records in    
the Prospect file.  If not registered, this program will lock you out   
from access to the program, though the data files are always intact.
