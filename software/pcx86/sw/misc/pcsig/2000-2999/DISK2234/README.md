## Information about "VPT, VFONT, READ, SEL, SNOOP, V7CURS"

    With this program, VGA or MCGA users can use the quarter-million
    (262,144) available VGA colors.  It's interactive and easy to use. It
    has a graphic display -- there are no ``magic numbers'' to type.
    
    Set any text-mode attribute to any color out of the quarter-million and
    control the overscan (border) color (not available on MCGA
    systems).  The colors ``stick'' with almost all programs.  Load and
    save your favorite settings in color files, and use the program in a
    command-line mode (for batch files).
    
    VPT operates in text mode and allows setting of any or all of the
    sixteen attributes available in text mode.
    
    Tired of the default VGA text-mode font?
    VFONT contains and loads replacement fonts for VGA systems.  It
    includes two variations of a ``modern'' font, and a handwritten
    ``scrawl'' font.
    
    The DOS version is a TSR (memory-resident) program that takes up
    approximately 4.5K of RAM, and works only in text modes.  The OS/2
    version calls the OS to request a new font, and works only in
    full-screen sessions.
    
    The four fonts are modern solid-line, modern-double-line,
    scrawl-straight-line, and scrawl-scrawled-line.  Modern is a pleasing,
    sans serif font.  Scrawl is a handwritten looking ``scrawled'' font.
    
    VFONT remains in place even if your software sets the video mode. This
    means the font won't go away as with some other font programs.  The
    OS/2 version is saved and restored by the OS when switching between
    screen groups.
    
    If you are a batch file writer who needs interaction and the use of
    DOS' environment variables, here are utilities to make your life
    easier.
    
    Most batch file utilities return results in the ERRORLEVEL.  These
    utilities set an environment variable, which means direct character
    results can be communicated between programs.  If you ask for a Y or N
    you can test for a Y or N.
    
    READLN and READKEY are programs that get input from the keyboard and
    place it in environment variables.  They're perfect for making
    interactive batch files and much easier to use than utilities that use
    ERRORLEVEL to communicate the results.
    
    READLN displays the prompt and waits for input.  All input up to an
    ENTER is placed in a specified environment variable.  If the first
    letter of var is capitalized, the input will be also.
    
    READKEY displays the prompt and waits for input.  ONE character is read
    (no ENTER is needed) and it is placed in the environment variable var.
    If the first letter of var is capitalized, the input character will be
    also.  If an extended key (function key, arrow keys, &c.) is pressed,
    the ASCII representation of the hexadecimal scan code for the key is
    placed in the variable. If a Carriage Return, Escape, BEL, or TAB is
    pressed, the ASCII representation of the character's ASCII code is
    placed in the variable.
    
    SEL is an ANSI color selector for DOS or OS/2 for those who use any
    ANSI screen driver (ANSI.SYS, NANSI.SYS, &c. under DOS; ANSI ON for
    OS/2).
    
    The program has easy color selection using mnemonics instead of
    numbers, a random color selection mode, and sets the prompt to a
    contrasting color.
    
    This utility is not for beginners; it's for programmers and advanced
    users who wish to snoop around the VGA BIOS.
    
    SNOOP shows various EGA and VGA pointers maintained by BIOS, and
    displays the contents of the tables these pointers point to.  These
    tables include the user palette override table, the alpha character
    override table, and the SAVE_PTR table.  The program also displays the
    current contents of the VGA color registers.
    
    V7CURS is for anyone who owns a VGA card based on the V7VGA chipset,
    such as the FastWrite VGA or VRAM VGA and hates blinking cursors.
    
    It exploits the non-blinking hardware cursor built into the V7VGA
    chipset by Video-7/Headland Technologies.  It is a small TSR (memory-
    resident) program that turns off the blinking, leaving you with an XOR
    cursor.  This mode shows what's underneath the cursor.

Program Title: Read                                                     
Author Registration: None.                                              
Special Requirements: DOS 3.3 or 4.0                                    
                                                                        
If you are a batch file writer who needs interaction and the use of DOS'
environment variables, here are a couple of utilities to make your life 
easier.                                                                 
                                                                        
Most batch file utilities return results in the ERRORLEVEL.  These      
utilities set an environment variable, which means direct character     
results can be communicated between programs.  If you ask for a Y or N,  
you can test for a Y or N.                                              
                                                                        
READLN and READKEY are programs that get input from the keyboard and    
place it in environment variables.  They're perfect for making          
interactive batch files and much easier to use than utilities that use  
ERRORLEVEL to communicate the results.                                  
                                                                        
READLN displays the prompt (which must be in double quotes) and waits   
for input.  All input up to an ENTER is placed in specified environment 
variables.  If the first letter of var is capitalized, so will the 
input.
                                                                        
READKEY displays the prompt (again in double quotes) and waits for      
input.  ONE character is read (no ENTER is needed) and it is placed in  
the environment variable var.  If the first letter of var is            
capitalized, so will the input character.  If an extended key (function 
key, arrow keys, etc.) is pressed, the ASCII representation of the       
hexadecimal scan code for the key is placed in the variable. If a       
Carriage Return, Escape, BEL, or TAB is pressed, the ASCII              
representation of the character's ASCII code is placed in the variable.

Special Requirements: CGA, and ANSI driver.

SEL allows easy color selection using mnemonics instead of numbers; has 
a random color selection mode; and sets the prompt to a contrasting     
color.

Special Requirements: EGA, or VGA.                                      
                                                                        
This isn't an end-user program; rather, it's for programmers and 
advanced users who wish to snoop around a part of the VGA BIOS.  SNOOP 
is a program to show various EGA and VGA pointers maintained by BIOS, 
and display the contents of the tables these pointers point to.  These      
tables include the user palette override table, the alpha character     
override table, and the SAVE_PTR table.  The program also displays the  
current contents of the VGA color registers.

Author Registration: None.                                              
Special Requirements: VGA with the V7VGA chip set.                      
                                                                        
For anyone who hates blinking cursors and owns a VGA card based on the 
V7VGA chipset, such as the FastWrite VGA and VRAM VGA.                  
                                                                        
V7CURS exploits the non-blinking hardware cursor built into the V7VGA   
chipset by Video-7/Headland Technologies.  It is a small TSR that turns 
off the blinking attribute, leaving you with an "XOR" cursor; this mode 
shows what's underneath the cursor.
