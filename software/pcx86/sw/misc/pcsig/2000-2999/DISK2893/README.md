FAST INVOICE WRITER is just what the small businessman ordered.  A      
winner for everyone from landlords to health professionals!             
                                                                        
This program provides invoices, purchase orders, requisitions, or any   
document similar in format to an invoice.  Compute taxes or bill by the 
hour -- the program does all the calculations.                          
                                                                        
Produce a numbered, professional-looking document in about 60 seconds   
and print as many copies as you want.  Then print your mailing labels   
and inserts for 10-inch window envelopes.  Your firm's name, address,   
and phone number are printed on the invoice in large letters.  Taxes and
shipping charges are handled.  The program contains a customer database 
routine and cashbook file for printing periodic summaries.
