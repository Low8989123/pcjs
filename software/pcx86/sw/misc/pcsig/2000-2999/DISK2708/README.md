Disk No: 2708                                                           
Disk Title: One View                                                    
PC-SIG Version: S1.0                                                    
                                                                        
Program Title: One View                                                 
Author Version: 1                                                       
Author Registration: None.                                              
Special Requirements: Hard drive.                                       
                                                                        
ONE VIEW is a complete DOS and hard disk management utility for MIS     
Managers and System Administrators.  Monitor and control the activity of
a computer station for up to nine different users.                      
                                                                        
Each user can quickly define their own menu to run specific application 
programs or issue DOS commands.  Specify additional arguments on the    
command line for each application.  Define whether or not ONE VIEW      
should automatically transfer to the directory of the program in order  
to access all subsidiary program files.  As a DOS utility, ONE VIEW has 
easy-to-use pull-down menus and a directory tree display.  Make, remove,
rename and even hide directories.  Tag specific files to copy, move,    
delete, rename, or change the attribute.  Files can be encoded so that  
they can not be read or executed by other users.  ONE VIEW has          
file-searching capabilities that work across all directories.  Select a 
file and automatically execute the application program.                 
                                                                        
ONE VIEW is more than a typical DOS shell or file management utility -- 
it is the type of complete management tool for a PC computer station    
that has previously only been available on mini- and mainframe          
computers.  With ONE VIEW, an administrator can control and monitor all 
computer activities.  The system administrator and each user must use a 
password to access their own menu, but the system administrator has     
complete access to the menu of each user.  The administrator may set up 
all application menus for users who are not familiar with the system.   
                                                                        
Reports and statistics can be generated recording the user name, the    
application, the date and time of execution, the amount of time the     
program was executed, and the amount of time there was activity with the
application.  The report or screen display of user activity can be      
sorted by user, by application, by amount of time in use, by amount of  
time working, or by date and is available in ASCII or LOTUS 1-2-3       
format.  ONE VIEW is the perfect program for all managers who need to   
monitor all computer activity, and while allowing each user to work     
independently.                                                          
                                                                        
ONE VIEW has an excellent file security system.  For each application   
program or file, the administrator can restrict access to certain       
users.  Even if a user exits to DOS, uses another bootable disk, or     
copies the program elsewhere, access to that program will be            
restricted.  All invalid access attempts are recorded in the computer   
usage statistics.                                                       
                                                                        
ONE VIEW is a perfect way to let users have access to their own system  
and yet prevent unauthorized copies of software from spreading within   
the company.
