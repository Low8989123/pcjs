  Version  4.10   ProDev*QUOTE QUOTATION SYSTEM REGISTRATION FORM    12/20/90

  Thank  you  for evaluating my Shareware Software.  If you find that you are
  able  to  use  this software beyond the evaluation stage, you MUST register
  your  copy  with PRO DEV Software.  The Registration Fee is only $40.00 for
  the  QUOTE  program,  $15.00  for  the  QBROWSE  program and $10.00 for the
  QTRACK  program plus $5.00 Shipping and Handling per order.  The QTRACK and
  QBROWSE  programs  are  on  the  ProDev*QUOTE  Utilities  Disk  that can be
  ordered  from your Disk Vendor or BBS downloaded separately.  The next page
  is the order form.  To insure your satisfaction, I offer the following.

                           Pre-Registration Support

  You  can  call  (preferred) or write to PRO DEV Software with any necessary
  questions  about  setting  up  or effectively using this Shareware for your
  type  of  company.   This system is extremely flexible and can be used by a
  WIDE  variety  and  size  of  business.    Please  be  sure  to  follow the
  installation instructions in the README.DOC file

  You  must  operate  this  system on a hard disk OR with the data files on a
  separate  disk  in drive B: (those with DBF and DBT file name extenders) if
  you  don't  have  a  hard  disk.    If I determine that you have received a
  faulty   evaluation   copy,  I  will  probably  send  you  a  complimentary
  evaluation  copy.    PRO  DEV  Software's  hours are 8:00 to 5:00 Monday to
  Friday Eastern Time USA and the telephone number is 616-788-2243.

                Here is what you will get for your registering.

  1.  You  will  receive  a  registered  copy  of  the  latest version of the
      ProDev*QUOTE  Quotation  system  disk.  You will NOT have to answer the
      copyright  screen  question.  You will also be able to skip the closing
      screen.    You  will NOT be sent a printed copy of the documentation as
      the  on-disk  manual is complete and describes all features.  This also
      holds  down  the  registration  cost of this powerful system.  The same
      applies if you also register the QTRACK or QBROWSE programs.

  2.  You  will  receive  at least 1 year of telephone (preferred) or written
      support.    For  registrants  outside  the USA or Canada, I will not be
      able  to  return  telephone  calls  as  the  overseas rates can rapidly
      exceed the low registration cost.

  3.  If  within  90 days of receiving the registered disks you find that you
      are  not  satisfied  with  the  registered software, you may return the
      REGISTERED  DISKS  in  the  original  PRO  DEV Software disk mailer (or
      equivalent) for a full refund.

  4.  If  you  discover  what  appears  to  be  a  bug, PRO DEV Software will
      attempt  to  resolve  the bug within 30 days from the time that PRO DEV
      Software   receives   your   full  telephoned  (preferred)  or  written
      description  of the bug.  If the cause of the perceived bug is a result
      of  unusual  hardware  or software that you are using, PRO DEV Software
      can  not  always  modify  the  programs  to  operate  with your unusual
      arrangements.

  Please  Send  Check,  Money  Order,  Postal  Order  OR  you  can enter your
  American  Express,  Master  or  Visa card number along with your signature.
  If  you are outside the USA or Canada please have your bank prepare a check
  in  USA  dollars  drawn  on a USA bank.  You may find it easiest to send an
  American  Express  Check or even USA cash.  Canadian registrants can submit
  their  check  using  Canadian  funds WITHOUT exchange rate adjustments.  If
  Canadians  use a Credit Card the Credit Card Company WILL apply the current
  exchange  rate.   Registrants outside the USA or Canada should add an extra
  $5.00 USA equivalent to cover extra banking and/or postage costs.

Copyright  1990 By PRO DEV Software    ProDev*QUOTE Utilities Version 4.10n

             Vendor Encouragements And Restrictions  05/01/90

This  document  contains  PRO  DEV  Software's  message to Disk Copying and
Bulletin  Board  Services.   This is the first release for the ProDev*QUOTE
Utility Program disk.

First  of  all,  thank  you for carrying my Shareware software in your Disk
Copying  Service  catalog  or  on  your  Bulletin Board Service.  You are a
vital link in the Shareware distribution process.

                               You MAY . . .

1.  This   on-disk   letter   authorizes   you   to  include  the  enclosed
    ProDev*QUOTE  Version 4.10 disk of Shareware software in your Shareware
    Cataloging   and  Disk  Copying  Service.    This  is  a  non-exclusive
    authorization.   Further, this on-disk letter notifies you that you may
    NOT  continue  to  distribute  ProDev*QUOTE  Utility  software with any
    version  number  lower  than  Version 4.10.  If you receive a copy with
    any  files with an extender of .MEM, you MUST delete those file to make
    the disk un-registered.

2.  You  may  sell  disks containing copies of this software as long as you
    do  NOT  imply  to  your customers that this is "free" software.  It is
    best  if  your  catalogs  make it clear that this is Shareware software
    that  the  end  user  must  register  with PRO DEV Software to continue
    using  beyond the evaluation stage.  You may add your own files to this
    disk  as  long  as none of them give any impression that this Shareware
    software  is  "free".    If  you  list  the  registration  fees in your
    catalog,  DO  NOT  use  words like "Donation", "Contribution", or other
    such  words.   It is a REGISTRATION FEE of $15 for the QBROWSE program,
    $10 for the QTRACK program plus $5 S&H.

3.  If  you  are  a Disk Copying or Bulletin Board Service and you obtained
    this  software  from  other than PRO DEV Software, you may not have the
    latest  version.   You are encouraged to write or call PRO DEV Software
    and ask for the latest version.

    PRO DEV Software   545 Grover Road   Muskegon, MI 49442
    616-788-2243 (8:00-5:00 M-F Eastern Time)  CompuServe PPN: 72617,1266

                             You may not . . .

1.  LIST.COM  is  included on this disk with written permission from Vernon
    Buerg  and may NOT be removed or replaced with a different version.  DO
    NOT  remove  any  of  the  following files from the disk (or compressed
    file if you are a BBS):

    BROWPROG.EXE  QBROWDOC.EXE  TRAKPROG.EXE  TRACKDOC.EXE  PRINTERS.EXE
    INSTALL.EXE   LIST.COM      U-VENDOR.DOC  REGISTER.DOC  READ-ME.DOC

Copyright  1990 By PRO DEV Software    ProDev*QUOTE Utilities Version 4.10n

                  Vendor Encouragements And Restrictions

2.   If  you are a Disk Copying Service, please do not further compress the
     above  files,  particularly  so  as  to add other software to the same
     disk.    You  may  NOT  put one of my competitors products on the same
     disk!      You   may  add  your  identifying  and  instruction  files.
     Naturally,   a  BBS  operator  will  compress  the  entire  system  as
     required.   If you sell collections on 720k or 1.4m disks, this system
     can   be   combined   with   the  ProDev*QUOTE  system  disk  and  the
     ProDev*EPRICE disk.

3.   You  may NOT replace any of the LHARCed or SCRNCHed files with another
     form  of  archiving,  packing  or  ziping.   If you are a BBS, you may
     archive/pack/zip  the  files  WITHOUT  first unLHARCing or unSCRNCHing
     the  files.    This  is because my INSTALL program expects the LHARCed
     and SCRNCHed files.

I  also  encourage  you  to  give this full featured system the write-up it
deserves  in  your  catalog.    Below  are  my  "unbiased" {grin} suggested
catalog  descriptions.    I really get discouraged when I see catalogs that
just  say  "ProDev*QUOTE  Quote/Bid Utilities".  These are really powerful,
low registration fee utilities that support the ProDev*QUOTE system.


                           Catalog Descriptions

1.   One Liner Description

     (disk  #)  ProDev*QUOTE  Utility  Programs  Ver.  4.10 - Used to Track
     actual costs and Browse ProDev*QUOTE data files. [ASP].

2.   Complete Description

     (disk  #)    ProDev*QUOTE  Utility  Programs  Version 4.10 [ASP].  The
     Tracking  program  is  used  to track actual costs for a quotation and
     print  exception  reports  that allow you to see all variances between
     the  quote  estimate  and the actual costs.  The Browse program allows
     you  to rapidly Browse/Edit the ProDev*QUOTE material, labor, supplier
     and quotation data files via overlaid Pop-Up windows.



Again, thank you for carrying my Shareware software.

     Very truly yours,



      George Abbott

     Member - Association Of
     Shareware Professionals
