The sequel to the ultimate bricks and paddles is here. SUPER BLAST      
has 34 levels and up to 17 simultaneous balls. The game contains        
many special bricks that do things like move, multiply, eat balls, and  
explode into eight balls. Also included are one way bricks, tunnels to  
other levels, and paddle expansion and contraction bricks.              
                                                                        
This game will work with any graphics card from Hercules to CGA, EGA,   
and even 800x600 VGA in 16 colors. The game only supports a joystick if 
you have an AT class computer.
