DELUXE YAHT is a very attractive computerized version of the famous     
Yathzee dice game.  In it, you throw five dice and try to match certain 
combinations (all sixes, full house, straights, etc).  You get a        
different amount of points for different combinations, and the player   
with the most points after the last throw wins!  The computer rolls the 
dice and you choose the combinations.  Old Yathzee players will like    
this version because the program tracks the scores on-screen with a     
score sheet that looks like the original paper version.  Deluxe Yaht is 
easy to use, and great fun for adults and children.

     ------------------------INTRODUCTION---------------------------------


         DELUXE YAHT is a fast paced game similar to the dice game Yahtzee.
    Up to four people may play, trying to obtain the highest possible score.
    DELUXE YAHT features include mouse/keyboard support, pop-up windows,and
    hi-res graphics. The game also keeps track of player statistics includ-
    ing individual highest/lowest games, the top five averages and the top
    five games.

    -------------------------SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS--------------------------

          Deluxe Yaht will run on most IBM PC XT/AT and compatibles equip-
    ped with EGA or VGA graphics cards. The game will accept either mouse
    or keyboard input, however the game plays best with a mouse.

    The following files are required to run Deluxe Yaht and should all be
    located in the same directory :

    DELYAHT.EXE                   Executable game file
    STAT.DAT                      Player data file
    HIGH.DAT                      High game data file
    AVG.DAT                       High average data file

   -------------------------GETTING STARTED-------------------------------

         At the dos prompt type DELYAHT to start the game. Make sure the
   mouse is loaded before you boot up the game. If you do not have a
   mouse the cursor can be controlled with the arrow keys. Press Enter
   to activate the buttons or menu after moving the cursor on them.

   ------------------------------ RULES-----------------------------------

         The rules are included in the game and can be accesssed anytime
     during play by activating the pull down menu 'Rules', then clicking
     on 'View Rules'. Scoring examples are also located there.
