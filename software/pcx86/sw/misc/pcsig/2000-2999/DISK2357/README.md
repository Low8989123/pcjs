## Information about "WITHIN & BEYOND DOS"

    TELEDISK is like a diskette FAX machine.  Turns any diskette into a
    compressed DOS file, suitable for sending over a modem or network.
    Reconstruct an EXACT duplicate of the diskette from the image file. A
    nicely-windowed color operation.  TELEDISK is great for those
    bootable diskettes or those with complex subdirectories. It even works
    with some ``copy-protected'' diskettes.
    
    RAINDOS is a DOS device driver which provides an absolutely
    transparent way to read, write and format DEC Rainbow 100 DOS
    diskettes. Supports all DOS functions and requires a 1.2M diskette
    drive.
    
    Eagle16 is another DOS device driver which provides an entirely
    transparent way to read, write and format Eagle 1600 DOS diskettes.
    Supports all DOS functions and requires a 1.2M diskette drive.
    
    HP150.SYS is the DOS device driver which provides a completely
    transparent way to read, write and format Hewlett Packard HP150
    diskettes. It also supports all DOS functions and requires a 1.2M
    diskette drive.
    
    SHARP56 is another of our compatibility series.  This is a DOS device
    driver which provides a totally transparent way to read, write and
    format Sharp 5600 series diskettes.  Supports all DOS functions and
    requires a 1.2M diskette drive.
