## Information about "UNISCREEN DISK 1 OF 2 (2057 ALSO)"

    Programmers, would you like to build your input format screens interact-
    ively?  UNISCREEN is a true universal screen format generator, usable in
    any language.
    
    The key to professional looking programs is the screen formats.
    However, producing such screens is often a tedious and time consuming
    task. UNISCREEN is a complete screen management system that offers:
    interactive format generation, windows, menus, popups, pulldowns,
    variable field and text attributes, alphanumeric and numeric selectable
    fields, mouse and printer support, and monochrome and color display
    support.  Most importantly, UNISCREEN supports all the major languages
    and compilers, such as, C, Pascal, BASIC, Cobol, Fortran, Assembler,
    Prolog, Clipper, and dBASE III Plus.
    
    UNISCREEN is invaluable to anyone wanting to improve the appearance of
    their programs.  It even comes with a DEMO program to illustrate its
    ease of use.
