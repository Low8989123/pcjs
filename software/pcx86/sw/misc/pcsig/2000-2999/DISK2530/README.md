                     SCHOOL-MOM Ver. 3.57
                          The Manual



1. INTRODUCTION
SCHOOL-MOM is an educational tool for children ages 4 to 16.
Its main options are Music, Art, English, Spelling, Math, Exams,
Time and Registration.  The Registration option can be used to
print a registration letter or to enter your name and
registration number in the register.dat file after you have
registered.  This program uses a back-to-basics approach to
teaching.  I think you will enjoy it.

There is also a separate file change program for parents or
teachers that allows you to edit or add to the School-Mom data
files.  Before you can use this file change program you must be
a registered owner.

The minimum hardware requirements for running School-Mom are
256K RAM and color graphics adapter (CGA).  A mouse is optional
but if used it should be a Microsoft (tm) compatible, serial one.
The minimum software requirement is DOS version 2.0 or higher.


2. MAIN MENU WINDOW
This window lists all the main options that you may choose from
such as Music, Art, Spelling, English, Math, Registration, Exams
and Time.  There are several ways to select an option from
Main Menu.  You may use the up or down arrow keys to highlight
the desired option then press the ENTER key to accept the option.
You may also press the key corresponding to the first letter of
the desired option until the option is highlighted then press
the ENTER key.  Accept END or press the ESC key to stop the
program.

If you want to use a mouse to select options from the menus you
must first tell School-Mom that you will be using a mouse.  You
can do this from Main Menu by simultaneously pressing the
Alt key and the m key.  School-Mom will ask if you will be
using a Microsoft (tm) compatible, serial mouse.  If yes then
press the y key.  You can now use the mouse to highlight the
desired option then press the left button to select.  You may
also use the right mouse button in place of the ESC key.

Use the right and left arrow keys, or the mouse to select whether
or not you want sound.  All options produce sound to indicate a
wrong answer (beep) or a correct answer (tune).  The sound option
must be on if you want to use the Music Composition option.


3. SUBMENUS OR LEVEL WINDOWS
All options except Registration have submenu windows.  These
windows are used to select learning levels or to choose a
particular suboption.  Choose from this menu using the same
techniques as in Main Menu.  In particular, use the mouse,
arrow keys, or the key corresponding to the first letter of the
suboption to highlight the desired suboption then press the ENTER
key or the left mouse button to accept.  Accept END, or press the
ESC key, or press the right mouse button to return to Main

Menu.


4. MUSIC COMPOSITION
This option has three suboptions.  You can use these suboptions
to compose and play tunes.  Note that in all three Music
suboptions, only the treble staff is shown; therefore, only
octave 3 notes and a few of octave 4 notes will appear on the
screen.

     A. LEVEL 1
     In Level 1 you are shown a musical scale and asked to enter
     notes by pressing a, b, c, d, e, f, or g.  As you press a
     key, the corresponding note is played and displayed on the
     scale.  If you make a mistake you can delete the previous
     notes by pressing the BACK-SPACE key.  When you are done
     just press ENTER to play the entire tune or press n to start
     a new tune.  You may also press the SPACE BAR to skip a note
     or equivalent, pause for one beat.  Also, press the up arrow
     key to go to the next higher octave or the down arrow key to
     go to the next lower octave.  When you first start a tune,
     octave 3 is the default.  The notes of some octaves will not
     be displayed on the scale but will still play.  As always,
     press ESC to exit the option and return to Main Menu.

     B. LEVEL 2
     Level 2 is similar to Level 1 except longer tunes can be
     composed and the note duration can be changed.  Either 1/2,
     1/4, 1/8, or 1/16 notes can be played.  Change the duration
     by using the left or right arrow key.  This change will
     remain in effect until you change the duration again.

     C. LEVEL 3
     Level 3 is similar to Level 2 except that sharp and flat
     notes can also be played.  To choose a sharp note press the
     +/= key first then the note key.  To choose a flat note
     press the _/- key first.  The change stays in effect only
     until the note is played then it reverts back to a simple
     note.  To remove a sharp before the note is played, press
     the _/- key.  To remove a flat before the note is played,
     press the +/= key.

When in Level 2 and Level 3 you may store your tunes to a file
and retrieve them later.  To store a tune press the ALT key then
press the s key before releasing the ALT key.  Now type the name
of the file where you wish the tune stored and press ENTER.  Do
not use an extension.  For example, use a word like "tune" but
do not use "tune.dat".  To get a tune that you've stored
earlier, press the ALT key then press the g key before releasing
the ALT key.  Now, type the name of the tune file without an
extension then press ENTER.  Your old tune will be played and
displayed ready for editing.


5. ART
Art has five suboptions.  These are Draw, Spider Webs, Space
Tunnels, Space Worms, and Space Ribbons.  The following
paragraphs describe each of these.


     A. DRAW
     This suboption allows you to draw freehand with a mouse or
     joystick in four colors.  After selecting the Draw
     suboption you will be asked if you will be using a
     Microsoft (tm) mouse or joystick.  Select the proper one
     by pressing m or j on the keyboard.  If you will be using
     the mouse, be sure to load the mouse driver before you
     start.

     The color can be changed to magenta, white, cyan, or
     background.  If you are using a mouse, change the color
     by pressing the left button and escape by pressing the
     right button.  If you're using a joystick, change the
     color by pressing c on the keyboard and escape by pressing
     ESC on the keyboard.  In either case press e on the
     keyboard to erase and start a new drawing.

     If you want to selectively erase only part of your drawing,
     change the color to background and then move the cursor
     over the area to be erased.  Changing the color to
     background is also useful for moving to new locations
     without leaving a trail.  This is equivalent to lifting
     your pen.

     B. SPIDER WEBS
     Here you can use the joystick or the arrow keys to control
     the actions of a spider while he leaves a web behind him.
     When the arrow keys are used, the joystick is disabled for
     the duration of the drawing.  You may change back to the
     joystick by erasing the drawing.  Press c to change the
     color of the web, press the < and > keys to change the
     rate or speed of movement, press e to erase the web and
     start again, or press ESC to return to Art Menu.

     The possible colors are magenta, white, cyan, or invisible.
     Choose the invisible web when you want to move the spider
     to a new location without leaving a web behind him.

     C. SPACE TUNNELS
     In this Art suboption you can use a joystick or the arrow
     keys to control the growth and/or elongation of a tunnel
     through deep space.  The rules for using the joystick or
     keys are the same as those just described in the Spider
     Webs description.

     Press ESC to quit, e to erase and start again, c to change
     the color of the tunnel, g to make the tunnel grow larger,
     r to make the tunnel reduce in size, the > key to increase
     the growth rate, or the < key to reduce the growth rate.
     With this option you can produce beautiful screen art that
     appears to have 3-dimensional qualities.  It is very
     relaxing.  Try it!

     D. SPACE WORMS
     This Art suboption is similar to Space Tunnels but it
     produces an elongating worm with alternating colors.  You
     have no control over color.  See the previous section for
     details.


     E. SPACE RIBBONS
     This suboption is exactly like Space Worms except the worm
     is flattened.  This produces even better 3-dimensional
     effects.

These Art suboptions were designed especially for relaxation and
enjoyment.  However, they can be used to stimulate creativity.


6. SPELLING
This option has five suboptions -- Alphabet, Random Words, New
Spelling Homework, Last Spelling Homework, and Old Spelling
Homework.  The following paragraphs describe these five.


     A. ALPHABET
     The purpose of this suboption is to teach preschoolers the
     alphabet, both upper case and lower case.  You are shown an
     uppercase letter then three choices for its lower case
     equivalent.  To choose the correct lower case letter use
     the right or left arrow key to move the pointing arrow to
     the correct choice then press ENTER.  Points will be added
     for correct answers and a tune will be played if the sound
     is on.

     You may press ESC to stop, otherwise the entire alphabet
     will be shown.  Also, you may press c to change the
     foreground color for the letters.

The following four suboptions will test your ability to spell
words.  The Random Words suboption uses existing libraries of
words while the New Spelling Homework suboption requires you
to input your own words.  After being drilled on these words
you have the option of storing them for later use with the
last two options, Last and Old Spelling Homework.

     B. RANDOM WORDS
     The Random Words suboption has four levels of difficulty.
     The first level contains words that are three characters
     long, the second level contains words that are four
     characters long, the third level contains words that are
     five characters long, and the fourth level contains words
     that are six characters long.  Each level is identical
     except for the length of the words.  Large word libraries
     are included on the disk and words are chosen at random
     from the libraries.

     C. NEW SPELLING HOMEWORK
     In this suboption you are allowed to enter up to 30 words
     of variable length.  The only limitation on length is that
     they must be shorter than 17 characters.  When you choose
     this suboption you are only quizzed on those words you have
     entered.  I developed this option to allow you to enter
     your daily spelling homework.

     When you choose the New Spelling HW suboption you are first
     asked how many words you would like to enter.  Just type
     the number and then press ENTER.  If you choose to enter 10
     words or less you may enter all 10 of the words on the same

     screen.  Type each word then press ENTER.  All editing
     functions such as delete, back-space, insert, and arrow key
     movements are allowed while you type the words.  You may
     also use the up and down arrow keys to move from one word
     field to another.  Press the F1 function key when you think
     you have them all spelled correctly.  You will then be
     quizzed on the words you entered.

     If you choose to enter more than 10 words you may only
     enter one word at a time.  Again, all editing functions
     such as delete, back-space, insert, and arrow key movements
     are allowed.  Press ENTER when you have the word spelled
     correctly then type the next word.  If you decide not to
     enter as many words as you originally planned just press
     the F1 key.  If you change your mind and want to quit just
     press ESC.

     When you are done with this suboption you will be asked if
     you want to store the words you just entered for later use.
     If you choose yes, the words will be stored in the "Last
     Spelling Homework" file and added to the end of the "Old
     Spelling Homework" data file.  These words can be recalled
     later when using the last two suboptions.

     D. LAST SPELLING HOMEWORK
     This suboption can be used to recall the last previously
     stored spelling homework exercises.  This can save you the
     time of retyping the words.  Note that only the last set
     of spelling words can be recalled using this suboption.

     E. OLD SPELLING HOMEWORK
     In this suboption you are quizzed on all the words that you
     previously stored in the "Old Spelling Homework" data file.
     When you store words in this file they are added to the end
     of the file.  The file gets bigger each time you store more
     words.  Use this option to review all your old spelling
     homework.

     If at the end of the school year you want to start a new
     file of old spelling homework you can use DOS commands to
     copy the old file to a new name and delete the old one.
     For example type RENAME HW-WORDS.DAT HW-WORDS.BAK then
     press enter.  Then type DEL HW-WORDS.DAT then press ENTER.
     The next time you store words a new file called
     HW-WORDS.DAT will be created.

In all the spelling suboptions a word is shown for 4 seconds
then it disappears and you are asked to spell it.  You cannot
begin to spell the word until the word disappears but you can
make it disappear faster by pressing ENTER.  If you need to
see it again, just press the down arrow key.  If you make a
mistake entering the word, use the backspace key to delete the
previous letters or use the arrow keys to move to the wrong
letters then press the delete key to delete the letters.  Press
ENTER when you think you have spelled the word correctly.  If
you enter the wrong spelling you will be asked to try again.
You get 10 points for each correct answer.  If sound is on you
also get a randomly chosen tune for each correct answer and a
beep for each wrong answer.


When you're done, press ESC to return to Level Menu if you are
in the Random Words suboption or to return to Spell Menu if you
are in the other suboptions.  However, no key entry will be
recognized if it occurs during the 4 second display of the word.
So, remember to wait until the word disappears to press ESC.
After you escape from a spelling suboption your misspelled words
will be shown.


7. ENGLISH
This option currently has four levels.  In the first level you
are taught about nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.  The
second level develops skill in forming sentences by asking you
to unscramble sentences.  The third level teaches you about the
5 basic sentence patterns and the fourth level teaches
subject-verb agreement.

     A. LEVEL 1
     In Level 1 you are first given the definition of a noun and
     a list of nouns to choose from.  To choose a noun use the
     arrow keys to highlight your selection and then press the
     ENTER key.  Next, the definition of an adjective is given
     and a list of seven adjectives is shown to choose from.
     Then the definitions of verbs and adverbs are given and
     lists of each are shown for you to choose from.  When the
     last word has been chosen, two or three sentences will be
     displayed that use the words you chose.  Although the
     sentences will be grammatically correct, they will not
     always make sense.  When this happens, they are usually
     very amusing.  To repeat the process with new words, press
     the SPACE BAR.  To quit and return to Level Menu, press
     the ESC key.

     B. LEVEL 2
     Here you are given several words that can be used to make
     a correct sentence.  One of the words will be highlighted.
     You must move (using the arrow keys) this highlighted word
     up to the top of the screen and place it in the correct
     sentence order.  When you have placed that word in the
     correct spot the second word will be highlighted.

     While you are moving the word to its correct location a
     timer will be running.  If you correctly place the word
     before the timer runs down, you will be given extra points.
     When the entire sentence is correct you will receive 10
     points.

     While you are placing the words you will notice that a
     small arrow will be moving from the right of the screen to
     the left.  If your word gets hit by this arrow it will be
     knocked back down to the bottom and you'll have to start
     it again.  So watch it!

     C. LEVEL 3
     In Level 3 you are first shown that sentences have two
     basic parts -- the subject and the predicate.  Definitions
     are also given.  After pressing the space bar you are shown
     how the predicate can be separated into its parts and as a

     result, that sentences have 5 basic patterns.  Shorthand
     names of each are given.  After pressing the space bar
     again, definitions of each part are given.  Finally, you
     will be given examples of each of the 5 sentence patterns.

     Press the space bar once more and you'll be given a
     randomly chosen sentence from the sentence file and asked
     to identify its sentence pattern.  Select the pattern by
     using the arrow keys to highlight the correct pattern then
     press the ENTER key.  Each correct answer is rewarded by
     the addition of 10 points to your score and the playing of
     a randomly chosen tune if sound is on.  Press ESC to quit
     or simply select END from the list of patterns.  Press the
     space bar to see another randomly chosen sentence.

     D. LEVEL 4
     Level 4 first gives some necessary instruction on how to
     insure that the verb agrees with the subject.  It then
     presents a sentence with a missing word (usually a missing
     verb).  You are then required to select the correct missing
     word from a list of two choices.  Choose the word by
     highlighting it with the up or down arrow key then press
     ENTER.  Each correct answer is rewarded by the addition
     of 10 points to your score and the playing of a randomly
     chosen tune if sound is on.  Press ESC to quit or simply
     select END from the list of words.  Press the space bar
     to see another randomly chosen sentence.

When you escape from any of the English suboptions you will be
placed back into English Level Menu.  Choose a new level or
escape again to return to Main Menu.


8. MATH
This option is divided into 6 suboptions.  These are Laser
Blast, Bug Numbers, Applespider, Addition and Subtraction,
Multiplication and Division, and Prealgebra Math.  They are
described in the following paragraphs.

     A. LASER BLAST
     This is an exciting game that entertains and teaches
     quantity.  First, a number of blocks are shown.  Then,
     colored numbers begin to float across the screen.  The
     object of the game is to shoot the correct number with
     the laser.  The correct number is the one that equals the
     number of blocks.  To shoot, simply push the SPACE BAR.
     To return to Main Menu press ESC.

     Points are given for each hit.  The faster you play, the
     larger the number of points given.  The speed can be
     increased by using the > key and decreased using the < key.

     If you want to change the background color just press c.
     Be careful not to choose a background color that matches
     the color of one of the floating numbers.  If this happens
     you will not be able to see that particular number.

     B. BUG NUMBERS
     This math suboption teaches the concept of multidigit

     numbers.  You are shown three large boxes.  The box on the
     right will have 0 to 9 large individual bugs.  The center
     box will have smaller bugs grouped in clusters of 10
     each.  The box on the left will have very small bugs in
     groups of 100 bugs each.  Your job is to find how many
     bugs are shown on the screen.

     You must first count the number of large bugs in the far
     right box.  Type this number and press ENTER.  This
     gives you the least significant digit.  Next, count the
     number of groups that contain 10 bugs and enter this
     number.  This gives you the next most significant digit.
     Finally, count the number of groups that contain 100 bugs
     and enter this number.  This gives you the most significant
     digit and you're done.  Ten points are given for completion.
     As always, if the sound is on, School-Mom will also play
     you a tune.

     C. APPLESPIDER
     This is a very exciting and intense game that drills you in
     basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
     The applespider wants to eat your apple.  You must prevent
     this by using the arrow keys to move the apple out of the
     spider's way.  At the beginning you are given 10 free
     moves.  To get more moves you must solve the equation at
     the bottom of the screen.  For every correct answer you
     get five more moves and one point added to your score.
     As your score increases, the spider gets faster.  As
     always, press ESC to stop.

     D. ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION
     This option has four levels of difficulty.  In each level
     the numbers are chosen at random.

     In Level 1, beside each number, stars are shown whose sum
     equals the number.  For example, suppose you are asked to
     add the numbers 2 and 3.  Beside 2 there will be two stars
     and beside 3 there will be three stars.  To find the answer
     just count the number of stars, type the answer and press
     the ENTER key.  If you are asked to, for example, subtract
     2 from 4 there will be two stars beside the number 2 and
     four stars beside the number 4.  However, two of the four
     stars beside the number four will be blinking to indicate
     the two that will be taken away.  Also, the two stars
     beside the number 2 will be blinking.  To find the answer
     just count the number of stars that are not blinking.

     Level 2 is exactly like Level 1 except that the numbers are
     larger and the stars are not shown.

     Level 3 illustrates how to add and subtract multiple digit
     numbers by stepping you through the process.  Again, all
     numbers are chosen at random.  Active elements of the
     problem are highlighted by flashing the digits.  Individual
     questions in the form of simple equations are shown at the
     bottom of the interactive window.   A flashing cursor at the
     end of this equation indicates that an input is expected.
     If you enter the correct value it will be placed in its
     proper spot.  The computer will beep if the answer is

     incorrect.

     Level 4 is exactly like Level 3 except numbers with decimals
     are used.

     In each of these levels a complete correct answer is
     rewarded by the addition of 10 points to your score and the
     playing of a tune if sound is on.  You can press ESC to
     quit and return to Level Menu when you're done.

     D. MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION
     This option also has four levels of difficulty.  Level 1 is
     similar to Level 1 of the Addition and Subtraction option
     because you must count stars that do not blink to find the
     correct answer.  The difference is that the stars are
     grouped differently and there is only one line with stars.
     For example, suppose you are asked to find the product of
     4 and 2.  At the bottom, where the answer belongs, you will
     find two groups with four stars each.  In other words, the
     computer has taken the four stars and placed them in the
     answer line twice.  There is a total of 8 stars and they
     have been placed on the line where the number 8 belongs.
     If you are asked to, for example, divide 12 by 3 then
     beside the 12 will be placed three groups of stars with 4
     stars in each group.  Only one group will not be blinking.
     So, if you count the stars that do not blink, you'll find
     the correct answer to be 4.

     Level 2 is like Level 1 but larger numbers are used and no
     stars are displayed.

     Level 3 leads you through long division and/or
     multiplication with multiple digit numbers.  As in Level 3
     & 4 of the Addition and Subtraction option, active elements
     of the problem are highlighted by flashing the numbers.  The
     instructions and questions to be answered are displayed at
     the bottom of the interactive window.  The flashing cursor
     at the end of this question or equation is an indication
     that the computer is waiting for an input.

     Level 4 is identical to Level 3 except that decimals are
     used.

     In each of these levels a complete correct answer is
     rewarded by the addition of 10 points to your score and
     the playing of a tune if sound is on.  You can press
     ESC to quit and return to Level Menu when you're done.

     E. PREALGEBRA MATH
     This option also has four levels of difficulty.  All four
     levels are basic introductory algebra but the difficulty
     level does increase slightly with each level chosen.  In
     each level you are asked to solve for the unknown value
     of Y.  Just follow the instructions and answer the
     questions, and the computer will lead you through the
     solution.  When you see the cursor flashing, the computer
     is waiting for an input.

In all the Math options, the active parts of the equation are

highlighted by flashing the numbers.  Also, the final correct
answer is rewarded by the addition of 10 points to your score
and the playing of a randomly chosen tune if the sound is on.
Press ESC to quit and return to Level Menu when you're done.


9. REGISTRATION
If you are not a registered owner of SCHOOL-MOM you can use this
option to print a registration letter.  If you are a registered
owner you can use it to store your name and registration number.
However, before you can enter your registration number you will
need the file change code.  I will send you this code after I
receive your registration letter.


10. EXAMS
This option or module has three suboptions.  These are Make
Exam, Take Exam, and See Scores.  Each of these is explained
in the following paragraphs.

     A. MAKE EXAM
     In this suboption you are allowed to create a multiple
     choice examination.  The first screen you'll see is an
     exam setup screen.  This screen has three fields, one to
     enter the number of questions you want to ask, one to
     enter the title of the exam, and one to enter the filename
     for the exam.  You may move freely from one field to
     another using the up or down arrow keys.  Once you have
     all the information typed correctly in all the fields press
     the F1 function key.  If you change your mind and decide
     you don't want to create an exam just press the ESC key
     to return to Exams Menu.

     After you press the F1 key from the Exam Setup screen you
     will see another screen that asks you to type the first
     question, its five answer choices, and the number of the
     correct answer.  A total of eight fields are shown -- two
     for entering the question, five for the answers, and one
     for the number of the correct answer.  When you've entered
     all the questions you'll be returned to Exam Menu.  If
     you decide to stop and not enter as many questions as you
     originally planned just press the ESC key.  The exam
     will be created but with only as many questions as you
     entered before pressing ESC.

     B. TAKE EXAM
     When you choose this option you'll first be asked to enter
     your name.  This is because your name will be stored later
     along with your score.  After you've done this either press
     ESC to quit or press ENTER to get a list of all the exam
     files on your current directory.  You may choose a file
     from the list or you may quit by pressing ESC.  Choose an
     exam file by typing its name without the .exm extension and
     then pressing ENTER.

     After you've chosen an exam file you'll see a screen that
     shows the exam title, the first question to answer, and its
     five answer choices.  There are three way to choose an
     answer.  You may use the up or down arrow keys to highlight

     the correct answer then press ENTER, or you may press the
     key corresponding to the first letter of the correct answer
     until it is highlighted then press ENTER, or you may use a
     mouse to highlight the correct answer then press the left
     mouse button to select it.  If you want to quit without
     answering the question just select END from the answer list.

     Your running score will be shown at the bottom of the
     screen.  After you're done, this score will be added to the
     end of the score file that corresponds to the exam.  The
     score file will have the same name as the exam file but a
     different extension.

     After you've either answered all the questions or quit you'll
     be shown your final score.  You'll then have to press ENTER
     to continue.

     C. SEE SCORES
     When you choose this suboption you'll first be shown a list
     of the score files to choose from.  Type the name of the
     score file you want then press ENTER.  If you change your
     mind you may quit by pressing ESC.

     Next, you'll be asked if you want to send the scores to a
     printer or to the screen.  Type p then press ENTER if you
     want it sent to a printer (don't forget to turn the printer
     on) or type s then press ENTER if you want it sent to the
     screen.

     Before the scores are listed, the exam title and the number
     of questions in the exam will be shown.  If the list is sent
     to the screen you'll have to press ENTER to return to Exams
     Menu when the list is complete.

Your disk will come with two exams already prepared.  One exam
is called STATES and will quiz you on the capitals of all 50
states in the U.S.  The other is called PRES and contains
questions about the Presidents of the United States.  Try them
out!


11. TIME
You can use this option to learn to tell time.  It has four
learning levels.  In each level a clock is shown on the screen
and you must choose the correct time from a list of three
answers.  Choose an answer by using the appropriate arrow key
to get the red arrow directly over the correct choice, then
press ENTER.  When the correct answer is chosen, a tune will be
played if sound is on, points will be added to the score, and
the digital time will be displayed below the clock.

     A. LEVEL 1
     In this beginner's level the big hand always points to 12.
     However, the little hand can point to any of the 12
     numbers.  For correct answers only one point will be added
     to the score.

     B. LEVEL 2
     In this second level only on-the-hour, quarter, and half

     hours are used.  In other words the big hand can only be
     on the 12, 3, 6, or 9.  Correct answers are rewarded by
     the addition of 3 points.

     C. LEVEL 3
     In this level the big hand may point to any of the 12
     numbers but may not point to any location between the
     numbers.  For example, the clock could show 7:05, 7:10,
     or 7:15 but it will not show 7:03, 7:07, or 7:18.  For
     correct answers, 5 points will be added to the score.

     D. LEVEL 4
     In this level any time is allowed on the clock.  For
     correct answers, 10 points will be added to the score.

Another nice feature of the TIME option is that the clock
actually ticks.


12. FILE CHANGE PROGRAM
This program was designed for teachers or parents.  Its purpose
is to allow additions to and editing of the Spelling, English
and Exam data files.

To run this program from the operating system type CHANGE then
press ENTER.  Before you will be allowed into the program you
must enter the file change code that you get when you register
the program.  This is the same code you use to enter your name
and registration number when in the Registration option.

File Change Menu contains 14 options.  The first 5 options
are for making changes to the spell files which contain words
for the Spelling option.  Spell_1.dat contains 3 letter words,
spell_2.dat contains 4 letter words, spell_3.dat contains 5
letter words, spell_4.dat contains 6 letter words, and the
hw-words.dat file contains old spelling homework words that
you've entered.  The next 8 options are used to add to or edit
the English option files.  These files are the noun1.dat,
adject1.dat, verb1.dat, verb2.dat, adverb1.dat, sentence.dat,
sub_verb.dat, and sc-words.dat files.  The last option allows
you to make changes to the Exam files.  As always there is a
final option to END.

     A. SPELL FILES
     Use these options to change any one of the five spelling
     word files.  These files include the four files for Level 1
     through Level 4 of the Random Words option and the old
     homework word file for the Old Spelling Homework option.

     When you select a spell file from Main Menu you'll be
     asked to choose whether you want to add words or edit them.
     If you select the Add Words suboption, the computer will
     quickly run through all the words in that particular file
     and  stop after the last one.  You may then enter a new
     word or press ESC to stop.  When you enter a word, unless
     the word already exists, it will be stored at the end of
     the file.  The new word will be displayed along with its
     number and you'll be asked to enter another word or press
     ESC to stop.


     If you select the Edit suboption the first word in the file
     will be displayed.  Then you will be asked to press the F1
     function key to go on to the next word, press ESC to stop,
     or make changes to the word then press ENTER.  Keep pressing
     F1 until you see the word you want changed.  When you're
     done just press ESC.

     B. ENGLISH WORD FILES
     If you choose one of the English word file options (Noun,
     Adjective, Verb1, Verb2, or Adverb file) from File
     Change Menu you will again be asked whether you want to
     add or edit.  The Add suboption works exactly like the
     Add suboption of the Spell Files option.  The computer
     will quickly run through all the words in that particular
     file and stop after the last one.  You may then enter a
     new word or press ESC to stop.  When you enter a word it
     will be stored at the end of the file.  The new word will
     be displayed along with its number and you'll be asked to
     enter another word or press ESC to stop.

     If you select the Edit suboption the first word in the file
     will be displayed.  Then you will be asked to press the F1
     function key to go on to the next word, press ESC to stop,
     or make changes to the word then press ENTER.  Keep pressing
     F1 until you see the word you want changed.  When you're
     done just press ESC.

     There is a slight difference between the verb1 and verb2
     data files.  The verb1 file contains past-tense and
     present-tense verbs that agree with singular subjects.
     The verb2 file contains only past-tense verbs.  If you
     get these mixed up, the English Level 1 suboption will
     not produce correct sentences.

     C. SENTENCE PTRN FILES
     This option allows you to change the sentence pattern
     files.  If you choose to add sentences, the last sentence
     in the file will be shown along with its pattern.  You
     will then be asked to enter new sentence information or
     press ESC to stop.  When you have typed the sentence and
     its pattern correctly press the F1 key to store the
     information and get ready for the next sentence.  When
     you are done press ESC to stop.

     If you choose to edit a sentence, the first sentence and
     its pattern will be displayed.  You may press ESC to stop,
     F1 to see the next sentence, or you may make corrections
     to the sentence and its pattern then press F1 to store
     the changes and see the next sentence.

     D. SUB-VERB AGREE FILES
     This option allows you to change the subject-verb agreement
     files.  If you choose to add sentences, the last sentence
     in the file will be shown.  You will then be asked to enter
     new sentence information or press ESC to stop.  When you
     have typed the sentence and all its associated information
     correctly press the F1 key to store it and get ready for
     the next sentence.  When you are done press ESC to stop.


     As an example, suppose your sentence is "They ____ late."
     Your two word choices will be "was" and "were".  Since the
     second one is correct you will enter the number 2 in the
     last field.  Once you have entered all four pieces of
     information and pressed F1, the sentence will be displayed
     at the top and you will be asked to enter another sentence.
     When you are done press ESC to stop.

     If you choose to edit a sentence, the first sentence and its
     word choices will be displayed.  You may press ESC to stop,
     F1 to see the next sentence, or you may make corrections
     then press F1 to store the changes and see the next sentence.

     E. SCRAMBLED WORDS FILES
     Use this option to make changes to the sc-words.dat file
     which is used in Level 2 of the English option.  This file
     contains the scrambled words that you must unscramble to
     make correct sentences.

     As always you will be asked if you want to edit or add to
     this file.  After choosing to add you must first enter the
     number of words you want to have in the sentence.  Then,
     you can type the words for the sentence.  You must type the
     words in correct order.  The software will scramble them
     before they are stored.  Don't forget to capitalize the
     first word and place a period after the last word.

     If you choose to edit, all the information will be shown
     on the screen.  You can then move around and make changes.
     The only thing you can't change is the number of words in
     the sentence.

     F. EXAM FILES
     Use this option to edit the exam files.  You will first be
     given a list of the exam files by file name.  To select one
     of these files for editing you must type its name then press
     ENTER.  However, do not type the exm extension.  For
     example, type PRES not PRES.EXM if you want to edit the
     presidents exam file.

     After you press ENTER, the exam name will be listed and you
     will be asked to make corrections.  When you are done just
     press ENTER.  If it is already correct you do not have to
     retype it.

     Next, the first question will be printed along with all 5
     of its possible answers and the number of its correct
     answer.  You can move the cursor around on the screen using
     the arrow keys.  You do not need to retype everything.  Just
     move to the error, make the correction and then move to the
     next error.  When you've made all the corrections press the
     F1 key.

     The second question will be displayed next along with its
     possible answers.  Make the changes and press F1 again.  If
     no changes are required just press F1 and the next question
     and answers set will be displayed.  If you finish editing
     before you get to the last set just press the ESC key.


Remember to keep knowledge of the file change code from your
children.  Always keep a backup of the software so that if the
data files get corrupted, you can replace them.  If you make
changes to the data files, please don't pass your changes on
to other people.  Save the original backup copy for sharing
with others.

This is SCHOOL-MOM version 3.57.  The author, Dr. Andrew Motes,
is a member of the Association of Shareware Professionals.

Shareware vendors have permission to distribute diskettes with
this software copied onto them.  However, vendors must tell their
customers that they are purchasing the disk and not the
software.  This software can only be purchased directly from
the author or from an authorized dealer.

The following is a short description of this version:

   SCHOOL-MOM version 3.57 is a complete educational tool
   for children ages 4 to 14.  It contains multi-level
   modules for Math, Music, English, Spelling, Art, and
   Time.  It also contains an exam generator.  Correct
   answers are rewarded by a tune if sound is turned on.


For the long description of this version, add the following:

   The Math module contains four levels of addition and
   subtraction, four levels of multiplication and division,
   four levels of prealgebra math, and a suboption called
   Bugnumbers that teaches the concept of multidigit numbers.
   It also contains two arcade math games.  The first, Laser
   Blast, is a counting game that teaches quantity.  The
   second, Applespider, is an exciting game that drills the
   student in basic addition, subtraction, multiplication,
   and division.


   The music module has three levels of difficulty.  Each
   level allows you to use the keyboard to write tunes as
   you watch the notes appear on the screen.  As the learning
   level increases, the capability increases.  The first
   level allows eight notes to be played in seven octaves.
   The second level allows the note duration to also be
   changed.  The third level also allows sharp and flat
   notes.  Tunes can be edited, played back and stored.


   The English module contains four learning levels.  The
   first level allows the student to choose from lists of nouns,
   verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.  The computer then makes
   sentences from the chosen words.  This teaches children
   how nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are used in
   sentences.  The second level shows a line of scrambled
   words.  The student is asked to use the arrow keys to
   unscramble the words and make a sentence.  The third level
   teaches sentence structure by showing a random sentence from
   the data files and asking the student to choose the proper
   structure.  The third level teaches subject-verb agreement
   by displaying a random sentence from the data files and
   asking the student to choose the proper verb for the sentence.


   The Spelling module contains five sub-options.  These
   are Alphabet, Random Words, New Spelling Homework, Last
   Spelling Homework, and Old Spelling Homework.  The Alphabet
   option is used to teach upper and lower case alphabet.  The
   upper case letter is shown and the student is asked to choose
   the lower case.

   The Random Words option has four learning levels.  In the
   first level a three letter word is shown for three seconds
   then the student is asked to spell the word.  As the learning
   level goes up the words get longer.

   The New Spelling Homework option can be used to enter the
   daily spelling homework so the computer can drill the student
   on the words.  When the student is done he/she has the option
   of storing the words for later use.

   The fourth option, Last Spelling Homework, allows you to
   recall the last set of spelling homework words.  The fifth
   option, Old Spelling Homework, calls up all the old spelling
   homework words and drills the student on these.


   The Art module allows the student to show creativity.
   He can choose from one of 5 sub-options.  These are
   Draw, Spider Webs, Space Tunnels, Space Worms, and
   Space Ribbons.  The Draw option allows the student to
   draw freehand with either the joystick or the mouse.
   The Spider Webs options allows the child to control
   the actions of a spider who leaves a web behind him.
   The last three sub-options allow the student to create
   beautiful screen art with three-dimensional qualities
   using either a joystick or the keyboard.

   The Time module has four learning levels that teach
   children to tell time.  A ticking clock is shown on
   the screen and the student must choose the correct
   time from a list of three answers.  The difficulty
   increases with the learning level chosen.

   The Exam module allows the teacher or parent to create
   multiple choice examinations for the children.  The
   exams are graded with the scores placed in a score file.
   Some exams are already provided on the disk.
