PC-SIG is the world's oldest and largest distributor of shareware.
Since 1982 PC-SIG has been compiling the most respected shareware
collection anywhere by actively seeking top software authors and
their high quality programs.

Shareware is a unique approach to software retailing in which
consumers purchase software directly from the author.  Individual
authors avoid costly marketing, promotion, and packaging by
allowing their programs to be copied and shared with few
restrictions.  PC-SIG plays a vital role in the shareware process by
bringing shareware to the consumer.  As a central distributor,
PC-SIG can give these programs the exposure they deserve at a
fraction of the cost of bringing a single software package to
market.  In the end, the consumer wins with great software at
prices far below traditional retail markets.

The end user also wins with the opportunity to try the full program
before buying it from the author.  This ``try-before-you-buy''
method of software distribution is successful because shareware is
high-quality software.  Authors are confident that once you have
used their programs you'll be impressed and want to register.
