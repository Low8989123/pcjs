## Information about "UNICOM"

    A data communications application that takes advantage of the
    Microsoft Windows operating environment.  UNICOM performs data
    communication tasks in the background while other applications are
    running.  You can even switch to another Windows application while
    UNICOM is running.
    
    UNICOM includes the following features:
    
    ~ X/Y/ZMODEM, Kermit, CompuServe B, Quick B and ASCII file transfer
    protocols
    
    ~ ANSI-BBS, VT52 and TTY terminal emulation
    
    ~ Directory-assisted batch dialing for users with Hayes compatible
    modems
    
    ~ An on-line help system
    
    ~ Ability to record mouse and keyboard operations for later playback
    
    ~ Script file processing for automatic logon to remote host systems
    
    ~ Keyboard macros, file logging, file paste, and print screen.
    
    UNICOM can transfer Windows-unique data formats between computers, such
    as the contents of Window's Clipboard from one PC directly into the
    Clipboard of another.
    
    Operate your computer in a multi-user mode with UNICOM's Host mode.  A
    built-in command processor lets a validated remote user examine or
    transfer files on a designated disk drive while remaining completely
    transparent to any user who may be at the keyboard operating other
    Window applications.
