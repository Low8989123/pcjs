## Information about "PERSONALITY ANALYSIS SYSTEM"

    A highly-accurate personality analysis program designed to help the
    individual better understand his own personality and those of friends,
    acquaintances and loved ones.
    
    PAS is based on the same principles and
    report system as the EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM but has been modified to
    work more on the personal and business rather than strictly business
    level.  PAS can help in several ways:
    
    ~ 1. ACCURATE.  The program is extremely accurate.  Trained and licensed
    psychologists and psychiatrists have marveled at the sophistication and
    accuracy of such a low-cost program.
    
    ~ 2. IMPROVE YOURSELF.  PAS helps you know yourself by describing your
    strenghts, motivational factors and demotivational factors. Knowing thes
    things can help you improve yourself as a person. You can also work with
    your strengths and build them to your advantage.
    
    ~ 3. OPEN SYSTEM.  PAS is a POSITIVE ANALYSIS system (it doesn't pull
    skeletons out of the closet).  The 5-page report is so amazing that
    people literally request a report to be run on their own personality as
    soon as they see it run on someone else.  The PAS report is intended to
    be shared and thus opens communications and strengthens good will among
    people.
    
    ~ 4. JOB MATCH helps you to determine whether or not a job fits in with
    your basic personality.  Is the environment one that will encourage you
    to work and motivate you to produce your best?  Will it allow you to use
    your personal skills to the utmost?  PAS can help you determine this.
    
    ~ 5. IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS.  PAS encourages open communication between
    adults and teens, helping to bridge the "generation gap".
    
    PAS reports on the two greatest influencing factors of your
    personality.  It also describes management style, decision making style,
    stamina, and personality characteristics.  The final page deals in
    motivational and demotivational factors that would cause you to like or
    dislike the environment in which you work and live.
    
    PAS is intended to improve communications between people and enhance
    your ability to improve your lifestyle.  PAS is valuable as a personal
    communications tool between friends, marriage mates, business
    acquaintances and any other relationship where personality is a strong
    influencing factor.
    
    PAS is a very accurate program and is a valuable personal tool.
