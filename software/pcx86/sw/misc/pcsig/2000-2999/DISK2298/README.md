## Information about "THE EXPLORERS"

    Here's a great tool for anyone at high school or college level with an
    interest in early American history.  This program has two parts: the
    EXPLORER HISTORIES and the EXPLORER QUIZ.
    
    EXPLORER HISTORIES contains information about 45 explorers who touched
    American shores and are considered to have made important historical
    contributions to America's growth.  Page through the explorers one by
    one until you have found the one you are interested in.  Once the
    explorer has been chosen, you will be shown his/her full biography,
    including birth/death date, accomplishment, and other interesting
    tidbits.
    
    It is best if the user has a good map of the U.S. for tracking the
    various expeditions.
    
    The EXPLORER QUIZ asks a series of questions on the 45 explorers.  The
    main menu provides a choice of subjects such as names of explorers,
    explorer dates, accomplishments and a fourth named POT LUCK.

Here's a great tool for anyone that has an interest in early American   
history.  This program is made up of two parts: the EXPLORER HISTORIES  
and the EXPLORER QUIZ.                                                  
                                                                        
The explorer histories in this collection contain 45 explorers that     
touched American shores and are considered to have made important       
historical contributions to America's growth.  You can page through the 
explorers one by one until you have found the historian you are         
interested in.  Once the explorer has been chosen, you will be shown    
his/her full biography.  The biography will include birth/death date,   
notes of accomplishment, and other interesting facts.                   
                                                                        
It is strongly recommended that the user have a good map of the         
U.S. at hand to follow the various expeditions.                         
                                                                        
The EXPLORER QUIZ is a program designed to ask a series of questions on 
the 45 explorers.  From the main menu you will have a choice of subject 
area. You may choose to be quizzed on just names of explorers, explorer 
dates, or accomplishments - there are three subject areas in all. You   
might also choose a fourth which has been called POT LUCK - it will     
select each of the other questions at random.                           
                                                                        
The information and questions in EXPLORERS is on a high school and      
college level.
