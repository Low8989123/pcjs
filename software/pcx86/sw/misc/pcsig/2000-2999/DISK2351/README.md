## Information about "TAG_ALONG"

    Are you finding it difficult to control and manage the files on your
    hard drive?  TAG_ALONG can free you from this frustrating task.
    TAG_ALONG is a DOS enhancement tool and Menuing system, similar to
    Xtree, that is used to control and manage your hard drive.  As a Disk
    Operating System DOS is fine but does have some shortcomings.  With
    TAG_ALONG you have all of DOS's commands and some DOS forgot to give
    you.  TAG_ALONG is a Two Level program.  Level One is a Hard Disk
    Management/DOS enhancement program and Level Two is your Menuing
    system.
    
    The DOS enhancement portion of TAG_ALONG displays a directory listing
    of your hard drive, in a tree format, showing all subdirectories. Along
    with this display is a list of the DOS commands that operate on files
    and directories, such as Mkdir, Rmdir, Copyfile, Delfile, View, Search,
    etc.  You no longer have to remember the DOS command you need or have to
    type it in.  Simply select the command you need from the menu.  Special
    commands are available such as Shoot, which allows you to shoot to any
    of your last ten accessed subdirectories instantly. TAG_ALONG makes it
    easy to traverse the directories and subdirectories and maintain the
    files on your hard drive.  Keyboard locking with password is also
    provided so that you can prevent someone from
    accessing your system when you have to leave it unattended.
    
    The Menuing system portion of TAG_ALONG is designed to isolate you and
    others from complicated DOS commands. With TAG_ALONG you can operate
    your system completely from menus.  The number of menus you can have is
    limited only by the amount of disk space available.  Each menu can have
    up to 12 entries and can be password protected.  Using TAG_ALONG is an
    excellent way to set up a computer system for use by novices.
