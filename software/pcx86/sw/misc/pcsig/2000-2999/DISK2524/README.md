Special Requirements: CGA, and a hard drive.                            
                                                                        
Forget DOS -- now you can manage your computer and organize yourself    
with LAUNCH PAD.  To help you manage your computer, LAUNCH PAD includes 
a DOS shell program that lets you view, copy, delete, and move files,   
either in a group or individually.  The program includes a complete menu
system that lets you access word processors, databases, or any program, 
with one keystroke.  Some clever extras include a program timer that    
executes a specified program at a preset time and a DOS spooler that    
executes a list of DOS commands.                                        
                                                                        
But that's only half of it.  To help organize your work, LAUNCH PAD     
includes a calendar and appointment book, name and address book         
(complete with labels), memo pad, and a alarm.  Lots of documentation   
and on-screen help makes LAUNCH PAD easy to start using.
