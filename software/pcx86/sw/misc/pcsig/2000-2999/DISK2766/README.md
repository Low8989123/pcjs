MORAFF'S WORLD is an awesome fantasy role-playing game that may keep    
many players hacking and slashing monsters, night after night.  It has  
16-level dungeons with brick walls, wooden doors, ladders, and colorful 
monsters that you can see coming down the 3-D corridors.                
                                                                        
Fight more than 20 classes of monsters, cast more than 100 spells,      
travel five continents, and explore many dungeons.  Stores are located  
on the top levels of each dungeon where you can equip your character    
with weapons and armor.  In the temples, you can buy spells to heal your
wounds, and you can store your loot in the bank so its weight won't slow
you down.                                                               
                                                                        
The main screen features a 3-D view for short distances, and a          
bird's-eye-view to show you where you are.  MORAFF's WORLD has          
intelligent Help that realizes when you are confused, and makes         
appropriate suggestions.  All commands are initiated with a single      
keystroke.
