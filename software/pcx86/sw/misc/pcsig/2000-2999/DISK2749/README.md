             ShareDebate International's first double-disk issue
          Featuring 11 popular authors including Jerry Pournelle &
                     the League for Programming Freedom!
      Also, ShareDebate has gone Semi-Annual to half subscription costs!
                   Spring/Summer 1991 (Issue #5 & #6)

ShareDebate International, a ShareWare disk magazine, formerly a
quarterly, is now semi-annual starting with this double-disk issue (#5 &
6). It is a debate forum for computer users concerned about the present
& future carried by 544 to 1,444 BBSs or Shareware Dealers.

                 Debates & Articles in This Double Disk Issue

Prior to this issue there were 19 debate topics (named in issue #4).
Five new debate topics have been added. Three are related to the Gulf
War and the Palestinian problem. One is a catch-all topic, which is used
by Sysop-Attorney Paula Goldman in her coverage of recent FCC actions
that impact the computer industry. The other topic covers intellectual
property law and programming freedom. Four position papers of the League
for Programming Freeedom, including one written for ShareDebate
International, kick off this debate.

Benston and Kaufman review the history of S&Ls. Bova writes about
freedom of information over the satellite waves. General Graham writes
on the political limitations imposed on the Patriot. The 28 Americans
killed by the Scud missile didn't need to die. Pournelle discusses how
government hurts progress.  Smith assesses the National Interest Project
level Stock market proposal.  Schulman's Prometheus- winning novel,
Alongside Night, is excerpted (7 chapters). Martin writes on the Gulf
War and viruses. McAfee Associates' latest version of its virus detector
is included, SCAN76-C.

SYNOPSIS

     VIRUSCAN (SCAN) is a virus detection and identification
program for the IBM PC and compatible computers.  VIRUSCAN will
search a PC for known computer viruses in memory, the boot sector,
the partition table, and the files of a PC and its disks.  VIRUSCAN
will also detect the presence of unknown viruses.
     SCAN works by searching the system for instruction sequences
or patterns that are unique to each computer virus, and then
reporting their presence if found.  This method works for viruses
that VIRUSCAN recognizes.  To detect unknown viruses, VIRUSCAN can
append a validation code or "CRC check" to .COM and .EXE files. 
If the file has been modified in any way, SCAN will report that
infection may have occurred.  VIRUSCAN can also look for new
viruses from a user-supplied list of virus search strings.
     VIRUSCAN runs on any PC with 256Kb and DOS version 2.00 or
greater.


AUTHENTICITY

     VIRUSCAN runs a self-test when executed.  If SCAN has been
modified in any way, a warning will be displayed.  The program will
still continue to check for viruses, though.  If SCAN reports that
it has been damaged, it is recommended that a clean copy be
obtained.
     VIRUSCAN versions 46 and above are packaged with the VALIDATE
program to ensure the integrity of the SCAN.EXE file.  The
VALIDATE.DOC  instructions tell how to use the VALIDATE program.
The VALIDATE program distributed with VIRUSCAN may be used to check
all further versions of SCAN.

     The validation results for Version 76-C should be:

              FILE NAME: SCAN.EXE
                   SIZE: 58,467
                   DATE: 04-09-1991
    FILE AUTHENTICATION
         Check Method 1: A9AB
         Check Method 2: 158B

If your copy of SCAN.EXE differs, it may have been modified.
Always obtain your copy of VIRUSCAN from a known source.  The
latest version of VIRUSCAN and validation data for SCAN.EXE can be
obtained off of McAfee Associates' bulletin board system at (408)
988-4004.

     Beginning with Version 72, all McAfee Associates programs for
download are archived with PKWare's PKZIP Authentic File
Verification.  If you do not see the "-AV" message after every file
is unzipped and receive the message "Authentic Files Verified!
# NWN405  Zip Source: McAFEE ASSOCIATES" when you unzip the files
then do not run them.  If your version of PKUNZIP does not have
verification ability, then this message may not be displayed.
Please contact McAfee Associates if your .ZIP file has been
tampered with.

WHAT'S NEW
	Version 76-C of SCAN fixes a false alarm with the Friday-13
virus.
     Version 76 of VIRUSCAN adds 18 new viruses, bringing the
total number of known computer viruses to 239, for a total of 501
viruses including strains.  The enclosed VIRLIST.TXT file outlines
the characteristics of the new viruses.  For a comprehensive
discussion of each of the viruses, we recommend that you access the
VSUM document copyrighted by Patricia Hoffman.  It is available on
most bulletin board systems.
     In addition, two new command line options have been added to
improve batch mode operation of SCAN:  The /NOPAUSE option turns
off the screen pause that occurs when SCAN fills up a screen with
messages.  The /NOBREAK option will prevent SCAN from stopping when
a Control-C or Control-Break is issued.
VIRUSCAN Version 7.2C76                                 Page 4


OVERVIEW

     VIRUSCAN scans diskettes or entire systems for pre-existing
computer virus infections.  It will identify the virus infecting
the system, and tell what area of the system (memory, boot sector,
file) the virus occupies.  An infected file can be removed with
the overwrite-and-delete option, /D which will erase the file.
The CLEAN-UP program is also available to automatically disinfect
the system and repair damaged areas whenever possible.
     VIRUSCAN Version 76 identifies all 239 known computer viruses
along with their variants.  Some viruses have been modified so that
more than one "strain" exists.  Counting such modifications, there
are 501 virus variants.  The ten most common viruses which account
for over 95% of all reported PC infections are also identified by
SCAN.  The accompanying VIRLIST.TXT file lists describes all new,
public domain, and extinct computer viruses identified by SCAN.
The number of variants of each virus is listed in parentheses after
the virus name.
      All known computer viruses infect one or more of the
following areas:  the hard or fixed disk partition table [also
known as the master boot record]; the DOS boot sector of hard disks
and floppy disks; or one or more executable files within the
system.  Executable files include operating system files, .COM
files, .EXE files, overlay files, or any other files loaded into
memory and executed.  A virus that infects more than one area, such
as a boot sector and an executable file is called a multipartite
virus.
    VIRUSCAN identifies every area or file that is infected, and
indicates both the name of the virus and CLEAN-UP I.D. code used
to remove it.  SCAN will check the entire system, an individual
diskette, sub-directory, or individual files for existing viruses.
     VIRUSCAN will also check for new, unknown viruses with the Add
Validation and Check Validation options.  This is done by computing
a code for a file, appending it to the file, and then validating
the file against that code.  If the file has been modified, the
check will no longer match, indicating that viral infection may
have occurred.  SCAN uses two independently generated CRC (Cyclic
Redundancy Check) checks that are added to the end of program files
to do this.  Files which are self-checking should not be validated
since this will "set off" the program's self-check.  Files which
are self-modifying may have different values for the same program
depending upon the modifications.  VIRUSCAN adds validation codes
to .COM and .EXE files only.  The validation codes for the
partition table, boot sector, and system files, are kept in a
hidden file called SCANVAL.VAL in the root directory.
     VIRUSCAN can also be updated to search for new viruses via
an External Virus Data File option, which allows the user to
provide the VIRUSCAN program with new search strings for viruses.
     VIRUSCAN can display messages in either English or French.
     VIRUSCAN works on stand-alone and networked PC's, but not on
a file server.  For networks, the NETSCAN file server-scanning
program is required.

OPERATION

IMPORTANT NOTE:  WRITE PROTECT YOUR FLOPPY DISK BEFORE SCANNING
YOUR SYSTEM TO PREVENT INFECTION OF THE VIRUSCAN PROGRAM.

     VIRUSCAN will check each area or file on the designated
drive(s) that could be host to a virus.  If a virus is found, a
message is displayed telling the name of the infected file or
system area and the name of the identified virus.  SCAN will
examine files for viruses based on their extensions.  The default
executable extensions supported by SCAN are .BIN, .COM, .EXE, .OV?,
.PGM, .PIF, .PRG, .SYS and .XTP.  Additional extensions can be
added to SCAN or all files on disk can be selected for scanning.

     To run VIRUSCAN type:

SCAN d1: ... d10: /A /AV /CV /D /E .xxx .yyy .zzz /EXT d:filename
                  /FR /MANY /NLZ /NOBREAK /NOMEM /NOPAUSE
                  /REPORT d:filename /RV


Options are:

                  \ - Scan root directory and boot area only
                 /A - Scan all files, including data, for viruses
                /AV - Add validation codes to specified files
                /CV - Check validation codes for files
                 /D - Overwrite and delete infected file
  /E .xxx .yyy .zzz - Scan overlay extensions .xxx .yyy .zzz
    /EXT d:filename - Scan using external virus information file
                /FR - Display messages in French
                 /M - Scan memory for all viruses
                      (see below for specifics)
              /MANY - Scan multiple floppies
               /NLZ - Skip internal scan of LZEXE compressed files
           /NOBREAK - Disable Ctrl-C / Ctrl-Brk during scanning
             /NOMEM - Skip memory checking
           /NOPAUSE - Disable screen pause when scanning
 /REPORT d:filename - Create report of infected files
                /RV - Remove validation codes from specified files

           (d1: ... d10: indicate drives to be scanned)

     The /A option will cause SCAN to check all files on the
referenced drive.  This should only be used if a file-infecting
virus has already been detected.  Otherwise the /A option should
only be used when checking a new program.  The /A option will add
a substantial time to scanning.  This option takes priority over
the /E option.
    The /AV option allows the user to add validation codes to the
files being scanned.  If a full drive is specified, SCAN will
create validation data for the partition table, boot sector, and
system files of the disk as well.  Validation adds ten (10) bytes
to files; the validation data for the partition table, boot sector,
and system files is stored separately in a hidden file in the root
directory of the scanned drive.
VIRUSCAN Version 7.2C76                                Page 6

    The /CV option checks the validation codes inserted by the /AV
option.  If the file has been changed, SCAN will report that the
file has been modified, and that viral infection may have occurred.
Using the /CV option adds about 25% more time to scanning.

NOTE:  Some older Hewlett Packard and Zenith PC's modify the boot
sector or partition table each time the system is booted.  This
will cause SCAN to continually notify the user of boot sector or
partition table modifications if the /CV switch is selected.  Check
your system's manual to determine if your system contains
self-modifying boot code.

     The /D option tells VIRUSCAN to prompt the user to overwrite
and delete an infected file when one is found.  If the user selects
"Y" the infected file will be overwritten with hex code C3 [the
Return-to-DOS instruction] and then deleted.  A file erased by the
/D option can not be recovered.  If the McAfee Associates' CLEAN-
UP program is available, it is recommended that CLEAN be used to
remove the virus instead of SCAN, since in most cases it will
recover the infected file.  Boot sector and partition table
infectors can not be removed by the /D option and require the
CLEAN-UP virus disinfection program.
     The /E option allows the user to specify an extension or set
of extensions to scan.  Extensions should include the period
character "." and be separated by a space after the /E and between
each other.  Up to three extensions may be added with the /E.  For
more extensions, use the /A option.
     The /EXT option allows VIRUSCAN to search for viruses from a
text file containing user-created search strings.  The syntax for
using the external virus data file is /EXT d:filename, where d: is
the drive name and filename is the name of the external virus data
file.  For instructions on how to create an external virus data
file, refer to Appendix A.

NOTE:  The /EXT option is intended for advanced users and computer
anti-virus researchers to add their own strings for detection of
computer viruses on an interim or emergency basis.  When used with
the /D option, it will delete infected files.  This option is not
recommended for general use and should be used with caution.

     The /FR option tells VIRUSCAN to output all messages in French
instead of English.
     The /M option tells VIRUSCAN to check system memory for all
known computer viruses that can inhabit memory.  SCAN by default
only checks memory for critical and "stealth" viruses, which are
viruses which can cause catastrophic damage or spread the infection
during the scanning process.  SCAN will check memory for the
following viruses in any case:

     1554           1971          1253          2100
     3445-Stealth   4096          512           Anthrax
     Brain          Dark Avenger  Disk Killer   Doom-2
     EDV            Fish6         Form          Invader
     Joshi          Microbes      Mirror        Murphy
     Nomenclature   Phantom       Plastique     Polish-2
     P1R (Phoenix)  Taiwan-3      Whale         Zero-Hunt

VIRUSCAN Version 7.2C76                                Page 7


If one of these viruses is found in memory, SCAN will stop and
advise the user to power down, and reboot the system from a
virus-free system disk.  Using the /M option with another
anti-viral software package may result in false alarms if the other
package does not remove its virus search strings from memory.  The
/M option will add 6 to 20 seconds to the scanning time.
     The /MANY option is used to scan multiple diskettes placed in
a given drive.  If the user has more than one floppy disk to
check for viruses, the /MANY option will allows the user to check
them without having to run SCAN multiple times.  If a system has
been disinfected, the /MANY and /NOMEM options can be used to speed
up scanning of disks.
     The /NLZ option tells VIRUSCAN not to look inside files
compressed with the LZEXE file compression program.  SCAN will
still check the programs for external infections.
     The /NOBREAK option disables Control-C or Control-Break from
stopping VIRUSCAN while running. 
     The /NOMEM option is used to turn off all memory checking for
viruses.  It should only be used when a system is known to be free
of viruses.
     The /NOPAUSE option disables the "More..." prompt that appears
when SCAN fills up a screen with data.  This allows VIRUSCAN to run
on a machine with multiple infections without requiring operator
intervention when the screen fills up with messages from the SCAN
program.
     The /REPORT option is used to generate a listing of infected
files.  The resulting list is saved to disk as an ASCII text file.
To use the report option, specify /REPORT on the command line,
followed by the device and filename [See EXAMPLES below for
samples].
     The /RV option is used to remove validation codes from a file
or files.  It can be used to remove the validation code from a
diskette, subdirectory, or file(s).  Using /RV on a disk will
remove the partition table, boot sector, and system file
validation.  This option can not be used with the /AV option.

EXIT CODES

     VIRUSCAN will set the DOS ERRORLEVEL upon program termination
to:

     ERRORLEVEL | DESCRIPTION
     -----------+--------------------------
         0      | No viruses found
         1      | One or more viruses found
         2      | Abnormal termination (program error)

If a user stops the scanning process, SCAN will set the ERRORLEVEL
to 0 or 1 depending on whether or not a virus was discovered prior
to termination of the SCAN.  The /NOBREAK option can be used to
prevent scanning from being stopped.


VIRUS REMOVAL

    What do you do if a virus is found?  You can contact McAfee
Associates for assistance with manually removing the virus, for
disinfection utilities, and for more information about the virus.
The CLEAN-UP universal virus disinfection program is available and
will disinfect the majority of reported computer viruses.  It is
updated frequently to remove new viruses.  The CLEAN-UP program can
be downloaded from McAfee Associates BBS.
     It is strongly recommended that you get experienced help in
dealing with viruses, especially critical viruses that can damage
or destroy data [for a listing of critical viruses, see the /M
option under OPTIONS, above] and partition table or boot sector
infecting viruses, as improper removal of these viruses could
result in the loss of all data and use of the disk(s).

IF CLEAN-UP IS NOT AVAILABLE, THEN FOR:

     BOOT SECTOR INFECTORS
     Power down the infected system and boot off of an uninfected,
     write-protected diskette.  Use the DOS SYS command to attempt
     to overwrite the boot sector.  This works in many cases.  Run
     VIRUSCAN to see if the virus has been eradicated.  If this
     does not work, do a file-by-file backup of the system (in
     other words, do not backup the boot sector) and do a low-level
     format of the disk.  For a floppy diskette, copy the files off
     of the infected diskette using the DOS COPY command, not XCOPY
     or DISKCOPY which will transfer the virus.  Reformat or
     discard the infected floppy disk.

     FILE INFECTORS
     Power down the infected system and boot off of an uninfected,
     write-protected diskette.  Run VIRUSCAN with the /D and /A
     options.  Scan all original disks for viruses and replace
     programs from them if clean.
VIRUSCAN Version 7.2C76                                Page 10


     PARTITION TABLE INFECTORS
     Power down the infected system and boot off of an uninfected,
     write-protected diskette.  Proceed to do a file-by-file backup
     of the system (in other words, do not backup the partition
     table).  Then do a low-level format of the disk.

Disinfection utilities are available for the majority of reported
computer viruses, these programs can be downloaded from McAfee
Associates' BBS at (408) 988-4004.

APPENDIX A:  Creating a Virus String File with the /EXT Option

     The External Virus Data file should be created with an editor
or a word processor and saved as an ASCII text file.  Be sure each
line ends with a CR/LF pair.

NOTE:  The /EXT option is intended for emergency and research use
only.  It is an temporary method for identifying new viruses prior
to the subsequent release of SCAN.  A sound understanding of
viruses and string-search techniques is advised as a prerequisite
for using this option.

     The virus string file uses the following format:

#Comment about Virus_1
"aabbccddeeff..." Virus_1_Name
#Comment about Virus_2
"gghhiijjkkll..." Virus_2_Name
     .
     .
"uuvvwwxxyyzz..." Virus_n_Name


Where aa, bb, cc, etc. are the hexadecimal bytes that you wish to
scan for.  Each line in the file represents one virus.  The Virus
Name for each virus is mandatory, and may be up to 25 characters
in length.  The double quotes (") are required at the beginning and
end of each hexadecimal string.
     SCAN will use the string file to search memory, the Partition
Table, Boot Sector, System files, all .COM and .EXE files, and
Overlay files with the extension .BIN, .OV?, .PGM, .PIF, .PRG, .SYS
and .XTP.

     Virus strings may contain wild cards.  The two wildcard
options are:

FIXED POSITION WILDCARD
     The question mark "?" may be used to represent a wildcard in
a fixed position within the string.  For example, the string:

               "E9 7C 00 10 ? 37 CB"

would match "E9 7C 00 10 27 37 CB", "E9 7C 00 10 9C 37 CB", or any
other similar string, no matter what byte was in the fifth place.

RANGE WILDCARD
     The asterisk "*", followed by range number in parentheses "("
and ")" is used to represent a variable number of adjoining random
bytes.  For example, the string:

               "E9 7C *(4) 37 CB"

would match "E9 7C 00 37 CB", "E9 7C 00 11 37 CB", and
"E9 7C 00 11 22 37 CB".  The string "E9 7C 00 11 22 33 44 37 CB"
would not match since the distance between 7C and 37 is greater
than four bytes.  You may specify a range of up to 99 bytes.
VIRUSCAN Version 7.2C76                                Page 12


Up to 10 different wildcards of either kind may be used in one
virus string.

COMMENTS
     A pound sign "#" at the begining of a line will denote that
it is a comment.  Use this for adding notes to the external virus
data file.  For example:

               #New .COM virus found in file FRITZ.EXE from
               #Schneiderland on 01-22-91
               "53 48 45 45 50" Fritz-1 [F-1]

Could be used to store a description of the virus, name of the
original infected file, where and when it was received, and so
forth.

## VALIDATE.DOC

{% raw %}
```
                             VALIDATE Version 0.3
                            From McAfee Associates
                                (408) 988-3832


     VALIDATE is a file-authentication program that may be used to 
check other programs for signs of tampering.  VALIDATE uses two 
discrete methods to generate Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC's),
which are then displayed for the user to compare against the known
value for the program(s) validated.  The known validation data can
be published by the author of the program or be obtained from a
trusted information database.  The dual CRC checking provides a
high degree of security.

     The Computer Virus Industry Association (CVIA) provides an
online database of validation values for shareware authors at no
cost.  You are encouraged to call the CVIA's BBS at (408) 988-4004
to access current validation data for McAfee Associates' VIRUSCAN,
California Software Concepts' SHEZ, Vern Berg's LIST, and other
shareware programs.

     To confirm that a program is in its original, untampered
state, run the VALIDATE program on it, record the validation data
produced, and compare it against the record in the online database. 
If they match, than it is highly improbable (less than one in
sixty-four quadrilion) that the program has been modified.

To run VALIDATE, type:

     VALIDATE d:\path\filename.ext

The VALIDATE program will then display the following information:

                   Size:  (#/bytes)
                   Date:  (file creation date)
    File Authentication
         Check Method 1:  (a four digit CRC)
         Check Method 2:  (a four digit CRC)


The VALIDATE program may be copied and distributed at no charge as
long as it is distributed whole and intact and unmodified in any
way, along with this file.  Please report virus infections and
reports of program tampering to:

                   Computer Virus Industry Association
                   4423 Cheeney Street
                   Santa Clara, CA  95054-0253
                   USA
                   (408) 727-4559 telephone answering machine


The validation data for VALIDATE.COM is:

                   WITH CRC            WITHOUT
                   CHECKING            CHECKING
                   Size:  6495         6485
                   Date:  10-31-1989   10-31-1989
    File Authentication
         Check Method 1:  4637         CB21
         Check Method 2:  1214         13B7

     If you have an older version of VALIDATE, it may be ten (10)
bytes shorter.  This is because it was not processed by VIRUSCAN's
CRC-checking feature, added in Version 66 of VIRUSCAN.  The
validation code can be removed from VALIDATE.COM by running
VIRUSCAN against it with the /RV Remove Validation option. 
However, this is not recommended.

Total Known Viruses - 501


LEGEND:

Size Increase:
     N/A        - Virus does not attach to files.
     None       - Virus does not change file size (attaches to tag end of file)
     Overwrites - Virus overwrites beginning of file, no file size change
     All Others - The length in bytes by which a file will increase when infected.

Damage Fields:
     B - Corrupts or overwrites the boot sector
     D - Corrupts data files
     F - Formats or overwrites all/part of disk
     L - Directly or indirectly corrupts file linkage
     O - Affects system run-time operation
     P - Corrupts program or overlay files

Characteristics:
     x - Yes
     . - No

Disinfectors:
     CLEAN-UP   - CLEAN-UP universal virus disinfector
     SCAN /D    - VIRUSCAN with /D option
     SCAN /D /A - VIRUSCAN with /D and /A options
     MDISK /P   - MDISK with "P" option
     All Others - The name of disinfecting program

     NOTE:     The  SCAN  /D options will overwrite and then delete  the
               entire  infected  program.   The  program  must  then  be
               replaced from the original program diskette.  If you wish
               to  try  and  recover an infected program, then  use  the
               above-named disinfector if available.

               If a virus infects Overlay Files (Item 7) Clean-Up should
               be used with the /A option when removing the virus.

     Footnote:  The 'crash' virus (in all implementations we have encountered)
               crashes when run.  It is included since it is possible that
               under other architectures than those tested, it might flourish.
