Disk Title: VUIMAGE                                                     
PC-SIG Version: S1.0                                                    
                                                                        
Program Title: VUIMAGE                                                  
Author Version: 2.82                                                    
Author Registration: $30.00                                             
Special Requirements: Graphics card.                                    
                                                                        
If you work with GIF/TIFF/PCX graphic files, you need VUIMAGE!  VUIMAGE 
lets you display or print GIF files and bilevel/grayscale TIFF files.   
It's fast and uses only 150K of free memory.                            
                                                                        
VUIMAGE automatically configures for your monitor with excellent color  
rendition on CGA, EGA, VGA, MCGA, and Super VGA (Hercules monochrome is 
also supported).                                                        
                                                                        
Automatically scale a graphic to the size of your screen or manually    
scale from 1% to 999%.  Zoom in and out, pan to different parts of a    
large graphic, and easily adjust brightness while the picture is on     
screen.                                                                 
                                                                        
Print out any graphic (with six dithering options) and VUIMAGE will     
automatically size it for your printer. (Some GIF images are provided   
for your use.)                                                          
                                                                        
In addition, you can specify a list of files to be automatically viewed 
allowing you to create great slide shows and demos.

        Tiff Bilevel/Grayscale to TIFF/GIF Bilevel/Grayscale Converter
          Copyright (C) 1990 Offe Enterprises. All rights reserved.

Converts a bilevel (black and white) or grayscale TIFF image to a
same or lower resolution bilevel/grayscale image in TIFF or GIF format.

EXAMPLE USES

  1.  Convert a scanned image in TIFF format (these are usually
      black and white images that have a large number of 
      horizontal and vertical pixels) to a smaller image
      with grayscales so that the image can be viewed more
      completely on a VGA/EGA screen.  The grayscales compensate
      for the loss of resolution caused when the image is
      reduced to a smaller size.

  2.  Convert a bilevel/grayscale TIFF file to a GIF file.

  3.  Reduce the filesize of TIFF files by scaling the image.

The program can be executed non-interactively (for example, from a batch file.
A demo version this program is available on many BBSes.


SYNTAX: tbg [options] inputfile outputfile

OPTIONS:

   -otiff  output file in TIFF format.

   -ogif   output file in  GIF format.

   -xn  where n=1,2,3,etc.  Reduce the width by this factor.
        Example: -x2 reduces the width to half its value.

   -yn  where n=1,2,3,etc.  Reduce the height by this factor.
        Example: -y4 reduces the height to a quarter of its value.

   -bn  where n=1 to 8.  Set the number of bits per pixel in the output to n.
        If a lower number is sufficient, the lower number is used (also see the
        -f option).  The maximum possible gray levels in the output is 2 to the
        power of this number.  Example: -b4 sets the # bits/pixel to 4.

   -f   force the number of bits/pixel to the value specified by the -b option

   -q   quiet.  Do not display input/output image information



EXAMPLE:       tbg -x4 -y4 -b2 input.tif output.tif
               tbg -ogif input.tif output.gif


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        SCRtoPS(tm) - Screen-to-PostScript

       PRINT PC SCREENS TO POSTSCRIPT PRINTER OR CAPTURE TO ENCAPSULATED
               POSTSCRIPT FILE FOR INCORPORATION INTO DOCUMENTS

              for IBM PC + Adobe PostScript Printers and Compatibles


Performs screen captures directly into PostScript by pressing Shift-PrintScreen.
Use to include screen snapshots in your documents (including line/box/upper
ASCII characters) or to print from software that does not support postscript.

Supports Text and graphics modes including IBM character graphics on CGA, EGA,
VGA and some SuperVGA.  Text modes use the Courier font for standard ASCII
characters.

Send postscript output to LPT1/LPT2/LPT3 ports, COM1/COM2 ports or disk files.
Send to postscript printer directly or import file into Desk-Top Publishing
packages like Ventura Publisher/ WordPerfect for use with PostScript printers.

Supports color to greyscale conversion on EGA/ VGA/SuperVGA and xon/xoff on
com ports

Uses minimal memory - less than 10K when resident - can be removed from memory.

Graphics cursor indicates progress, screen capture can be aborted

User selectable landscape/portrait mode, x, y sizes, and <ctrl>-d at end-of-job

Built-in help facility


(A new program is also available that will post-process TEXT screens
 captured using SCRtoPS(tm) so that foreground/background color information
 can be translated to different foreground thicknesses and background gray
 shades on the printout)

INSTALLATION AND USAGE
----------------------

Note: Requires MS-DOS Version 2.0 or later and at least 150K of free memory.

1.  FLOPPY DISK  Copy all the files from the program disk to another floppy
                 disk.  Use this as your working disk - place this disk into
                 drive A:, type "A:" and press return.  Go to step 2.

    HARD DISK    Make a new subdirectory.  For example, if you are using
                 drive C: and the subdirectory name you want is \VUIMAGE, enter
                          c:
                          md \vuimage
                 Now make this subdirectory your current directory.  In our
                 example, enter
                          cd  \vuimage
                 Copy all the files from the program disk to this subdirectory.
                 Go to step 2.

2.  Now all the files are in the current drive/directory.  To start the program,
    type "vuimg"  at the DOS prompt and press return.

    You will be placed in the main menu.  Also shown will be a list of files
    in the current directory that have the extension "GIF".  The current display
    mode will be displayed at the bottom left of the screen.  The main menu
    options are displayed at the bottom right of the screen.

    Press "Q" to quit back to DOS.  Go to step 3.

3.  You can execute the program any time by changing to the subdirectory that
    has the program files and typing "vuimg"  as in step 2.  However, it is
    much more convenient to create a "batch file" that will execute the
    program from any directory.  WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO THIS so that you
    can "configure" the program this way to suit your own needs.  You can
    create a batch file by typing

          copy con: v.bat     <return>

    where "v.bat" is the name of the batch file.  Now enter the program
    name along with the drive and directory name.  For example,

          c:\vuimage\vuimg    <return>

    Then press <ctrl>-Z followed by a <return> to finish creating the batch
    file (you can also use an editor to create this file).  Now you can start
    the program by typing "v" and return.  The batch file need not be kept
    in the same subdirectory as the program files.  However, the sub-directory
    that it is kept in must be part of your "PATH".  The PATH is a list of
    directories that DOS will search when you type in a command.  Refer to
    your DOS manual for information on PATH and how to add a sub-directory to
    your PATH.

    After you become familiar with the command line options of the program (see
    later section on command line options), you can re-create the batch file 
    and also specify the command line options that you normally prefer to use.
    This way you can "configure" the program to suit your needs.


MAIN MENU
---------

From the main menu, at the "File(s)" prompt, you can enter:

        - "t" to select the file type - GIF or TIFF

        - "m" to change the display mode

        - "s" to change the scaling options

        - "o" to change other user selectable options

        - "d" to select a different directory/different group of files

        - "q" or ESC to quit and go back to DOS.

        - a list of picture files to be displayed.  For example, enter

                3,1,5-7,17-14  <return>

           to display files 3,1,5,6,7,17,16,15,14 from the list (in that order).

        - One of the arrow keys to select files using the cursor keys.

          In this mode, to display a single file, move the cursor bar to the
          file and press enter.  To display a list of files, move to each file
          and press the space bar to select (mark) the file.  Press enter to
          display the marked files or "/" to continuously repeat the list of
          files.  If there are too many files to fit on one screen, use the
          PgUp/PgDn keys to see other files.

          After moving the cursor to a specific file, you can press the
          "Insert" key to obtain quick information about the file.

	  To get back to the main menu, press the escape key.



SELECTING THE FILE TYPE
-----------------------

The default file type is "GIF".  To select between TIFF and GIF,
press "t" at the main menu prompt.  You can also select the file type from
the command line using the "-T" option (for example, -Ttiff will select TIFF -
see section on command line options).


SETTING THE DISPLAY MODE
------------------------

The program selects a video display mode appropriate for the video adapter
and the picture being displayed automatically.  The mode is chosen from the
CGA/Hercules/EGA/VGA modes present and any modes supported by any extended
mode driver that has been loaded (extended mode drivers are selected by the
command line option "-v" - see section "Display Boards and Extended
Modes/Drivers" for more details on extended modes).  SuperVGA modes are
extended modes.

If the user desires to select a particular video mode to display the picture
instead of the automatically selected mode, this can be done by pressing
"m" at the main menu prompt, going into the display mode menu and changing
the display mode.  An appropriate mode supported by your video display
board may be specified.  If any extended video mode drivers have been
loaded, the extended modes supported by these drivers are also listed.

Instead of using the menu, you can also specify the mode to be used from the
command line by using the "-m" option (for example, "-m7" will use the
EGA 640x350 16-color mode - see section on command line options).

There is also a "BIOS" mode that you can use for extended modes that are
unsupported.  Your display board will need to provide complete BIOS support.
Usually the BIOS mode is extremely slow. 

If you are using a video mode that has only 2 colors, you can use dithering
to improve the displayed picture.  Use the Options menu to select a type
of dithering to be used for 2-color modes.  A suggested dither option for
2-color displays is 3 (3x3).


DISPLAYING PICTURE FILES
------------------------

From the main menu, enter the number of the file you wish to display and
press return.  If you wish to display a sequence of files, you can enter
a set of numbers, separated by commas:

        Example:  3,5 <return> will display file 3 followed by file 5. 

You can enter a starting number and an ending number to display a list of
files:

        Example:  2,5-7 <return> will display files 2, 5, 6 and 7.
        Example:  2,7-5 <return> will display files 2, 7, 6 and 5.

After you enter a list of files (or one file) and press return, the picture(s)
are displayed in sequence.

Alternately, you can press the "up arrow" to select files using the cursor.
To see one file, move the cursor bar to the file and press return.  To
select a list of files, "mark" each file by moving the cursor bar to it
and then pressing space bar.  When you press return, the files will be 
displayed in sequence.


TIMEOUT
-------

Each picture is displayed for a default time of 20 seconds.  Pressing a
return, however, will force the display to end and move on to the next
picture or back to the main menu.  The timeout value can be changed from
the "Options" menu or from the command line using the -t option.

If the "@" key is pressed after drawing the picture on screen, the timeout
is disabled.  In this case the picture will continue to be displayed
until another key is pressed.

If you use a screen grabber program to capture the displayed image and
you are not successful, use of the "@" key may help.

ABORT PICTURE
-------------

Pressing the ESC key while a picture is being drawn aborts that picture.
You can abort a list of pictures by pressing the ESC key twice.


REPEATING LISTS ( CONTINUOUS SLIDE SHOW MODE )
----------------------------------------------

When you enter a list of pictures in the main menu, if you end the list with
the forward slash ("/") instead of a <return>, the list will be continuously
repeated.  To abort this repeated display, press the ESC key twice in quick
succession.


SELECTING THE DISPLAY DIRECTORY
-------------------------------

From the main menu, press "d" to change the display directory (the directory
containing the picture files).  The files in this directory will be listed
when you return to the main menu.

If only a directory name is specified, all files that have an extension
of GIF or TIF (depending on file type selected) in that directory will be
displayed.  If you want to list other files also, enter an appropriate string
to be matched.

Examples:
          To list                                       Enter

all files in the current directory                      *.*<return>

all files with extension GIF in the current directory   *.gif<return>

all files with extension GIF or TIF (depending on       pics<return>
  file type) in the subdirectory "pics" of the
  current directory

all files with extension GIF or TIF (depending on       \picdir<return>
  file type) in the subdirectory "picdir" of the
  root directory

all files in the subdirectory "picdir" of the root      \picdir\*.*<return>
        directory.

You can also set the display directory from the command line using the -d
option.


SCALING OF PICTURES
-------------------

There are many scaling options. The default scaling is 1:1 i.e. no scaling.
You can choose to set the scales manually.  You can also have the program
perform auto-scaling.  The "auto-scale full screen" option makes the picture
"fit" the screen horizontally and vertically.  You can also auto-scale
with the constraint that the horizontal and vertical scales should be equal.

Use the "Scale" menu to change the scaling options.  You can also select
the scaling method from the command line using the -s option.


ZOOMING
-------

Once a picture is displayed on the screen, you can zoom in using the "+" key
and zoom out using the "-" key.


PANNING
-------

Once a picture is displayed on the screen, you can move the viewing window
around the picture by the use of the cursor keypad:

                           (Number lock should be disabled)

        down arrow  (or "d")       move down  half screen (1/8 screen for TIFF)
        right arrow (or "r")       move right half screen (1/8 screen for TIFF)
        up   arrow  (or "u")       move up    half screen (1/8 screen for TIFF)
        left arrow  (or "l")       move left  half screen (1/8 screen for TIFF)
        "End"       (or "1")       move to bottom left corner
        "PgDn"      (or "3")       move to bottom right corner
        "PgUp"      (or "9")       move to top right corner
        "Home"      (or "7")       move to top left corner

                           (Scroll lock should be disabled)

  shift-down  arrow (or "2")       move down  full screen
  shift-right arrow (or "6")       move right full screen
  shift-up    arrow (or "8")       move up    full screen
  shift-left  arrow (or "4")       move left  full screen
 


BRIGHTNESS
----------

Once a picture is displayed on the screen, you can increase the brightness
by pressing the "b" key and reduce the brightness by pressing the "B" key.


INVERTING THE IMAGE
-------------------

Once a picture is displayed on the screen, you can invert the image by
pressing the "i" key.  This is useful for black and white or grayscale
images.  Image inversion can also be set using the "-ii" commandline option.
Available in VUIMAGE PLUS(tm) only.


PRINTING
--------

Once an image is displayed on the screen, you can print that image by
pressing the "p" key.  Before printing, make sure that you have set up
the printer port and selected the correct printer by going into the
Options menu.

The entire image is printed.  Any brightness adjustments you have made
will affect the print output.  The output to 2-color printers (most printers)
can be dithered so as to obtain a better print-out.  You can choose between
no dithering, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5 or 6x6 dithering by going
into the Options menu.  You may wish to experiment with the dithering
options to obtain the best print image.  For fairly high resolution
printers (200x200 dpi or greater), 6x6 or 5x5 is suggested for paint-type
images and scanned images with many shades.  For line art/scanned documents,
eiher no dithering or 2x2 is suggested.

From the Options menu, you can also set the desired size of the print-out.

You can specify "lpt1:","lpt2:","lpt3:","com1:","com2:" or a filename
for the printer port.


TEXT SCREEN COLORS
------------------

You can change the text screen colors used by going into the "Options"
menu and answering "y" when asked "Change Screen Colors ?".
Use the left/right arrow keys to change the foreground color and the
up/down arrow keys to change the background color. (Alternately, you can use
the "f" and "F" keys for foreground and the "b" and "B" keys for background).
Select the colors you like.  Note the numbers shown that corresponds to each
of the colors that you selected - these numbers can be used with the "-cd",
"-co" and the "-cg" command line options to automatically select your
favourite colors when the program is started.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
--------------------

Many of the options may be set from the command line instead going through
a menu.  For example, to start the program with the mode option set to 9
and the scaling option set to 3, enter:

        vuimg  -m9 -s3

The available command line options are listed below:

  -Tfiletype    where filetype is "gif" or "tiff".

                Example:   -Ttiff       (display tiff files)

  -vdrivername  where drivername is the name of the extended mode driver
                appropriate for your board.  If the program files are not in
                the current directory, then the drive and subdirectory must
                also be specified.

                Example (load ATI VGAWonder driver):

                           -vdativ            (program files in current dir)
                           -vc:\vuimage\dativ (program files in c:\vuimage)

  -mmodeindex   where modeindex is the number you would enter if you were
                to go into the "Mode" menu and make a selection.

                Example:   -m9          (set 320x200x256 mode)

  -sscaleindex  where scaleindex is the number you would enter if you were
                to go into the Scale menu (part of the "Options" menu) and
                make a selection.

                Example:   -s3          (set autoscale full screen)

  -sxhscale     where hscale is the horizontal scale value (1% to 999%).
                This option should be used only if manual scaling is selected.

                Example:   -sx200       (set horizontal scale to 200%)

  -syvscale     where vscale is the vertical scale value (1% to 999%).
                This option should be used only if manual scaling is selected.

                Example:   -sy50        (set vertical scale to 50%)

  -ddirectory   where directory is a directory name (or file matching string)
                that you would enter when you go into the Dir menu.

  -bn           disables the beep at the end of the picture

                Example:   -bn          (disable beep)

  -Bbrightness  where brightness is the brightness value (100 is nominal)

                Example:   -B120                (set brightness to 120%)

  -cddircolor   where dircolor is the color number for the filenames 
  -cofncolor          fncolor  is the color number for the file numbers 
  -cmmodcolor         modcolor is the color number for the display mode
  -cggencolor         gencolor is the color number for general text
                To find the color numbers for the colors of your choice, first
                go into the "Options" menu and select the colors that you like.
                The corresponding color numbers are also displayed.

                Example:   -cd78    (filenames in yellow on a red background)
                           -co10    (filenumbers in bright green on black)

(*** The following options are available only in VUIMAGE PLUS(tm) ***)

  -Tpcx         select filetype to be PCX.

  -pprinternum  where printernum is the number you would enter if you were
                to go into the Options menu and choose a printer.

                Example:   -p1      (select EPSON FX80/100 printer)

  -pddevicename where devicename is the printer device (lpt1:, lpt2:, lpt3:,
                com1:, com2: or filename).

                Example:   -pdlpt1:      (send output to lpt1:)
                           -pdvuimg.prn  (send output to file vuimg.prn)

                go into the Options menu and choose the printer dither type.

                Example:   -fp4     (dither 2-color printers using 4x4 matrix)

  -ii           invert the image (really useful for only black and white or
                grayscale images)

  -C            disables the menus.  If you use this option, you must also
                specify a filename to be displayed including the pathname.
                This should be the last option entered on the command line.
                The filename may contain wild card characters ? and * and 
                should be the last parameter.  Any directory name entered
                with the -d option will be ignored.

                Examples:   -C somefile.gif
                            -C \pics\*.gif

  -L            leave the last image on the screen when the program ends.
                Valid only when the -C option is used.  Useful when called
                as a sub-program by another program.




PRE-PROGRAMMED MODE
-------------------

You can run the program in a PRE-PROGRAMMED mode where it will go through a
display session with no keyboard input.  To do this, go through a manual
session and write down all keystrokes till you quit back to DOS (this is
important).  If you use the ESC key to abort a picture or list,
the return key to move on to the next picture, or the cursor keys to do
panning, do NOT include these keystrokes.  Then create a file containing
these keystrokes (we will use the filename "vuimg.inp" in the following
example).  To do this, type: 

        copy con: vuimg.inp <return>

Enter the keystrokes you wrote down and then type a <CTRL>Z to create the
file called vuimg.inp.  A text editor (ex. edlin) may also be used to
create such a file (start a new line for every "return" key).  This file
may then be used to run the program in the PRE-PROGRAMMED mode by typing

       vuimg  < vuimg.inp


DOS EXIT CODES (ERRORLEVEL)
---------------------------

The return codes generated by the program that may be tested in a batch
file are:

0 - no error
1 - command line option error
2 - the -C option was used without specifying a file
3 - file not found or invalid filename




DISPLAY BOARDS and EXTENDED VIDEO MODES/DRIVERS
-----------------------------------------------

If the program does not work with your display board, try loading any software
drivers (BIOS emulators, int 10h drivers, RAM BIOS drivers) that come with it.
Refer to the instructions that come with your graphics board.

Some video display boards support even higher resolutions than standard VGA,
for example, 640x480 in 256 colors and 800x600 in 16 colors.  These are
sometimes referred to as SuperVGA modes.  Additional drivers that support
these "extended modes" are included with the program.  These drivers have
filenames with the extension ".VDR" and are listed later in this section.
They can be loaded using the "-v" command line option (see section on command
line options).

Typically, extended modes are dependent on your type of graphics card.
Refer to your graphics card manual to see what extended modes are supported.
Only VGA type extended modes with either 16 or 256 colors out of a palette
of 262,144 colors are supported by the extended mode drivers.  Check the
list of extended mode drivers at the end of this section to see which driver
is suitable for use with your card.

However, there is a SuperVGA standard known as the VESA SuperVGA standard.
Many or most of the SuperVGA cards now support this standard.  If your
card supports this standard, then you can take advantage of the VESA driver
(DVESA.VDR) that comes with the program.  Even if there is a separate driver
that supports your card, WE RECOMMEND that you use the VESA driver instead
if your card supports the VESA standard.  In order for your card to support
the VESA standard, you may need to load a device driver or TSR that comes
with your card (through the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file).  Refer to the
documentation that comes with your card (in printed form or disk file form).

If you are not using any extended drivers, you may still be able to display
in an extended mode if your BIOS for the board will support this.  Not all
boards come with BIOS that support the extended modes completely.  Installing
any RAM BIOS drivers that come with your board may help.  Display done
through the BIOS is usually extremely slow.

To use the BIOS supported extended modes, you need to know the mode number,
the no. of columns, the no. of rows, and the no. of colors for the mode.
Refer to the manual for your graphics card.

If you have a plain VGA card with no SuperVGA modes, you may still be able
to get higher resolutions (320x400x256, 360x480x256, 800x600x16) using the
DNVGA driver.


Extended Mode Drivers (SuperVGA drivers) included:

(additional untested drivers may be available from Offe Enterprises)

        Tiff Bilevel/Grayscale to TIFF/GIF Bilevel/Grayscale Converter
          Copyright (C) 1990 Offe Enterprises. All rights reserved.

Converts a bilevel (black and white) or grayscale TIFF image to a
same or lower resolution bilevel/grayscale image in TIFF or GIF format.

EXAMPLE USES

  1.  Convert a scanned image in TIFF format (these are usually
      black and white images that have a large number of 
      horizontal and vertical pixels) to a smaller image
      with grayscales so that the image can be viewed more
      completely on a VGA/EGA screen.  The grayscales compensate
      for the loss of resolution caused when the image is
      reduced to a smaller size.

  2.  Convert a bilevel/grayscale TIFF file to a GIF file.

  3.  Reduce the filesize of TIFF files by scaling the image.

The program can be executed non-interactively (for example, from a batch file.
A demo version this program is available on many BBSes.


SYNTAX: tbg [options] inputfile outputfile

OPTIONS:

   -otiff  output file in TIFF format.

   -ogif   output file in  GIF format.

   -xn  where n=1,2,3,etc.  Reduce the width by this factor.
        Example: -x2 reduces the width to half its value.

   -yn  where n=1,2,3,etc.  Reduce the height by this factor.
        Example: -y4 reduces the height to a quarter of its value.

   -bn  where n=1 to 8.  Set the number of bits per pixel in the output to n.
        If a lower number is sufficient, the lower number is used (also see the
        -f option).  The maximum possible gray levels in the output is 2 to the
        power of this number.  Example: -b4 sets the # bits/pixel to 4.

   -f   force the number of bits/pixel to the value specified by the -b option

   -q   quiet.  Do not display input/output image information



EXAMPLE:       tbg -x4 -y4 -b2 input.tif output.tif
               tbg -ogif input.tif output.gif


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        SCRtoPS(tm) - Screen-to-PostScript

       PRINT PC SCREENS TO POSTSCRIPT PRINTER OR CAPTURE TO ENCAPSULATED
               POSTSCRIPT FILE FOR INCORPORATION INTO DOCUMENTS

              for IBM PC + Adobe PostScript Printers and Compatibles


Performs screen captures directly into PostScript by pressing Shift-PrintScreen.
Use to include screen snapshots in your documents (including line/box/upper
ASCII characters) or to print from software that does not support postscript.

Supports Text and graphics modes including IBM character graphics on CGA, EGA,
VGA and some SuperVGA.  Text modes use the Courier font for standard ASCII
characters.

Send postscript output to LPT1/LPT2/LPT3 ports, COM1/COM2 ports or disk files.
Send to postscript printer directly or import file into Desk-Top Publishing
packages like Ventura Publisher/ WordPerfect for use with PostScript printers.

Supports color to greyscale conversion on EGA/ VGA/SuperVGA and xon/xoff on
com ports

Uses minimal memory - less than 10K when resident - can be removed from memory.

Graphics cursor indicates progress, screen capture can be aborted

User selectable landscape/portrait mode, x, y sizes, and <ctrl>-d at end-of-job

Built-in help facility


(A new program is also available that will post-process TEXT screens
 captured using SCRtoPS(tm) so that foreground/background color information
 can be translated to different foreground thicknesses and background gray
 shades on the printout)

INSTALLATION AND USAGE
----------------------

Note: Requires MS-DOS Version 2.0 or later and at least 150K of free memory.

1.  FLOPPY DISK  Copy all the files from the program disk to another floppy
                 disk.  Use this as your working disk - place this disk into
                 drive A:, type "A:" and press return.  Go to step 2.

    HARD DISK    Make a new subdirectory.  For example, if you are using
                 drive C: and the subdirectory name you want is \VUIMAGE, enter
                          c:
                          md \vuimage
                 Now make this subdirectory your current directory.  In our
                 example, enter
                          cd  \vuimage
                 Copy all the files from the program disk to this subdirectory.
                 Go to step 2.

2.  Now all the files are in the current drive/directory.  To start the program,
    type "vuimg"  at the DOS prompt and press return.

    You will be placed in the main menu.  Also shown will be a list of files
    in the current directory that have the extension "GIF".  The current display
    mode will be displayed at the bottom left of the screen.  The main menu
    options are displayed at the bottom right of the screen.

    Press "Q" to quit back to DOS.  Go to step 3.

3.  You can execute the program any time by changing to the subdirectory that
    has the program files and typing "vuimg"  as in step 2.  However, it is
    much more convenient to create a "batch file" that will execute the
    program from any directory.  WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO THIS so that you
    can "configure" the program this way to suit your own needs.  You can
    create a batch file by typing

          copy con: v.bat     <return>

    where "v.bat" is the name of the batch file.  Now enter the program
    name along with the drive and directory name.  For example,

          c:\vuimage\vuimg    <return>

    Then press <ctrl>-Z followed by a <return> to finish creating the batch
    file (you can also use an editor to create this file).  Now you can start
    the program by typing "v" and return.  The batch file need not be kept
    in the same subdirectory as the program files.  However, the sub-directory
    that it is kept in must be part of your "PATH".  The PATH is a list of
    directories that DOS will search when you type in a command.  Refer to
    your DOS manual for information on PATH and how to add a sub-directory to
    your PATH.

    After you become familiar with the command line options of the program (see
    later section on command line options), you can re-create the batch file 
    and also specify the command line options that you normally prefer to use.
    This way you can "configure" the program to suit your needs.


MAIN MENU
---------

From the main menu, at the "File(s)" prompt, you can enter:

        - "t" to select the file type - GIF or TIFF

        - "m" to change the display mode

        - "s" to change the scaling options

        - "o" to change other user selectable options

        - "d" to select a different directory/different group of files

        - "q" or ESC to quit and go back to DOS.

        - a list of picture files to be displayed.  For example, enter

                3,1,5-7,17-14  <return>

           to display files 3,1,5,6,7,17,16,15,14 from the list (in that order).

        - One of the arrow keys to select files using the cursor keys.

          In this mode, to display a single file, move the cursor bar to the
          file and press enter.  To display a list of files, move to each file
          and press the space bar to select (mark) the file.  Press enter to
          display the marked files or "/" to continuously repeat the list of
          files.  If there are too many files to fit on one screen, use the
          PgUp/PgDn keys to see other files.

          After moving the cursor to a specific file, you can press the
          "Insert" key to obtain quick information about the file.

	  To get back to the main menu, press the escape key.



SELECTING THE FILE TYPE
-----------------------

The default file type is "GIF".  To select between TIFF and GIF,
press "t" at the main menu prompt.  You can also select the file type from
the command line using the "-T" option (for example, -Ttiff will select TIFF -
see section on command line options).


SETTING THE DISPLAY MODE
------------------------

The program selects a video display mode appropriate for the video adapter
and the picture being displayed automatically.  The mode is chosen from the
CGA/Hercules/EGA/VGA modes present and any modes supported by any extended
mode driver that has been loaded (extended mode drivers are selected by the
command line option "-v" - see section "Display Boards and Extended
Modes/Drivers" for more details on extended modes).  SuperVGA modes are
extended modes.

If the user desires to select a particular video mode to display the picture
instead of the automatically selected mode, this can be done by pressing
"m" at the main menu prompt, going into the display mode menu and changing
the display mode.  An appropriate mode supported by your video display
board may be specified.  If any extended video mode drivers have been
loaded, the extended modes supported by these drivers are also listed.

Instead of using the menu, you can also specify the mode to be used from the
command line by using the "-m" option (for example, "-m7" will use the
EGA 640x350 16-color mode - see section on command line options).

There is also a "BIOS" mode that you can use for extended modes that are
unsupported.  Your display board will need to provide complete BIOS support.
Usually the BIOS mode is extremely slow. 

If you are using a video mode that has only 2 colors, you can use dithering
to improve the displayed picture.  Use the Options menu to select a type
of dithering to be used for 2-color modes.  A suggested dither option for
2-color displays is 3 (3x3).


DISPLAYING PICTURE FILES
------------------------

From the main menu, enter the number of the file you wish to display and
press return.  If you wish to display a sequence of files, you can enter
a set of numbers, separated by commas:

        Example:  3,5 <return> will display file 3 followed by file 5. 

You can enter a starting number and an ending number to display a list of
files:

        Example:  2,5-7 <return> will display files 2, 5, 6 and 7.
        Example:  2,7-5 <return> will display files 2, 7, 6 and 5.

After you enter a list of files (or one file) and press return, the picture(s)
are displayed in sequence.

Alternately, you can press the "up arrow" to select files using the cursor.
To see one file, move the cursor bar to the file and press return.  To
select a list of files, "mark" each file by moving the cursor bar to it
and then pressing space bar.  When you press return, the files will be 
displayed in sequence.


TIMEOUT
-------

Each picture is displayed for a default time of 20 seconds.  Pressing a
return, however, will force the display to end and move on to the next
picture or back to the main menu.  The timeout value can be changed from
the "Options" menu or from the command line using the -t option.

If the "@" key is pressed after drawing the picture on screen, the timeout
is disabled.  In this case the picture will continue to be displayed
until another key is pressed.

If you use a screen grabber program to capture the displayed image and
you are not successful, use of the "@" key may help.

ABORT PICTURE
-------------

Pressing the ESC key while a picture is being drawn aborts that picture.
You can abort a list of pictures by pressing the ESC key twice.


REPEATING LISTS ( CONTINUOUS SLIDE SHOW MODE )
----------------------------------------------

When you enter a list of pictures in the main menu, if you end the list with
the forward slash ("/") instead of a <return>, the list will be continuously
repeated.  To abort this repeated display, press the ESC key twice in quick
succession.


SELECTING THE DISPLAY DIRECTORY
-------------------------------

From the main menu, press "d" to change the display directory (the directory
containing the picture files).  The files in this directory will be listed
when you return to the main menu.

If only a directory name is specified, all files that have an extension
of GIF or TIF (depending on file type selected) in that directory will be
displayed.  If you want to list other files also, enter an appropriate string
to be matched.

Examples:
          To list                                       Enter

all files in the current directory                      *.*<return>

all files with extension GIF in the current directory   *.gif<return>

all files with extension GIF or TIF (depending on       pics<return>
  file type) in the subdirectory "pics" of the
  current directory

all files with extension GIF or TIF (depending on       \picdir<return>
  file type) in the subdirectory "picdir" of the
  root directory

all files in the subdirectory "picdir" of the root      \picdir\*.*<return>
        directory.

You can also set the display directory from the command line using the -d
option.


SCALING OF PICTURES
-------------------

There are many scaling options. The default scaling is 1:1 i.e. no scaling.
You can choose to set the scales manually.  You can also have the program
perform auto-scaling.  The "auto-scale full screen" option makes the picture
"fit" the screen horizontally and vertically.  You can also auto-scale
with the constraint that the horizontal and vertical scales should be equal.

Use the "Scale" menu to change the scaling options.  You can also select
the scaling method from the command line using the -s option.


ZOOMING
-------

Once a picture is displayed on the screen, you can zoom in using the "+" key
and zoom out using the "-" key.


PANNING
-------

Once a picture is displayed on the screen, you can move the viewing window
around the picture by the use of the cursor keypad:

                           (Number lock should be disabled)

        down arrow  (or "d")       move down  half screen (1/8 screen for TIFF)
        right arrow (or "r")       move right half screen (1/8 screen for TIFF)
        up   arrow  (or "u")       move up    half screen (1/8 screen for TIFF)
        left arrow  (or "l")       move left  half screen (1/8 screen for TIFF)
        "End"       (or "1")       move to bottom left corner
        "PgDn"      (or "3")       move to bottom right corner
        "PgUp"      (or "9")       move to top right corner
        "Home"      (or "7")       move to top left corner

                           (Scroll lock should be disabled)

  shift-down  arrow (or "2")       move down  full screen
  shift-right arrow (or "6")       move right full screen
  shift-up    arrow (or "8")       move up    full screen
  shift-left  arrow (or "4")       move left  full screen
 


BRIGHTNESS
----------

Once a picture is displayed on the screen, you can increase the brightness
by pressing the "b" key and reduce the brightness by pressing the "B" key.


INVERTING THE IMAGE
-------------------

Once a picture is displayed on the screen, you can invert the image by
pressing the "i" key.  This is useful for black and white or grayscale
images.  Image inversion can also be set using the "-ii" commandline option.
Available in VUIMAGE PLUS(tm) only.


PRINTING
--------

Once an image is displayed on the screen, you can print that image by
pressing the "p" key.  Before printing, make sure that you have set up
the printer port and selected the correct printer by going into the
Options menu.

The entire image is printed.  Any brightness adjustments you have made
will affect the print output.  The output to 2-color printers (most printers)
can be dithered so as to obtain a better print-out.  You can choose between
no dithering, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5 or 6x6 dithering by going
into the Options menu.  You may wish to experiment with the dithering
options to obtain the best print image.  For fairly high resolution
printers (200x200 dpi or greater), 6x6 or 5x5 is suggested for paint-type
images and scanned images with many shades.  For line art/scanned documents,
eiher no dithering or 2x2 is suggested.

From the Options menu, you can also set the desired size of the print-out.

You can specify "lpt1:","lpt2:","lpt3:","com1:","com2:" or a filename
for the printer port.


TEXT SCREEN COLORS
------------------

You can change the text screen colors used by going into the "Options"
menu and answering "y" when asked "Change Screen Colors ?".
Use the left/right arrow keys to change the foreground color and the
up/down arrow keys to change the background color. (Alternately, you can use
the "f" and "F" keys for foreground and the "b" and "B" keys for background).
Select the colors you like.  Note the numbers shown that corresponds to each
of the colors that you selected - these numbers can be used with the "-cd",
"-co" and the "-cg" command line options to automatically select your
favourite colors when the program is started.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
--------------------

Many of the options may be set from the command line instead going through
a menu.  For example, to start the program with the mode option set to 9
and the scaling option set to 3, enter:

        vuimg  -m9 -s3

The available command line options are listed below:

  -Tfiletype    where filetype is "gif" or "tiff".

                Example:   -Ttiff       (display tiff files)

  -vdrivername  where drivername is the name of the extended mode driver
                appropriate for your board.  If the program files are not in
                the current directory, then the drive and subdirectory must
                also be specified.

                Example (load ATI VGAWonder driver):

                           -vdativ            (program files in current dir)
                           -vc:\vuimage\dativ (program files in c:\vuimage)

  -mmodeindex   where modeindex is the number you would enter if you were
                to go into the "Mode" menu and make a selection.

                Example:   -m9          (set 320x200x256 mode)

  -sscaleindex  where scaleindex is the number you would enter if you were
                to go into the Scale menu (part of the "Options" menu) and
                make a selection.

                Example:   -s3          (set autoscale full screen)

  -sxhscale     where hscale is the horizontal scale value (1% to 999%).
                This option should be used only if manual scaling is selected.

                Example:   -sx200       (set horizontal scale to 200%)

  -syvscale     where vscale is the vertical scale value (1% to 999%).
                This option should be used only if manual scaling is selected.

                Example:   -sy50        (set vertical scale to 50%)

  -ddirectory   where directory is a directory name (or file matching string)
                that you would enter when you go into the Dir menu.

  -bn           disables the beep at the end of the picture

                Example:   -bn          (disable beep)

  -Bbrightness  where brightness is the brightness value (100 is nominal)

                Example:   -B120                (set brightness to 120%)

  -cddircolor   where dircolor is the color number for the filenames 
  -cofncolor          fncolor  is the color number for the file numbers 
  -cmmodcolor         modcolor is the color number for the display mode
  -cggencolor         gencolor is the color number for general text
                To find the color numbers for the colors of your choice, first
                go into the "Options" menu and select the colors that you like.
                The corresponding color numbers are also displayed.

                Example:   -cd78    (filenames in yellow on a red background)
                           -co10    (filenumbers in bright green on black)

                           -cg14    (general text in yellow on black)

(*** The following options are available only in VUIMAGE PLUS(tm) ***)

  -Tpcx         select filetype to be PCX.

  -pprinternum  where printernum is the number you would enter if you were
                to go into the Options menu and choose a printer.

                Example:   -p1      (select EPSON FX80/100 printer)

  -pddevicename where devicename is the printer device (lpt1:, lpt2:, lpt3:,
                com1:, com2: or filename).

                Example:   -pdlpt1:      (send output to lpt1:)
                           -pdvuimg.prn  (send output to file vuimg.prn)

  -fpdithertype where dithertype is the number you would enter if you were to
                go into the Options menu and choose the printer dither type.

                Example:   -fp4     (dither 2-color printers using 4x4 matrix)

  -ii           invert the image (really useful for only black and white or
                grayscale images)

  -C            disables the menus.  If you use this option, you must also
                specify a filename to be displayed including the pathname.
                This should be the last option entered on the command line.
                The filename may contain wild card characters ? and * and 
                should be the last parameter.  Any directory name entered
                with the -d option will be ignored.

                Examples:   -C somefile.gif
                            -C \pics\*.gif

  -L            leave the last image on the screen when the program ends.
                Valid only when the -C option is used.  Useful when called
                as a sub-program by another program.




PRE-PROGRAMMED MODE
-------------------

You can run the program in a PRE-PROGRAMMED mode where it will go through a
display session with no keyboard input.  To do this, go through a manual
session and write down all keystrokes till you quit back to DOS (this is
important).  If you use the ESC key to abort a picture or list,
the return key to move on to the next picture, or the cursor keys to do
panning, do NOT include these keystrokes.  Then create a file containing
these keystrokes (we will use the filename "vuimg.inp" in the following
example).  To do this, type: 

        copy con: vuimg.inp <return>

Enter the keystrokes you wrote down and then type a <CTRL>Z to create the
file called vuimg.inp.  A text editor (ex. edlin) may also be used to
create such a file (start a new line for every "return" key).  This file
may then be used to run the program in the PRE-PROGRAMMED mode by typing

       vuimg  < vuimg.inp


DOS EXIT CODES (ERRORLEVEL)
---------------------------

The return codes generated by the program that may be tested in a batch
file are:

0 - no error
1 - command line option error
2 - the -C option was used without specifying a file
3 - file not found or invalid filename




DISPLAY BOARDS and EXTENDED VIDEO MODES/DRIVERS
-----------------------------------------------

If the program does not work with your display board, try loading any software
drivers (BIOS emulators, int 10h drivers, RAM BIOS drivers) that come with it.
Refer to the instructions that come with your graphics board.

Some video display boards support even higher resolutions than standard VGA,
for example, 640x480 in 256 colors and 800x600 in 16 colors.  These are
sometimes referred to as SuperVGA modes.  Additional drivers that support
these "extended modes" are included with the program.  These drivers have
filenames with the extension ".VDR" and are listed later in this section.
They can be loaded using the "-v" command line option (see section on command
line options).

Typically, extended modes are dependent on your type of graphics card.
Refer to your graphics card manual to see what extended modes are supported.
Only VGA type extended modes with either 16 or 256 colors out of a palette
of 262,144 colors are supported by the extended mode drivers.  Check the
list of extended mode drivers at the end of this section to see which driver
is suitable for use with your card.

However, there is a SuperVGA standard known as the VESA SuperVGA standard.
Many or most of the SuperVGA cards now support this standard.  If your
card supports this standard, then you can take advantage of the VESA driver
(DVESA.VDR) that comes with the program.  Even if there is a separate driver
that supports your card, WE RECOMMEND that you use the VESA driver instead
if your card supports the VESA standard.  In order for your card to support
the VESA standard, you may need to load a device driver or TSR that comes
with your card (through the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file).  Refer to the
documentation that comes with your card (in printed form or disk file form).

If you are not using any extended drivers, you may still be able to display
in an extended mode if your BIOS for the board will support this.  Not all
boards come with BIOS that support the extended modes completely.  Installing
any RAM BIOS drivers that come with your board may help.  Display done
through the BIOS is usually extremely slow.

To use the BIOS supported extended modes, you need to know the mode number,
the no. of columns, the no. of rows, and the no. of colors for the mode.
Refer to the manual for your graphics card.

If you have a plain VGA card with no SuperVGA modes, you may still be able
to get higher resolutions (320x400x256, 360x480x256, 800x600x16) using the
DNVGA driver.
