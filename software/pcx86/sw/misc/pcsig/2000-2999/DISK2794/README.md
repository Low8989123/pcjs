Disk No: 2794
Disk Title: XDOS+
PC-SIG Version: S1

Program Title: XDos+
Author Version: 14.22
Author Registration: $35.00
Special Requirements: No special requirements

Introducing XDOS, a new integrated package which takes care of all your
filing, text editing, and file transfer needs. Not only does XDOS
provide all the usual DOS shell commands, (copy, delete, rename files
etc.), but XDOS has a built in text editor and fast file transfer
functions as well. This is achieved in a single package which is based
on the intuitive principle of select-and-do. Simply move the highlight
bar to the file or directory you want to work with, and select the
command from the menu. XDOS also sports a complete mouse user interface
which makes it a very easy programme to work with and also one of the
few mouse drivable shareware programmes available.  Some help screens
are also provided to make life easy.

Like XTree-Gold, XDOS gives you a display of the working directory,
sorted and formatted as required. XDOS will sort by name, extension,
size, and age.  When sorting by age, the listing starts with the newest
file rather than the oldest, which is probably more useful as the newer
files are the ones that are currently being worked on. The files are
displayed in either two, three, or five columns, depending on the amount
of information the operator asks for.  The registered version of XDOS
allows you to work with the extra lines available on some displays, and
allows you to adjust the colours.

In conclusion, XDOS is a powerful tool that must be considered as an
alternative to spending hours each day battling with DOS and is a cost
effective alternative to comercial programmes. Packed with features,
XDOS is well worth a good look.
