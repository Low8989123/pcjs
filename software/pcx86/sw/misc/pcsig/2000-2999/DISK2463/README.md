## Information about "KATIE'S CLOCK AND REMEDIES"

    Teaching children to tell time from an analog (standard old time) clock
    can try the patience of most parents. That was before KATIE'S CLOCK was
    developed.
    
    KATIE'S CLOCK displays a giant analog clock on your computer screen. As
    the dial changes position, you can quiz your child orally or have
    him/her enter the time digitally into the computer. During the testing,
    you can set the dials to move randomly or increment every five minutes.
    You can also test by inputting the time digitally and having the clock
    dials display the proper time. This program is a breeze to use and
    you'll be teaching time -- in no time!
    
    Whether you have a sore throat, colic, cramps, gas, a headache, or a
    hangover, REMEDIES has some down-home ways to make you feel better.
    REMEDIES is not meant to replace a doctor, but it does offer some
    healthy natural advice for many common ailments.  Select a listed
    ailment and REMEDIES recommends herbal cures.  Select a listed herb and
    REMEDIES will tell you what it cures.  Over 60 herbs and 60 ailments
    listed.  By the way, what are licorice and ginseng good for?

   PROGRAM OVERVIEW

   Katie's Clock (KC) is a tool to help parents teach their children how to
   tell the time of day from conventional analogue clocks. Although a computer
   literate child can easily learn how to use KC we recommend that a parent be
   present, at least in the beginning, to ensure that the child doesn't get
   discouraged.  Parental feedback is important in all learning situations.

   I you have VGA display KC will be displayed in the VGA mode. Likewise, if
   you have EGA display KC will be diplayed in the EGA mode. If you have VGA
   but want the display in EGA press F9 at the introductory screen. The only
   advantage to this is a faster screen response for slower machines.

   KC can be used in several different ways:

   CLOCK: In this mode the actual time will be displayed (if your computers'
   internal clock is set properly - refer to your DOS manual). This is the way
   in which the clock portion of the program begins. To get back TO this mode
   FROM any other mode press the F5 key.

   RANDOM: This mode, invoked by the F2 key, causes the clock to display
   various times, randomly, by pressing the Space Bar or the Enter key.

   INPUT: Invoked by the F3 key, this mode allows you to input a time in order
   to tell what it looks like on a clock face. Enter the Hour, a comma, then
   the Minutes. Use the backspace key to make corrections.

   SEQUENTIAL: Invoked by the F4 key, this mode starts the clock at 12:00 and
   allows you to increment the time by 5 minutes each time you press the Space
   Bar or Enter key.

   DIGITAL DISPLAY: The F1 key toggles (turns on or off) a digital display of
   the time and a statement of the time such as {15 minutes after 3}. This
   feature is available in any mode.

   REGISTERED USERS: Feel free to write if you have questions or suggestions to
   improve the program (be sure to send registration number with letter).

   HARDWARE/SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: Version 1.10 requires a color VGA or EGA
   monitor, and DOS 2.11 or greater. Version 1.20 (due out in October, 1990)
   will work with CGA monitors.

   REGISTRATION: By registering (only $12 postpaid) you'll not only fulfill
   your legal and ethical obligations but you'll also receive:

    1)  a floppy disk with the latest registered version of Katie's Clock;
    2)  another TZK program (shareware version) of your choice (see below);

   PROGRAM OVERVIEW

   Katie's Clock (KC) is a tool to help parents teach their children how to
   tell the time of day from conventional analogue clocks. Although a computer
   literate child can easily learn how to use KC we recommend that a parent be
   present, at least in the beginning, to ensure that the child doesn't get
   discouraged.  Parental feedback is important in all learning situations.

   I you have VGA display KC will be displayed in the VGA mode. Likewise, if
   you have EGA display KC will be diplayed in the EGA mode. If you have VGA
   but want the display in EGA press F9 at the introductory screen. The only
   advantage to this is a faster screen response for slower machines.

   KC can be used in several different ways:

   CLOCK: In this mode the actual time will be displayed (if your computers'
   internal clock is set properly - refer to your DOS manual). This is the way
   in which the clock portion of the program begins. To get back TO this mode
   FROM any other mode press the F5 key.

   RANDOM: This mode, invoked by the F2 key, causes the clock to display
   various times, randomly, by pressing the Space Bar or the Enter key.

   INPUT: Invoked by the F3 key, this mode allows you to input a time in order
   to tell what it looks like on a clock face. Enter the Hour, a comma, then
   the Minutes. Use the backspace key to make corrections.

   SEQUENTIAL: Invoked by the F4 key, this mode starts the clock at 12:00 and
   allows you to increment the time by 5 minutes each time you press the Space
   Bar or Enter key.

   DIGITAL DISPLAY: The F1 key toggles (turns on or off) a digital display of
   the time and a statement of the time such as {15 minutes after 3}. This
   feature is available in any mode.

   REGISTERED USERS: Feel free to write if you have questions or suggestions to
   improve the program (be sure to send registration number with letter).

   HARDWARE/SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: Version 1.10 requires a color VGA or EGA
   monitor, and DOS 2.11 or greater. Version 1.20 (due out in October, 1990)
   will work with CGA monitors.
