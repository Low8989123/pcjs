This may well be the greatest collection of software ever compiled.

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM is our premier collection of the entire
PC-SIG library.  Every shareware program we have is on one disc; over
700 megabytes of software you can have immediate access to.

Easy to use, all you have to do is insert the disc and type 'GO' at the
DOS prompt.  We've included all the tools you need for fast easy access
to the programs and their descriptions.

The WordCruncher text retrieval software allows you to quickly access
the description for any program you want.  All the programs are indexed
by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word within the
program description.  There couldn't be an easier way to find just the
right program.

The Narc utility, newly instituted with the tenth edition, allows you to
look directly at all the compressed program files on the CD without
having to download the program to your hard disk.  So if you want to
look at the programmer's notes or on-line documentation before using
valuable hard disk space, you can.

The PC-SIG Encyclopedia of Shareware is included on the disk, and a
printed copy of the book is included so you can peruse the available
programs from the comfort of your favorite chair.  All the programs are
logically divided into one-hundred twenty categories making it easier to
find just the right software.

Whether you're interested in Accounting or Windows, there's a shareware
program for you on the PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM.

Finally, 368 of the most useful, popular, important shareware programs
have been put together on one CD. No matter what your need, it's on The
Essential Home & Business Collection.  Everything from Administration to
Windows software is here.

The Essential CD incorporates the WordCruncher text retrieval system.
Every program on the disc is indexed

by title, filename, PC-SIG disk number, and every word in the program
description.  A new utility, Narc, is implemented so you can look at the
program files and the author's on-line documentation without having to
first copy the program to your hard disk.  By using WordCruncher and
Narc, you can quickly find the program you want and review it to be
sure, without ever having to run it from your hard disk.

If you've got a CD-ROM player at home and want to get more use of it and
your computer, or if you're trying to avoid purchasing another Nintendo
cartridge, or if you just enjoy looking at new software, you need The
Essential Home & Business Collection.

Special Requirements: 512K RAM, VGA, a mouse, and a hard drive.         
                                                                        
IMPROCES is a VGA image processor.  It lets you load your favorite .GIF,
.PCX, or .PRF images and process them in VGA and Super VGA mode. Process
doesn't really mean edit (though editing is part of it).  Instead,      
IMPROCES has a number of features that let you improve the appearance of
your images.                                                            
                                                                        
To start, IMPROCES lets you modify images with tools common to paint or 
drawing programs.  It provides line drawing, area fills, spray cans,    
paint brushes, and cut-and-paste features.  It also includes fat-bit    
editing, which blows up an area and lets you edit the individual pixels.
You can select a font (five included) and add text to an image. IMPROCES
lets you control the colors and create custom color palettes.           
                                                                        
One of the more interesting paint features is the ability to flip or    
rotate areas of the image, create mirror images, adding fractal         
graphics, and 3-D terrain fractals to your images. Color images can be  
converted to gray-scale images and halftones can be produced for any    
image a great tool to compliment your desktop publishing.  TGA files can
be imported and saved as GIF or PCX formats.                            
                                                                        
The image processing really comes to play on gray-scale images. IMPROCES
uses histograms to display statistical properties of images. Histograms 
are bar graph displays that present information that can be used to     
enhance your images.  Routines are included to enhance, contract, and   
sharpen images.  It also has a number of special effects like color     
reverse, image melt, image replicate, and even an effect that turns your
image into an oil painting.                                             
                                                                        
IMPROCES uses convenient pull-down menus to access its well- conceived  
features.  However, this is not a trivial program you can walk through  
your first time.  New users should expect to spend some time with the   
manuals. And while the documentation does explain the basics of image   
processing, you should either have some knowledge of graphics or be     
prepared to get it from some outside source.                            
                                                                        
IMPROCES has the features necessary to do some high-powered image       
editing (processing), but with a registration fee low enough that anyone
can afford to explore the world of high-tech graphics.                  
                                                                        
IMPROCES supports VGA modes from 320x200x256 to 1024x768x256 on Ahead,  
ATI, Chips & Technology, Everex, Paradise, Trident, Tseng, Video7, or   
any card with VESA compatibility.

         IMPROCES(C). Copyright John Wagner 1991. All rights reserved.

Since version 3.1 and version 3.0 of IMPROCES are so close together,
I'll keep the newstuff for version 3.0 in here as well. Version 3.1 is a
couple of bug fixes, two minor, one major - athough nothing really got
fixed on it, one new function and support for another SVGA card.

Minor bug 1:
This bug will not cause any damage nor will it crash the program. In
fact, if you only use one drive for your image files, you may never
notice the problem.

Here it is:
After you load an image, clipfile, .MAP or .PAL file, the program will
change back to that drive/directory next time you tried to load the same
type of file, even if you had changed to a different drive.

EXAMPLE OF BUG:

Start IMPROCES in the C:\IMPROCES directory.
Load JOAN.GIF in current directory.
Change logged drive.
Try to load new GIF from new drive, IMPROCES will change the drive back to
drive C: and change the directory back to C:\IMPROCES.

The first drive/directory you load a file from will be the only
drive/directory that you can load each type of file from. This is only
effective for each time the program is run.

Why? I added this as a feature. One of my beta testers pointed out that
this was a problem when using multiple drives. I took it out. It's not
there. The only problem is, I didn't copy the updated .EXE file to my
release directory. Oops. Sorry!

Minor bug 2:
The virtual screen function that checked if you had enough drive space
would report that you didn't if your TEMP or TMP variable started
with a lowercase drive letter. Fixed.

Major Bug:
Some SVGA cards have not been very kind to IMPROCES. Ever since version
1.0 that is. Why? Mouse drivers, yes you heard it hear first. I went to
the local computer store, had 'em run IMPROCES on a 1 MB, Tseng ET4000
VGA card. Didn't work. I BOUGHT the card and took it home. Put the card
in my machine, ran the program, ran FINE. No problems, every mode
supported.

Why? Mouse drivers. Registered user Rick Berkheimer from Salem Oregon
has generously taken the time to trouble shoot the problem. Changing the
mouse driver fixed it for Rick, he now runs IMPROCES on his ET4000 board
just fine, a happy customer. He switched from his latest Mouse Sytems
drivers to a driver from another company, I think it was Microsoft. I use
a Logitech Serial Mouse, with a Logitech driver and have never had
a problem. All other users that have switched their mouse drivers to
updated ones have cured what ales them.

I can't fix what I can't duplicate. I traded the card in for 4 megs of
RAM. I called Jordan Hargrave, the author of SVGA256.BGI driver, he owns
an ET4000 board, SpeedStar or something like that, runs fine on it. If
you can't run IMPROCES on your SVGA board, I'm sorry, I've spent a lot
of time and money to try to fix it and I can't. I suggest you get a
different mouse driver. If you write to me with a problem on with your
SVGA card, or call, you will probably get this same answer. I'm sorry,
thats the line I'm taking! Try a different mouse driver, you'll be
pleasently surprised when IMPROCE works fine, you just got to love
those higher video modes!

New command line switch:
As a fix for the mouse driver problem, you may now use the -MC (mouse
compatibilty) command line switch. This should fix your problem, but
might cause your mouse to update on every other pixel in the higher
video modes.

To use this switch, start IMPROCES with:    IMPROCES -MC

If this doesn't do it, you will need to change your mouse stuff.

Support for Trident 9000:
Boards based on the Trident 9000 chipset are now supported as well as
boards based on the 8800 and 8900. 9000 based boards will go up to
800x600x256 with 512K of Video Memory. Thanks to registered user, Dale
Combrink of ALPHA-OMEGA electronics in Idabel, Oklahoma for _sending_ me
a Trident 9000 based vga card to work with.

New function:
New in the TOOLS section is Siner. Siner is a function that uses the sin
and cos of a changing angle to make a neat display. It works best when
you choose .003 for the increment and use the default palette.

No longer using GIF_LIB:
Transparent to the user is the GIF library I was using called GIF_LIB. I
used GIF_LIB through an agreement with it's author Gershon Elber. I have
written my own GIF encoder/decoder and am no longer using GIF_LIB. No
problems with GIF_LIB, it is a great library and widely available on
BBS's, I highly recomend it to anyone interested in writing programs
that use the GIF format.

Sped up the True Color Targa stuff a little using assembly language.

Thats about it. Another .0 release down the tubes. I'm a little
depressed about the mouse driver causing so many problems. Downloads of
IMPROCES have been happening at an all time high. This is good! I would
like to thank everyone for sticking with me. I do believe IMPROCES is a
great program, I certainly have enjoyed writing it. It has come a very,
very long way since version 1.0, and to that I owe the support of the
users who have registered so far. Thank you.

Heres the new stuff for version 3.0:
Well, we are moving along here with this latest version. Version 3.0 of
IMPROCES incorporates some some really exciting stuff. Here is a
rundown:

* True Color Targa!:
Uncompressed, True Color Targa Files (such as those produced with DKB
Trace) can now be loaded and processed by IMPROCES. Custom color
reduction is performed on these image while they are being loaded to
reduce the possible 16 million colors to 256 colors. All this while
preserving the original appearance of the image.

* Virtual Images!:
IMPROCES now includes a Virtual Video Mode so that images up to
2048x2048 pixels can be loaded and edited in video mode 320x200 while
panning around the image, like you would edit a document in a word
processor.

* Best Fit Palette!:
When images or clipfiles are avereraged together, you can now best fit
the palette so that the image will preserve its intended appearance.
You can choose between the incoming palette, the current palette, or
a split palette.

* True Color Averaging!:
When images and clipfiles are averaged, IMPROCES will now search the
palette for the best color for the averaged pixel instead of just using
the color look up value. This way full color images can now be averaged
without degradation.

* The Jiggler!:
Define up to five areas on your image and then IMPROCES will set them in
motion. using this you make peoples hands, mouths and other parts move.
Warning: This feature is a time waster, you'll be loading up all of your
old people pictures just to see what they will look like!

As before, IMPROCES supports video modes up to 1024x768x256 on most SVGA
cards and video mode 320x200x256 on all VGA systems. A small bug in
versions 2.2 through 2.6 has been fixed and the program should support
all of the modes on the Tseng ET4000 chipset. IMPROCES supports GIF,
PCX, TGA and the Pixel Run Format from the Fastgraf Graphics library
from Ted Gruber Software.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.


To Order, in the U.S.A.: Call 800-245-6717 and ask Customer Service.
