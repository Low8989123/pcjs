## Information about "TELEMATE 3 OF 3 (2341, 2342 ALSO)"

    TELEMATE is a full-featured and flexible communication program with an
    easy-to-learn and easy-to-use integrated environment.  With TELEMATE,
    you don't need to use a separate editor, viewer and mouse driver for
    smooth communications.  All these features are built-in and are
    accessible through the menus and windows.
    
    TELEMATE has built-in multitasking features.  While dialing or
    downloading, you can prepare messages, view files, scroll back to the
    last connection.  Or you can have all of them at the same time, each
    running in its own window.
    
    The editor allows you to prepare your messages, edit documents or type
    letters.  And the viewer can display files as references without
    influencing the editor.  The very large back scroll buffer works just
    like an editor, allowing you to save parts of the content to files,
    find text and even quote a message.
    
    Through the clipboard, you can cut and paste text between windows.
    Prepare a message in the editor and then copy and paste it to the
    terminal.
    
    TELEMATE has the most popular protocols built-in, including Zmodem,
    Ymodem-G, SEAlink and CompuServe QuickB.  There are four slots for
    external protocols.
    
    Easy-to-learn Script Language makes writing a TELEMATE script program
    as simple as writing a BASIC program.  No programming experience? Don't
    worry.  The Learn Script Mode can generate script files for you.
    
    Without any additional hardware, TELEMATE lets you select a screen
    height from 25 to 32 lines on your normal CGA adapter as well as 7
    choices of screen height on an EGA or VGA adapter.  TELEMATE accesses
    expanded memory, extended memory and EGA/VGA video RAM as virtual
    memory to store data.
