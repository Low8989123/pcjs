                       WELCOME TO GRIN GRAPHICS VOLUME #1                       
                                                                  
   All Grin Graphics clip art is compressed into self extracting zip-files.
The easiest way to get going is to copy the "*.EXE" file from this disk to
the directory on your hard drive where you wish to keep your art. 
 
Example:  COPY A:\PCX1.EXE C:\CLIPART

Go to the clipart directory on your hard disk and type the first letters
of the "*.EXE" file:

Example for PCX1.EXE;    TYPE    "PCX1"  then press ENTER 

The file will automatically decompress into seperate clip art images. Make sure
you have plenty of room on your hard drive, some of these are really monsters.

After the files are decompressed erase the Grin Gaphics "EXE" file from your
hard drive and put away your floppy in a safe place. You never know when
you might need to do this again.

To get a copy of our invoice for registration type: COPY INVOICE.DOC PRN
Press ENTER and your printer will print it out.
