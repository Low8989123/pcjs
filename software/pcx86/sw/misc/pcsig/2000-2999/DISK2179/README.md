## Information about "SALES COMMISSION TRACKER"

    Quit wondering how your sales people are doing in the field and what you
    owe them in commission.  SCT lets a company or organization
    track commissions due the sales staff in an orderly manner.
    
    SCT is easy to use and set up.  It assumes you're familiar with its
    terms and doesn't define them.
    
    The function keys shouldn't be used.  If they are, strange things pop up
    that need to be erased.  Those familiar with dBASE, dBXL, or
    FoxBase instantly recognize the keys are defined for database work. SCT
    does not use them and neither should you.
    
    When the manual is expanded to define program terms and when the
    program is revised to accept rates with at least two decimal points,
    this will be a good program to use.

PC-SIG Version: S1                                                      
                                                                        
Program Title: Sales Commission Tracker                                 
Author Version: 1.0

Special Requirements: 512K RAM, and a hard disk.                        
                                                                        
If you have wanted a way to keep track of the commissions that you      
are due or that you need to pay your sales people, then SCT may be      
your program.  SCT allows a company to track commissions due to sales   
staff in an orderly manner.  Such a program can be a time saver.        
                                                                        
SCT is easy to use, to set up, and to print its reports.  And, only     
two small areas stand in its way of being a very good program.  The     
first concerns the technical terms used in the program.  SCT assumes    
that you will be familiar with its terms and does not define them.      
In addition, there is no on-line help to assist in this or any other    
matter.  One of these other matters is the use of the function keys.    
The function keys should not be used.  If they are, strange things      
pop up that will need to be erased.  Those familiar with dBASE, dBXL,   
or FoxBase will instantly recognize that the keys are defined for       
database work.  SCT does not use them and neither should you.           
                                                                        
When the manual is expanded to define program terms and when the        
program is revised to accept rates with at least two decimal points,    
this will be a good program to use.

        The minimum system required to operate SCT is:         
                                                               
          a.  Computer with MS- or PC-DOS                      
                                                               
          b.  512K RAM                                         
                                                               
          c.  Hard disk and 5.25" floppy disk drive    
                                                               
          d.  Printer                                          
        
        Note: SCT may be operated on a dual floppy system provided one 
        of the floppy drives is high capacity (720KB or greater) to 
        hold the SCT programs.
                                                               

        1.3  Disk Contents                                             
                                                                       
        SCT is supplied in archived file on a 360KB floppy disk.  
        AINSTALL.BAT is the program that installs SCT on your hard 
        disk in a directory named SCT.  This program also places 
        SCT.BAT in the root directory of your hard disk enabling one 
        to start using the Argonaut Systems Advertising Response 
        Manager by typing SCT while in the root directory.      
                                                 

        2.0  INSTALLATION                        
                                                 
        You need the CONFIG.SYS file on the boot disk to properly run 
        SCT.  If CONFIG.SYS already exists on your disk, modify the 
        file by adding the following lines using your word processing 
        program or EDLIN:                             
                         
                                   FILES = 24      
                                   BUFFERS = 24    
                                                   
        If CONFIG.SYS does not exist on your boot disk you may copy it 
        from SCT disk   Place disk into drive A.  Select drive A by 
        typing:                            
                    
                                   >A: [Enter]  
                                                
        Follow this by typing:                  
                                                
                          A>COPY CONFIG.SYS C:\ [Enter]
                                                       
        Where C:\ represents the root directory of the disk to which 
        you wish to copy SCT.  If the disk is not C, change the letter 
        to the appropriate one.                               
        




                                       2

                
        Begin installation of SCT with the disk in drive A and type:                
                    
                               A>AINSTALL C: [Enter]   
                                                       
        This operation will install SCT on your disk.  If the 
        designation of your drive is not "C:", you must type the 
        appropriate drive letter.      
                                       
        SCT will be installed in a directory called SCT.  SCT.BAT will 
        be in the root directory of drive C.  Use SCT by selecting 
        drive C and typing:     
                                
                                  C>SCT [Enter]   
                                                  
        3.0  GETTING STARTED                      
                                                  
        After typing SCT [Enter] to start SCT the initial SCT menu 
        will be displayed on the monitor.  This menu will reappear 
        after each function is completed.  Select a function by 
        pressing the letter preceding each function in the menu or by 
        moving the arrow keys to  highlight the desired function and 
        pressing Enter.  This same technique is used for selections in 
        all menus within SCT.  Areas that require operator entry are 
        highlighted.  Most messages (instructions, notes, etc.) appear 
        at the bottom of the monitor screen.  If you have a color 
        adapter (CGA or EGA) and a color monitor SCT will display in 
        color.    
                
        Setup should be entered prior to proceeding with other SCT 
        functions since this data is used in some of the other 
        functions.                                    
             
        Observe case of typed entries when searching for files, e.g., 
        a search for "Joe" will not be successful if you type "JOE".  
        The complete word is not necessary for a search, e.g., "Joe" 
        would be found if you typed "J" as well as  all other names 
        that begin with "J" in the file.                                
             

        4.0  ENTERING SETUP DATA   
                                   
        Press A when the initial SCT menu is displayed on the monitor

        Input your company or organization name.  Input the first month 
        of your fiscal year, e.g., if your fiscal year begins April 1 
        you would enter 4.  If you are limited for space on your hard 
        disk it is recommended that you store history files on floppy 
        disks, i.e., press A or B in response to the "Disk drive 
        letter..." heading.   
                                                                                
                                                                                
        4.1.1  Clear All Files
                                                                                
        If you wish to begin SCT from scratch after data has been 
        entered you may erase all data from every file by responding 
        with a Y to the following screen prompt: 
                                                                                
        Clear all files? Y,N
                                                                                
        If you pressed Y in error you have one more opportunity to avoid 
        erasing your files.  A warning message, "ALL DATA CONTAINED IN 
        THE FILES WILL BE ERASED", is followed by "Proceed? Y,N".  Press 
        Y to erase the files.               
                                                                                
        After your last entry the program returns to the Setup menu.

        The first prompt after pressing A is a request for a purchase 
        order number.  If you do not enter a purchase order prior to 
        pressing Enter the screen prompt will be:

        A request for order date, customer, buyer, principal, sales 
        order number and salesperson will follow the purchase order 
        number.
                                                                                
        You may enter items from the sales order until you press Enter 
        with no product typed.  Each item requires a product name or 
        description.  This entry is followed by requests for quantity, 
        price, commission rates.  Separate commission rates may be 
        entered for each item if required.  The default commission rates 
        will be those entered in the "Setup" principal database.
                                                                                
        The routine requests a shipping schedule consisting of a ship 
        date and quantity for each item.  The shipping routine will be 
        exited when Enter is pressed with no quantity entered.  After 
        the shipping schedule is completed you may edit the sales order 
        input.  Finally the Data Entry menu is redisplayed.

        Input a sales order number after pressing B.  SCT will search 
        the sales order file for this number.  If the corresponding 
        sales order is not found the following message appears:
