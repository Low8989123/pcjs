ANCIENTS I: THE DEATHWATCH is a fantasy role playing game with excellent
VGA graphics, similar to the games like EYE OF BEHOLDER and BARD'S TALE.
You can create and save your own characters.  There are four classes and
three races (elf, dwarf, human), as well as several face portraits (both
male and female) for displaying your character on the screen.  The game 
a three dimensional viewing screen for exploring the town and the dungeo
as well as a dialogue box for encountering other characters or special  
areas of the town and dungeon.  The town has an inn, an equipment shop, 
guild, a temple, and a casino.  All commands are performed by clicking t
mouse on one of several screen icons or on a particular line of text in 
dialogue box - rarely will you ever need to touch the keyboard.         
                                                                        
Weaponry, armor and the inventory of each character can be displayed and
manipulated on the screen using the mouse.  In combat the monsters are  
displayed on the screen, and each character can attack, defend, use an  
item, cast a spell, or flee.  Only magicians and friars can opt to cast 
spells.  In the game your party of characters will be set on various    
missions, and clues will be given on the way.  Games can be saved and th
restored at a later date.
