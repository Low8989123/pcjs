Disk Title: JOB COST  2 of 2  (also #1230)                              
PC-SIG Version: S1.4                                                    
                                                                        
Program Title: Job Cost                                                 
Author Version: 1.14                                                    
Author Registration: $45.00                                             
Special Requirements: 640K RAM, a hard disk, and a printer.             
                                                                        
JOB COST was made for the person who is responsible for monitoring and  
keeping costs under control on complex, expensive projects.             
                                                                        
With this system you can:                                               
                                                                        
~ Set up multiple jobs each with its own unique set of cost centers     
~ Establish budget controls for each cost center for labor, material,   
and other expenses                                                      
                                                                        
~ Edit and post transaction cost items to each cost center              
                                                                        
~ Post estimates of percent completions for each budget item            
                                                                        
~ Set up budgets for up to 99 unique change orders per job              
                                                                        
JOB COST then provides you with cost variances, projected profit/loss at
the detail budget level, cost center level, and total job. As expenses  
are posted, the overall job status is updated keeping you informed of   
balance of funds available and projected profit/loss for the job's      
original estimate and change orders. You are provided concise reports   
for distribution to your client, foreman, and sub-contractors.          
                                                                        
At the end of the job, after all reporting has been performed, you can  
back up the completed job to a floppy disk for storage, delete the job  
from your active job database, and if necessary restore the job from    
backup for recording additional cost information after job was          
completed. New jobs can be set up from existing job formats, requiring  
only the entering of the new job's unique budget information.           
                                                                        
All functions are menu driven with on-screen help.
