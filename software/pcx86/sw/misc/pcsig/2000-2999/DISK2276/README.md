## Information about "DINO PICTURE DATABASE & MEMOR-E"

    If you like dinosaurs, then you'll love the DINO DATABASE.  DINO tells
    you the common and scientific names of a dinosaur and lists other
    dinosaurs in the same family.  A world map graphically displays their
    habitats and the years they lived.
    
    Kids will like the option to "paint" the dinosaurs and change the
    screen colors. A function to print the screen is also available.  This
    program makes it fun and entertaining for kids or adults who want to
    learn about dinosaurs.
    
    A computer version of "Concentration." Match 18 pairs of pictures in
    a 36-square grid. Get on-line Help, hints, or even where all the pairs
    reside. The game can be played by one player against the clock, or by
    up to four players.
