## Information about "TYPESETTER PC 1 OF 2 (ALSO 2168)"

    A single page desktop publishing program that lets you mix text and
    graphics anywhere on the page in a WYSIWYG environment. An unlimited
    number of fonts sizes and styles can be mixed on the page. TYPESETTER
    PC is also a full-featured drawing program, including functions such as
    pencil draw, line draw, k-line, circles, rectangles, rounded
    rectangles, polygons, fills, splines, fat bits, and more.
    
    With TYPESETTER PC, you can import ASCII files to use in your
    newsletter or flyer. Graphics from other programs such as Dr. Halo and
    PC-Paintbrush can also be imported. A utility (CBEAM) allows screen
    capture from other programs on CGA systems.
    
    The Near Laser Quality output to 9-pin dot matrix printers is
    a key feature. Because TYPESETTER PC literally draws all text and
    graphics to the design page, the user can control every pixel on the
    page with either a mouse or the keyboard.
