```
Disk No: 2874
Disk Title: Show Talk
PC-SIG Version: S1.0

Program Title: Show Talk
Author Version: 1.3
Author Registration: $15.00
Special Requirements: 512K RAM and graphic monitor. EGA/VGA and hard
                      drive recommended.

Did you ever see the candid camera show where there is a guy hiding in
the mail box talking to people as they walk by? Well, that is what this
program is. It is intended to be used to attract people to the computer.

SHOW TALK will draw fancy collages and about every 30 seconds it will
say catch phrases (in real human speech), to try and catch the person's
attention. Some of the phrases are:  Hello, is there anyone out there?
Hey there, good looking (female voice); Hey you over there, come on over
here; Please get me out of here; Try pressing a key; and many more. When
the person presses a keyboard key, SHOW TALK will say a joke or sing a
song or play Name That Tune. This is a great customer catcher for your
next show. You can also use this in a retail store or to play jokes on
your friends.  Try it, it really works!!
