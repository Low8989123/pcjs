Other Ideas:
     College  student  class  schedule;
     Softball league play;
     Managers could keep daily commitments in separate calendars,
          so  that a  meeting can be scheduled  by looking at the
          attenders schedules of availability;
     Nightly  banking  computer  runs  could  be  separated    by
          checking,  savings,  mortgage  processing  so that each
          department   could  view  the  schedule  kept  in  data
          processing;
        Schedule  of auto maintenance  to keep  track  of  when  oil
             changes are needed or when they were done;
        Family  doctor  and dentist appointments;
        History of employees absenteeism, comp days, etc.;     
        And on and on.................

--------------------------------------------------------------------

C. NETWORK CONSIDERATIONS

    If  you  run  CALENDAR  WISE on a network,  you will encounter a
warning screen when attempting to  edit a calendar that is currently
opened for update by another user.   You may open  the  calendar  in
view-only  mode.    If  you  open  the calendar for updating,  it is
possible that all changes someone  else  is currently making will be
lost or all changes that you make will be lost.    It  simply  is  a
matter  of  whomever  saves  their calendar last,  erases the others
changes.   This same warning can appear in a single user environment
(i.e.  if the calendar file is open and power is lost, or some other
reason causes the calendar file to not be closed properly).   Simply
choose "OVERRIDE FOR UPDATING"  to  circumvent the warning and reset
the file status.

D. OTHER TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS

1.  The CALENDAR WISE executable file "CW.EXE" must be executed from
the current  directory.   If  you did  not execute  CW.EXE  from the
current directory, CALENDAR WISE  will tell you so, and not continue
to run.  To run CW.EXE,  change to  the directory that you installed
it into(for example. "CD \CWISE"),  and then execute CW.EXE.  If you
are using a menu program to execute CALENDAR WISE,you must set it up
appropriately.  Normally this is done by specifying the path(\CWISE)
separately  from the command  line (CW.EXE)  in  the  menu  program.
(i.e.  When then command line is specified as C:\CWISE\CW.EXE,  most
menu programs will  not change  to the \CWISE directory,  and CW.EXE
will not run then, because you are not in the correct directory)

2.  CALENDAR WISE uses a  portion of unused  video memory to quickly
swap menus onto the screen.  Task switchers such as the one included
in  DOS 5.0 or  Windows 3.1 capture the video display image and then
restore it upon returning to  the application.   They do not however
restore the extra memory on the video card which has critical infor-
mation  for CALENDAR WISE  screen  manipulation.   Upon returning to
CALENDAR WISE in these task switcher environments,  CALENDAR WISE
will automatically sense the corrupted memory, momentarily blank the
screen to refresh the lost info,  and then instantaneously allow you
to continue.

====================================================================
II: USER INFORMATION
====================================================================

A. CALENDAR LIST

     Touch any key while on the opening screen and the calendar list
will  appear.    100  different calendars are available,  10 on each
page.   Calendars can be selected and unselected for menu operations
such as move, delete, or merge. Multiple calendars can be marked<F2>
to view simultaneously.  A  demo can be run showing  various  sample
calendars<F10> after the calendar list appears.

   Escape      - Main Menu
   Enter       - View calendar(s).


F2  -  Marking calendars for viewing.

     This function allows you to view multiple calendars at the same
time.   By pressing F2,  an asterisk will appear to the left of  the
selected calendar's name.  Any number of calendars can be chosen for
viewing  and printing simultaneously.   The Enter key also chooses a
calendar to view,  so remember  that  this calendar will also appear
if the selection box is not on a previously marked calendar.   Also,
while viewing multiple calendars,  no  editing may  be done  to the
calendars  chosen.   "Multiple Calendars"  will appear at the top of
the calendar when multiples have  been chosen.   This feature can be
extremely handy to determine  multiple  managers  availability  when
scheduling  a  meeting,   or  to  see all employee vacations or work
schedules in different departments.   It provides  a quick  overview
of any or all calendars.

**Note :  You may automatically have CALENDAR WISE enter a specified
calendar upon execution.Simply enter CW /(calendar #) on the command
line.  For example, to start in calendar 1, enter CW /1, or CW 1.

F2  -  Marking calendar for setting default colors.

    After customizing  a  calendar's  colors,   the  colors  can  be
designated  as  the  default colors.   The default color scheme will
appear upon entering a new  calendar.   The default colors will also
appear in the preset  color  schemes(see  DISPLAY  -  SCREEN  COLORS
<F10>).   By pressing F2, an asterisk will appear to the left of the
calendar's  name.   You should then press Escape to get to the menu.
SET DEFAULT COLORS  is  located  under  OPTIONS.   After setting the
default colors,  any changes to the colors of the calendar  selected
will not affect the default color scheme.


F2, F3  -  Marking calendars for merging

     This  function  allows  you  to  merge  the  contents of one or
several calendars  into  another  calendar.    By  pressing  F2,  an
asterisk will appear to the left of the donor calendar's name.    By
pressing  F3,   an arrow   will  appear to the left of the recipient
calendar's name.  Any number of calendars can be selected as donors,
but only one calendar may be selected as the recipient of the merge.
You should then press Escape to get to the menu.   MERGE CALENDAR is
located under OPTIONS.   You will be asked to verify the calendar to
be merged.   If you select  "YES",   you  will then enter the merged
calendar.   When exiting this calendar you may still choose  to  not
save any changes, in effect leaving the recipient calendar as it was
prior to the merge. No changes are ever made to the donor calendars.
This feature can be extremely handy if holidays are kept exclusively
in one calendar.  This way, when a new calendar is started, they can
be easily merged in.  (Registration Note:  Please check REGISTER.DOC
as holiday calendars are included in the registration package.

F2, F3 - Marking calendar for moving

     This  function  allows  you  to  move  all  of  the information
associated with  a  certain  calendar  to  another  location  on the
calendar list.    Prior  to  moving  a  calendar,   the  source  and
destination must be chosen.  By pressing F2, an asterisk will appear
to the left of the calendar to be moved.   By pressing F3,  an arrow
will  appear  to  the  left of the destination on the calendar list.
You should then press Escape to  get to the menu.   MOVE CALENDAR is
located under OPTIONS.   Only one source and one destination may  be
chosen.  You will be asked to verify the calendar to be moved.  If a
calendar exists at the destination, you will be asked if you want to
overwrite it.

F3  - Marking calendar for deleting

     This  function  allows  you  to  delete  all of the information
associated with a certain calendar.    Prior to deleting a calendar,
one calendar must be chosen.   By pressing  F3,   an  arrow     will
appear  to the left of the calendar to be deleted.   You should then
press Escape to get to the  menu.   DELETE CALENDAR is located under
OPTIONS.  You will be asked to verify the calendar to be deleted.


********************************************************************
           NOTE - Possible File Status Error Encountered.

     If you run CALENDAR WISE on a network,  you  can  encounter  an
error when attempting to delete,  move,  or merge a calendar that is
currently  opened  for  update by another user.   You must make sure
that the calendar is in the correct status before CALENDAR WISE will
allow this operation.   You can  do  this by simply choosing to view
the calendar,  and when the "CALENDAR IN USE" screen appears, choose
"OVERRIDE FOR UPDATE".   Make sure that no one is actually  updating
before  you  choose to override the file status.   Upon exiting this
calendar,  the file status  will  be  set  correctly so that you can
attempt the delete,  move, or merge operation.   This same error can
appear in a single user environment (i.e.   if the calendar file  is
open  and  power  is lost,  or some other reason causes the calendar
file to  not  be  closed  properly).    Simply  choose "OVERRIDE FOR
UPDATING" to circumvent the warning and reset the file status.

     This menu  selection will  print the CALENDAR WISE registration
     information.



     OPTIONS - MOVE CALENDAR

     This  function  allows  you  to  move  all  of  the information
associated with a  certain  calendar  to  another  location  on  the
calendar  list.    Prior  to  moving  a  calendar,   the  source and
destination must be chosen.  By pressing F2, an asterisk will appear
to the left of the calendar to be moved.   By pressing F3,  an arrow
will appear to the  left  of  the  destination on the calendar list.
Only one source and one destination may be  chosen.    You  will  be
asked  to verify the calendar to be moved.   If a calendar exists at
the destination, you will be asked if you want to overwrite it.

     OPTIONS - MERGE CALENDAR

     This function  allows  you  to  merge  the  contents  of one or
several calendars into  another  calendar.    By  pressing  F2,   an
asterisk  will appear to the left of the donor calendar's name.   By
pressing F3,  an arrow  will  appear  to  the  left of the recipient
calendar's name.  Any number of calendars can be selected as donors,
but only one calendar may be selected as the recipient of the merge.
If you select "YES", you will then enter the merged calendar.   When
exiting this calendar you may still choose to not save any  changes,
in  effect  leaving  the  recipient  calendar as it was prior to the
merge.   This feature can  be  extremely  handy if holidays are kept
exclusively in one calendar.   This way,  when  a  new  calendar  is
started, they can be easily merged in.

     OPTIONS - DELETE CALENDAR

     This  function  allows  you  to  delete  all of the information
associated with a certain calendar.    Prior to deleting a calendar,

to the left of the calendar to be deleted.   You will  be  asked  to
verify the calendar to be deleted.

     OPTIONS - SET DELETE DATE

     In order to save processing time,  disk space,  and memory, old
data  will  automatically be deleted.   You will be asked to enter a
date.   All nonrecurring items PRIOR TO THIS DATE WILL BE DELETED!!!
All recurring items with  an ending  date PRIOR TO THIS DATE WILL BE
DELETED!!!  This option affects every calendar.   Data is deleted at
the time you exit a calendar.   This date is displayed with the EXIT
menu.  CALENDAR WISE will,  fortunately,  not allow you  to set this 
date within one year prior to your system date. ***  BE CAREFUL  !!!
To be safe, leave it at it's default setting of 01/01/1980.


     OPTIONS - EDIT DATE AND TIME

access to the default color scheme.   (Check DISPLAY - SCREEN COLORS
(F10) in section IIE).   By pressing  F2 while on the calendar list,
an asterisk will appear to the left of the  calendar's  name.    You
will  be  asked  to  verify prior to setting default colors.   After

C. CALENDAR

    The default  layout  for  a  calendar  is  5  weeks  by  7 days.
Appearing in the upper left corner is the  registered  owners  name,
from the REGISTRATION FORM screen.   Top center is the calendar name
from the calendar list,  or 'Multiple Calendars".   Top right is the
currently  displayed  month  and  year.   Vertically on the right is
todays date, and across the bottom is a status line with certain key
function reminders.  Always check the status line across the bottom
of the screen to see what common keystrokes are available, and which
function keys are active.   The highlighted  box  moves  around  the
displayed  days using the arrow and page keys.   If more information
exists for  a day than can be displayed,  a small box appears around
the date.

    F6          - Paste
    Escape      - Menu
    Enter       - Edit day



F5   -  Copy

     Move the day selection  box  to  the day containing the desired
data.  By pressing F5, the item for the selected date is copied into
memory.   If you want to copy the fourth item displayed into memory,
press F5 four times. The item in memory appears across the bottom of
the  screen.    If  this  item is not recurring,  pasting(<F6>) will
simply place it on the new day.   If this item is recurring, pasting
will use the day being  pasted  as the beginning day,  calculate the
duration of this item and subsequently calculate  the  corresponding
ending day for the item pasted.  This feature can be extremely handy
when scheduling infrequent items on many days.    A workers name can
easily be copied to memory and then added to all of  the  days he is
scheduled (i.e.   this Thursday,  next Monday,  next Wednesday).   A
five day stint in Atlanta can easily be added to the first  week  of
May, second week of September, etc..


F6   -  Paste

     By pressing F6,  a previously copied item(see F5 under Calendar
and  Edit  Day)  will  be  inserted on this day.   If the item to be
pasted is not recurring,  pasting  will  simply  place it on the new
day.   If the item is recurring,  pasting will  use  the  day  being
pasted  as the beginning day,  calculate the duration of the item to
be pasted and  subsequently  calculate  the corresponding ending day
for the item pasted.   This feature  can  be  extremely  handy  when
scheduling infrequent items on many days.  A workers name can easily
be  added  to all of the days he is scheduled (i.e.   this Thursday,
next Monday,  next Wednesday).    A  five  day  stint in Atlanta can
easily be added to the first week of May,  second week of September,
etc..

    It is important to know that pasting uses the day you  currently
are on as the beginning day.Therefore if you are pasting a recurring
monthly item from the  31st of a month to the 30th of another month,
this item will appear on the 30th and not at the end of every month,
even if the 30th is the last day of the month. 

F9 - Search again

     A previous search operation can  be  repeated.    If  the  last
search  was  successful,   this search starts with the day following
where the day selection box is located.   This means that if you see
items that  will  match a  subsequent search,  you may  move the day
selection box past them, prior to searching again.If the last search
was  unsuccessful, the search starts  with January 1 of the next year
to search.
     A status line appears across the bottom of the page indicating
the search parameters, and the status of the search.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

D. EDIT DAY


Fields...

  Item

     This field is what appears on the calendar.    If more space is
needed,  the note  field is  available  on the right,   which may be
toggled to  fill the  rest of  the line  by pressing <F8>.  A second
title line can be used as well,  allowing both lines to be viewed on
the calendar(for example,  FAMILY on the first line,  REUNION on the
second line). To delete  an item,  simply space  out this  field, or
press  <F3> and  it  will  automatically  put spaces  in this field.
Remember that deleting an  item will delete  all occurrences  of the
item.   Use <F7> to delete only one occurrence from a recurring item
as described later.

  Frequency

     The frequency field consists of  two parts,  the frequency type
and the frequency number.    Four  frequency  types  are  available.
Yearly, Monthly, Daily and Weekly.   The first letter must be in the
first position of this three position field.   When the frequency is
entered, default data will appear in the other fields.   The day you
are editing will appear in  the  beginning field and 12/31/9999 will
appear in the ending field.   The frequency number pertains  to  how
many weeks apart, how many years apart, etc..  For every five years,
enter Y5; for semiannual,  enter M6; for biweekly, enter W2; and for
every  4 days,  enter D4.    If the first part of this field is left
blank, the item will be treated as non-recurring. If the second part
of this field is left blank, it will be replaced with a 1. To change
a recurring item to a non-recurring item, simply make the first part
of this field blank.   You do not need to blank any of the following
fields.
     You may also make a  frequency moveable.   A moveable item is a
monthly or yearly  frequency item that doesn't happen on the 15th of
every month,  for instance, but rather on the first Tuesday of every
month.  See <F4> below.

   Beginning Date

     The Beginning field denotes when the first occurrence  of  this
item  will  be.    If  the frequency for an item is monthly starting
March 31,  all occurrences of this  item  will  be at the end of the
month.   Likewise if you want an item to fall on  the  end  of  each
month  starting  February  28,   type  31 in the day portion of this
field.   For processing speed  reasons,  the earliest beginning date
year allowed is 1978.   On your personal calendar of birthdays,  put
the birth year in the note field.

   Ending Date

        The Ending field denotes when the last  occurrence  of  this
item  will  be.    If you are entering an event that happens for the
next x frequencies (i.e.    W2  for  10  times,   M1 for the next 18
months),  simply press any nonnumeric key while in this field.    An
asterisk will appear to the left.     Now enter x in the ending date
field,  rather than the actual ending date.   The actual ending date
will be calculated when you press <Enter>.

 TIP:
 1) The frequency,  beginning and  ending fields are only entered if
    the item is recurring.

   Notes

         This field  is provided  so that  more  information  can be
attached to an item. Everywhere this item appears,so will this note.
Only one line of information may be attached to an item. If you need
more space,  fill in the item  field on a second line,  and attach a
second note to it.  If there is nothing in  the item field, the note
will simply disappear.   You can expand the notes area  by  pressing
<F8>.
     This feature can  be extremely handy on your calendars of bills
due,  to see how much  your insurance due quarterly will be,  or how
much your mortgage payment is.

F4   -  Moveable frequency

     By  pressing  F4,   an  asterisk will appear to the left of the
frequency field.   the item  within  the  edit  box will then have a
moveable frequency.   "Moveable" means that this item has  either  a
yearly or monthly frequency,  but each occurrence does not happen on
the same date.   Rather each occurrence happens at the same point in
the  month,  relative to the first week of the month.   (i.   e. the
first Tuesday of each month, the second Friday of every other month,
political elections held on the first Tuesday of November every four
years.) To make an non-moveable  item  moveable,  or a moveable item
non- moveable,  you must be editing on the  beginning  date  of  the
recurring item.

F5   -  Copy

     By pressing F5,  the item inside of the edit box is copied into
memory for later use in pasting.  See also F5 and F6 under Calendar.
If this item is not recurring, pasting(<F6>) will simply place it on
the  new day.   If this item is recurring,  pasting will use the day
being pasted as the beginning  day,   calculate the duration of this
item and subsequently calculate the corresponding ending day for the
item pasted.   This feature can be extremely handy  when  scheduling
infrequent  items on many days.   A workers name can easily be added
to all the days he is scheduled (i.e.   this Thursday,  next Monday,
next Wednesday).  A five day stint in Atlanta can easily be added to
the first week of May, second week of September, etc..

F7   -  Delete one occurrence of a recurring item

     By pressing F7,  an asterisk  will  appear  to the right of the
frequency field.  The occurrence of the item on the day being edited
will be deleted from  occurrences  of  this  item.    Actually  what
happens  is  two recurring items are created;  one starting with the
item's beginning day and ending  with the occurrence previous to the
day being  edited;   and  one  starting  with  the  next  occurrence
following  the  day  being  edited and ending with the item's ending
date.    This  feature  can  be  extremely  handy  when  softball is
scheduled for the next 14 weeks, yet no games are played on Memorial
Day and the team has a bye on the fifth week.

* Note - Pageup and Pagedown save the data prior to  displaying  the
next  page.   This may cause confusion as to what you are viewing if
you have deleted some information on  a  page and are now looking at
the next page.   You may think that you are not seeing some data  on
the  new page that you expected.   Press Pageup to view the data you
expected to be here.   Of course you must have more than 10 items on
a day to encounter this.

    This specifies how many rows each printed day will contain.  The
default is the number of days  that  can  be displayed on one day on
the screen.   If more information exists on  a  day  than  you  have
allotted  room to print,  an asterisk will appear to the left of the
appropriate day on the printout.

     Weeks Per Page

    This specifies how many  weeks  will  be  printed before a forms
feed is sent to the printer.

* Note - You may have to manually set your printer to 12  characters
per  inch  or  higher,  or to landscape,  to fit the calendar on the
page.

     PRINT - PRINT MONTH  <ALT-M>

     The second print  option  available  is printing information by

-------------------------------------------------------------------
D.EXPLANATION OF SHAREWARE

     Shareware is not a type of software,   but  rather  a  form  of
marketing  and  distribution.    Users  are  given  a  chance to try
software before spending  the  sometimes  outlandish fees for retail
software.  If you try a shareware program and continue to use it you
are expected to register it.   Individual programs differ on details
of registration and levels of support offered.   It is important  to
know  what  is  supplied  with your registration,  whether continued
support,  upgraded programs,  or  printed manuals will be available.
Copyright laws apply to both shareware and commercial software,  and
the  copyright  holder  retains  all  rights  The  main  difference,
however,  is that shareware authors specifically grant the right  to
copy  and distribute the software,  either to all and sundry or to a
specific  group.    For  example,    some  authors  require  written
permission before a commercial disk vendor may copy their  software.
When looking for software,  you should find software that suits your
needs  and pocketbook,  whether commercial or shareware.   Shareware
makes fitting your needs easier, because you can try before you buy,
the  ultimate  money-back-guarantee.    Most  likely  shareware  can
deliver  a  lower  priced  product  because  there  is  no  overhead
marketing and distributing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

E.USER AGREEMENT

     If you find this  program  useful  and  find that you are using
CALENDAR WISE and continue to  use  CALENDAR WISE after a reasonable
trial period(30 days),  you must make a registration payment to BLUE
CANNON SOFTWARE.   The appropriate amount is stated on  the  pricing
schedule  and  continued  use is only valid for the amount received.
If in the future you are no longer using CALENDAR WISE in the way it
was originally registered, you must register again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Shareware  Professionals  (ASP).    ASP  wants to make sure that the
shareware principle works for you.   If  you are unable to resolve a
shareware related problem with  an  ASP  member  by  contacting  the

****************************************************************************
                         WELCOME TO CALENDAR WISE
****************************************************************************
      Calendar Wise is a multi-subject planning and tracking tool.

     To execute  Calendar Wise,  the directory  that you previously
     installed into must be the current directory.(i.e. "CD \CWISE"
     and  then  "CW".)   If you are  not in the  current directory,
     Calendar Wise will give  you an error  stating just that.  You
     must change  to the  directory where  CW.EXE is  located prior
     to executing CW.  If you are executing CW from a menu program,
     make sure to set the menu program to do this.

                      CALENDAR WISE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

          1.   IBM PC or compatible
          2.   VGA or EGA monitor
          3.   512k RAM
          4.   DOS 3.0 or higher
          5.   Hard Drive
          6.   CALENDAR WISE is a graphic based program, so a
               80286 or higher processor is recommended.


     Calendar Wise documentation and registration information can be
     printed  via  menu  selections.   Be sure  to print the  manual,
     because it can best explain the features and intricacies of the
     program.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Outside the U.S.A. call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer in

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.


To Order, in the U.S.A.: Call 800-245-6717 and ask Customer Service.

Outside the U.S.A. call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer in
your country.
