## Information about "RSE UTILITIES"

    PC-IMAGES lets you capture images from your computer screen and group
    these ``pictures'' into Carousels.  Run these carousels as a TSR,
    popping them up at will, even during other programs.  Or maybe you'd
    like a picture of your kids, or the company logo, to be automatically
    displayed instead of the blank DOS screen?  No problem.
    
    Registered users can also create stand-alone carousels that will run
    without needing to use PC-IMAGES.  This is excellent for creating user-
    paced business presentations or ``slide shows.''  Use a carousel as a
    ``screen-saver'', automatically popping up after a period of keyboard
    and screen inactivity.  Business users will appreciate PC-IMAGES'
    practical side, but it's a great way to personalize your computer and
    have a little fun too.
    
    You'll never again forget what's in a file. PC-FILENOTES lets you easily
    attach 160 character "pop-up" notes to your file names.
    
    Activate PC-FILENOTES at any time, even during other programs. When
    you do, a sorted directory listing appears instantly. Just highlight
    the desired file and its filenote automatically "pops-up." No more
    staring at endless directory listings wondering what's in all those
    files. With PC-FILENOTES, leave memos to yourself and others on the
    contents or status of your files. It also includes one-touch menu
    functions to view files, delete, rename and tag copy files as well as
    change drives and directories. It's extremely easy to learn and a
    pleasure to use. Both TSR and non-TSR versions are included.
    
    PC-DIRECTORY is PC-FileNote's big brother. It's a powerful file
    manager with advanced file management capabilities. To help you
    remember what's in your files, PC-DIRECTORY lets you attach 160
    character "pop-up" notes to your file names. The disk management
    functions include one-touch menu commands to view files, rename, tag
    copy, tag delete, and tag move files.
    
    Other functions include search for file, search for text, search for
    FileNote, change file or directory attributes, tree listing of
    directories, change drives, print files, catalog floppies, and much
    more.
    
    PC-DIRECTORY is very fast and includes both a TSR (33K) and non-TSR
    version. Even if you have a file manager you're comfortable with, you
    still owe it to yourself to check out PC-DIRECTORY.
    
    NABBIT lets you "nab" information from your screen and send it to your
    printer to print envelopes, labels, or do selective screen dumps. Store
    the nabbed information in a buffer and redirect it through the keyboard
    at some later time. Nab something from the screen and insert it into
    another application as though you typed it in yourself. Transferring
    information between programs is a breeze. It's a very small TSR (2K)
    that's easy to learn and to use! The longer you use it, the more uses
    you'll find for it. It won't be long before you'll wonder how you got by
    without it.
    
    REMIND ME! reminds you of the important events in your life before they
    occur, so you can prepare for them.  It includes a calendar that
    displays any date in any year.  Unbeatable for keeping track of
    birthdays, holidays, paydays, when bills are due, business meetings --
    anything you need to be reminded of in advance.  Enter the event, its
    date, and how many days in advance you want to be reminded of it.
    REMIND ME! does the rest.  Easy to learn and use, you'll never forget
    an important event again.
    
    Have trouble locating the cursor on your laptop when viewing databases,
    or looking at spreadsheet data?  BRITELINE is the answer. It highlights
    the entire line the cursor is on, making it a breeze to find the cursor
    and read data on the cursor line.
    
    BRITELINE is a tiny TSR (less than 1K) that you can turn on or off at
    will.  Registered users can make the cursor line any of 127 different
    color combinations and even change the size of the cursor.  Quit
    squinting, give BRITELINE a try today.
