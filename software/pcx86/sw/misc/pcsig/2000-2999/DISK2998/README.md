PC-SIG UPDATES PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM

For Immediate Release


PC-SIG LIBRARY ON CD-ROM UPDATED TO INCLUDE A NEW USER INTERFACE AND MORE
THAN 800 MB OF PROGRAMS June 21, 1992, SUNNYVALE, CALIF. - PC-SIG, Inc.
today announced availability of The Eleventh Edition of the PC-SIG Library
on CD-ROM.  The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM contains over 800 megabytes of
shareware and includes more than 300 new programs, 550 updated programs,
and the addition of 75 megabytes of Windows 3.x shareware.  The
user-interface has been completely re-engineered to take advantage of the
HyperWriter! hypermedia and multimedia authoring system from NTERGAID, Inc.

The implementation of HyperWriter! provides significant performance and
ease of use enhancements.  Programs can access and download much faster
than with previous editions.  Programs have been reorganized and indexed
for better referencing.  Users just c lick with a mouse, or point with the
cursor, on a program name to see a complete description of the program.
Downloading or copying a program is handled automatically by HyperWriter!
Addition of a preview option is especially important for anyone who uses
images, icons, or fonts.  "You can preview the whole library of images to
find the right one," according to Bruce Kent, product development manager.
"This CD finally makes it possi ble to conserve your disk space and paper,
yet still have all the information you need to make an informed decision,"
said Kent.

All new and updated programs have been reviewed and tested by PC-SIG. Every
program goes through extensive virus checking using the most recent version
of VIRUSCAN from McAfee Associates, and other anti-virus software.
According to Kent, "In the ten ye ars we've distributed shareware, we have
never had a confirmed report of a virus on any of our distributed programs
or CD-ROMs."

The PC-SIG Library on CD-ROM, Eleventh Edition has a list price of $179.

Upgrades from previous editions are available for $99.

Users of PC-SIG's Essential Home & Business Collection CD-ROM can upgrade
for $120.

PC-SIG CD-ROMs are distributed worldwide through a network of distributors
and resellers. Based in Sunnyvale, Calif., PC-SIG, Inc. markets and
supports one of the world's largest collections of shareware for IBM PCs
and compatible systems.  PC-SIG also publishes Shareware Magazine, which is
devoted solely to shareware.  The magazine is availa ble by subscription
and on newsstands nationwide.

Welcome to the world of Shareware, state of the art software you can
actually try before you buy.

Shareware, a term coined in the early eighties, refers to the method of
distribution chosen by the software authors.  With shareware, you can
receive a program and put it through its paces without having to pay for
it. If you find the program useful, and choose to keep the program, then
you pay a modest registration fee to the author.

For the last nine years, PC-SIG has been providing shareware and public
domain software to its customers and members.  Since 1982 PC-SIG has
developed an unprecedented library of shareware programs, constantly
updated, consistently strong in every category.  Our library of
shareware contains over 2700 titles divided into 120 logical categories.

Every program we add to the library is thoroughly reviewed and tested to
insure that each one meets the high standards of reliability and value we
insist upon and you expect.  As a result, our library doesn't contain
every shareware program available, just those that really work.

PC-SIG has grown into the premier distributor of shareware and and
shareware information by producing shareware collections on CD-ROM,
publishing an encyclopedia of shareware, and by publishing Shareware
Magazine, a bi-monthly magazine distributed world-wide.

Quality and support - guaranteed.  All of our programs are guaranteed
virus free.  We've isolated our systems and check every program
submitted to insure that no viruses make their way to your computer or
ours.

Our support staff is available by phone as well as on our BBS to help
you with questions about installation and operation of PC-SIG's
products.

Through our network of international distributors, PC- SIG strives to
bring you the most current, exciting, technically advanced software
available as shareware.

If you can't find the software you need in PC-SIG's library, it may well
not exist.

To order the latest in Shareware, in the U.S.A: Call (800) 245-6717

Outside the U.S.A. call (408) 730-9291 for the name of the dealer in

		SUREFIRE - THE SMART DOCUMENT PROCESSOR

Short Abstract

Surefire lets you put live forms, spreadsheets and databases (Dbase
compatible) right in your documents! Even build complete applications!

Medium Abstract

Surefire lets you put live forms, spreadsheets and databases (Dbase
compatible) right in your documents! Start with text, then add fields 
where you want with formulas for automatic calculations. Store fields in
a Dbase compatible database. Do queries and reports naturally and even 
build complete applications. There's on-line help too. The shareware 
version includes a 180 page User's Guide and a self-running demo.

Long Abstract

Surefire uses the concept of "Smart Documents" to build databases,
spreadsheets, forms and more right within a word processing document.
Users gradually add intelligence to their Smart Documents via fields.
These fields can be fill-in-the-blank, have formulas, cause actions or
be stored in a database (Dbase compatible). Over 70 spreadsheet
functions are available for your calculations. You can use Surefire's
powerful search capabilities on your databases and even generate
reports by projecting data from many records right into your document.
Then use Surefire's buttons to bring you to a page, get another
document, do a calculation, or join to another database. Now you are
building complete Smart Document applications. There's on-line help
too. The shareware version includes a 180 page User's Guide and a
self-running Surefire demo.

Shareware Magazine has distinguished itself as the only internationally
distributed periodical devoted to the use and business of shareware.
Shareware Magazine provides detailed reviews of new products,
hard-hitting comparisons of shareware programs with regular retail
software, and timely information about changes in the industry and the
latest technology.

Intriguing columnists and regular features add to the excitement.  The
beginners section sheds light on new user's concerns regarding
everything from choosing the right operating system to alleviating the
intimidation of using on-line systems.

Educational sections focus on how low cost shareware can aid in
classroom learning, curriculum development, and as a forum for
discussing the impact of computers and technology in schools.

Graphics Gallery renders expert advice and suggestions on how to better
work with graphics, desktop publishing, CAD systems, and the Windows
environment.

Programmers benefit from others experience in developing new programs or
polishing existing ones as well as choosing the right programming
language.

And columnists provide that subjective component, sometimes
controversial, that calls for a closer look at the way we compute and
how shareware effects what we do.

Published bimonthly, Shareware Magazine is available on a subscription
or at your local newsstand or computer bookstore.  In conjunction with
PC-SIG, there are special benefits for subscribers as well as
opportunities for discount purchases from PC-SIG.

Short Abstract

Surefire lets you put live forms, spreadsheets and databases (Dbase
compatible) right in your documents! Even build complete applications!

Medium Abstract

Surefire lets you put live forms, spreadsheets and databases (Dbase
compatible) right in your documents! Start with text, then add fields 
where you want with formulas for automatic calculations. Store fields in
a Dbase compatible database. Do queries and reports naturally and even 
build complete applications. There's on-line help too. The shareware 
version includes a 180 page User's Guide and a self-running demo.

Long Abstract

Surefire uses the concept of "Smart Documents" to build databases,
spreadsheets, forms and more right within a word processing document.
Users gradually add intelligence to their Smart Documents via fields.
These fields can be fill-in-the-blank, have formulas, cause actions or
be stored in a database (Dbase compatible). Over 70 spreadsheet
functions are available for your calculations. You can use Surefire's
powerful search capabilities on your databases and even generate
reports by projecting data from many records right into your document.
Then use Surefire's buttons to bring you to a page, get another
document, do a calculation, or join to another database. Now you are
building complete Smart Document applications. There's on-line help
too. The shareware version includes a 180 page User's Guide and a
self-running Surefire demo.
