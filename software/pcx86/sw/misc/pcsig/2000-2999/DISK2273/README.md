The files contained on this disk are self extracting archive files.
By creating these files this way, we can provide more programs on
a diskette and you can un-archive them without any special tools.

  DLR.EXE - METZ Dialer
  DN.EXE  - METZ Desktop Navigator
  DT.EXE  - METZ Desktop Manager
  FM.EXE  - METZ Freemem
  LK.EXE  - METZ Lock
  MTMBETA.EXE  - METZ Task Manager Beta version
  PH.EXE  - METZ Phones
  RNR.EXE - METZ Runner
  TM.EXE  - METZ Time

Simply run the desired self extracting archive to extract it's contents.
For example, to extract the Phones files, copy PH.EXE to your disk then
type PH.  The contents of PH.EXE will be extracted.  PH.EXE will not
delete itself.

Special thanks to Haruyasu Yoshizaki for providing this self-extracting
file format.  (LHarc Version 1.13c)
