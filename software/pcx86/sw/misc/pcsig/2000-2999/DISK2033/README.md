## Information about "RAMBASE ACCOUNTING"

    Fast, faster, fastest are ways to describe this program. RAMBASE
    ACCOUNTING is run completely within RAM and you can tell the difference
    in speed quickly. To be sure, data is saved to disk, but only when you
    request it. Consequently, data can be lost more easily than with other
    programs, but with a little practice this can be overcome.
    
    There are absolutely no delays to be found in the program.
    State-of-the-art technology is used to sort, index and merge all the
    necessary data at keystroke speed. Switching is easy. You can go
    between payables, receivables, inventory, checkbook, point-of-sale and
    reports simply by pressing a key. Each task is simply suspended until
    you return to it. In addition, invoices can be produced and printed
    quickly, which is something that many other accounting programs only
    dream about.
    
    It is suggested that the user read the manual to understand some of the
    ways the program has been organized. For instance, accounts are
    accessed by their names rather than by an account number as in most

Fast, faster, fastest are ways to describe this program.  The program is
run completely within RAM [RBA: RamBase Accounting] and you can tell the
difference in speed quickly.  To be sure, data is saved to disk, but    
only when you request it.  Consequently, data can be lost more easily   
than with other programs, but with a little practice this can be        
overcome.                                                               
                                                                        
Keeping everything in RAM does cause some difficulties.  The menus are  
one example.  They are somewhat cluttered, but on the upside, context-  
sensitive help is but a key [F1] away.  Reading the manual is critical  
to using the program correctly.                                         
                                                                        
For one thing, there are no account numbers and only the manual         
clarifies how things mesh.  Nevertheless, for those willing to stay with
it, RBA [RamBase Accounting] is a fast accounting program that will     
track inventory, clients, receivables, payables and more.  It does not  
use account numbers and is run entirely within RAM.  In addition,       
invoices can be produced and printed quickly which is something that    
many other accounting programs only dream about.

                          item with the payable statement in payable mode.
                          RAMlink allows you to search in the inventory
                          while invoicing or writing a payable. (See
                          Section l2 of User's Manual).

F10  Function Key         Will request security code.  This will toggle
                          from MGR mode to CLERK mode.  When in Clerk
                          mode, sensitive customer/supplier information
                          is hidden. (See Section 4.11 of User's Manual).
