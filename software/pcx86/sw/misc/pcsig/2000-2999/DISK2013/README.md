## Information about "KAKA!"

    Roll six die in competition to remain the highest scoring player in the
    game.  Two to six players take turns to roll "scorable" combinations of
    numbers.  Once a player's turn begins, play continues until the player
    chooses to quit and take the turn's score or until KAKA! is rolled -- a
    non-scoring roll of the dice.  Directions are provided online and
    context-sensitive help is a keystroke away.

Roll six die in the competition to remain the highest scoring player in 
the game.  Two to six players vie to roll "scorable" combinations of    
numbers.  Once the scoring begins, a player continues to play until     
KAKA! is rolled - a non-scoring play.  Directions are provided online   
and context-sensitive help is a keystroke away.
