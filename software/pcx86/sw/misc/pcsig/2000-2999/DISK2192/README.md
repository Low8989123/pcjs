## Information about "ONLINE BIBLE 2 OF 7 (2191-2197 ALSO)"

    Did you ever wish that there was an easier and faster way to find words
    or phrases in the Bible? The ONLINE BIBLE is a full-function search and
    retrieval program for Bible students.
    
    Search facilities include word, phrase, and multiple words.  You can
    add notes of any size to a verse using the supplied text processor.
    Cross-reference information may be stored in the notes for automatic
    recall.  Verses may be printed or saved in ASCII format, and from there
    you can customize them with your favorite wordprocessor.
    
    Using the ONLINE BIBLE is a breeze with adjustable window size for
    viewing verses, drop down menus, and context sensitive help screens.
    
    Furthermore, visually challenged individuals can now use screen reader
    hardware to use the Online Bible screens.  These characteristics, plus
    the coupling of ONLINE BIBLE with the Greek and Hebrew Lexicon
    (#220-2206, #2485) and Online Bible Cross References (#2483-#2484),
    make ON-LINE BIBLE a powerful tool.
