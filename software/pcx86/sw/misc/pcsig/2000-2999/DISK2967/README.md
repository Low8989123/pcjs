Francis X. "Butch" Mahoney, Jr.302 Lessard St.Donaldsonville, La. 70346(504) 473-9378The fee for this typeface is $15 as is, check or money order(preferred).Or send $20 and a disk and a list of the sizes of the bitmaps you would like to have and I will try to oblige (within reason...like, don't ask for 127 point,etc...).  Also, I can include (and probably will anyway) varying spaces to help you set your own type.  I like very close spacing, but if you like to spread out your type, then this will be available from within the font itself.  This capability will be for those people who don't have all the fancy new software that will do manual kerning, etc. (available only to registered owners). [proposed spacing - units based on selected point size - 1,1/2,1/4,1/8,1/16,1/32,1/64 and maybe smaller]Hello Font Lover,Previously, I had become very discouraged by distributing my work on CompuServe.  A couple of bad experiences made it difficult for me tocontinue.  However, recently I have received some recognition (Thank you Richard Eckhardt), and it has made me rethink my position.The economy is bad in Louisiana and I am not doing well.  You may have noticed the address change.  I cannot afford the time on CompuServe except for uploading.  Also, my troubles are your gain for neither can I afford to do any other kind of marketing for my work other than ShareWare (they would cost at least twice as much or more).  And just having me "sit on these faces" (pun intended) is not doing any good for myself or anyone else.  My first uploads to CompuServe were rather primitive attempts.  I think now you will find that I am capable of good - excellent quality alter-natives to the "higher priced spreads".I will assume you know what to do with this typeface.   (use Font/DA Mover 3.2 or higher, don't let Font/DA Mover change the    font id, etc...)            .........if you don't know how to work these, call!!! (not collect)            .........if you can't call, write (like I said, I can't afford CIS)There is only one size bitmap with this typeface (I'm trying to keep my long distance and your download charges to a minimum).  And there is a good chancethat it is not very clean (some of them are however, and even print fairly well on ImageWriter - besides, LaserWriter doesn't care what the bitmaps look like - you can use geneva first, then switch to this face before printing).  It will however, automatically download to any PostScript Device i.e. LaserWriter, Linotronic, or any of the new PostScript printers that are accessed by AppleTalk.  (Versions of this typeface can be prepared for manual downloading as a text only file for non-Macintosh computers if the need should arise.)If you should happen to investigate any of the other typefaces I've uploadedyou will probably discover that this is a form letter tacked on to every one of them.  You can skip reading the others, however, the ShareWare fee remains.                          PLEASE PAY ME...	                                                          Thank you.P.S. If you are curious as to what happened to Calligraphic, I had to shelve it.  It doesn't work with the newer LaserWriter software.  The new Fontographer software was supposed to fix the problems.  The recompiled Calligraphic worked with the new LW software but the decorative letters don't print properly (they turn out with black letters on the background, and they are supposed to be white - I haven't been able to fix it - maybe with the next release of Fontographer).  Furthermore, it would only work if ZapfChancery was available, which leaves out regular LW users.
