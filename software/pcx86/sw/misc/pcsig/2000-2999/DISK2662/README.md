Special Requirements: 512K RAM, and two floppy drives or a hard drive.  
                                                                        
Do you need an integrated accounting management system for your         
business? ACCOUNT + PLUS is the ideal choice, providing everything a    
small business needs in one package.                                    
                                                                        
ACCOUNT + PLUS consists of individual modules: payroll, bookkeeping,    
inventory, checkbook, receivables, payables, and report generation.     
The payroll module handles all types of employee payroll. Deductions    
include federal, state taxes, insurance, and pension. Earning may be by 
hour, week, month, or commission.                                       
                                                                        
The bookkeeping module operates as a general ledger, keeping track of   
all of your income and expenses. It will also write the checks you need 
to issue in paying your bills.                                          
                                                                        
The inventory module lets you maintain an inventory database with add,  
delete, and change record functions. Many report generation options are 
available here.                                                         
                                                                        
The checkbook module is a complete checkbook management system. It will 
keep track of your deposits, your withdrawals, your checks, balancing of
your checkbook, and several report printing options.                    
                                                                        
ACCOUNT + PLUS is menu driven with an on-line help facility that does   
away with the need to constantly refer to printed documentation. No     
small business should be without ACCOUNT + PLUS, the integrated         
accounting management system.
