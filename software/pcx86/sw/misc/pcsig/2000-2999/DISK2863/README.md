Disk No: 2863                                                           
Disk Title: U-Net                                                       
PC-SIG Version: S1.0                                                    
                                                                        
Program Title: U-Net                                                    
Author Version: 1.1                                                     
Author Registration: $9.95/$19.95 (includes 20ft cable)                 
Special Requirements: 640K RAM, hard drive, and MS-DOS 3.3+.            
                                                                        
U-NET is the first complete network available via shareware, and also   
the first network that can be installed by a computer novice. U-NET     
allows small businesses to install the network and see the advantages of
sharing software, data files, and printer between any two IBM or        
compatible computers, without a major investment.                       
                                                                        
The biggest benefit to users is ease of use. Installation takes less    
than 5 minutes by running a simple Install program on each computer that
automatically configures the software for the computer ports being used.
The cable simply connects between the parallel ports of the two         
computers. If there is more than one parallel port then U-NET uses LPT2.
                                                                        
No learning is required as U-NET uses standard DOS commands. The only   
additional commands are S-Print and W-Print for directing printing. The 
hard disk drive(s) on the main computer are accessed as if they were    
physically in the other computer becoming additional virtual drives and 
being automatically assigned the next logical letter.                   
                                                                        
U-NET is very applicable to Laptop, Notebook, or IBM PS/1 computers with
no free slots available for networking adapter cards. Also it can be    
used for the transfer of data between computers with incompatible       
diskette sizes or simply to share a high cost laser printer between two 
computers. Small businesses or professional people such as doctors,     
attorneys, and traveling salesmen who do not need to be constantly using
a network will find U-NET extremely useful in being able to link a      
second computer into the office's main computer and access information  
from time to time as required.
