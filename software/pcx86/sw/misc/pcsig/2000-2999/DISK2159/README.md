## Information about "THE LAND 2 OF 2 (ALSO 2158)"

    A fantasy role-playing game based on the book "The Chronicles of Thomas
    Covenant."  Choose from six character classes, and explore towns,
    villages, and dungeons in search of treasure and magic.
    
    Buy and trade armor, weapons, food, or magic items from the townspeople,
    who sometimes have helpful hints about the game.  Mapping is simple in
    THE LAND since the program does it for you. As you search a town, a
    dungeon, or the outside world, an overhead view shows where you are,
    and how much is left to explore of that region.
    
    You can save your game at any time -- handy if you are about to do
    battle with a dragon, or Hydra.  Like Ultima and Questron this game will
    take you many hours to complete as your character gains experience and
    knowledge in the place called THE LAND.

     And now to the game.
     This game is based on the trilogy  "The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant"
     written by Stephen R. Donaldson.  If you like fantasy type  reading  I
     strongly recomend you read this series of books.
     
     OBJECT: This game belongs to the Rouge Genre of games.  You  create  a
     character,  travel  the  lands  and dungeons in search of treasure and
     magic.  There is a main goal to this game that you will discover while
     you play.
     
     CHARACTER CLASSES:
     
     LORESRAAT
       This is about the  most  powerfull  in  the  game  but  the  hardest
     advancement.    This player can cast the most powerfull of spells, and
     use the most powerfull of artifacts.  This  character  also  has  good
     fighting ability.
     
     RHADHAMAERL
       This character is dedicated to the lore of stone and  therefore  can
     cast only the stone lore spells.  This class is mostly magic using and
     little fighting ability.  This class may at any time join  either  the
     LORESRAAT  or  the  WARWARD,  If  the player does this then he will no
     longer advance in Rhadhamaerl skill.
     
     LILIANRILL
       This character is dedicated to the lore of wood  and  therefore  can
     cast only the wood lore spells.  This class also is mostly magic using
     and therefore has little fighting ability.  This class also  may  join
     the  LORESRAAT or the WARWARD, If the player does this then he will no
     longer advance in Lilianrill skill.
     
     BLOODGUARD
       This class is of the Haruchai race.  This class is  immune  to  both
     sleep  and fear.  This class cannot use any weapon or armour.  Defense
     and attack are both very strong with this character class.  This class
     is  strictly  of  fighting  ability  and cannot use any magical items.

     Bloodguard automaticaly acquire a Ranyhyn  at  the  beginning  of  the
     game.
     
     RAMEN
       The Ramen are the tenders of the Ranyhyn (the great horses).   Ramen
     are strictly fighting characters and cannot use any armour or weapons.
     Ramen are immune to fear.  Ramen may not at any time ride any type  of
     mount.
     
     WARWARD
       The warward is your basic average fighter  class.    Any  weapon  or
     armour can be used, as well as lesser magical items, But no artifacts.
     
     GIANTS
       Giants are basically very strong characters and can hit  very  hard.
     Giants  cannot use any weapons or armour since they would be too small
     for them.  Magical items  may  also  not  be  used  by  giants  except
     potions.  Giants are immune to fire attacks and fear.
     
     
     SERVICE
       All characters have some vow or oath to follow,  This is followed by
     giving  a certain amount of time to their cause.  This service must be
     rendered, for if it is not  then  the  characters  abilities  will  be
     reduced.   The amount of service changes from class to class and level
     to level.  Basicly start with 6 months of service per year and  add  1
     month  every  five  levels.   The actual schedule of service is in the
     full documentation for the program.  The only class that does not have
     to  perform any service are the giants.  This service must be given at
     the players starting point.

     HURTLOAM - If this items is possesed by anyone who has any Rhadhamaerl
     skill, Hurtloam acts like a potion of healing.

     ability to read scrolls.
     
     
     Restoring Saved games.

        THELAND JUDY
        
        
     
     Two new command line options have been added:
       /C - This option converts save files from versions earlier than 1.6
            to work under the newer versions.  This option should be  used
            the first time you load your save file into the new version.
       /E - This option enables EGA graphics.
       
       Any command line options used should be placed after the saved game
     name.
     
     Note from the author:
       This brief documentation file leaves out  an  incredible  amount  of
     information  available  in  the  full  documentation.   It is strongly
     recommended that you register your copy of "The Land" so that you will
     recieve  the full documentation, as well as getting a free copy of the
     next release of the program.
