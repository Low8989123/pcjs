Using the EXM files (loaders)
-----------------------------
 
The EXM files are actually 'loaders' which allow their respective
DOS programs to run without closing all of your applications, making
your HP95 more efficient.  They are started with 'hotkeys' just like
the built-in applications.

There are two groups of EXM files. The ones starting with 'A' are
used if your DOS program resides on A:.  The other ones are for
those on C:.  There is a required directory setup to use these
files, therefore follow the instructions carefully.

The following are the directories that the DOS applications MUST
reside in to use the associated EXM file.

Program        Directory      Loader         Hotkey

{COMMO}        C:\COMMO       COMMO.EXM      CTRL-COMM
{COMMO}        A:\COMMO       ACOMMO.EXM     CTRL-COMM
Screen         C:\            SCREEN.EXM     ALT-S
Screen         A:\            ASCREEN.EXM    ALT-S

After you have placed the program files in their appropriate
directories, include their associated EXM files dropping the 'A'
where applicable.

You will then need to create or modify your APNAME.LST file on each
drive.  This is a standard text file that can be modified by MEMO.
Do not mix applications from different drives in one APNAME.LST
file.  The one on C: needs to be in the \_DAT directory.  The one on
A: needs to be in the root directory, A:\.  There are a total of 8
applications that are allowed at one time.  The ones on C: are
counted first.  The ones on A: are added whenever a Ram Card is
inserted and removed when the card is removed.  If you have more
than one card you can have more applications.

I have included a sample APNAME.LST file which you can use or
modify.  Notice the entries show the path of the EXM file and the
scan-code of the hotkey.  The third entry is the name display if
there is not enough memory to load an application.  Once you have
created the file and put it in the appropriate directory, you can
activate it by rebooting, CTRL-ALT-DEL.


NOTES ON PROGRAMS

{COMMO}: The statement SET COMMO=A:\COMMO (or C:\COMMO) should be in
your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  There is a bug in SYSMGR with respect to
the operation of the serial port.  After transmitting with {COMMO}
the port won't work with FILER or DATACOMM until you reboot.  If you
use FILER or DATACOMM to communicate, the simplest solution is to
enter {COMMO} when FILER and DATACOMM are closed.  This can easily
be done with a USER key and this macro:

      {FILER}Q{Ctrl-COMM}

Store this under one of your CHAR F# keys and you won't have to
reboot to use FILER or DATACOMM.

SCREEN:  This loader will activate SCREEN.COM which will allow
Alt-Arrow tracking of the screen.  Rename CURSOR.COM to SCREEN.COM
if you want to enable cursor tracking as well.  This capability is
disabled anytime you re-enter SYSMGR from the FILER DOS shell.

CAVEATS:

None of the above loaders will allow another application to be
accessed while it is running unless it can shell to DOS.  You cannot
access a SYSMGR app until you exit the program.

These loaders will not work if LOTUS is open.

The environment size on the 95 is defaulted to 160 bytes. APNAME.LST
will not work if you are close to the limit. Reduce your PATH,
SHELL, or SET statements and retry. Keep your path statements in the
APNAME.LST file in either all upper or all lower case.  If you want
to increase the size of the enviroment use the following statement
in your CONFIG.SYS.

   SHELL=COMMAND /E:#### /P  (#### is the number of bytes)

Do not put a SET statement after your PATH statement in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  If you use SET statements include a PATH
statement after the the last SET statement.


These loaders were created using UTIL which is available from ESSEX
Marketing at 203-651-8284 for $70.  If you would like to create
custom loaders please order the software.  You do not need
programming experience to use this feature.

If you have any problems you can post a message to me on this forum.
My Compuserve ID is 71551,467.

These loaders, SCREEN.COM and CURSOR.COM are donated to the public
domain and cannot be offered for sale.

```

=================================
Installing {COMMO} on the HP 95LX
=================================

If you do not have the Connectivity Pack, you will need the accessory serial
cable, HP PN 82222A.  Connect your PC to the HP with the cable and follow
these steps:

  ----------
  ON YOUR PC
  ----------

  IMPORTANT:  This procedure assumes that you have read READ95.ME and that you
  have installed the standard version of {COMMO} on your PC.  If you have not
  done so, refer to COMMO.DOC for instructions.

  It also assumes that the {COMMO} "home" directory is "C:\COMMO\".  If this
  is not the case, you will be given an opportunity to change it while the
  install macro is running.

  1) Create a subdirectory below your {COMMO} "home" directory called "HP95".
     The path for this directory would then be "C:\COMMO\HP95\".

  2) Copy the files from the {COMMO} HP 95LX archive, COMMO9.ZIP or
     CMOHPxx.ZIP, to this directory.  "xx" is the {COMMO} version number.

  3) Copy the the files INSTAL95.BAT and INSTAL95.MAC to your {COMMO} "home"
     directory.

  4) Change to the {COMMO} "home" directory and type "instal95" to run the
     installation batch file.

  5) Enter the number of the serial port that is connected to the 95LX, "1"
     for COM1, "2" for COM2, etc.

  6) If the directory shown is correct, just press Enter.  Otherwise edit the
     path and then press Enter.  Be sure there is a "\" at the end.

  7) The first filename will blink at the top of the screen.  This is the
     filename that you should enter on the 95LX.  After each file is
     transferred, a new filename will appear.  Note that some of the names
     have "95" in them on the PC, but are named without the "95" on the 95LX.

  8) When you see the message "Finished!" you should press Alt-X to exit
     {COMMO} on your PC.  If you need to cancel the process at any time, just
     press Esc to stop and leave {COMMO}.

  ------------
  ON YOUR 95LX
  ------------

  1) Open FILER.

  2) Open DATACOMM.

  3) Press MENU, T, X, R.

  4) Enter the 95LX path and the filename that the PC is sending.

  5) The transfer will start.

  6) Continue until all files are copied.

                                - end -

     ____________________________________________________

     {ncr=}         Macro to execute when carrier is lost
     ____________________________________________________

     Specify a macro label here and {COMMO} will execute the macro
     when carrier detect is lost.  Example:

          {ncr=carrlost}

     IMPORTANT:  This feature is enabled only when a connection is
     made using {COMMO}'s Auto Dialer.  Also, if carrier drops while a
     macro is running or a command window is open (such as the Dialing
     Directory or Capture File Options), the carrier lost macro will
     not activate.

     Be sure that you have your modem configured to provide the
     carrier detect signal.  See Appendix A for modem information.


     ________________________________________________

     {rtr=}    Receive Translate Table initialization
     {str=}    Send Translate Table initialization
     ________________________________________________

          These items are used to place values into the character
          translation tables at program startup and, if desired, to
          turn translation ON.  Multiple receive or send items may be
          present.

          Character translation is used when you wish certain
          characters to be changed into other characters as they are
          received from, or as they are sent to, the remote system. 
          You may also cause received characters to be ignored.

          Examples:

               {rtr=y,7,0,36,156}



                    Turn ON receive translation ("y").

                    Change the bell character (ASCII 7) to null (ASCII
                    0, which will not display).

                    Change the "$" (ASCII 36) to ASCII 156.

               {str=#26,97,65,42,43,#10,48,128}

                    Change 26 consecutive values starting at 97 to
                    consecutive values starting at 65.  This will
                    change all lowercase letters (ASCII 97 to 122) to
                    uppercase letters (ASCII 65 to 90).

                    Change the "*" (ASCII 42) to a "+" (ASCII 43).

                    Change 10 consecutive values starting at 48 to
                    consecutive values starting at 128.  This will
                    change the digits 0 through 9 (ASCII 48 to 57) to
                    ASCII 128 to 137.

                    The ON/OFF state of send translation will not be
                    changed (no "y" or "n" is present).

          A "y", to turn translation ON, must be the first argument,
          if present.  It may be used on any "rtr" or "str" item and
          will apply to all 256 values in either the receive table or
          the send table.  Note that translation defaults to OFF when
          {COMMO} is started.

          Use a PAIR of arguments to change a single value.

          Use THREE arguments to change a range of consecutive values
          to another range of consecutive values.  The "#" operator on
          the first argument specifies the number of values to change,
          followed by the starting values for each range.

          The macro functions RTRAn and STRAn have similar argument
          lists.  In addition they allow you to restore each Translate
          Table to default values and to turn translation ON and OFF
          without disturbing the values in the tables.  See the Macro
          Programming Guide for more details.

          VT102     (V)  For calling certain mainframes and online
                         services.
          TTY       (T)  For turning off almost all control functions
                         (lets you see ANSI control sequences).
          TTY(40)   (H)  HP 95LX version only.  Wraps terminal lines
                         at 40 columns.  Use when the host cannot be
                         configured for 40 columns.

     General form:

          {GOLOok label,string}

               label     A label to GOTO when "string" is received

     _______

     LOOKfor
     _______

     Default key:   none
     Description:   Look for strings in the modem input stream.

     LOOKfor may be used in conjunction with CALOok and GOLOok to scan
     for up to 16 strings at the same time.  When CALOok and GOLOok
     set up additional strings to look for, the actual "looking" does
     not take place until the LOOKfor executes.

     Parameters controlling LOOKfor execution are set with the SETLook
     function, which should be executed before any LOOKfor functions. 
     See the description of the SETLook function for details.

     Examples using LOOKfor only:

          {lookfor first name?}    Look for the string "first name?"

          {look ^(COMMO^)}         Look for the string "{COMMO}".

          When the string comes in, control will pass to the next
          function.

     Example construct using CALOok/GOLOok/LOOKfor:

                    {setlook 60,hng,3,n|}
                      ...

          {:m_1234}
                    {golook aaa,string1}
                    {calook m_1234,bbb,string2}
                    {calook m_1234,ccc,string3}
                    {golook ,string4}
                    {lookfor string5} {send answer5|} {goto ddd}

          {:aaa}    {hangup y} {goto cancel}
          {:bbb}    {send answer2|} {return}
          {:ccc}    {send answer3|} {call subr} {return}

          {:ddd}      ...

          In this example {COMMO} will look for five strings.  When
          any string comes in, the LOOKfor is terminated (all strings



          are cancelled).  It may be set up again by going back to
          "m_1234".

          The GOLOok function for string1 will GOTO "aaa" when the
          string comes in.  In the example control will pass to
          "cancel".

          If string2 or string3 come in the CALOok functions will set
          "m_1234" as the return point and then CALL "bbb" or "ccc"
          respectively.  When these routines RETUrn, control returns
          to "m_1234" and the five string LOOKfor will be set up
          again.

          The GOLOok for string4 has a null label and control will
          pass to the function following the LOOKfor if that string
          comes in.  The "," must be present.

          If string5 comes in, control will also pass to the function
          following the LOOKfor.

     TIPS on creating LOOKfor strings:

     >    There should be just one space following the LOOKfor
          function name.  Any spaces beyond this point are part of the
          string.  The string ends at the right curly brace.

     >    CALOok/GOLOok/Auto Receive strings begin immediately after
          the comma.  There should be no spaces unless they are part
          of the string.

     >    Strings may be up to 32 characters in length (control
          characters like "^M" count as one).  Upper/lower case is
          ignored.

     >    ANSI control sequences are filtered if ANSI or VT102
          emulation is enabled.

     >    Remember that short strings may not be unique enough, long
          strings may not match due to line noise.

     >    Rules for representing special characters in
          CALOok/GOLOok/LOOKfor/Auto Receive strings are given in
          Appendix D in the User Guide and Reference.

     Additional TIPS:

     >    CALOok and GOLOok functions should immediately precede a
          LOOKfor (no string compares actually occur until the LOOKfor
          executes).  Up to 15 CALOok/GOLOok strings may be used for a
          total of up to 16 strings to scan for.

     >    FILTER Capture Mode should be used to determine the exact
          prompt to look for.  The LOOKfor sees the incoming data
          exactly as it is captured when FILTER mode is set.



     >    If two or more strings cause a match at the same time, the
          LAST such string listed is the one acted upon.  For example,
          if "abcdef" and "def" are listed and "abcdef" comes in.

     >    Since the LOOKfor is terminated whenever any of the strings
          come in (or when the LOOKfor timeout expires), this
          structure is unrestricted -- that is, CALLs, GOTOs, other
          CALOok/GOLOok/LOOKfor constructs, etc., may be used freely
          in any of the branches.

                                   240, 225 to 241, ..., 231 to 247. 

          {rtran}                  Toggle receive translation ON/OFF.

          {rtran #13,65,78,#13,78,65,#13,97,110,#13,110,97}
                                   ROT13 translation.  This swaps the
                                   first 13 letters of the alphabet
                                   for the second 13.

     Rules for RTRAn arguments are the same as for the {rtr=} item in
     the Setup File.  In addition, "n" may be used as the first
     argument to turn receive translation OFF at any time.

     See "Edit Setup File" in the User Guide and Reference for details
     and more examples.

     TIPS on using RTRAn:

     >    Some control characters are unaffected by translation when
          certain features are enabled.  Examples:  XON (17) and XOFF
          (19) are not translated when Software Flow Control is on. 
          ENQ (5) is not translated when ENQ/ACK emulation is on.

     >    When the Capture Mode is set to RAW, data will be captured
          prior to translation.  FILTER and SCREEN captures will
          contain translated data.

     >    LOOKfor will always see translated data.  Use FILTER Capture
          Mode to see what LOOKfor sees.

     >    In GETString, incoming data (as well as locally typed
          characters) will be translated with the Receive Translate
          Table (it may be necessary to turn receive translation off
          during certain GETString functions).

     SPDCtrl
     _______

     Default key:   none
     Description:   Serial port display control.



     Examples:

          {spdc y}            Serial port display is ON.
          {spdc n}            Serial port display is OFF.

     This function will suppress display of any data received from the
     serial port.  It can be used when a "clean" display is desired
     during automated procedures.

     TIPS on using SPDCtrl:

     >    ANSI control sequences are not processed while SPDCtrl is in
          effect (Terminal Emulation effectively reverts to TTY).

     >    LOOKfor will function normally, but remember that ANSI
          sequences are not stripped.  Make a manual run using TTY
          emulation to see what the LOOKfor will see.

     >    SCREEN Capture Mode will not capture any of the incoming
          data.  Use RAW mode or FILTER mode instead (FILTER capture
          will be affected by the Translate Table, but will still
          contain ANSI sequences).

     >    Serial port display will always be restored to ON at macro
          termination.

     STRAn
     _____

     Default key:   none
     Description:   Maintain Send Translate Table.

     Switches:

               I1 or I   Initialize Send Translate Table to default
                         values (consecutive 0 to 255).

               I0        Do not initialize (default).

     Examples:

          {stran y}           Turn send translation ON.

          {stran-i n}         Initialize the table and turn it OFF.

          {stran-i y,92,47}   Initialize the table, turn send
                              translation ON, change "\" to "/".

          {stran}             Toggle send translation ON/OFF.

     =======
     Preface
     =======

     {COMMO} is a general purpose telecommunications program, also
     called a "terminal" program.  Use it to dial remote systems and
     to communicate using a choice of terminal emulations.  Many
     features are available to enhance your communications needs.

     Minimum system configuration:

          IBM PC compatible computer.
          MS-DOS 2.1 or higher.
          128k of memory.
          One diskette drive.
          A serial port or internal modem with an 8250, 16450 or 16550
          series UART chip.

     {COMMO} can be configured to work with virtually any type of
     modem.

     ==================
     Principal Features
     ==================

     {COMMO} is small in size, loads rapidly and performs all
     functions with great speed.

     The powerful Macro Processor allows you to:

          1)   Write macro "scripts" to automate many common
               operations such as logging in, reading messages,
               uploading/downloading.  {COMMO} will perform these
               tasks in the middle of the night while you sleep.

          2)   Assign Function Keys, Alt Keys, Keypad Keys, etc., to:

                    (a) send a string to the modem
                    (b) execute any DOS command
                    (c) start any macro

     1)   Read the section "Getting Started" which will get you up and
          running.

     2)   Read Appendix A "Setting Up Your Modem" for some very
          important instructions regarding your specific hardware.

     3)   Read through the section "{COMMO} Key Commands" to
          familiarize yourself with {COMMO}'s commands and features.

     4)   Use Online Help as a reference while you use {COMMO}.


     How is it pronounced???  Just like "comma" (,) except for the
     last letter.  It's technical jargon for "communications."

     ===============
     Getting Started
     ===============

     NOTE:  Refer to Appendix G for explanations of any error messages
     you receive during your initial use of {COMMO}.

     For greater detail, see the next section "Preparing Your System."


     Quick Start Instructions
     ========================

     1)   If you have a hard drive, create a subdirectory named
          "COMMO."  Copy all of the files from the {COMMO} archive or
          distribution diskette into this subdirectory.

          If your system has only floppy drives, copy the {COMMO}
          files to a formatted diskette.

          Now change to the {COMMO} subdirectory or log in to the
          diskette where you have copied the {COMMO} files.

     2)   Run the "New User's Guide"  by typing "guide" at the DOS
          prompt. Follow the instructions carefully.  A macro will
          automatically take you on a tour of some of {COMMO}'s main
          features.

          When you are in the Setup File you will be in {COMMO}'s
          Internal Editor and you may change any portion of the file
          using the arrow keys, PgUp, PgDn and other editing keys. 
          Press Alt-E for Edit Help to see a list of editing keys.

          You may need to change some of the items to conform to your
          system setup.  Notice that {COMMO} only looks at the items
          that are contained in curly braces: { }.  All other text is
          treated as commentary and is not used by the program.

          Most items will not need to be changed until you are more
          familiar with {COMMO}.  For now, check the following:

               The Default Dialing Parameters in the first item.  Make
               sure you have the correct port number (the third
               field).  If your modem is on COM2, change it to "2",
               COM3 to "3", etc.  Using COM2 it would look like this: 
               {2400,8n1,2,A,0}.

               The Modem Initialization String.  If you know the
               commands for your own modem, make the necessary
               adjustments.  If you don't, then leave it like it is. 
               Refer to Appendix A for more information.



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           13


               The items under "Paths and Files" (page down to see
               these). 

          Press [Esc] to save the file and continue the tour.

     3)   The next stop is the Dialing Directory.  To alter an entry
          or to add new ones, just press "E" to enter edit mode.  This
          is the same Internal Editor you used to modify the Setup
          File.  When you are finished making changes, press Esc to
          bring back the Selector Bar.  Then press Esc again to
          continue.

     4)   Next you will see a sample menu created by the Macro
          Processor.  Press Enter to continue and return to the
          Terminal Screen.  Then exit {COMMO} with the Alt-X command.

     5)   From the DOS prompt type "commo<cr>" to restart the program. 
          The new Setup File items will now be in effect.

     6)   IMPORTANT!  {COMMO}'s Auto Receive feature is set up to
          automatically start the program DSZ.COM (from Omen
          Technology) when the remote system sends a file using the
          Zmodem protocol.

          Do not request a file for downloading with Zmodem until you
          have this program installed in a directory that is in your
          DOS path (or in the current directory).  If "Bad command or
          filename" is displayed by DOS, just keep pressing Ctrl-X
          until it stops.  This message means you haven't installed
          DSZ properly.

          If things happen too quickly to see what is happening, you
          can use EXECute Preview Mode, which will allow you see the
          results of the command execution.  Use Alt-T to toggle
          Preview Mode on/off.

          The same principle applies to any other protocol drivers
          that you use, such as HS/Link, MPt, etc.  If you don't have
          any external protocol drivers installed, use the internal
          Xmodem protocol (use Xmodem-1k whenever possible since it is
          much faster).

     7)   When you see the Status Line at the bottom of the screen,
          you are in the Terminal Screen.  Now you may press Alt-D to
          enter the Dialing Directory.  Use the up and down arrow keys
          to select a system to call and press Enter.  {COMMO} will
          begin dialing.

     8)   When a connection is made with a remote system, {COMMO} will
          return to the Terminal Screen where you may interact with
          the remote.



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           14


          NOTE:  If your modem does not seem to operate properly (no
          connection is made or the data is garbled), read Appendix A
          "Setting Up Your Modem."  You may need to change the Modem
          Initialization String in the Setup File.  If you change it,
          exit and restart {COMMO} to send the new string.  Then try
          dialing again.


     Preparing Your System
     =====================

     The following sections give startup instructions in greater
     detail.

     Make sure that all of the files from the {COMMO} package are in
     one directory or on one diskette.  Four of these files are
     required to run the {COMMO} program:

          COMMO.COM      the Program File
          COMMO.SET      the Setup File
          COMMO.FON      the Dialing Directory File
          COMMO.MAC      the Macro File

     In addition, if Online Help is used (recommended):

          COMMO.HLP      the Online Help File

     There are two ways to make sure that {COMMO} will be able to find
     all of its files.  The first method is the simplest and should be
     used if you are not too familiar with DOS commands:

     1)   Make sure you are logged into the directory or disk drive
          where the files are located.  Then simply type "commo" at
          the DOS prompt.  If your files are in the directory
          "C:\COMMO" you would type:

               c:<cr>
               cd \commo<cr>
               commo<cr>

          (<cr> is the [Enter] or Return key)

          Or if the files are on a diskette in drive A you would type:

               a:<cr>
               commo<cr>

          {COMMO} will remember where the files are, so you will be
          able to change directory or drive later without concern.



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           15


     2)   The second method is a little more advanced, but allows you
          to run {COMMO} no matter what directory or drive you are
          currently logged into:

          Use the SET command in DOS to store the {COMMO} path into
          the "environment."  If you place this command in your
          AUTOEXEC.BAT file you won't have to change directories or
          diskettes to run {COMMO}.  If your files are in the
          directory "C:\COMMO" the command would be:

               set commo=c:\commo

          If the files are on the diskette in drive B the command
          would be:

               set commo=b:

          Do not use any extra spaces in the SET command.  And
          remember to place the {COMMO} directory or drive in your
          PATH command.

          IMPORTANT!  Be sure to check your "set commo=" command if
          you install {COMMO} into a different directory or onto
          another drive (or if you install a later release of the
          program).  If it points to the wrong directory, {COMMO} will
          not operate properly.  This is a common error and can cause
          a lot of head scratching.


     Command Line Options
     ====================

          _______________

          Dialing Strings
          _______________

     Dialing Strings are used to indicate numbers to dial at program
     startup.  If present, they must be placed before any command line
     switches.  {COMMO} will search the Dialing Directory for each
     string and mark the first entry where a match is found (case is
     ignored).

     The strings may consist of any part of a Dialing Directory entry
     line (usually part of the system name) and may be separated by
     commas or spaces.  The following characters may not appear in a
     command line Dialing String: space, comma, slash (/), curly
     braces.

     After entries in the Dialing Directory are marked, {COMMO} will
     check for a startup macro (specified on the command line or in
     the Setup File).  If a startup macro is present, it will be



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           16


     started.  Otherwise Multi Number Dialing of the marked systems
     will begin.

     Examples:

              commo telegodzilla joes-bbs 4567 

              commo zilla,joes,4567

     IMPORTANT!  The Modem Initialization String will normally be sent
     before dialing begins.  Your modem should be turned on and ready
     to receive the command string before you start {COMMO}.

          ________

          Switches
          ________

     Case is ignored and the switches may be in any order (Dialing
     Strings must precede them, however).

     NOTE:  Environment variables may also be used to communicate data
     to {COMMO} at program startup.  See the description of the
     SETVariable function in the Macro Programming Guide.

     /:label        Startup Macro.

          This switch can be used to override the "mac=" item in the
          Setup File.  The "label" is a one to eight character macro
          label.  If the label is found in the Macro File, macro
          processing will be started.  If the label is not found the
          switch will be ignored.

     /sfilename          Alternate Setup File.
     /dfilename          Alternate Dialing Directory File.
     /mfilename          Alternate Macro File

          Only the filename should be specified.  The {COMMO} home
          directory will be assumed for the path.

          If an alternate Macro File is specified, it will become the
          default Macro File.  This means it will be reloaded when the
          "R" switch is used with the MACLoad macro function.

     /knn           Scrollback Buffer size.

          This switch will override the "sbs=" item in the Setup File. 
          "nn" is kilobytes and may be 0 to 64.

     /i[y/n]        Modem Initialization override.



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           17


          Forces the Modem Initialization String to be sent ("/iy") or
          not sent ("/in").  This will override the "min=" item in the
          Setup File.

     Example:

     C:\COMMO> commo joes zilla /:mailrun /dother.dir /k25 /in

          Two systems will be marked in the Dialing Directory.

          The macro "mailrun" will be started if it exists in the
          Macro File.

          The alternate Dialing Directory "other.dir" will be loaded.

          The Scrollback Buffer will be set to 25k in size.

          The Modem Initialization String will not be sent.


     {COMMO} Support Files
     =====================

     The {COMMO} files are standard ASCII text files and may be
     modified with any editor (or word processor in "non-document"
     mode).  From within {COMMO} they may be edited with {COMMO}'s
     Internal Editor.

     The only control characters (below ASCII 28) allowed in the
     support files are CR/LF pairs and an EOF at the end.  {COMMO}'s
     Internal Editor adheres to this rule.  Control characters may be
     represented as shown in Appendix D.  For example, an ASCII 16
     would be written as ^P.

     Key definitions for the Internal Editor are given in Online Help. 
     A Color Chart will be displayed in the editor when F7 is pressed
     (useful in the Setup File and for the DISPlay function in the
     Macro File).

     NOTE:  {COMMO} generally retains the Dialing Directory and Macro
     File in memory during program operation.  If you use an external
     editor to modify them while in the Shell to DOS (or using the
     EXEC macro function), your changes could be lost.  See "Saving
     the Support Files" below.

     Following is a brief description of each file. 

     1)   COMMO.SET.  The Setup File contains settings for many
          important parameters.  The first time you run {COMMO} you
          should use the Alt-G key command to edit this file to your
          own needs.  See "Alt-G  Edit Setup File" for details on each
          item.



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           18



     2)   COMMO.FON.  The Dialing Directory File.  This file contains
          information about each system that you will be calling,
          including the telephone number, password, Linked Macro and
          serial port parameter overrides.  Use the Alt-D key command
          to dial numbers and to edit this file.  Details are given in
          the section "Alt-D  Dialing Directory."

     3)   COMMO.MAC.  The Macro File.  Use the Alt-M key command to
          select a macro for execution and to edit this file.  A
          complete description of {COMMO} macros is given in the Macro
          Programming Guide.  A summary of macro functions and key
          designators is also given in Online Help.

     4)   COMMO.HLP.  The Online Help File.  This file contains the
          information for {COMMO}'s context-related Online Help.  See
          "How to Use Online Help" later in this document.


     Saving the Support Files
     ========================

     Whenever a change is made to any file, the internal change flag
     is set for that file (indicated by an "*" next to the column
     number in the Internal Editor).

     The Dialing Directory and Macro File will be saved automatically
     when you exit {COMMO} (if the change flag is set).  The Setup
     File and other files that you may edit will be saved when you
     press Esc to exit the editor.

     You may press Alt-F in the Internal Editor to immediately save
     any file.

     If you do not wish to save your changes to the Dialing Directory
     or Macro File, you may press Alt-Q while in the Internal Editor. 
     This will reset {COMMO}'s change flag and the file will not be
     saved when exiting the program.  Any subsequent changes to the
     file will set the change flag again.  Pressing Alt-Q while
     editing any other file will simply cancel the edit.


     Initialization Procedure
     ========================

     When {COMMO} begins running it will read and process the Setup
     File, COMMO.SET.  Then it will attempt to load into memory:

          (1) the Dialing Directory     COMMO.FON
          (2) the Macro File            COMMO.MAC



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           19


     Any problems encountered will be reported.  These problems must
     be corrected before restarting the program.

     Automatic modem initialization will occur if requested in the
     Setup File with {min=yes}, or by the "/iy" command line switch. 
     Use the "/in" switch to suppress modem initialization if you are
     already on line.

     Please note that {COMMO} does NOT change the video display mode. 
     Instead {COMMO} can adapt to any text mode that is set when the
     program is started.  Check the items under "Video and Chat Mode"
     in the Setup File for details.  See also the section "[Alt-G] 
     Edit Setup File" later in this document.

     If the display does not look right try executing the DOS command 
     "mode co80" or "mode bw80" prior to calling {COMMO}.


     Terminal Screen
     ===============

     The Terminal Screen allows you to see the characters coming in
     from the serial port.  Any characters that you type will be sent
     out to the serial port.  If you are connected to another system
     you will be interacting with that system.

     Keep in mind that you will also be interacting with {COMMO} and
     with your own computer via key commands (Alt keys, for example). 
     These key commands have no effect on the remote system unless
     they cause characters to be sent to the serial port (pressing
     Alt-W to send your password, for example).

     ====================
     {COMMO} Key Commands
     ====================

     The Alt Keys shown in this section are the built-in default key
     assignments for the various {COMMO} commands.  Once you are
     familiar with these commands you may use the Macro Processor to
     reassign any of the keys.

     Keys used within the various command windows are properly
     detailed in Online Help.  Please press F1 from any command window
     to invoke {COMMO}'s context-related help system.

     Note that certain features are only available as macro functions. 
     Refer to the Macro Programming Guide for details.


     ======================
     [Alt-A]   ASCII Upload
     ======================

     This command is used to send prepared messages or any text files
     to the remote system.  Enter the pathname of the file you wish to
     send.  Note that the input field will be blank unless a macro is
     used to prompt with a path.  The macro supplied in COMMO.MAC is:

          {:ala} {ascii %uldir\} {}          ASCII Upload with path

     Notice the "\" following the path variable.  It tells {COMMO} to
     prompt for the filename.  If you needed to specify a colon for
     pacing (see below) you could change this to:

          {:ala} {ascii %uldir\,:} {}        ASCII Upload with path

     There is no special error checking associated with ASCII Upload. 
     It is intended primarily for sending message responses and other
     short text files.  For longer files, binary files or compressed
     files (.ARC, .ZIP) you will want to use error checking protocols
     such as Xmodem, Zmodem, MPt, etc.  See "Uploading / Downloading."

     A number of parameters are used to control an ASCII Upload:

          ___________

          Line Pacing
          ___________

     IMPORTANT!  Line Pacing is used to keep transmitted data
     synchronized with received (echoed) data and is normally used
     ONLY when the remote is sending a prompt for each line, usually
     "nn:" or "nn?".  "nn" is a line number and ":" or "?" is the
     prompt or "pacing character."



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           21



     {COMMO} will wait up to 5 seconds for the pacing character, then
     send the next line.  If there is a 5 second delay between the
     sending of each line, then either you have the wrong pacing
     character or you don't need line pacing (you don't need it when
     using a full-screen editor, for example).

     At any time, the Spacebar may be pressed to force transmission of
     the next line.  This is very useful when you have set the wrong
     pacing character or if you wish to send each line manually.  In
     the latter case, use any pacing character that is different from
     the one in the line prompt.

     To use line pacing, enter the pacing character when {COMMO} asks
     for it in the ASCII Upload window.  NOTE:  The receive Translate
     Table can affect the pacing character if receive translation is
     ON.

     The initial pacing character is configurable.  See "[Alt-G]  Edit
     Setup File."

     The pacing character may be any character including control
     characters, e.g. "^m" or "|" for carriage return.  See Appendix D
     for details on how to represent special characters.

     See also Appendix C "Flow Control."

          ________________

          Character Pacing
          ________________

     You may insert a delay between each character using the Inter-
     Character Delay feature.  This should only be used when the
     remote is so slow that it drops characters.  See "Set Terminal
     Parameters" for details.

          ___________________

          Stripping Linefeeds
          ___________________

     Normally you will want to strip linefeeds from your outgoing
     text.  This will appear to the remote as if you are typing the
     data.  But if all your data displays on the same line at the
     remote, then you must configure {COMMO} to send the linefeeds.

     NOTE:  This item is initialized in the Setup File.

          _____________________

          Expanding Blank Lines
          _____________________

     You may configure {COMMO} to send a space character whenever a
     blank line is encountered in the text file you are sending.  This
     will prevent your message from terminating prematurely if you are
     sending to a BBS message editor.  Blank line expansion is not
     normally required when sending to a "full screen" BBS editor.

     NOTE:  This item is initialized in the Setup File.


     ===========================
     [Alt-B]   Send Break Signal
     ===========================

     A one second Break Signal will be sent.  This signal is used by
     some systems to interrupt certain operations.  Use it only when
     the remote system directs you to do so.


     ======================
     [Alt-C]   Clear Screen
     ======================

     The Terminal Screen will be cleared and the current colors will
     be set to the Setup File defaults.


     ===========================
     [Alt-D]   Dialing Directory
     ===========================

     The Dialing Directory is your data base of telephone numbers. 
     From the directory window you can select numbers to dial and also
     update the directory using the Internal Editor.

     Refer to Online Help for a complete description of the commands
     available in the Dialing Directory window.

     NOTE:  Any number of Variable Items may be added following the
     Terminal Parameters item (see below).


     IMPORTANT!  Items in curly braces must be present (they are
     positional).  Items which are not used must have a null string {}
     as a placeholder.  You may omit null strings at the end of the
     line.

     Directory entries are limited to one per line.  Lines may be up
     to 255 characters in length.  {COMMO}'s Internal Editor will
     scroll horizontally to follow the cursor.

     Comments may be placed anywhere outside the curly braces or on
     separate lines.

     System Name      File City BBS
     ______________________________

          Up to 40 characters in length,  it must NOT be enclosed in
          curly braces.  The System Name will be displayed on the
          Status Line after connection, unless the Signal Lights
          option is selected.  It will also be part of a Usage Log
          entry if the log is enabled.

     Telephone Number      {1-707-555-1234}
     ______________________________________

          Spaces and hyphens are ignored by most modems.  The Dialing
          Prefix, Telephone Number and Dialing Suffix are strung
          together to form a dialing command (may be up to 128
          characters total).  Refer to your modem manual for details
          on dialing commands.

          Normally the default Dialing Prefix (usually "ATDT") and the
          default Dialing Suffix (usually "|") will be used.  These



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           24


          are specified in the Setup File.  You may also have any
          number of alternate prefixes and suffixes by defining them
          with SET items in the Setup File.

          For example, if you wanted your prefix for a certain entry
          to be "ATM1L3DT" (to turn on the modem speaker LOUD), you
          could put this item in your Setup File:

               {set spkrpref,ATM1L3DT}       Loud speaker prefix

          Then your entry might look like this:

               File City  {%spkrpref%555-1234} {pword} {city} {}

          The prefix "spkrpref" will override the default prefix if it
          is at the very beginning of the telephone number field. 
          Similarly, an override suffix may be specified if it is at
          the very end of the field.

          Notice that these are variable names and must be bracketed
          between "%" characters.  Variables may be placed anywhere
          else within the number field as well, but they will not
          override the default prefix or suffix unless they are at the
          very beginning or very end, respectively.

          You may use variables defined with SET items in the Setup
          File or variables set within macros.

     _________________________________

     System Password      {mypassword}
     _________________________________

          A different Password String may be defined for each system
          that you call.  Passwords may be up to 64 characters in
          length.

          The Password String may be sent by pressing Alt-W or by
          using the variable "_pas" in a SEND macro function.

          Passwords are invisible in the Dialing Directory window, but
          appear when you enter [E]dit mode.

          Rules for writing passwords are in Appendix D.

     Linked Macro      {city}  
     ________________________

          If a valid Linked Macro is specified, it will be started
          when a connection is established with the remote system.  If
          no macro is specified (or the macro label is not found),
          {COMMO} will enter the Terminal Screen.

     ___________________________

     Terminal Parameters      {}
     ___________________________

          This item allows you to override any or all of the Default
          Dialing Parameters for the current call.  Prior to dialing
          each number, {COMMO} will set all Terminal Parameters to the
          Dialing Defaults (which are initialized from the Setup File
          at program startup, but may be changed with the DPARms macro
          function or with the Alt-P key command).

          If a system requires parameters that are different from the
          Dialing Defaults, specify them in this item.

          The general form of this item is:

               {speed,format,comport,terminal-type,delay}

          For example, you might have "{,7,,V}", which would set the
          Data Format to "7e1" and the Terminal-type to VT102, but
          would use the Dialing Defaults for the other parameters.

          See "Set Terminal Parameters" for a complete description of
          each field.  See also "AutoBaud Detect."

          current date whenever a connection is made with the system. 
          It may appear anywhere on the entry line (outside the curly
          braces).  Place "00/00/00" to start it.  The Dialing
          Directory file will be saved to disk when you exit {COMMO}.

     Variable Items      {name,string}
     _________________________________

          Any number of Variable Items may be included in a directory
          entry and will be set just prior to dialing.  The "string"
          may not contain any variables.  The first Variable Item must
          follow the Terminal Parameters item (all other items must be
          present as placeholders even if some are null).  Example:

            Joes-BBS  {555-1234} {pword} {mac} {} {bbsid,joesbbs} ...

     [Alt-G]   Edit Setup File
     =========================

     Pressing Alt-G allows you to edit the Setup File, COMMO.SET (see
     "Internal Editor" in Online Help for details on editing).  The
     Setup File contains initial settings for many parameters used by
     {COMMO}.

     Items changed with the editor are not effective until the next
     time you start the program.  However, most items may be changed
     with key commands and/or macro functions while the program is
     running.

     Each item in the Setup File is enclosed in curly braces.  Items
     are designated with three letter "keywords" and may be present in
     any order.  There are no "required" items.  Most missing items
     will take on the default values shown in the examples below (AUT
     items and SET items have no default values).

     All text outside the curly braces is commentary and is ignored by
     {COMMO}.  Avoid using curly braces other than to bracket setup
     items.


     Predefining Variables with SET
     ==============================

     SET items predefine variables in {COMMO}'s String Variable Space. 
     The general form of a SET item is

          {set name,string}.

               name      Any valid variable name.

               string    A text string to assign to the name.  The
                         string may not contain any variables.

     Any number of SET items may appear in the Setup File.  They may
     be used later in macros, in telephone numbers, etc.

     See the Macro Programming Guide for more information on
     variables.

     ___________________________________________________

          This item defines the reserved variable "_modini" (notice
          that the string itself begins following the comma).

          The Modem Initialization String is normally sent to your
          modem when {COMMO} is started or when you press Alt-O.  

          If you are using a 1200 bps modem you should remove the "&C1
          &D2" commands.  In either case the "X" command may have to
          be adjusted.  See Appendix A "Setting Up Your Modem."

     ________________________________________________________

          These are used to control the flow of data between your
          computer and the remote system.  They prevent loss of data
          when one end can send faster than the other end can process
          the information.  See Appendix C for details.

     ________________________________________________

          Leave this "no" if you want to exit {COMMO} and return while
          still connected to a host.  "Yes" will normally cause the
          modem to hang up when exiting.

          Some hosts send an ENQ control character (^E) periodically
          and require that the terminal "answer back" with an ACK
          (^F).  Set this item to "yes" only if your host requires
          this.

     {ncr=}         Macro to execute when carrier is lost
     ____________________________________________________

          Specify a macro label here and {COMMO} will execute the
          macro when carrier detect is lost.  Example:

               {ncr=carrlost}

          IMPORTANT:  This feature is enabled only when a connection
          is made using {COMMO}'s Auto Dialer.  Also, if carrier drops
          while a macro is running or a command window is open (such
          as the Dialing Directory or Capture File Options), the
          carrier lost macro will not activate.

          Be sure that you have your modem configured to provide the
          carrier detect signal.  See Appendix A for modem
          information.

          These items are used to place values into the character
          translation tables at program startup and, if desired, to
          turn translation ON.  Multiple receive or send items may be

          Character translation is used when you wish certain
          characters to be changed into other characters as they are
          received from, or as they are sent to, the remote system. 
          You may also cause received characters to be ignored.

          Examples:

               {rtr=y,7,0,36,156}

                    Turn ON receive translation ("y").

                    Change the bell character (ASCII 7) to null (ASCII
                    0, which will not display).

                    Change the "$" (ASCII 36) to ASCII 156.

               {str=#26,97,65,42,43,#10,48,128}

                    Change 26 consecutive values starting at 97 to
                    consecutive values starting at 65.  This will
                    change all lowercase letters (ASCII 97 to 122) to
                    uppercase letters (ASCII 65 to 90).

                    Change the "*" (ASCII 42) to a "+" (ASCII 43).

                    Change 10 consecutive values starting at 48 to
                    consecutive values starting at 128.  This will
                    change the digits 0 through 9 (ASCII 48 to 57) to
                    ASCII 128 to 137.

                    The ON/OFF state of send translation will not be
                    changed (no "y" or "n" is present).

          A "y", to turn translation ON, must be the first argument,
          if present.  It may be used on any "rtr" or "str" item and
          will apply to all 256 values in either the receive table or
          the send table.  Note that translation defaults to OFF when
          {COMMO} is started.

          Use a PAIR of arguments to change a single value.

          Use THREE arguments to change a range of consecutive values
          to another range of consecutive values.  The "#" operator on
          the first argument specifies the number of values to change,
          followed by the starting values for each range.

          The macro functions RTRAn and STRAn have similar argument
          lists.  In addition they allow you to restore each Translate
          Table to default values and to turn translation ON and OFF
          without disturbing the values in the tables.  See the Macro
          Programming Guide for more details.

          These are the hardware serial port base address and IRQ
          assignments.  The settings shown are the most common, but
          some serial adapters are different.  The serial adapter
          manual may give a range of addresses, for example "3f8-3ff." 
          Use the first value as the base address.

     {cdm=yes}      Clear dialing marks when saving directory (yes/no)
     _________________________________________________________________

          If this is "yes", dialing marks will not be written to disk
          when saving the Dialing Directory file.  Set it to "no" if
          you wish the marks to be saved with the file (to be used in
          the next session).

          Note that changes to dialing marks (mark or unmark) will not
          cause the file to be saved upon exit from {COMMO}.  If no
          other changes occur (such as Date Last Called), you must use
          Alt-F in the Internal Editor to save the marks.

     {set _dialpf,ATDT }      Default Dialing Prefix
     {set _dialsf, |}         Default Dialing Suffix
     _______________________________________________

          These reserved variables define strings that will be used to
          create the modem dialing command.  The prefix, telephone
          number and suffix will be strung together in that order and
          sent to your modem when you dial.

          Any number of additional prefixes and suffixes may be used
          by including variables in the telephone number string (see
          "[Alt-D]  Dialing Directory" for details).



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           32


          Use "ATDP" if you don't have a tone line.  Use "ATDT9," to
          get an outside line on a switchboard.  The suffix is usually
          just a carriage return (|).  Your modem manual has
          additional tips on dialing prefixes and suffixes.

     _______________________________________________

     {dct=45}       Dialing cycle time-out (seconds)
     _______________________________________________

          The maximum time to wait before hanging up and redialing. 
          Adjust if your modem needs more time to complete a call.

     _______________________________________________________

     {idt=2}        Delay between dialing attempts (seconds)
     _______________________________________________________

          Amount of time to wait between dialing attempts.  Adjust to
          give incoming calls a greater chance of getting through.

                                        Dialing failure response(s) 
     ______________________________________________________________

          These reserved variables each define a list of response
          codes that can be found in your modem manual.  Do not
          include the speed in the CONNECT response if you are
          enabling AutoBaud.

          Some modems use a CARRIER response to indicate the modem
          speed, e.g. CARRIER 2400.  Using this instead of CONNECT
          will improve the accuracy of the Usage Log.  In order to
          avoid confusion with a NO CARRIER response, you should use:

           {set _dialsr,CARRIER }    Notice the space after CARRIER.

          Responses are case sensitive.  There should be no null
          strings or extra spaces.

          These variables are used in some of the macros in COMMO.MAC
          and SAMPLES.MAC, primarily in the Uploading and Downloading

     _______________________________________________________________

          This variable is used in macros that require an Omen
          Technology external protocol driver program.  Just enter one
          of the three programs shown and all of the Zmodem and Ymodem
          macros will use it (including the MOSTHOST).

     {set _uselog,c:\commo\commo.log}   Pathname for Usage Log
     _________________________________________________________

          This is a reserved variable that tells {COMMO} where to find
          your Usage Log.  The Usage Log keeps a record of the calls
          you make.  If a valid pathname is specified, entries will be
          made when:

               1) You connect to a system.
               2) You transfer a file using an internal protocol.
               3) You disconnect (or exit {COMMO}).

          IMPORTANT!  In order for the log to function properly your
          modem must be set to provide "true carrier detect" (see
          Appendix A).

          Use a null pathname or remove this item to disable the Usage
          Log.  A null pathname would look like this:

               {set _uselog}

          The Usage Log should be disabled when you are connecting
          directly to another computer (with a null modem cable).

          Specify the same log file as your external protocol driver
          (e.g., DSZ.LOG or MPT.LOG) and you will have a complete
          record of your calls, including upload/download statistics.

     {pac=}         ASCII Upload pacing character
     ________________________________________________

          These items are used with the ASCII Upload feature.

          Blank line expansion sends a space and a carriage return,
          instead of just a carriage return for lines with no data. 
          This prevents BBS line editors from terminating prematurely.



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           35


          Stripping linefeeds gives the data the appearance of being
          entered manually.  Linefeeds should not be stripped when the
          remote is not in "edit" mode.

          The pacing character shown is null (no pacing).  To use a
          ":" for pacing, change the item to

               {pac=:}

     {tek=no}       Test for enhanced keyboard (yes/no)
     __________________________________________________

          Set this to "yes" if your system supports the enhanced (101
          key) keyboard.  This will enable you to assign F11, F12 and
          a number of other keys to your macros.  See Appendix A

     {dca=yes}      Dialing connection alarm (yes/no)
     ________________________________________________

          Controls the alarm that signals a connection when Auto
          Dialing is used.  The alarm will not be sounded when a valid

          a key at any time to stop the alarm.

     _________________________________________________________

     {sbs=10}       Scrollback buffer size in kilobytes (0-64)
     _________________________________________________________

          The actual minimum size of the buffer (which {COMMO} will
          compute) depends on the number of screen lines and columns. 
          For a 25x80 screen it will be about 4k bytes -- it will be
          larger for screens with more lines and/or columns.  This
          includes room to save the current screen.

          Setting the size to 0 disables the Scrollback feature.  See
          also "Scrollback."

     {adn=no}       Auto-detect number of rows and columns (yes/no)
     ______________________________________________________________

          {COMMO} will support 25 to 127 rows and 80 to 255 columns on
          the display, but you MUST set the display into the proper
          mode before starting the program (EGA/VGA adapters usually
          come with utilities to set modes such as 50x80, 44x132,
          etc.).

          Set this item to "yes" if you want {COMMO} to automatically
          obtain the current number of rows and columns from the
          system.  Most systems provide this information.  If the
          display is unsatisfactory, you may have to set it to "no."

          NOTE:  The cursor may not display properly in 43 line mode. 
          This is a problem with some EGA adapters.

     ________________________________________________________

     {ucw=18}       Number of lines in upper Chat Mode window
     ________________________________________________________

          This allows you to adjust the line "split" in Chat Mode. 
          The minimum number of lines in the upper or lower window is
          three.

     _______________________________________________________________

     {swe=no}       Send when Enter is pressed in Chat Mode (yes/no)
     _______________________________________________________________

          If "no" {COMMO} will send each character as you type it.  If
          "yes" {COMMO} will wait until you press Enter, then send all
          that you have typed.

     _________________________________________________

     {sfi=no}       Speech Friendly Interface (yes/no) 
     _________________________________________________

          If this is "yes" {COMMO} will be much friendlier to users
          with speech synthesizer boards (these enable blind users to
          read the computer display).  Terminal Screen data and many
          error and information messages will be displayed using the
          BIOS.  Also, the up and down arrow keys move the cursor
          instead of scrolling the screen in windows such as Online
          Help, Scrollback and View String Variable Space.

     {sno=no}       Snow checking on CGA adapter (yes/no)
     ______________________________________________________________

          Change these video parameters only if necessary.

          o    BIOS scrolling enables external scrollback programs to
               work, but is slower and may cause "flicker" in certain
               displays.

          o    Snow checking will also slow the display, but will help
               to eliminate the "snow" effect on CGA monitors.

     {ema=no}       Enable mono attributes (yes/no)
     ______________________________________________

          If this is "no" the default mono attributes will be used, no
          matter what colors are set in the following items.  Set it
          to "yes" if you want to set your own monochrome attributes
          (high intensity, reverse video, underline, etc.).  This has
          no effect on color displays.

          NOTE:  For the most accurate ANSI-BBS or VT102 terminal
          emulation, the Terminal Screen colors should be set to {07}. 
          In many cases, {COMMO} uses this color when clearing
          portions of the screen or when a "reset attributes" sequence
          is received from the host.

          "File windows" are full-screen windows such as the Dialing
          Directory, Macro File, Scrollback Buffer, etc.  "Small
          windows" are the pop up windows such as Capture File Options
          or ASCII Upload.



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           40


          Colors should be set so that the different parts of the
          screen contrast with each other.  For example the Status
          Line should be easily discernable from the rest of the
          Terminal Screen.  And the borders and Selector Bar should
          stand out against the text portion of the file windows.


     (End of Setup File items)


     =================
     [Alt-H]   Hang Up
     =================

     Disconnects the call by dropping DTR.  This will put the modem
     "on-hook" if response to DTR is enabled (see Appendix A).  If
     your modem does not respond properly, you may define a macro to
     send a "hang-up" command.  For modems using the "AT" command set
     the macro would look like this:

        {alh} {send ~~~+++~~~ATH|} {}    Press Alt-H to hangup
        
     Of course, you may assign this macro to any key you like.


     ===========================
     [Alt-I]   Screen Image Save
     ===========================

     The Screen Image Save is used to append all of the text currently
     on the screen to a disk file.  This is sometimes handier than
     repeatedly opening and closing the Capture File.

     TIPS on using Screen Image Save:

     >    The pathname may not be the same as the pathname of an open
          Capture File.

     >    If the file cannot be opened, the old pathname is retained.

     NOTE:  The current Screen Image Save file is also used to save
     blocks of text in the Scrollback feature.

     See also "Capture File Options" and "Scrollback."

     ====================
     [Alt-K]   Scrollback
     ====================

     Scrollback allows you to see what was previously on your screen. 
     Screen data is saved to a memory buffer (the size is defined in
     the Setup File).  Set the size to 0 to disable the feature
     entirely.

     A number of commands are available in Scrollback:

     1)   You may navigate as in the Online Help file -- scroll
          up/down, page up/down, beginning/end of buffer, etc.

     2)   Use the String Search feature available in all {COMMO} file
          windows.

     3)   Change the Screen Image Save pathname.

     4)   Write any part of the Scrollback buffer to the current
          Screen Image Save file.

     5)   Exit and return to the same place the next time you call
          Scrollback.

     6)   Jump directly to the Dialing Directory or Macro Processor
          windows.


     =========================
     [Alt-M]   Macro Processor
     =========================

     The Macro Processor executes {COMMO} macros which are resident in
     memory.  Macros are loaded at program startup from a Macro File
     (the default is COMMO.MAC, but an alternate file may be loaded
     using the "/m" command line switch).  A new Macro File can be
     loaded at any time using the MACLoad macro function.  The Macro
     File is maintained with the Internal Editor.

     IMPORTANT:  Only macros resident in memory may be executed.

     The Macro Programming Guide shows you how easily you can automate
     program operations, link to external protocols (used for
     Uploading/Downloading), assign keys and perform a myriad of other
     functions.

     See Online Help for details on operations within the Macro
     Processor window.

     ==============================
     [Alt-N]   Multi Number Dialing
     ==============================

     Any number of entries may be "marked" in the Dialing Directory,
     then automatically dialed in sequence until a connection is
     established.  Multi Number Dialing may be initiated in one of
     four ways:

     1)   Bring up the Dialing Directory window with Alt-D, then move
          the Selector Bar to each desired entry and press [Space]
          (repeat the procedure to unmark an entry).  Press Alt-N to
          begin dialing at the location of the Selector Bar.

     2)   Specify entries with Dialing Strings on the command line
          used to run {COMMO} (see "Command Line Options").  Specified
          entries will be marked and dialed in sequence when {COMMO}
          is started.

     3)   Specify entries with Dialing Strings in a macro, using the
          MARK function.  Refer to the Macro Programming Guide.

     4)   Press Alt-N from the Terminal Screen.  Dialing of marked
          entries will resume with the next system in the sequence.

     See also "[Alt-D]  Dialing Directory" and the DIAL function in
     the Macro Programming Guide. 


     ==========================================
     [Alt-O]   Send Modem Initialization String
     ==========================================

     Pressing Alt-O at any time from the Terminal Screen will cause
     the Modem Initialization String to be sent to the modem (if one
     is defined).  This is useful if your modem was powered off or if
     the modem setup was changed.


     =================================
     [Alt-P]   Set Terminal Parameters
     =================================

     The Terminal Parameters affect the transmission of data to and
     from your computer.  They are usually displayed or defined with a
     string.  For example:

               {2400,8n1,1,A,0}    Speed,format,port,terminal,delay.

     {COMMO} keeps two complete sets of Terminal Parameters:



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           43


          1)   The Current Parameters as shown on the left side of the
               Status Line.

          2)   The Default Dialing Parameters.  These will be set each
               time a number is dialed unless overridden by parameters
               in the Dialing Directory.


     Parameter Descriptions
     ======================

          _____

          Speed
          _____

     The rate at which data travels between your computer and your
     modem (or remote system if no modem is used).  It is specified as
     "bits per second" or "bps."  Allowable values are 300, 600, 1200,
     2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200.  These may be
     abbreviated to the first two characters in Serial Port Parameter
     strings.

     See "AutoBaud Detect" for more information on setting the Speed.

          ___________

          Data Format
          ___________

     This consists of three parts.  Allowable values are:

          character length:   7, 8
          parity:             [n]one, [e]ven, [o]dd, [m]ark, [s]pace
          stop-bits:          1, 2

     Examples:

          7o2       7 bit characters, odd parity, 2 stop bits
          8m1       8 bit characters, mark parity, 1 stop bit

     The most common formats, "8n1" and "7e1", may be abbreviated to
     "8" and "7" in parameter strings, such as:

          {2400,8,1,A,0}



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           44


          ___________

          Serial Port
          ___________

     The channel your computer uses to talk to the outside world.  May
     be 1, 2, 3 or 4 (for Com1, Com2, Com3 or Com4).

     NOTE:  PCjr users without the internal modem should specify Com2.

          _______________________

          Terminal Emulation Type
          _______________________

     {COMMO} supports the following terminal types:

          ANSI-BBS  (A)  For calling most bulletin board systems.
          VT102     (V)  For calling certain mainframes and online
                         services.
          TTY       (T)  For turning off almost all control functions
                         (lets you see ANSI control sequences).
          TTY(40)   (H)  HP 95LX version only.  Wraps terminal lines
                         at 40 columns.  Use when the host cannot be
                         configured for 40 columns.

          _____________________

          Inter-Character Delay
          _____________________

     This factor defines the amount of delay to insert between
     characters transmitted by the SEND macro function and by ASCII
     Upload.  Use only when the remote is too slow to process the data
     (drops characters).

     Each unit is about 5 thousandths of a second (5 ms) on a 4.77 MHz
     XT class machine.  Faster machines require higher values -- on a
     12 MHz AT each unit will only be about 1 ms.

     For example, to delay 20 ms between characters (50 cps) use a
     factor of:

                4 on 4.77 MHz XT
               16 on 12 MHz AT
               27 on 20 MHz 386

     The factor will also vary when you use multi-tasking software, so
     adjust as necessary.  The maximum delay allowed is one second.

     Setting Terminal Parameters
     ===========================

          __________________________

          With the Alt-P Key Command
          __________________________

     Alt-P may be used at any time to change the Current Parameters or
     the Default Dialing Parameters.  Remember that Current Parameters
     will be reset to the Default Dialing Parameters whenever dialing
     begins.

          ________________________

          In the Dialing Directory
          ________________________

     Serial Port Parameters may be specified in a Dialing Directory
     entry to override the Default Dialing Parameters.  Specify only
     values that are different.  For example:

          {,,3,V}   A different serial port and terminal emulation is
                    required for this call.

          {,8o2}    Unusual format required.

          __________________________________________

          Using the Macro functions PARMs and DPARms
          __________________________________________

     Use these to set parameters during macro execution.  See the
     Macro Programming Guide.


     ======================
     [Alt-S]   Shell to DOS
     ======================

     When you Shell to DOS {COMMO} remains resident in memory and you
     may perform any DOS functions as you normally do.  Since {COMMO}
     is small in size, most of your memory is available when you use
     this key command.

     =====================
     [Alt-T]   Set Toggles
     =====================

     This key command is used to set a number of miscellaneous toggle
     (yes/no) parameters.  Some take effect while you are still in the
     Set Toggles window -- others when you exit the window.

     Some of the toggles will be described here.  The others are
     detailed in their respective sections of this document.


     Sound Control Toggle
     ====================

     This is the Master Sound Control toggle.  When sound is OFF all
     alarms, sounds and beeps will be silenced.  Alarms are
     individually controlled with items in the Setup File and with the
     "A" switch in EXECute macro functions.


     AutoBaud Toggle
     ===============

     AutoBaud Detect enables {COMMO} to automatically adjust to the
     line speed of the system you are calling.  You won't have to hang
     up and call back when you get the wrong speed.

     TIPS on using AutoBaud:

     >    Your modem must be set to return the connection speed
          responses such as "CONNECT 1200" (see Appendix A "Setting Up
          Your Modem").

     >    The Default Dialing Speed in the Setup File should be set to
          your modem's highest speed.

          ____________________

          Most 2400 bps modems
          ____________________

     Toggle AutoBaud Detect to the ON state.  Set the Default Dialing
     Speed in the Setup File to 2400.  The following modem responses
     will cause the indicated actions:

          CONNECT 2400  -->  serial port remains at 2400 bps
          CONNECT 1200  -->  serial port adjusted to 1200 bps
          CONNECT       -->  serial port adjusted to 300 bps



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           47


          _________________

          High-speed modems
          _________________


     Most high-speed modems require that the serial port be "locked"
     at 19200 bps or 38400 bps.  The modem will then automatically
     adjust to the line (modem-to-modem) speed.  In this case AutoBaud
     must be turned OFF to prevent {COMMO} from changing the serial
     port speed.

     IMPORTANT!  Check your modem manual for details.


     Local Echo Toggle
     =================

     Local Echo (sometimes called half-duplex) is normally used when
     you connect to a host that does not echo what you type.  {COMMO}
     will assume that the host is sending a linefeed with each
     carriage return.

     Typed characters will be displayed directly to the screen.


     Signal Lights Toggle
     ====================

     Turns ON/OFF the "modem lights" display on the Status Line. 
     Shows the state of the RS-232C signals, including send and
     receive.

     This toggles the right half of the Status Line from the System
     Name to the Signal Lights Display.  See "What is on the Status
     Line" in Online Help for a complete description of the Status
     Line indicators.


     ======================
     [Alt-U]   Utility Menu
     ======================

     The Utility Menu is supported by a macro in COMMO.MAC.  It
     contains a selection of features created by {COMMO} macros.

     Example features include:

          Edit any external text file less than 64k in size.
          Run any macro by name (label).
          Run the host mode macro, MOSTHOST.MAC.
          Edit the host mode macro.



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           48



     NOTE:  The Utility Menu will not be available when another Macro
     File has been loaded by the MACLoad macro function.


     ===============================
     [Alt-W]   Send Current Password
     ===============================

     Each entry in the Dialing Directory can have its own Password
     String.  After dialing a number, the Alt-W key command will send
     the current Password String to the remote system.

     For additional details on Passwords see "[Alt-D]  Dialing
     Directory."


     ===========================
     [Alt-X]   Exit from {COMMO}
     ===========================

     This key command will cause {COMMO} to terminate, saving all
     support files with outstanding changes.

     You may configure {COMMO} to leave DTR high when exiting so that
     you may exit and remain connected to a system (this is the
     default, see "[Alt-G]  Edit Setup File").

     If you re-enter {COMMO} while still online you should use the
     "/in" command line switch to prevent the Modem Initialization
     String from being sent.

     Alt-X may also be pressed from the Dialing Directory, Macro File
     or Scrollback windows for a quick exit.


     ==============================
     [Alt-1]   Capture File Options
     ==============================

     When Capture is OPEN all information written to your screen will
     be saved to the designated disk file.  This command allows you
     to:

          1)   OPEN/CLOSE the Capture File.
          2)   Change to a different file.
          3)   Change the Capture Mode.

     Data may be captured in one of three modes.  The startup Capture
     Mode is selected in the Setup File.



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           49


          If the mode is set to SCREEN, data will be captured exactly
          as it appears on the Terminal Screen.  This mode greatly
          improves the appearance of data captured from screens drawn
          with ANSI positioning sequences (animation).

          FILTER mode is used primarily when you need to capture lines
          longer than the width of the screen (e.g., to be printed on
          a wide carriage printer).  ANSI control sequences will be
          stripped out if ANSI-BBS or VT102 emulation is on. 
          Characters will be translated if the receive Translate Table
          is on.

          Use RAW mode when you want all data captured exactly as it
          comes from the serial port.  ANSI control sequences will not
          be stripped and length of lines will be preserved.  This
          mode can be used to capture ANSI animation and color to be
          "played back" later.

     TIPS on using the Capture File:

     >    IMPORTANT!  When capturing to a floppy drive, the diskette
          should not be removed until the Capture File is closed (this
          also applies if the "disk full" message appears).  DOS is
          unaware of a disk change and may overwrite the replacement
          disk.

     >    The old file will be closed if a new file is opened.

     >    If Capture Mode is set to SCREEN, text will be saved as it
          scrolls OFF the screen.  To prevent loss of data, the entire
          screen will be saved in the following situations:

               (1) whenever the screen is cleared
               (2) Capture is closed with Alt-1
               (3) {COMMO} is terminated
               (4) the mode is changed from SCREEN to FILTER or RAW

     >    If Capture Mode is set to FILTER or RAW, text will be saved
          as it arrives from the serial port.

     See also "Screen Image Save."


     ==========================
     [Alt-2]   Print Log Toggle
     ==========================

     Turns the Print Log ON/OFF.  When ON all information written to
     your screen will be printed to LPT1.  Handy for getting hard-copy
     of file lists, messages, etc.

     TIPS on using the Print Log:



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           50



     >    Text is printed as it scrolls OFF the screen.

     >    To prevent loss of data, the entire screen will be printed
          in the following situations:

               (1) whenever the screen is cleared
               (2) Print Log is turned off with Alt-2
               (3) {COMMO} is terminated

     >    Flow Control should be used if your printer cannot keep up
          with the incoming data (see Appendix C).


     ==========================
     [Alt--]   Chat Mode Toggle  (Alt minus)
     ==========================

     Chat Mode is normally used when you wish to converse via
     keyboard. The screen will be split with the upper portion showing
     what the remote is sending, while the lower portion shows what
     you type.

     The method used to send typed characters is selected in the Setup
     File under the section "Video and Chat Mode."  The two possible
     methods are:

          1)   Each character is sent as you type it.  This method is
               normally used when you are chatting with another person
               who is also in Chat Mode.

          2)   All characters are sent at once when you press Enter
               (up to 240 characters will be buffered).  Use this
               method when you are using a teleconferencing system or
               "CB Simulator."

     The number of lines in the upper and lower portions of the screen
     (the "line split") may also be set in the "Video and Chat Mode"
     section.

     TIPS on using Chat Mode:

     >    Alt-- (Alt minus) is used to enter AND exit Chat Mode.

     >    All {COMMO} functions are available in Chat Mode except
          Doorway Mode.

     =============================
     [Alt-=]   Doorway Mode Toggle
     =============================

     Definition: "Extended keys" are function keys, Alt keys, cursor
     keys, etc.  In other words, keys that do not generate ASCII
     characters.

     In Doorway Mode all extended keys will send their key codes to
     the remote (instead of activating {COMMO} functions).  Thus
     Doorway Mode can be used to operate most application software on
     the remote system when used with a host program such as Marshall
     Dudley's Doorway.  In addition some BBS full-screen editors use
     Doorway Mode.

     TIPS on using Doorway Mode:

     >    The Alt-= key is necessarily reserved for exiting Doorway
          Mode and thus cannot be sent to the remote.  Be sure to
          configure remote applications accordingly.

     >    The display should be set to the number of lines expected by
          the host program.  Usually this is 25 lines of text.  If
          your display is not in the proper mode, the results will be
          unpredictable.

     >    The Status Line is normally suppressed in Doorway Mode, but
          may be turned on by using the "S" switch in a macro:

               {:al=} {doorway-s} {}

          The "s" switch is ignored when exiting Doorway Mode and the
          Status Line will be restored to its previous state. 
          Remember that when the Status Line is on, there is one less
          usable line on the Terminal Screen.

     >    If it is necessary to clear the screen or to reset the
          terminal emulation mode parameters when starting Doorway
          Mode, use a macro.  For example:

               {:al=} {clear} {parms ,,,a} {doorway} {}

          This macro will execute when entering or exiting Doorway
          Mode (Alt-= must be used to exit, but any key may be
          assigned to enter Doorway Mode).

     >    For most applications you will want Terminal-Type set to
          ANSI-BBS.  It's a good idea to enter Doorway Mode before
          starting the host program.  The host may send commands to
          initialize the terminal.

     >    If Software Flow Control is enabled, the ASCII character
          values 17 and 19 (XON and XOFF) will not display.  If these
          characters are needed, Software Flow Control must be turned
          off.


     =============================
     [F1]   How to Use Online Help
     =============================

     A summary of {COMMO}'s operations is available by pressing F1. 
     The Online Help support file, COMMO.HLP, must be in the {COMMO}
     home directory or you will get an error message.

     This message will also be issued if there is not enough memory to
     load the Online Help file.  Note that the file is retained in
     memory until {COMMO} requires memory for some other program
     function.  It will automatically be re-read when necessary. 

     Once the Help window is entered you will see the Help control
     keys listed at the bottom of the screen.  At this point you may
     obtain more detailed information about using Online Help by
     typing "H".


     Modifying the Help File
     =======================

     When you are familiar with {COMMO} you may wish to reduce the
     size of the Help File.  Feel free to edit this file -- you can
     even set up your own menu.

     The search keys are in the bars separating the topics.  The
     character following the "T" in the middle of the bar may be
     changed to create your own key.  Keep in mind that the context-
     related Help uses topic characters that cannot be changed.

     The HELP macro function enables you to assign a key to go
     directly to any topic in Online Help.  For example:

               {:cf6} {help J} {}

     will go to topic "TJ" when Ctrl-F6 is pressed.  Use any single
     character as the key (do not include the "T").

     If you change the Help File, remember to keep a backup copy of
     the original.

     ====================================
     [PgUp]/[PgDn]  Uploading/Downloading
     ====================================

     When you press PgUp or PgDn you will be presented with a menu
     from which you may select a file transfer protocol.  Protocols
     provide the ability to transfer any kind of data using error
     correction methods.

     {COMMO} has the Xmodem and Xmodem-1k (old Ymodem) protocols built
     in and provides you with macros to send and receive.  In addition
     the Macro File is pre-configured with macros that execute various
     popular protocol drivers, including DSZ which performs Zmodem,
     Ymodem Batch and Ymodem-G uploads and downloads.

     The PgUp and PgDn menus are implemented using {COMMO}'s powerful
     Macro Processor which enables you to execute internal and
     external protocols easily and seamlessly (see below for details
     on obtaining and installing several of these drivers).

     You may add macros for any other protocol drivers that you need. 
     See the Macro Programming Guide for details on writing macros.


     How to Install External Protocol Drivers
     ========================================

     Protocols such as Zmodem, HS/Link and MPt offer greater
     convenience, speed and reliability.  They include features such
     as:

          1) Automatic startup.
          2) Transmission of file names, sizes and dates.
          3) Batch (multiple file) transfers.
          4) Resuming partial (failed) transfers.
          5) Bi-directional transfers (HS/Link only)

     External protocol "drivers" can be obtained from BBS's and other
     sources.  You can download them using {COMMO}'s internal
     protocols.

     To install DSZ, HS/Link, MPt or OZBEXT, just place the executable
     file (e.g., DSZ.COM, HSLINK.EXE, MPT.EXE, OZBEXT.EXE) in a
     directory which is specified in your DOS path statement.  If you
     don't have a path statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, place the
     executable in your C:\COMMO directory.  In the latter case,
     change to this directory before you start {COMMO}.

     Each of the protocol driver programs has additional features that
     may be useful to you.  Refer to the program's documentation for
     more information.



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           54



     Using DSZ or GSZ
     ================

     NOTE:  These are Shareware programs from Omen Technology.  Like
     {COMMO}, they must be registered for continued use (some features
     are not enabled in the unregistered versions).  DSZ may almost
     always be found where you obtained {COMMO} and is usually
     archived as DSZmmdd.ZIP (mmdd is a release date).

     DSZ will transfer files using Zmodem, Ymodem Batch and Ymodem-G.

     The executable file to install is DSZ.COM.

     GSZ is functionally equivalent to DSZ.  In addition GSZ provides
     an attractive graphic display of the file transfer in progress. 
     To use GSZ you need only change one item in the Setup file:

          {set dszprog,GSZ.EXE}

     The executable file to install is GSZ.EXE.


     Using HS/Link
     =============

     HS/Link is a Shareware program that offers very fast file
     transfers.  It also has bi-directional capability for uploading
     and downloading simultaneously with a full-duplex modem (make
     sure the remote system allows this feature before attempting it).

     When you select a download with HS/Link (or if it is started
     automatically, see "Auto Receive"), you will be asked to enter a
     "Filename to Upload" as well.  Just press Enter for download
     only.

     The executable file to install is HSLINK.EXE.


     Using MPt
     =========

     MPt is a Shareware program that transfers files using the MPt
     protocol (similar to Zmodem, but not compatible).  It offers an
     excellent graphic display during file transfers.

     The executable file to install is MPT.EXE.



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           55


     Using OZBEXT
     ============

     OZBEXT is a file transfer program for CompuServe users (it is
     available without charge from CIS).  This protocol offers much
     better network throughput than Xmodem.

     OZBEXT will transfer files using the "B" and "B+" protocols.

     The executable file to install is OZBEXT.EXE.


     {COMMO} Auto Receive
     ====================

     This feature will automatically start a macro when a specified
     string is received from the serial port and is normally used for
     starting downloads.

     Up to 8 strings and respective macro labels may be defined in the
     "Terminal and Modem" section of the Setup File.  These are
     preconfigured for the Zmodem, HS/Link and MPt protocol
     "signature" strings, but you may change them or add new ones as
     desired.

     As an example, suppose one of the Auto Receive strings in your
     Setup File is:

               {pzbr,^XB00}        Zmodem Auto Receive

     This means that when the string "^XB00" is received, the macro at
     label "pzbr" will be started.  This string is the Zmodem
     signature string.

     In your Macro File you would have the corresponding macro:

       Z BATCH  {:pzbr} {exec %dszprog port %_por rz -mr %dldir} {}

     {COMMO} will execute the macro as soon as the signature string is
     received (be patient, a BBS may take several seconds to load and
     execute its own protocol program).

     IMPORTANT!  If you have not properly installed the protocol
     program, the message "Bad command or file name" will be
     periodically displayed by DOS.  If this happens type Ctrl-X
     repeatedly until the sender cancels the transfer.

     TIPS on using Auto Receive:

     >    If the macro called by Auto Receive EXECutes a DOS command,
          you may want to use EXECute Preview Mode for preliminary
          testing.  This will allow you to view the command before



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           56


          execution and to see the results afterwards.  Preview Mode
          may be toggled on/off using the Alt-T key command.

     >    Auto Receive will not trigger on characters that are
          displayed to the screen while a macro is running.

     >    If you need to download within a macro, you should do a
          LOOKfor to wait for the signature string, then CALL the
          download macro (make sure you have a RETUrn at the end).

     >    Using short strings, such as "^E" for CIS B protocol may
          result in unexpected triggering of the macro.  This is
          because other systems may send the same string for a
          different purpose (to display a "club" symbol, for example). 
          Thus it may be necessary to disable a string at times or to
          discontinue its use.

     >    A string may be disabled by removing the corresponding macro
          label in the Macro File, but this degrades performance since
          the Macro File must be scanned each time a "hit" occurs. 
          Instead, the Setup File item should be removed.

     >    Auto Receive can be set up for protocols that do not send
          signature strings, such as Xmodem, Ymodem, Ymodem-G, etc. 
          Use the prompt that the BBS sends just prior to the file
          transfer.  For example, "Start your Ymodem-G now."  Note
          that different systems may use different prompts.

     >    An Auto Receive string can be used to automatically continue
          Multi Number Dialing after you disconnect (in manual mode). 
          Set one of the strings to:

                    {aut=nocar,^jNO CARRIER^m}

          Then enter a macro in the Macro File:

                    {:nocar} {dial ,} {}

          When your modem sends "NO CARRIER" the macro will start. 
          Multi Number Dialing will resume if any more systems are
          marked in the Dialing Directory.

     See also "TIPS on creating LOOKfor strings" in the Macro
     Programming Guide, under LOOKfor.

     ==========   =====================
     Appendix A   Setting Up Your Modem
     ==========   =====================

     Please be aware that there are many different modems in use and
     that it is of the utmost importance that you configure your modem
     to work correctly with {COMMO}.  A few tips will be given here,
     but they are no substitute for the detailed installation
     instructions in your modem manual!

     When {COMMO} is started, a command string called the Modem
     Initialization String will be sent to the modem.  You must make
     certain that you have the correct string in your Setup File. 
     This string will perform part or all of the modem setup depending
     on the type of modem.  Examples will be given for the most common
     types.

     If your modem is external to your computer, be sure you have
     followed the installation instructions carefully and that the
     cable is connected to the computer's serial port.  It is wise to
     turn off power to the computer and the modem when connecting or
     disconnecting any cables.

     Also check the Default Dialing Parameters in the Setup File. 
     Make sure the serial port number is correct.

          _______________

          1200 bps Modems
          _______________

     Most 1200 bps modems have switches on them which must be set to
     provide the proper interaction with your computer and with
     {COMMO}.  Consult your modem manual concerning these switches and
     pay particular attention to the following:

          1)   Enable command recognition.  Allows the modem to
               recognize commands (dial, set registers, etc.).  Must
               be in the "enable" position or modem will be unusable.

          2)   Send result codes in English.  This switch should be
               set so that the modem will send verbal responses to
               commands instead of numbers.  This is usually
               controlled by a command also (such as ATV1).

          3)   Respond to DTR (data terminal ready).  This should NOT
               be in the "ignore" or "on all the time" position.  This
               switch allows the computer to signal the modem to hang
               up.



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           58


          4)   Respond to carrier detect or "allow true carrier." 
               This should NOT be set to the "on all the time"
               position.

     Here is an example Modem Initialization String which will set up
     a 1200 bps modem and override the switch settings (if possible):

          {~AT S0=0 S7=60 E0 Q0 V1 X1 |}

     The most important command to check is the "X" command, since its
     function varies the most from modem to modem.  The "X" command
     determines which responses the modem will generate during dialing
     (e.g. CONNECT, BUSY, etc.).  It may also activate an additional
     modem feature such as automatic redialing which will interfere
     with {COMMO}'s own redialing procedure.

     Your modem manual gives a description for each level of the "X"
     command: X0, X1, X2, ... , etc.  Generally you want to use the
     highest level that does not activate undesirable features.  If
     you will be using {COMMO}'s AutoBaud feature you will need the
     extended connect responses such as CONNECT 1200.  Also the BUSY
     response should be provided if possible.  In any case you should
     modify the Modem Initialization String to work with your
     particular modem.

          ____________________________

          2400, 9600, 14400 bps Modems
          ____________________________

     Most of the information in the section above on 1200 bps modems
     applies to higher speed modems as well.  However, these modems
     usually have software command settings to replace the switches. 
     These commands may be given every time you start {COMMO} or they
     may be permanently remembered by modems which have "non-volatile"
     memory.

     It will be assumed here that the commands are given every time
     you start {COMMO}.  If you wish to place the settings in non-
     volatile memory, consult your modem manual on how to do this. 
     Here is an example Modem Initialization String for most higher
     speed modems:

          {~AT S0=0 S7=180 E0 Q0 V1 X4 &C1 &D2 |}

     See the comments above concerning the "X" command since they
     apply to these modems as well.

     IMPORTANT!  Many modems that operate at 2400 bps and above
     require additional commands to control features such as error
     correction and data compression.  Consult the modem manual for
     details.  Insert these commands into the above string.



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           59



     If you need to change the Modem Initialization String, edit the
     Setup File with the Alt-G key command, then restart the program
     to send the string to the modem.


     Answering a call from another computer
     ======================================

     The following information assumes that you are not using the
     MOSTHOST or other {COMMO} host mode macro.  If you use a host
     macro, follow the instructions for installing and operating the
     host.

     There are two easy ways to use {COMMO} to answer when a friend or
     associate calls you by computer.  For best results, make sure you
     are in Chat Mode.  Press Alt-- (Alt minus) to enter/exit Chat
     Mode.

     1)   While in Chat Mode or in the Terminal Screen, wait for the
          phone to ring, then type "ATA<cr>" (upper case is not
          necessary with many modems).  Your modem should answer
          immediately (go off hook) and begin handshaking with the
          remote modem.

          When you see the CONNECT message you are ready to
          communicate.  At this point you can type, send data with
          macro keys, send a text file with ASCII Upload or send any
          file with an external protocol.

          You can use a macro key to send the answer command to the
          modem.  For example, to send it by pressing Alt-W, place the
          following macro in your Macro File.  When the phone rings,
          press F5:

               {nf5} {send ATA|} {}     Answer the phone!

     2)   The other method involves setting your modem into Auto
          Answer Mode.  This method is useful in some situations, but
          will cause the modem to answer whenever the phone rings. 
          This can be undesirable if you get a voice call.

          To set Auto Answer just type "ATS0=1<cr>" (or make "S0=1"
          part of your Modem Initialization String).  This will tell
          the modem to answer on ring "1" (adjust to as many rings as
          desired).  To turn off Auto Answer type "ATS0=0<cr>".  These
          may also be sent with macro keys.

     Connecting two computers (null modem cable)
     ===========================================

     {COMMO} may be used on a "direct connection" between two
     computers or between a computer and another serial device. 
     Connect the two serial ports with a "null modem" cable.  Then
     start the program on each computer, having selected the
     appropriate Default Dialing Parameters in the Setup File(s).

     The null modem cable should be designed so that the transmit line
     on each end connects to the receive line on the other end.  No
     other signals are needed, but none of the RS-232C signals should
     be left "floating."  They should be tied high or low (or at least
     grounded).

     You may have to disable the Usage Log in the Setup File by
     setting the path to null: {set _uselog}.  The log is triggered by
     changes in Carrier Detect and will slow things down if CD is
     unpredictable.

     ==========   =========================

          ________

          DESQview
          ________

     Special care has been taken to ensure that {COMMO} is compatible
     with Quarterdeck Office Systems' DESQview(tm), a multi-tasking
     supervisor.  DESQview allows more than one program to execute at
     the same time.

     A sample Program Information File (CO-PIF.DVP) has been included
     in the {COMMO} package for your convenience.  This file is
     installed as follows:

          1)   Copy the file to your DESQview directory (usually
               C:\DV).
          2)   Run "Add a Program" (AP) from the "Open Window" menu.
          3)   Select "Other."  Specify the DESQview directory as the
               "Path."
          4)   Mark the {COMMO} entry, press Enter.  "CO" should now
               appear on your "Open Window" menu.

     The CO-PIF.DVP file has been set up to define a 150k memory
     window.  The amount of memory actually required is affected by
     the size of your COMMO.FON file, your COMMO.MAC file and the size
     of your Scrollback buffer.

     Test the size of the window by running DSZ, HS/Link, LIST, etc.,
     from the Macro Processor or Shell to DOS.  Be sure to test the
     execution of external programs with a "wait" at the end (or use
     EXECute Preview Mode) so that you can see any error messages (see
     EXEC function).

     CO-PIF.DVP can be changed with the "Change a Program" (CP)
     command on the "Open Window" menu.  You may also want to change
     the directory information or other parameters.

     TIPS on using {COMMO} with DESQview:

     >    For best performance the foreground and background "tick
          counts" should both be 10 or less.

     >    If you switch to another task, do not attempt to access any
          files which may be in use in the {COMMO} window.  Examples
          are the Capture File, the Screen Image File and files that
          may be currently involved in a file transfer (upload or
          download).  The result may be a loss of part or all of the
          data in the file.  This is a general DESQview no-no.  You



                   {COMMO} (tm)  User Guide and Reference           62


          may freely access these files in the Shell to DOS or Macro
          Processor features of {COMMO} (within the same window).

     >    If the memory allocated to the window is too small, {COMMO}
          will not be able to load the Online Help file.  Since the
          Online Help file is loaded only when requested, you needn't
          be concerned if you don't intend to use it.

     >    The video display may seem less smooth in DESQview.  This is
          a result of {COMMO} using the fastest possible display
          method, and is quite normal.  This effect can be reduced by
          specifying fewer clock ticks for foreground and background
          (4 and 4 seems to work well). 

     >    The Snow Checking option should not be used when {COMMO} is
          run under DESQview.  If you see "snow" type interference in
          your CGA display, use DESQview's own snow checking (request
          "synchronized access" in the Setup program).

     Display bleed-through may be avoided by telling OmniView that
     {COMMO} "Supports TopView Functions" or by using the "/T" switch
     on the OmniView command line.

     Color displays require the "DISPLAY = TEXT" option in
     DDCONFIG.SYS.  Run {COMMO} in the bottom partition -- about 130k
     to 150k should suffice if you plan to use Online Help and/or
     external protocols.  Increase this size in proportion to the size
     of your Scrollback buffer.

     Some non-multi-tasker-aware, direct-screen-writing programs
     executed with the Macro Processor or Shell to DOS may not display
     properly.  If this happens you may have to run {COMMO} in the top
     partition.

     Use the supplied DBLDANSI.SYS driver in place of your ANSI.SYS
     for running other programs in this partition ({COMMO} doesn't use
     it).

     ==========   ============
     Appendix C   Flow Control
     ==========   ============

     Flow Control is a signalling system used by communications
     devices to prevent data from being transmitted faster than it can
     be processed by the receiving system.  This is especially
     important when data is transferred at high speeds.

     Flow Control is initialized in the Setup File and is used by
     {COMMO} for both sending and receiving.  You may specify Software
     Flow Control, Hardware Flow Control or both.  Changes may be made
     at any time using the "[Alt-T]  Set Toggles" key command (or with
     the HFLOw and SFLOw macro functions) and will be effective
     immediately.
      
     Software Flow Control uses a control character called XOFF (or
     ^S) to signal the remote to pause.  XON (^Q) is the signal to
     "resume transmission."  This is normally used only for ASCII
     data, since these characters may appear randomly within binary
     data.  An XOFF pause will automatically be released in 20 seconds
     if no XON is received.  It will also be released if you type a
     character in the Terminal Screen.

     Hardware Flow Control uses the RTS/CTS lines in your RS-232C
     (serial port) cable to signal pause/resume without interfering
     with the data.  It should only be used when you are connected to
     a device which also recognizes RTS/CTS Flow Control (such as a
     high-speed modem or another computer connected with a null modem
     cable).  A CTS-off (send) pause will not be released
     automatically.  Turn off Hardware Flow Control (using Alt-T) if
     you need to override it.

     TIPS on using Flow Control:

     >    Your modem must be properly initialized to utilize flow
          control (consult the manual for details).

     >    Since Software Flow Control uses the XOFF (ASCII 19) and XON
          (ASCII 17) characters, these will not display on the screen. 
          If it is necessary to display them, Software Flow Control
          must be turned off.

     >    It is especially important to use Flow Control when the
          Print Log is on, since data is usually received faster than
          it can be printed.  If you type a character to the remote
          during a flow control pause, the remote may begin sending
          again (some systems resume on any character, not just XON). 
          You may have to turn off the Print Log if this happens.

     ==========   ==============================
     Appendix D   ASCII Character Representation
     ==========   ==============================

     Sometimes it is necessary to enter control characters and other
     special characters in the {COMMO} support files or as input to
     {COMMO} key commands.

     For example, a carriage return (typed with the Enter key) is used
     to terminate your typed input.  Therefore a carriage return must
     be represented by some other character (or characters) in order
     to be used as data.

     The process of converting represented characters to actual
     characters is done in many places in {COMMO}.  Some examples are:

          1)   Strings sent to the modem.  These include the Modem
               Initialization String, dialing prefixes and suffixes,
               telephone numbers, the Password String, strings defined
               in macro functions such as SEND, SETLook (prompt
               response), VTCUr and VTPAd.

          2)   Strings defined in other macro functions such as
               LOOKfor, GOLOok, EXECute and DISPlay.

     All control characters may be represented using the (^) caret
     symbol (it is the shift character above the top row "6").  If you
     need to send a caret, use two carets (^^).

     For convenience, two "normal" characters have special meanings in
     certain contexts:

          The vertical bar (|) may be used to represent a carriage
          return.  If you need a vertical bar, use (^|).  In the
          EXECute function the vertical bar is never converted (it is
          used by DOS as the "pipe" symbol).

          The tilde (~) forces a one-half second delay when it is
          encountered in a string that is being sent to the modem.  If
          you need a tilde, use (^~).  This is effective only in
          strings that are sent to the modem.  In other strings the
          tilde is used as a tilde.

     Finally, curly braces { } are very special characters and may not
     be used as data in the support files.  They are represented as
     follows, using parentheses:

          Left curly brace         ^(
          Right curly brace        ^)

     Here is a list of some of the most common control characters and
     how to represent them.  Upper or lower case may be used.

          End of file              ^Z

     Here is a table of all ASCII control characters.  Values are
     decimal:

          0  ... ^@      7  ... ^G      14 ... ^N      21 ... ^U
          1  ... ^A      8  ... ^H      15 ... ^O      22 ... ^V
          2  ... ^B      9  ... ^I      16 ... ^P      23 ... ^W
          3  ... ^C      10 ... ^J      17 ... ^Q      24 ... ^X
          4  ... ^D      11 ... ^K      18 ... ^R      25 ... ^Y
          5  ... ^E      12 ... ^L      19 ... ^S      26 ... ^Z
          6  ... ^F      13 ... ^M      20 ... ^T      27 ... ^[

     ASCII 28 to 31 and those in the extended graphic character set
     (128 to 255), may be typed using the ALT-NUMERIC-KEYPAD method as
     follows:

          1.   Hold down the Alt key (and keep it down).
          2.   Enter the ASCII code in decimal using the numeric
               keypad keys (1, 2 or 3 digits are ok).
          3.   Release the Alt key.

     ==========   ==================
     Appendix E   Terminal Emulation
     ==========   ==================

     Terminal Emulation Type is indicated on the Status Line (in the
     Terminal Parameters string).  Available types are:

          A    ANSI-BBS  Used on bulletin boards and other systems.
          V    VT102     Used on minicomputers and mainframes.
          T    TTY       Supports only the basic control characters.
          H    TTY(40)   HP 95LX version only.  Wraps at 40 columns.

     The Terminal Emulation Type (as defined by the Default Dialing
     Parameter string) will be set whenever a system is dialed.  It
     may be changed temporarily using the Alt-P key command or the
     PARMs macro function.  The Default Dialing Parameters may be
     changed using the Alt-P key command or the DPARms macro function.

     TIPS on using terminal emulation:

     >    Whenever a change is made, a reset of mode parameters will
          be performed.  It is therefore important that the change be
          made BEFORE (or at the time of) connecting with a host (mode
          settings may be transmitted by the host).

     >    If some screens do not look right when VT102 emulation is
          used, you may need to turn LINEWRAP off (it defaults to on).

     >    Linewrap may be turned on/off locally using the DISPlay
          macro function.  Place one of the following in your login
          macro (or assign one of them to a key and execute it
          manually):

                    {display ,,,^[[?7h}      linewrap ON
                    {display ,,,^[[?7l}      linewrap OFF

     >    If colors do not always look right, it may be necessary to
          set the Terminal Screen colors in the Setup File to {07}. 
          See the note under "Colors" in the section "[Alt-G]  Setup
          File."

     >    Using the "H" emulation type with the HP 95LX version will
          cause terminal lines to wrap at 40 columns.  This is useful
          when calling systems that do not support 40 column screens. 
          Note that the basic emulation in this mode is TTY and that
          {COMMO} will not perform word wrapping (i.e., words may be
          split).

     Printer Support
     ===============

     {COMMO} supports the ANSI/VT102 printer functions, controlled by
     the remote system.

          The "Printer ON/OFF" function will turn {COMMO}'s Print Log
          ON/OFF.

          The "Dedicated Printing" function will send all input from
          the serial port directly to the printer.  This allows for
          "transparent" transmission of printer data, including
          control codes.

          The "Print Screen" function will print the entire current
          screen.

     The printer should be on and ready to print when these functions
     are used.  When "Dedicated Printing" is active no characters will
     be displayed on the screen.


     ANSI-BBS Keyboard Support
     =========================

     The sample Macro File is set up so you can use the PC keypad keys
     (arrow keys, PgUp, PgDn, etc.) with most BBS full-screen editors.


     VT102 Keyboard Simulation
     =========================

     Two keyboard files, VT102-1.MAC and VT102-2.MAC, provide support
     to simulate the VT102 keyboard.  You may merge one of these into
     COMMO.MAC if you intend to use VT102 all the time (replace the
     ANSI-BBS keys).  Be sure that you have no conflicting key-labels
     (remember that {COMMO} will use the first occurrence of a key-
     label).

     Or you can use the MACLoad function in your login macro to load
     the VT102 file automatically when you connect to the host.  Use
     the "R" switch to reload COMMO.MAC at disconnect.  For example:

          {macload-r vt102-1.mac}

     Both files support the following PC keypad functions (^ indicates
     the Ctrl key):

               Four cursor (arrow) keys
               Home   - Home cursor
               ^Home  - Insert line
               PgUp   - Page up

               ^PgUp  - Delete line
               PgDn   - Page down
               ^PgDn  - Clear screen
               End    - End of line
               Ins    - Insert mode
               Del    - Delete
               ^bs   -  Ctrl backspace (delete)

     VT102 numeric keypad keys are auto-switched by the host system
     between numeric mode and application mode.

     The four cursor keys are auto-switched between cursor mode and
     application mode.

     These files may be modified to create any keyboard support you
     desire (see description of VTCUr and VTPAd functions in the
     section "{COMMO} Macro Functions."

     This file contains keyboard assignments that work best with the
     enhanced keyboard (because of the separate cursor keys, etc.).

     With Numlock ON the ten digits and period will simulate their
     equivalent VT102 functions.  In addition:

               F1 to F4 simulate PF1 to PF4
               Grey * is used for comma
               Grey - is used for dash
               Grey + is used for Enter

          VT102-2.MAC
          ___________

     This file contains keyboard assignments that work best with the
     83-key keyboard (because of the location of the function keys on
     the left side).

          A problem was encountered during Shell to DOS or EXEC:

          1)   There may not be enough memory to execute the command
               processor or external program you have specified.

          2)   The program file you specified in an EXECute function
               using the "D" switch cannot be located.  Make sure you
               specify the full path and filename.

          3)   Some other system error condition may exist.  Make sure
               that COMMAND.COM is still available in the "COMSPEC="
               path.

     Hardware flow control pause
     ___________________________

          Hardware Flow Control is in effect and the remote system (or
          your modem) has requested a pause.  Try waiting a few
          seconds for the pause to clear; if that fails you may have
          to turn off Hardware Flow Control (use Alt-T, Set Toggles).

     _________________________________________

     File space full!  Delete unnecessary text
     _________________________________________

          {COMMO} allows about 65,000 bytes when editing any file (the
          Dialing Directory and Macro File occupy a common file
          space).  This limit may be reached when editing any of the
          files with the Internal Editor.  If this happens you must
          reduce the size of the file in question.  Try removing
          comment lines and any other extraneous information.

          This message may also be the result of loading a resident
          program (TSR) in the Shell to DOS or via the EXEC macro
          function.  Other causes involve a corruption of DOS
          parameters and require rebooting.

     Dial command too long
     _____________________

          The dial command is limited to 128 characters.

     Unable to open file
     Unable to open Help File
     File not found
     Path not found
     Too many files
     ________________________

          Check the following:

          1)   Your "SET COMMO=" command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. 
               It may be specifying the wrong directory.
          2)   That the path exists where the file should be.

          3)   That the file itself exists (this won't be the problem
               if the file is being created).
          4)   Too many files may be open.  You may need to increase
               your FILES= parameter in CONFIG.SYS.
          5)   The Online Help File must be less than 64K bytes in
               size.
          6)   You cannot use an open Capture File for any other
               purpose.

     ____________________________________

     Capture File Closed, disk is full!
     Information not saved, disk is full!
     ____________________________________

          The Capture File and Screen Image File should be edited
          regularly to ensure that they are not occupying too much
          disk space.

     ==========================
     Programming {COMMO} Macros
     ==========================

     IMPORTANT!  Please read the next few pages before you attempt to
     write any macros!  The rules for writing {COMMO} macros are few
     in number, but must be followed carefully.  Examples of more
     complex macro programming are given in the sample Macro File
     COMMO.MAC, in the supplied file SAMPLES.MAC and in the Host Mode
     and Guide macros.

     The following sections assume familiarity with {COMMO}'s key
     commands and with other features of the program.  Since many
     macro functions have corresponding key commands, duplicate
     explanations will not be given here.  Refer to the description of
     the key command in the User Guide and Reference.

     {COMMO}'s Macro File may contain any number of macros.  The only
     size limitation on the file is that the Dialing Directory and
     Macro File combined must total 64k bytes or less.

     Macros are "interpreted," which implies the following:

          (1)  Macros are not processed until they are executed.

          (2)  Only macros within the currently loaded Macro File are
               available for use.

          (3)  Macros added or modified with the Internal Editor are
               available immediately.

     Alternate Macro Files may be loaded using the MACLoad function
     (the original file is replaced and may be reloaded at a later
     time).


     Macro Structure
     ===============

     Macros consist of a series of items enclosed in curly braces. 
     Items may be placed on the same line or on as many lines as
     desired.  The file is entirely free-form.  Lines may be up to 255
     characters in length and all text outside the curly braces is
     ignored.

     There are two types of items: "functions" and "labels."

          Functions are action items.  Some are equivalent to {COMMO}
          key commands, such as DIAL, while others are unique to the
          macro language, such as SETVariable.



                   {COMMO} (tm)  Macro Programming Guide             9


          Labels are macro entry points and may be placed anywhere
          within the Macro File.


     Macro Functions
     ===============

     Each macro function is described in detail later in this
     document.  See also Appendix C "Macro Functions Listed by Class."


     The general form of any macro function is:

          {name-switches arg1,arg2,...,argn}

               name      The function name describes the action to be
                         performed and consists of four or more
                         characters. Only the first four are
                         significant and case is ignored.

               switches  These are used to alter the operation of a
                         function.  Each switch is a single letter and
                         may be followed by a numeric value, usually
                         "1" or "0" to indicate "yes" or "no"
                         respectively.

                         Switches have default interpretations when
                         the numeric value is omitted, or when the
                         switch is not present.

                         Switches must be separated from the name with
                         a hyphen (no intervening spaces).  They may
                         be upper or lower case.

                         See individual function descriptions for
                         details (note that only certain functions
                         have switches).

               args      Arguments follow the function name and
                         switches separated by a SINGLE SPACE. 
                         Individual arguments are separated with
                         commas and may contain no extraneous spaces
                         (all spaces are significant).

     NOTE:  Curly braces may be represented within macro functions by
     using ^( for { and ^) for }.

     Examples:

          {send Hi, how are you?}



                   {COMMO} (tm)  Macro Programming Guide            10


               This function sends the string "Hi, how are you?" to
               the modem.  SEND has only one argument -- the string to
               send out.  Since the string is the last argument, it
               may contain commas and spaces.  Quotes are not used to
               define strings.

          {ifcon-LE label1,label2}

               The IFCOndition function tests for conditions set by
               other functions, such as COMPare.  Here two switches
               are present, telling {COMMO} to test for less than or
               equal:

                    L    Test for "less than."
                    E    Test for "equal."

               The two arguments are labels to GOTO depending on the
               conditions.

               Notice that "name-switches" may be written in a number
               of different ways:

                    ifco-LE  ifcondition-EL  ifcond-LE

          {asci-S0E1 pathname}

               The ASCII Upload function will send the file indicated
               by "pathname."  The switches override current settings
               and tell {COMMO}:

                    S0   Do NOT strip linefeeds.
                    E1   DO expand blank lines (may also be written
                         "E").

          {sound}   {sound yes}

               The first function will TOGGLE Master Sound ON/OFF
               (since there is no argument).  The second will turn the
               sound ON.


     One very important function is the STOP function.  It is used to
     terminate macro processing and may appear in either its long form
     or short form:

          ... {stop}          long form
          ... {}              short form

     Macro processing continues until a STOP function is executed.  Be
     sure to use one or processing will continue into the next macro!

     Macro Labels
     ============

     Labels are identifiers consisting of one or more characters. 
     When a label is defined, it must be preceded by a colon. 
     References to labels, such as {goto label}, do not require the
     colon.

     IMPORTANT!  {COMMO} always searches for labels from the beginning
     of the Macro File.  This means that if a label is duplicated
     within the file, the first occurrence will be used.

     Only the first eight characters in a label are significant.  Case
     is ignored.  All characters are allowed in labels except the
     following:

          colon          ":"
          space          " "
          comma          ","
          slash          "/"
          curly braces   "{" or "}"

     Examples:

          {:mailrun} {call login} ...

          {:start-here} {:another.entry} {send Begin now!} ...


     A number of three character labels are reserved and are called
     "key-labels."  When the corresponding key is pressed from the
     Terminal Screen, {COMMO} will look for the key-label in the
     current Macro File.  If the key-label is found, macro processing
     will begin at that location.

     Any default key assignment may be overridden using a key-label. 
     For example, pressing Alt-D normally enters the Dialing
     Directory.  But suppose this line is in the Macro File:

          {:ald} {clear} {}

     Now pressing Alt-D will clear the screen.

     See Appendix A "Table of {COMMO} Key-labels" for a complete list
     of keys that may be assigned.

     Macro Variables
     ===============

     {COMMO} maintains a String Variable Space in which variables
     appear in the form:

          name,string

               name      An identifier consisting of one or more
                         characters of which only the first eight are
                         significant.  Case is ignored.  The following
                         are the ONLY valid characters that my be used
                         in a variable name:

                              "A" through "Z"
                              "a" through "z"
                              "0" through "9"
                              "_" underline.

                         All other characters will terminate the name.

               string    A text string.  The string must not contain
                         any control characters below ASCII 28.  Null
                         strings (0 characters) do not appear in
                         variable space.

                         Strings consisting of only the digits 0-9 and
                         representing a decimal number from 0 to 65535
                         are also numeric variables (there is no other
                         difference between string and numeric
                         variables).

                         The maximum length of strings is 240
                         characters.

     The String Variable Space may be viewed from within the Macro
     Processor window by pressing "V".  The amount of unused string
     space is shown at the bottom of the screen.

     Once a variable is defined, it remains in String Variable Space
     until it is redefined or deleted (set to null).  Therefore
     variables should be deleted or re-used to prevent String Variable
     Space from becoming full.



                   {COMMO} (tm)  Macro Programming Guide            13


     How to Use Variables
     ====================

     {COMMO} variables may be used in macro functions and also in the
     telephone number field of the Dialing Directory.  See "Alt-D 
     Dialing Directory" in the User Guide and Reference for this
     latter usage.

     When a variable name appears within a function, the string
     assigned to the name is substituted for the name.  If the
     variable is null, then the name is replaced with 0 characters. 
     {COMMO} will expand the variables in a function before processing
     it.

     In order to distinguish variable names, they must be preceded
     with a percent sign "%" (use two percent signs if a percent sign
     is needed in the data).

     The end of the variable name is indicated with another "%" or
     with the first character that is not allowed in a name (see
     above).


     A variable definition example:

          {setvar animal,Elephant} or {setvar %animal,Elephant}

               Notice that the "%" is not required (but is permitted)
               when the variable name is the first argument of a
               function that defines, modifies or tests the value of a
               variable.  Other such functions include INPUt,
               GETString, INCRement, DECRement, COMPare, SUBString,
               INSTring, READ.

               If the variable name in this situation needs to be a
               variable, then use two percent signs:

          {setv %%animal,Elephant}


     Variable usage examples:

          {setvar animal,Elephant}
          {send %animal}           Sends "Elephant" to the modem.
          {send animal}            Sends "animal".
          {send %animal%s are large animals}
                                   Sends "Elephants are large
                                   animals".  Note that the trailing
                                   "%" is required here.

          {setvar animal,Elephant}
          {setv creature,animal}



                   {COMMO} (tm)  Macro Programming Guide            14


          {send creature}          Sends "creature". 
          {send %creature}         Sends "animal". 
          {setv %%creature,Giraffe}
          {send %animal}           Sends "Giraffe".


     IMPORTANT!  Variables may NOT be substituted within the function
     name or switches.  They may be substituted anywhere else, even
     for the commas separating arguments.


     Reserved Variables
     ==================

     Certain variables have fixed names so that {COMMO} can find them
     whenever they are needed.  The names of these variables begin
     with an underline character "_".  There are two types of reserved
     variables: "user-defined" and "built-in" (see Appendix B "List of
     Reserved Variables" for a complete list).

     USER-DEFINED reserved variables are defined in the same way that
     you define ordinary variables -- in the Setup File using SET, or
     in a macro using functions such as SETVariable, INPUt, etc. 
     These variables define strings used by certain program features. 
     For example, the pathname of the Usage Log is defined in the
     Setup File as follows:

          {set _uselog,c:\commo\commo.log}

     BUILT-IN variables are defined by {COMMO} based on current system
     parameters.  Examples are:

          _cap      Current Capture File pathname
          _tim      Full time, hh:mm xm (am or pm)

     Any variable that starts with the same four characters as a
     built-in variable ("_" plus the next three) will be considered
     the same variable.  For example "_pas" may be written "_password"
     and "_yea" may be written "_year".

     {COMMO} will always search String Variable Space first when
     looking up the value of any variable.  This allows built-in
     variables to be overridden, but only when using their four
     character minimum names.  For example, to override the serial
     port number, you must use "_por", not "_port".

     See Appendix B for a complete list of reserved variables.

     Executing Macros
     ================

     Macro execution may be started in any of the following ways:

     1)   Open the Macro Processor window by pressing Alt-M.  Position
          the Selector Bar at the desired starting point and press
          [Enter].  The Macro Processor will begin processing at the
          first macro label or function on the line.

          NOTE:  Macros started with the Selector Bar do not need
          macro labels and may be started at any point within the
          macro.

     2)   If a macro label is also a key-label, then you may press
          that key from the Terminal Screen.  Note that if the same
          key-label appears more than once, the first occurrence will
          be used.

     3)   A macro may be linked to a Dialing Directory entry (Linked
          Macro).  In this case {COMMO} will GOTO the macro when a
          connection is established with that system (or optionally
          CALL it, see the DIAL function).

     4)   A startup macro may be specified in the Setup File using the
          "{mac=label}" item.

     5)   A startup macro may be specified on the command line with
          the switch "/:label".  This will override the Setup File
          macro.

     6)   A macro may be an argument of another function such as CALL,
          GOTO, DIAL or SETLook (these are detailed in a later
          section).

     Some macro functions show their current action on the Status Line
     at the bottom of the screen.  In addition, a "face" character in
     the middle of the Status Line indicates that a macro is
     executing.


     Additional Macro Execution Rules
     ================================

     ASCII keys may be typed to the serial port during long functions
     (LOOKfor, GETString, PAUSe, HOLD, etc.).

     The Macro Processor will execute functions in order until one of
     the following conditions occurs:

     1)   A CALL, GOTO, RETURn, STOP, EXIT, etc. is encountered.



                   {COMMO} (tm)  Macro Programming Guide            16


     2)   Control is transferred to an alternate macro from certain
          functions when a special condition occurs.  An example of
          this is the SETLook function.  The alternate will execute
          when a subsequent LOOKfor times out.

     3)   A macro error occurs.  This will bring up the Macro
          Processor window with the Selector Bar on the problem line. 
          The macro will be terminated.

     4)   The end of the Macro File is reached.


     Cancelling a Macro
     ==================

     The [Esc] key is used to terminate macro processing.  To send an
     <esc> code (ASCII 27) to the remote during macro execution
     (without terminating the macro), press Ctrl-[ (Ctrl + left
     bracket).

     Current function execution may be terminated by pressing
     [Ctrl-Break].  For example, this can be used to terminate a
     LOOKfor, PAUSe or HOLD prematurely.  Macro processing will
     advance to the next function.

     If a macro contains a function that brings up a {COMMO} window
     (Dialing Directory, Capture File Options, etc.), then [Esc] will
     exit the window and processing continues with the next function. 
     To terminate macro processing from a window, press [Ctrl-Break].

     NOTE:  The SETEsc function may be used to help prevent accidental
     termination of macros.

     =======================================
     Description of Functions (Alphabetical)
     =======================================

     The purpose of this section is to show the syntax of each
     function and the meaning of its arguments through examples.  All
     functions are listed here, but details on functions which are
     also default key commands are found in The User Guide and
     Reference under "{COMMO} Key Commands."

     Function names are shown with their four-letter abbreviations in
     uppercase.

     For consistency, the following conventions are used in many

     Default key:   none
     Description:   Compare a string or numeric variable.

     General form:

          {COMPare name,string}

               name           The name of a variable.

               string         A string of ASCII characters.

     Examples:

          {comp pword,aardvark}         Test if the variable "pword"
                                        is set to "aardvark."

          {comp pword}                  Test if "pword" is null.
          {comp pword,}                 Test if "pword" is null.

          {comp nmbr,5}                 Compare a numeric variable.

          {comp abc,%xyz}               Test if the variable "abc" is
                                        equal to the variable "xyz."

     A numeric variable is a string of ASCII digits, 0-9, forming a
     positive integer in the range from 0 to 65535.  If the number is
     outside this range or contains non-numeric characters, the
     results of the compare will be unpredictable.

     COMPare will set flags which can be tested with the IFCOndition
     function.

          The Condition Flag will be set to "true" if the two
          arguments are identical strings (case is ignored). 
          Otherwise it will be set to "false."

          The Numeric Flag will be set to "equal", "less than" or
          "greater than."  This flag is unpredictable unless both
          arguments are valid numeric variables.

     A variable may be tested for being null (no entry in variable
     space) by omitting the second argument (or by comparing to a null
     variable).

          {decr count}        Subtract 1 from the variable "count".

     Numeric variables and the amounts to be subtracted may range from
     0 to 65535.  The default amount is 1.  Results less than 0 will
     be set to 0.

                         "0" means unlimited.  Default is 0.

               label     A macro to GOTO if the try count in the first
                         argument is exhausted.  If no macro is
                         specified or if the macro label is invalid,
                         control will pass to the next function. 
                         Default is none.

     Switches:

               C1 or C   Specifies that a Linked Macro (from the
                         Dialing Directory) will be entered via CALL
                         (instead of GOTO).  When the Linked Macro
                         executes a RETUrn, control returns to the
                         DIAL function and Multi Number Dialing will
                         resume (see below).

               C0        Enter the Linked Macro via GOTO (default).


     Examples:

          {dial}              Open Dialing Directory window (similar
                              to Alt-D).

          {dial ,}            Multi Number Dial (similar to Alt-N).

          {dial 25,abc}       Multi Number Dial with try count.

          {dial-C ,}          Multi Number Dial, CALL Linked Macros.


     Marked numbers will be redialed in sequence.  Numbers may be
     marked in one of several ways:

          1)   Manually in the Dialing Directory window.
          2)   By placing Dialing Strings on the {COMMO} command line.
          3)   Using the MARK macro function.

     If a connection occurs and a valid Linked Macro is specified in
     the Dialing Directory, the macro will be started (via GOTO unless
     the "C" switch is present).  If no macro is specified in the
     Dialing Directory, control is passed to the next function.


     To automatically resume Multi Number Dialing at the end of a
     Linked Macro, use one of the following methods.

          1)   Execute the following sequence at the end of each
               Linked Macro (or GOTO it):



                   {COMMO} (tm)  Macro Programming Guide            26


               ... {setlook 60} {lookfor ^jNO CARRIER^m} {dial ,} {}

               This allows more than one system to be called without
               operator intervention.  This method will also work when
               using Dialing Strings on the command line or when
               pressing Alt-U after marking systems for dialing.

          2)   Use the "C" switch in the DIAL function.  Each Linked
               Macro should end with a RETUrn which will transfer
               control back to the DIAL.  When all numbers have been
               called, the DIAL will pass control to the next function
               in sequence.

     Default key:   none
     Description:   Execute a DOS command.

     Switches:

               A1 or A   Sound the alarm at the end of command
                         execution.

               A0        Do not sound the alarm (default).

               D1 or D   Execute an external program directly, without
                         use of the command processor (see details
                         below).

               D0        Use the command processor (default).

               N1 or N   Do not clear the screen before execution. 
                         This is useful when running programs that
                         clear or rewrite the screen.  Also for simple
                         DOS functions like changing directories,
                         renaming files, etc.

     Examples:

          {exec-AW3 dsz port %_por speed %_spe sz %uldir%\%file}

               {COMMO} will prepare the DSZ command by expanding the
               "%" variables, then call DOS to execute the program.

               See the section "Macro Variables" for complete details
               on variable substitution.

               The alarm will sound at completion (the "A" switch) and
               {COMMO} will wait for three seconds (the "W3" switch)
               before restoring the Terminal Screen.

          {execute-DN c:\utils\list.com %_cap}

               The LIST program will be directly executed with the
               current Capture File pathname as a command line
               argument.  The screen will not be cleared (LIST will
               rewrite the screen).  {COMMO} will return immediately
               to the Terminal Screen when LIST exits.

     The EXECute function enables you to "build" a command to be
     executed by DOS.  The DOS command processor (COMMAND.COM) is
     normally used (see below), which implies that you may specify any
     command as you would type it from the DOS prompt.

     Thus you can execute batch files and internal DOS commands (REN,
     DEL, etc.).  Also you can omit command paths and extensions (if
     the command is in your PATH or in the current directory).

     Character conversion is performed in the EXECute function.  This
     enables you to specify control characters.  For example:

               {exec echo ^L> prn}   Send a formfeed to the printer

     See Appendix D in the User Guide and Reference for details on
     conversion.  Note that the vertical bar "|" is NOT translated to
     a carriage return in the EXECute function.

     Using the Direct Switch: exec-D
     -------------------------------

     Use this switch to execute .EXE and .COM programs without the use
     of the command processor (usually COMMAND.COM).

     The program's Exit Code (called ERRORLEVEL in batch files) is
     saved and may be tested with the IFERrorlevel function.  The Exit
     Code is also available in the variable "_err".

     There are several advantages to using the "D" switch:

     1)   Only the memory needed to run the program is required (the
          command processor requires that about 32k be available, even
          if the program being run is much smaller).

     2)   About 4k of memory is saved by not having a copy of the
          command processor resident when the program is running.

     3)   The program executes faster, since COMMAND.COM is not loaded
          from disk.

     4)   The program's Exit Code is preserved and may be tested with
          the {COMMO} IFERrorlevel function.

     Two important rules must be followed when using the "D" switch:

     1)   The full pathname of the program file must be specified,
          including the path where the file resides on disk and the
          file extension.  For example:

               {exec-D c:\util\list.com file.txt}

     2)   Only .EXE and .COM files may be run (batch files and
          internal DOS commands cannot be executed without the command
          processor).


     EXECute Preview Mode
     --------------------

     Use the Set Toggles key command, Alt-T, to turn on "EXECute
     Preview Mode."  This mode is used to test your DOS commands and
     performs the following steps for each EXECute function:

     1)   The command will be displayed after expanding variables and
          converting control characters.

     2)   You will be given an opportunity to cancel the command
          before it is executed.



                   {COMMO} (tm)  Macro Programming Guide            32


     3)   Following execution {COMMO} will wait before restoring the
          Terminal Screen.  This lets you see any error messages that
          the command may have displayed.

     Default key:   Alt-X
     Description:   Exit {COMMO}.

     General form:

          {EXIT number}

               number    The return code to be passed to DOS.  It may
                         be tested with the IF ERRORLEVEL batch
                         command.  Range is 0 to 255.

     Switches:

               D1 or D   Drop DTR and RTS.  Dropping DTR will cause
                         the modem to disconnect if it has been
                         properly initialized.  See Appendix A in the
                         User Guide and Reference.

               D0        Do not drop DTR and RTS.

                         If the switch is absent, the current setting
                         of the toggle will be used.  The toggle can
                         be set in the Setup File or by using the Alt-
                         T key command.

     Examples:

          {exit}              No arguments (return code = 0).
          {exit 3}            With return code.

               name      The name of the variable to which the string
                         will be assigned.

               count     The maximum number of data characters
                         allowed.  A carriage return will always
                         terminate input.  May be 1 to 240.  Default
                         is 240.

               label     A macro to GOTO if a carriage return is
                         received and no characters have been entered
                         (the string will be assigned as null).  If
                         this argument is omitted, control will pass
                         to the next function.

     Switches:

               A1 or A   "Append" mode.  Characters will be appended
                         to the variable.  If the current length of
                         the variable is greater than the count in the
                         second argument, a count of 240 will be
                         assumed.

               A0        The variable will be overwritten (default).

               H1 or H   "Hotkey" mode.  When the maximum number of
                         characters has been entered, control will
                         pass to the next function.

               H0        Ignore all input after the maximum has been
                         entered, except backspace and carriage return
                         (default).

               P1 or P   "Password" mode.  Asterisks will be echoed to
                         the remote and local terminals in place of
                         the received characters (Echo Status will be
                         honored, see SETGet).

               P0        Characters are echoed as received (default).

     Examples:

          {setget 60,timeout,y,^m^j}         Set GETString parameters.
          {gets fonum,12,badinput}           Get input to "fonum."

          {gets-p pword,20}                  Get a password.


     TIPS on using GETString:

                   {COMMO} (tm)  Macro Programming Guide            34


          control characters should be entered as ^J for linefeed,
          etc.  See Appendix D in the User Guide and Reference.

     >    Destructive backspace processing is supported for editing
          purposes.

     >    GETString supports "tandem" input.  Characters entered at
          either end will be input to the string (and displayed at
          both ends if echo is on (see SETGet).  Turn on Local Echo to
          see text locally that is sent to the remote with SEND,
          ASCIiup, etc.

     >    Use the "H" switch and a character count of 1 for "hotkeys."

     >    Turn off echo in the SETGet while waiting for the modem to
          answer (in host mode).  Some modems react poorly to
          characters being echoed when they are generating a response
          (such as "RING").

     General form:

          {IFCOndition true,false}

               true      A label to GOTO if the Condition Flag is
                         true.

               false     A label to GOTO if the Condition Flag is
                         false.

     NOTE:  The default when either label is omitted is to pass
     control to the next function.

     Switches:

               none      Test the current state of the Condition Flag.

               E1 or E   Test for numeric equality.  A numeric string
                         contains only the digits 0-9 and is in the
                         range 0 to 65535.

               L1 or L   Numeric test -- if first COMPare argument is
                         less than the second.

               G1 or G   Numeric test -- if first COMPare argument is
                         greater than the second.

     Examples:

          {compare var1,message}        Compare and set Condition
          {ifcondit match,nomatch}      Flag.  GOTO "match" if the

                                        GOTO "yes", if "false" GOTO
                                        "no".

     Switches may be used in any combination.  If any numeric switches
     are present, the Condition Flag is not tested.

     The difference between testing for string equality and numeric
     equality is shown in this example:

          The strings "05" and "5" are different text strings, but are
          numerically equal.

     NOTE:  The default when either label is omitted is to pass
     control to the next function.

     Example:

               {iferror 1,abc,def}      GOTO "abc" if Exit Code is
                                        greater than or equal to 1. 
                                        Else GOTO def.

     TIPS on using IFERrorlevel:

     >    The Exit Code is set by certain functions (e.g., EXECute-D,
          SHELl, RXMOdem, SXMOdem) and should normally be tested
          immediately following execution of those functions.



                   {COMMO} (tm)  Macro Programming Guide            39


     >    EXECute without the "D" switch or Shell to DOS will normally
          set the Exit Code to 0.

     >    Many programs return an Exit Code greater than 0 when the
          result is unsuccessful.  DSZ, for example, will return an
          Exit Code of 1 if the file transfer has failed.

     >    The value of the Exit Code is also stored in the string
          variable "_err" and may be tested with COMPare.

     LOOKfor
     _______

     Default key:   none
     Description:   Look for strings in the modem input stream.

     LOOKfor may be used in conjunction with CALOok and GOLOok to scan
     for up to 16 strings at the same time.  When CALOok and GOLOok
     set up additional strings to look for, the actual "looking" does
     not take place until the LOOKfor executes.

     Parameters controlling LOOKfor execution are set with the SETLook
     function, which should be executed before any LOOKfor functions. 
     See the description of the SETLook function for details.

     Examples using LOOKfor only:

          {lookfor first name?}    Look for the string "first name?"

          {look ^(COMMO^)}         Look for the string "{COMMO}".



                   {COMMO} (tm)  Macro Programming Guide            43


          When the string comes in, control will pass to the next
          function.

     Example construct using CALOok/GOLOok/LOOKfor:

                    {setlook 60,hng,3,n|}
                      ...

          {:m_1234}
                    {golook aaa,string1}
                    {calook m_1234,bbb,string2}
                    {calook m_1234,ccc,string3}
                    {golook ,string4}
                    {lookfor string5} {send answer5|} {goto ddd}

          {:aaa}    {hangup y} {goto cancel}
          {:bbb}    {send answer2|} {return}
          {:ccc}    {send answer3|} {call subr} {return}

          {:ddd}      ...

          In this example {COMMO} will look for five strings.  When
          any string comes in, the LOOKfor is terminated (all strings
          are cancelled).  It may be set up again by going back to
          "m_1234".

          The GOLOok function for string1 will GOTO "aaa" when the
          string comes in.  In the example control will pass to
          "cancel".

          If string2 or string3 come in the CALOok functions will set
          "m_1234" as the return point and then CALL "bbb" or "ccc"
          respectively.  When these routines RETUrn, control returns
          to "m_1234" and the five string LOOKfor will be set up
          again.

          The GOLOok for string4 has a null label and control will
          pass to the function following the LOOKfor if that string
          comes in.  The "," must be present.

          If string5 comes in, control will also pass to the function
          following the LOOKfor.

     TIPS on creating LOOKfor strings:

     >    There should be just one space following the LOOKfor
          function name.  Any spaces beyond this point are part of the
          string.  The string ends at the right curly brace.

     >    CALOok/GOLOok/Auto Receive strings begin immediately after
          the comma.  There should be no spaces unless they are part
          of the string.



                   {COMMO} (tm)  Macro Programming Guide            44



     >    Strings may be up to 32 characters in length (control
          characters like "^M" count as one).  Upper/lower case is
          ignored.

     >    ANSI control sequences are filtered if ANSI or VT102
          emulation is enabled.

     >    Remember that short strings may not be unique enough, long
          strings may not match due to line noise.

     >    Rules for representing special characters in
          CALOok/GOLOok/LOOKfor/Auto Receive strings are given in
          Appendix D in the User Guide and Reference.

     Additional TIPS:

     >    CALOok and GOLOok functions should immediately precede a
          LOOKfor (no string compares actually occur until the LOOKfor
          executes).  Up to 15 CALOok/GOLOok strings may be used for a
          total of up to 16 strings to scan for.

     >    FILTER Capture Mode should be used to determine the exact
          prompt to look for.  The LOOKfor sees the incoming data
          exactly as it is captured when FILTER mode is set.

     >    If two or more strings cause a match at the same time, the
          LAST such string listed is the one acted upon.  For example,
          if "abcdef" and "def" are listed and "abcdef" comes in.

     >    Since the LOOKfor is terminated whenever any of the strings
          come in (or when the LOOKfor timeout expires), this
          structure is unrestricted -- that is, CALLs, GOTOs, other
          CALOok/GOLOok/LOOKfor constructs, etc., may be used freely
          in any of the branches.

     IMPORTANT!  The new Macro File must reside in the {COMMO} home
     directory (do not specify a path).

     The current file will be saved to disk if changes are
     outstanding.  The new file is then loaded in place of the current

                                        | menu111
               Name of Menu             |
                                        |
                                        |
               Selection 1              | {exec ... } {}
               Selection 2              | {exec ... } {}
               Selection 3              | {exec ... } {}
                                        | {:af1} {macro menu111}


     The upper line with "menu111" will be the top line of the screen. 
     Pressing Alt-F1 will bring up the menu with the Selector Bar on
     Selection 1.

     Remember that the function itself will be found in the search
     since it contains the string.

     MARK
     ____

     Default key:   none
     Description:   Mark Dialing Directory entries for dialing.

     Example:

          {mark joes-bbs,file-city}     Mark entries for dialing.

     Dialing Strings may be separated by spaces or commas.

     {COMMO} will search the Dialing Directory for each string and
     mark the first entry where a match is found.  Case is ignored.

     The strings may consist of any part of a Dialing Directory entry
     line (including passwords).  However the following characters may
     not appear in a macro Dialing String: space, comma, left or right
     curly brace.

     See also: DIAL, UNMArk.

     Default key:   none
     Description:   Sets/resets a macro to execute when carrier detect
                    is lost.

     Examples:

          {nocar carrlost}         GOTO the label "carrlost" when the
                                   carrier detect signal drops.

          {nocar}                  Turn off the carrier lost label.

     IMPORTANT:  This feature is enabled only when a connection is
     made using {COMMO}'s Auto Dialer.  Also, if carrier drops while a
     macro is running or a command window is open (such as the Dialing
     Directory or Capture File Options), the carrier lost macro will
     not activate.

     Be sure that you have your modem configured to provide the
     carrier detect signal.  See Appendix A in the User Guide and
     Reference for modem information.

     Default key:   none
     Description:   Pop an element from the macro stack.

     Switches:

               C1 or C   Clear all elements from the stack.

               C0        Pop the top element (default).

          {pops}              Pop the top element.
          {pops-c}            Clear the stack.

     POPStack throws away the top element on the macro stack.  This
     element would have been used by the next RETUrn function.

     See PUSHstack for a more complete description of the use of this
     function.

     PUSHstack
     _________

     Default key:   none
     Description:   Push a return point onto the macro stack.



                   {COMMO} (tm)  Macro Programming Guide            50


     Examples:

          {push}              Push the current location.
          {push abc}          Push the location "abc".

     When there are no arguments, the location pushed is the location
     of the PUSHstack function itself (i.e., it will be executed again
     when a RETUrn is encountered).

     Explanation:  Whenever a CALL is executed, the location of the
     function following the CALL (the "return point") is "pushed" onto
     the macro stack.  When a subsequent RETUrn is executed, the
     location at the top of the stack is "popped" and control is
     transferred to that location.  This allows "nesting" of CALLs and
     RETUrns.

     PUSHstack will push a return point onto the macro stack without
     transferring control to the location (control continues in
     sequence).  A subsequent RETUrn will transfer control to the
     location that was pushed.

     POPStack will remove the top stack element without transferring
     control to it (control continues in sequence).

     RCLOse
     ______

     Description:   Close the read file.

     Example:

          {rclose}            No arguments.

     IMPORTANT!  The read file will be closed automatically in the
     following situations:

          1)   When an attempt is made to read past the end of the
               file.
          2)   When the macro terminates (STOP, EXIT, etc.).

     A macro error will result if you try to close and no file is
     open.

     See also ROPEn, READ.

     ____

     READ
     ____

     Default key:   none
     Description:   Read a line from the read file to a variable.

     Example:

          {read nextline}          Read the next line in the file into
                                   the variable "nextline."

     TIPS on reading files:

     >    Each READ will get another line until the end of the file is
          encountered, at which time control will GOTO the label
          specified when the file was opened.  If no label was
          specified (or the label is invalid) control continues in
          sequence.

          IMPORTANT:  In either case the file will be closed.

     >    ALL control characters (below ASCII 28) will be discarded,
          including the carriage return/linefeed that terminates the
          line.

     >    A file must be open for reading or a macro error will
          result.

     ______

     RETUrn
     ______

     Default key:   none
     Description:   Return from a CALLed macro.

     Example:

          {return}            No arguments.

     This function will return control to a location determined by the
     last CALL or PUSHstack function.  See PUSHstack for a more
     complete description of CALL and RETUrn.

     NOTE:  If a RETUrn is encountered and no CALL or PUSHstack has
     been executed, a STOP will occur.  This is useful in macros that
     are CALLed and are also used standalone (such as protocol file
     transfer macros).

     General Form:

          {ROPEn name,label}

               name      The name of a string variable.

               label     A label to GOTO when a READ is attempted at
                         the end of the file.

     Example:

          {ropen c:\bbs\file.txt,nomore}     Open the file and set the
                                             label "nomore" to GOTO
                                             when the end of the file
                                             is reached.

     TIPS on using ROPEn:

     >    Only one file may be opened for reading (and one for
          writing).

     >    The file will be automatically closed when the end of the
          file is encountered during a READ (whether or not a label is
          specified).  An RCLOse is not needed in this situation and
          will cause a macro error.

     Examples:

          {rtran y}                Turn receive translation ON.

          {rtran-i n}              Initialize the table and turn it
                                   OFF.

          {rtran 26,0}             Change ASCII 26 to null (ASCII 0,
                                   which will not display).

          {rtran-i y,#8,224,240}   Initialize the table, turn receive
                                   translation ON, change ASCII 224 to
                                   240, 225 to 241, ..., 231 to 247. 

          {rtran}                  Toggle receive translation ON/OFF.

          {rtran #13,65,78,#13,78,65,#13,97,110,#13,110,97}
                                   ROT13 translation.  This swaps the
                                   first 13 letters of the alphabet
                                   for the second 13.

     Rules for RTRAn arguments are the same as for the {rtr=} item in
     the Setup File.  In addition, "n" may be used as the first
     argument to turn receive translation OFF at any time.

     See "Edit Setup File" in the User Guide and Reference for details
     and more examples.

     TIPS on using RTRAn:

     >    Some control characters are unaffected by translation when
          certain features are enabled.  Examples:  XON (17) and XOFF
          (19) are not translated when Software Flow Control is on. 
          ENQ (5) is not translated when ENQ/ACK emulation is on.

     >    When the Capture Mode is set to RAW, data will be captured
          prior to translation.  FILTER and SCREEN captures will
          contain translated data.

     >    LOOKfor will always see translated data.  Use FILTER Capture
          Mode to see what LOOKfor sees.

     >    In GETString, incoming data (as well as locally typed
          characters) will be translated with the Receive Translate
          Table (it may be necessary to turn receive translation off
          during certain GETString functions).

                                             the alarm.

     TIPS on using RXMOdem:

     >    IMPORTANT!  If the file already exists it will be
          overwritten without warning.  The IFEXist function may be
          used to prevent this if desired.

     >    Block size is established by the sender and may be changed

     >    The transfer will be cancelled after 10 consecutive errors,
          if the sender cancels or if you press Esc.

     >    The Exit Code (test with IFER) will be set at the end of the
          transfer.  The Exit Code will also be stored in the variable
          "_err".  0 means success, 1 means failure.

                         running.  Terminate it?."  If the user
                         answers "no," macro processing will continue
                         as if nothing had happened.  If "yes,"
                         processing will GOTO the label.  If the label
                         does not exist, a STOP will be executed.  P1
                         is the default.

               P0        The user will not be prompted.  Processing
                         will GOTO the label if it exists, else a STOP
                         will be executed.

     Examples:

          {setesc finish}          GOTO label, with prompt.
          {sete-p0 done}           GOTO label, without prompt.
          {setesc}                 Reset to no label (STOP on Esc).


     This function is used to "capture" the Esc key during macro
     execution, especially when a MACLoad is used to load a new Macro
     File.  It will help prevent accidental macro terminations.

     The macro at the label would typically reload COMMO.MAC, thus
     restoring the user's familiar environment.

     exit the window.  Use Ctrl-Break to bring up the prompt.

                         specified or if the macro label is invalid,
                         control will pass to the function following
                         the GETString.  Default is no macro.

                         Note that if the timer expires no variable
                         assignment will be made.  Any previous
                         assignment will be unaltered.

               y/n/l     Echo Status.  If this is "yes", characters
                         entered at the local or remote terminals will
                         be echoed back to the remote and displayed
                         locally.  This is the default.

                         If "no", characters will not be echoed to
                         either location.

                         If "local", characters will be displayed
                         locally, but not echoed to the remote.  This
                         should be used when the remote is a host
                         system.

                         IMPORTANT!  This setting is independent of
                         Local Echo.  Turn on Local Echo if necessary
                         for local display of data transmitted with

                         up to 32 characters.  Default is no string.

     Example:

          {setg 120,noget,y,^m^j}       Set GETString parameters.


     The SETGet function will set parameters for all subsequent
     GETString functions.  It may be executed at any time to modify
     the parameters.

     When macro processing terminates, the parameters will be reset to
     the default values.

     Default arguments are:   GETString timeout        0 (disabled)
                              Timeout macro            none

     SETLook
     _______

     Default key:   none
     Description:   Set parameters for LOOKfor functions.

     General form:

          {SETLook seconds,label,seconds,string}

               seconds   LOOKfor timeout.  Maximum time in seconds to
                         look for a string.  If the string is not
                         found in the allotted time, the macro in the
                         second argument will be started.  May be 0 to
                         999.  Default is 0 (disabled).  

               label     Timeout macro.  Macro to GOTO if the time in
                         the first argument expires.  If no macro is
                         specified or if the macro label is invalid,
                         control will pass to the function following

                   {COMMO} (tm)  Macro Programming Guide            59


                         the time in seconds to wait at a prompt (no
                         input from the modem) before sending the
                         string in the fourth argument.  Usually you
                         would send "|" or "n|".

                         When the response string is sent the timer is
                         restarted, allowing any number of prompts to
                         be satisfied (until the LOOKfor itself is
                         satisfied or times out).

                         The timer will also be restarted if any keys
                         are typed while waiting.  This allows a
                         manual response to a prompt which the macro
                         does not handle.

                         IMPORTANT!  The prompt timeout should be long
                         enough (or disabled entirely) to prevent the
                         response from being sent when there is a long
                         delay without a prompt.  This might occur
                         right after connection while the BBS software
                         is loading or when a "door" program is
                         loading.

                         Failure to heed this warning will result in
                         "n" responses to "First name?" and other
                         undesirable effects.

                         May be 0 to 999.  Default is 0 (disabled).

               string    Prompt response.  String to send when the
                         time in the third argument runs out.  May be
                         up to 32 characters.  Default is no string.

     Example:

          {setl 60,abc,4,n|}       Set LOOKfor parameters


     The SETLook function will set parameters for all subsequent
     LOOKfor functions.  It may be executed at any time to modify the
     parameters.

     When macro processing terminates, the parameters will be reset to
     the default values.

     Default arguments are:   LOOKfor timeout     0 (disabled)
                              Timeout macro       none

     General form:

          {SETVariable name,string}

               name      The name of the variable to which the string
                         will be assigned.

               string    The string may be the name of another {COMMO}
                         variable or an environment variable.  In
                         these cases further expansion is controlled
                         by switches (see below).

     Switches:

               E1 or E   This switch indicates that the second
                         argument is a DOS environment variable.  If
                         it is not found in the environment, the
                         {COMMO} variable will be set to NULL.

                         Note that environment variable names are CASE
                         SENSITIVE (they are usually upper case).

               E0        Normal variable (default).

               S1 or S   This switch will cause "double expansion" of
                         the second argument (indirect variable). 
                         First {COMMO} will substitute any variables
                         indicated by "%" signs.  The resulting string
                         (which must NOT begin with a "%") will then
                         be treated as a variable name and expanded
                         again.

                         This facility may be used to create a
                         "subscript."

               S0        Single expansion (default).

     Examples:

          {setv net,nodeid}             Assign the string "nodeid" to
                                        the variable name "net".

                                        the variable name "nodeid".

          {setv-s bbs,nodeid}           Assuming the above examples
                                        have been executed, this will
                                        set the variable "bbs" to
                                        "dirasnt".

          {setv-s board,%net}           Assuming the above examples
                                        have been executed, this will
                                        set the variable "board" to
                                        "dirasnt".

          {setv-s xxx,yyy%index}        Suppose the variable "index"
                                        has the value "3".  It will be
                                        expanded first, then "yyy3"
                                        will be expanded and its value
                                        assigned to "xxx".

          {setv-e abc,TABLE}            Assuming a "SET TABLE=" DOS
                                        command has been executed
                                        prior to running {COMMO}, the
                                        variable "abc" will be set to

          {setv abc} or {setv abc,}     Set the variable "abc" to null
                                        (it will be deleted from

          {spdc n}            Serial port display is OFF.

     This function will suppress display of any data received from the
     serial port.  It can be used when a "clean" display is desired
     during automated procedures.

     TIPS on using SPDCtrl:

     >    ANSI control sequences are not processed while the display
          is OFF (Terminal Emulation effectively reverts to TTY).

     >    LOOKfor will function normally, but remember that ANSI
          sequences are not stripped.  Make a manual run using TTY
          emulation to see what the LOOKfor will see.

     >    SCREEN Capture Mode will not capture any of the incoming
          data.  Use RAW mode or FILTER mode instead (FILTER capture
          will be affected by the Translate Table, but will still
          contain ANSI sequences).

     >    Serial port display will always be restored to ON at macro
          termination.

          {spoc n}            Serial port output is OFF.

     This function will inhibit any data from being sent to the serial
     port.  All other program operations will be normal.  It is used
     for "local mode" in host macros (no data is sent to the modem).

     Serial port output will always be restored to ON at macro
     termination.

     IMPORTANT!  The Status Line is {COMMO}'s instrument panel.  You
     should not turn it off until you are familiar with operating the
     program.

     Examples:

          {statusline}        Toggle Status Line on/off.

                         values (consecutive 0 to 255).

               I0        Do not initialize (default).

     Examples:

          {stran y}           Turn send translation ON.

          {stran-i n}         Initialize the table and turn it OFF.

          {stran-i y,92,47}   Initialize the table, turn send
                              translation ON, change "\" to "/".

          {stran}             Toggle send translation ON/OFF.

          {stran #13,65,78,#13,78,65,#13,97,110,#13,110,97}
                              ROT13 translation.  This swaps the first
                              13 letters of the alphabet for the
                              second 13.

     Rules for STRAn arguments are the same as for the {str=} item in
     the Setup File.  In addition, "n" may be used as the first
     argument to turn send translation OFF at any time.

     See "Edit Setup File" in the User Guide and Reference for details
     and more examples.

     TIPS on using STRAn:

     >    Some control characters are unaffected by translation when
          certain features are enabled.  Examples:  XON (17) and XOFF
          (19) are not translated when Software Flow Control is on. 
          When ENQ/ACK emulation is on, an ACK sent in response to an
          ENQ will not be translated.

     >    In GETString, data echoed to the modem (and displayed
          locally) will be translated with the Send Translate Table
          (it may be necessary to turn send translation off during
          certain GETString functions).

     SUBString
     _________

     Default key:   none
     Description:   Move a substring to a variable.

     General form:

          {SUBString name,start,count,string}

               name      The name of the variable to which the
                         substring will be assigned.

               start     The starting character number (first
                         character is "1").  If it is negative,
                         {COMMO} will count in from the end of the
                         string.

                         If it is too large and positive, the
                         substring will be null.

                         If it is too large and negative, the
                         substring will start at the beginning of the
                         string.

               count     The number of characters to use.  If the
                         number is too large, {COMMO} will use as many
                         as possible.  If the count is 0, the
                         substring will be null.

               string    The string to use.

     Examples:

          {subs var-sub,2,4,abcdefgh}        Set "var-sub" to "bcde".
          {subs newvar,-5,20,abcdefgh}       Set "newvar" to "defgh".

                                             1024 byte block size,
                                             sound the alarm.

     TIPS on using SXMOdem:

     >    The transfer will be cancelled after 10 consecutive errors,
          if the receiver cancels or if you press Esc.

     >    CRC vs. Checksum mode is established by the receiver.

     >    The Exit Code (test with IFER) will be set at the end of the
          transfer.  The Exit Code will also be stored in the variable
          "_err".  0 means success, 1 means failure.

     >    If the Usage Log is enabled, an entry will be made at the
          end of each transfer.

     Appendix A   Table of {COMMO} Key-labels
     ========================================

     Key-labels are also macro labels with the added advantage that
     the macro can be started by pressing the associated key from the
     Terminal Screen.  Most "extended" keys may be assigned this way. 
     If the same key-label appears more than once, the first
     occurrence will be used.  Note that key-labels are case
     insensitive.  The caret (^) indicates the Ctrl key.

     Enhanced keyboard key-labels are listed below.

## UPGRADE.DOC

                     {COMMO} 4.xx to 5.xx Upgrade Guide
                     ----------------------------------


Upgrading is very easy if you follow the instructions below.  These changes
will bring you up to date.  Then you will probably want to take advantage of
the new features to greatly increase the power of your macros.


Configuration File
------------------

COMMO.CFG has been replaced with COMMO.SET.  All items in this new file are
"keyworded."  This means that in the future you will only have to add an item
or two to become current.  You won't have to redo the entire file any more.

The easiest way to upgrade to the new Setup File is to print out your
Configuration File.  Then start {COMMO} 5.xx and press Alt-G to edit the Setup
File.  Change any items as needed, then exit and restart {COMMO} (the Setup
File is processed only at startup now).


Dialing Directory
-----------------

You will only need to change your Dialing Directory if you have used any
alternate Dialing Prefixes -- #1, #2, #3 or #4.

The Dialing Prefix items in the Configuration File are gone, but you may now
establish String Variables to have as many prefixes (or suffixes) as desired.
For example, suppose you had this in 4.xx:

        23 * {AT U1 DT}        Dial Prefix #2

and you had a Dialing Directory entry:

        Joes-BBS        {#2 555-1234} {pword} ...

In 5.xx you would put the following in your Setup File:

        {set prefix2,AT U1 DT}   Alternate prefix

You could use a variable name of your choice instead of "prefix2."

Finally, in your Dialing Directory change the entry to:

        Joes-BBS        {%prefix2% 555-1234} {pword} ...


Macro File
----------

Macro labels (they used to be called macro-id's) must now begin with a colon
(:).  They may also be made up of one or more characters, of which the first
eight are significant.

So just change all your macro labels from {abc} to {:abc}, etc., for now.

The password must now be specified with the built-in variable "_pas".  So just
replace all occurrences of "#" with "%_pas".

The EXECute "%" parameters have all been replaced with String Variables or
with Function Switches.  Here is a list of parameters and what to change them
to:

 Old Parameter   Change to
 -------------   ---------

        %a      Use "A" switch:  EXEC-A ...
        %w      Use "W" switch:  EXEC-W ...
        %p      %_port   (or %_por)
        %s      %_speed  (or %_spe)
        %m      %_modem  (or %_mod)
        %c      %_cap
        %u      String variable, "%uldir" for example.
        %d      String variable, "%dldir" for example.
        %k      Control character, e.g. change "%k^L" to just "^L".
        %i      Use INPUt function prior to EXEC.  See example
                below.

EXED and EXEN are no longer valid functions and must be specified with
Function Switches.  Change EXED to EXEC-D and EXEN to EXEC-N.

Note that Function Switches may be used in any combination.  Here is an
example of a macro to upload a file using Zmodem with DSZ:

 ZMODEM batch   {:af2} {setv file,%uldir\}
                {input file,Enter a filename to UPLOAD}
                {exec-AWD c:\proto\DSZ.com port %_port sz -m %file} {}

This sets the temporary variable "file" to the upload directory "uldir".  The
INPUt function will display the current value of "file" in the input line
(with the cursor at the end).

Then DSZ will be run (direct, because of the "D" switch).  The contents of the
variable "file" will be used for the filename.  After DSZ executes, the alarm
will sound ("A" switch) and {COMMO} will wait for a key press ("W" switch) so
you can see the results.


A few other functions now have Function Switches to replace other parameters:

 Change                         To
 ------                         --

 {dial 5,abc,c}                 {dial-C 5,abc}
 {macload other.mac,abc,r}      {macload-R other.mac,abc}
 {doorway s}                    {doorway-S}


Key Changes
-----------

A number of key commands now have different default keys.  These new keys may
conflict with existing macros, so check them carefully.  Here is a list of the
changes:

 Old key        New key         Key Command
 -------        -------         -----------

  Alt-H          F1             Online Help
  Alt-Q          Alt-H          Hang Up Modem
  Alt-U          Alt-N          Multi Number Dial
  Alt-L          Alt-P          Set Terminal Parameters
  Alt-P          Alt-W          Send Password String
  Alt-3          Alt-T          Master Sound toggle
  Alt-4          Alt-T          AutoBaud toggle
  Alt-5          Alt-T          Local Echo toggle
  Alt-0          Alt-T          Signal Lights toggle
