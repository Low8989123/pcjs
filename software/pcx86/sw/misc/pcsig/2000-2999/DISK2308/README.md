## Information about "LASER GRAPH  2 OF 2 (ALSO 2027)"

    LASER GRAPH is a group of programs, useful to engineers, for producing
    high resolution data plots using an HP LaserJet II printer.  The types
    of plots LASER GRAPH is capable of producing are: single line,
    multiple line, three dimensional surface plots, X-Y plots, and scatter
    diagrams.  The plots may be saved to a disk file; a program is
    included to review previously generated plots. It can print with a
    resolution of up to 2500 X 3000 dots (pixels), depending upon your
    printer.  LaserJet soft fonts are supported, providing a high level of
    flexibility in font choice.
    
    All of the elements of a really good data plotting system are here. It
    requires patience and diligence to become familiar with how it works but
    LASER GRAPH does produce stunning results on your laser printer.  All
    plot commands may be entered on the DOS command line. This allows a
    string of plot commands to be put in a batch file for execution without
    requiring constant user intervention.
