Disk Title: Laser Letterhead plus 2/2 (#2037 also)                      
PC-SIG Version: S3.0                                                    
                                                                        
Program Title: Laser Letterhead plus                                    
Author Version: 3.0                                                     
Author Registration: $25.00                                             
Special Requirements: 640K RAM, DOS 3.0+, hard drive, laser printer, sof
                                                                        
This program is an easy-to-use laser printing program that will let you 
create letterhead stationery and matching envelopes on your HP LaserJet 
printer.  This includes all Hewlett Packard printers except the original
LaserJet Model.  Supported models are the LaserJet Plus, LaserJet 500   
Plus, LaserJet 200, Series II, Series IID, Series IIP, and the new      
Series III. A closely compatible laser printer may also be used.        
                                                                        
All font handling is automatically done for you.  Copy your fonts into  
the directory with the program files, place the font names in the Setup 
program, and you are ready to go.  With a few menu choices you can      
create stationery that looks as though it came from a typesetter's      
workbench.                                                              
                                                                        
Any laser printer using Level IV (page formatting feature) HP Printer   
Command Language (PCL) can use LASER LETTERHEAD.  Using proportional    
fonts of your choice you may select centered or left justified groupings
with ten variations of borders and shadings precisely formatted and     
calculated.  You do not need bold type: the program will make bold type 
from your light or regular fonts.                                       
                                                                        
Create not only a business letterhead, but a personal version also. You 
do not have to calculate each line of print, nor worry about the        
difficult task of centering proportional fonts.  The program does it all
for you.  Boxing in lines is a snap, and shading the letterhead is a    
matter of choice.  Everything is menu-driven to make it easy.           
                                                                        
Addresses placed on envelopes can be saved to the address database and  
used again.  This dBASE-type file can be exported to a wordprocessor    
and used to write form letters.
