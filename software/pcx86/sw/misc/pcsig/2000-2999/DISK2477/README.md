## Information about "CLUB-EZ"

    CLUB-EZ is a simple to use program designed to handle any club or
    organization's record keeping, including membership, attendance and
    financial information. The program is powerful enough for the
    experienced PC user yet, because it is "menu" driven, allows people who
    probably have not had much experience with a PC or software packages to
    be up and running in minutes.
    
    CLUB-EZ is in full color, with no graphic cards or printer drivers
    needed, and is packed with features. It prints 2 kinds of club rosters,
    and will print dues statements on plain paper or letterhead for ANY
    billing cycle. It produces mailing labels for members, guests, and dues
    statements, tracks attendance, and easily handles meeting reservations.
    The financial module (which is sent free with your $45 registration)
    allows you to set up a budget and track income and expenses for any
    period. The module also allows you to set up your own income and expense
    categories.
    
    CLUB-EZ seems to be particularly advantageous in that years of club
    records can be saved for future reference and because it eliminates
    compatibility problems when transferring records from one year (or
    person) to the next, making CLUB-EZ a good value and useful for years to
    come.

Dear Club Officer,


Look what Club-EZ can do for your group:

     CLUB-EZ is "menu" driven, which means that even a novice
     PC user will be up and running, literally in minutes.

     Because CLUB-EZ has three separate modules (membership, attendance,
     and financial management) it is referred to as "integrated
     software".  This means that it is possible for one person to handle
     all the record keeping needs of an organization because everything
     needed to run a club efficiently is right at his or her fingertips.
     But, each module can be run independently, too, so any number
     of people can share in club record keeping and later combine their
     records!

NOTE!!!! This shareware version does not contain the financial module.
As such, you will get an error message if you try to run option 3 off
the Main Menu. We will send you the financial module FREE! when you
register your copy. (SEE BELOW)

Speaking of everything needed to run a club, CLUB-EZ
does it all:

             Prints 2 kinds of club rosters, a detailed one
             that's great for networking; and a shorter
             version for clubs with hundreds of members.

             Prints dues statements on plain paper or
             letterhead for ANY billing cycle.

             Produces mailing labels for members, guests,
             and dues statements.

             Makes tracking attendance and handling meeting
             reservations a snap!

When you register your CLUB-EZ program, we will send you the
financial module that completes the CLUB-EZ set ABSOLUTELY
FREE! This module:

     Allows you to set up a budget and track income
     and expenses for any period.  You can even set
     up your own income and expense categories!


WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO COMPLETE THE REGISTRATION FORM AT THE
END OF THIS LETTER . . . IT IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN RECEIVE THE
FREE FINANCIAL MODULE, AND NOTICES ON UPDATES. CLUB-EZ is
regularly updated, enhanced and improved from your comments!

                     BUT THAT ' S NOT ALL !


Years of club records can be saved for future reference.  Just
think what that will mean when your chapters celebrate their
anniversaries, or when someone is trying to look-up an old
friend or remember past officers!

Most clubs find that perhaps the best benefit to CLUB-EZ is
that it makes record keeping fun, simple, and FAST!  No more arm-
twisting to get committee volunteers, because everyone
wants to use CLUB-EZ!

Because it eliminates compatibility problems when
transferring records from one year (or person) to the next,
CLUB-EZ will serve your organization for years to come!



I truly believe your group will find CLUB-EZ to be of
tremendous benefit, especially because CLUB-EZ is particularly
strong in the areas of membership development, retention and networking.



Sincerely,

Jeffrey L. Thomas
President

     STEP 1:  Make a directory on hard drive C called CLUB-EZ


     STEP 2:  Place the PROGRAM disk in the A drive and copy
              all the files (*.*) to the CLUB-EZ directory on
              the hard drive.

     STEP 4:  Type CLUB to start the program.

     STEP 5:  When the MAIN MENU screen appears, be sure to
              set-up your disk (choice #4) with your club's information.
              CLUB-EZ must know where your data
              files are before you start to write files.
              (This process only has to be done once.)
