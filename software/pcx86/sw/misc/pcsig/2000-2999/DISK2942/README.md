You have a King and a seven and the dealers has a nine showing.  What do
you do?  I'll take another card!  "Never hit hard 17 or more."  That's  
something the advanced blackjack player knows and that something that   
PRO-PLAY BLACKJACK will remind you of.  Have fun and learn the advanced 
concepts of blackjack with PRO-PLAY BLACKJACK; a blackjack simulation   
with great graphics.                                                    
                                                                        
If you have a basic understanding of blackjack, but want to take the    
next step and play like a "pro," here's your chance.  PRO-PLAY includes 
all the help screens and the tables of strategies you'll need. PRO-PLAY 
uses the rules found in most casinos on the Las Vegas Strip to teach you
concepts of hard/soft hands, splitting, double downing, and more.  Once 
you have skills improved, invite six other friends to play and PRO-PLAY 
will keep the score.
