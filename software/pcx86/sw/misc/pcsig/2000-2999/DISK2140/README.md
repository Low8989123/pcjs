## Information about "THE NIGHT SKY 4 OF 4 (1796,1797,2139)"

    This computer planetarium is capable of plotting 24,000 stars to
    magnitude +7.49. The registered version is capable of plotting 45,000
    stars to magnitude +8.49. THE NIGHT SKY is a very easy to use
    menu-driven program for the amateur astronomer. In fact, this program
    was
    written by an amateur astronomer who, when he is not looking at the
    stars, drives a London transport bus. He has spent many of his off
    hours working on this program, which originally started as an exercise
    in programming.
    
    Use THE NIGHT SKY to draw a star map and move around the sky, show the
    night sky to a magnification and resolution of your choice, plot all the
    planets and the Moon any time from January 1, 1600 to December 31, 3000;
    predict solar and lunar eclipses; and view your local sky. Also covered
    are comets, the minor planets, the sun, moon, and satellites of Jupiter.
    From the stars menu you can choose the constellations, 21 brightest
    stars, bright star catalogue, map the night sky, star atlas, deep sky,

You may never figure out where all that stuff in your house came from,  
but as long as you have it, you might as well keep track of it.  The    
HOME INVENTORY RECORD KEEPER lets you do just that, room by room.       
                                                                        
It's not dramatic, but it is a handy way of keeping track of everything 
you have in your house.  You can, of course, give a location for        
everything, and indicate the actual or estimated value of each item.    
This will be essential should you ever suffer a loss by theft or fire.  
You can also print a list of your possessions and tuck it away for safe 
keeping.                                                                
                                                                        
There is no manual on the disk, because you won't need one -- that's how
easy this program is to use.  If you need help at any time, just press  
the F1 key and you'll see a context-sensitive help screen.
