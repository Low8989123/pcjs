Author Registration: $15.00                                             
Special Requirements: CGA.                                              
                                                                        
CGA SCREEN DESIGNER turns your keyboard or mouse into a drawing pen and 
your CGA monitor screen into an easel.  With CGA SCREEN DESIGNER, you   
can draw your own pictures using graphics primitives such as lines,     
circles, and boxes.  Use the numeric keypad or mouse to draw or move the
cursor around the screen.  Create eight different graph styles, save    
your pictures and graphs to disk for future editing, and print your     
pictures and graphs on any Epson-compatible dot-matrix printer.         
                                                                        
Use the menu system or the Quick Command keys to operate CGA SCREEN     
DESIGNER.  The Pen menu items include:  Move, Draw, Erase, Pattern, or  
Pen Width (which can be 1, 3, or 5 pixels).  Select the Shapes menu for 
options such as:  Circle, Rectangle, Ellipse, Curve, or Line.  Create   
eight different graphs.  Choose from two types each of horizontal bar,  
vertical bar, and line graphs as well as three-dimensional bar graphs   
and pie charts.                                                         
                                                                        
CGA SCREEN DESIGNER supports all printers that emulate the FX/LX/MX/LQ  
series of Epson printers.  This includes most of the dot-matrix printers
on the market, and a few laser printers.  Choose to print in Portrait,  
Landscape, or Oversize Portrait mode.
