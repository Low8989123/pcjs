## Information about "FONTED DISK 1 OF 2 (ALSO 2097)"

    Want to change the fonts that are normally displayed on your EGA or VGA
    screen?  FONTED lets you change the size and shape of
    characters to suit your taste; create foreign language fonts like
    Russian, Hebrew or Arabic; or make custom fonts to suit other special
    uses.
    
    You can reduce the size of a screen font to increase the number of text
    lines displayed on the screen.  You can also save custom screen fonts in
    an executable COM file and recall them later.  And custom fonts can be
    made "sticky" with an installation procedure so you can use the fonts
    with your favorite application such as a wordprocessor.  Works great
    with or without a mouse.

Special Requirements: EGA or VGA, Hard Drive recommended                
                                                                        
Want to change the fonts that are normally displayed on your EGA or VGA 
screen?  FONTED enables you change the size and shape of the characters 
to suit your taste, or create foreign language fonts like Russian,      
Hebrew or Arabic, or make custom fonts to suit other special uses.      
                                                                        
For example, by reducing the size of a screen font you can increase the 
number of text lines on the screen.  You can save these custom screen   
fonts in an executable COM file and recall them later.  The custom fonts
have the unique ability to be made "sticky" with an installation        
procedure so you can use the fonts with your favorite application, for  
example, a word processor.  FONTED supports a mouse, but does not       
require one.

			CHARCONV Font converter
			=======================

In addition to the font editor	proper, you will find a utility  program
CHARCONV that converts a FONTED binary font file to an assembly language
source program, which can be fed directly into an assembler to produce a
self-loading .COM program from the font.  Thus, you can distribute  your
fonts more freely.  They also load slightly faster.  The resulting  font
"programs"  set  the  errorlevel  automatically,  if  the  printer   was
off-line:  This helps building more  powerful batch files.  To use  this
program, you will need an assembler, linker and a program to convert  an
.EXE file to a .COM file (EXE2BIN).
