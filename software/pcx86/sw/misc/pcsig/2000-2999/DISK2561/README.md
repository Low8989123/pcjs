Program Title: PC-Postcard Plus                                         
Author Version: 3.41S                                                   
Author Registration: $25.00                                             
Special Requirements: Pin-feed index card stock and a dot matrix printer
                                                                        
PC-POSTCARD PLUS uses your standard dot matrix printer to produce and   
address postcards with your custom message, such as business            
announcements, reminders and social invitations.  Even does double      
postcards!                                                              
                                                                        
With first-class mail costing 25 cents and bulk mail now almost         
17 cents a piece, postcard mailings have suddenly become the darling of 
thrift-minded businesses and organizations.  You get first-class        
delivery and immediate attention for just 15 cents.  Here's a program   
that lets you produce customized postcards -- both singles and doubles, 
with or without a mailing permit -- and even individually addresses     
them!                                                                   
                                                                        
Using standard-sized (4x6) pin-fed postcards, PC-POSTCARD PLUS prints a 
message 22 lines by 55 characters, an address, and an optional header   
for the return address, postal mailing permit stamp, etc.  It has       
formats for your messages for both sides of a single or double          
postcard.                                                               
Double postcards are great as they allow for a tear-off response card   
for orders, RSVPs, and such. membership events, etc.                    
                                                                        
Addresses are automatically inserted as each card prints.  Mailing lists
can be built, added to and sorted by up to 10 different fields.  Since  
PC-POSTCARD PLUS was written by Carl Mieske, author of PC-MAIL          
(PC-SIG disks #868, #869), PC-MAIL mailing lists are compatible for use 
with this program, but not required.
