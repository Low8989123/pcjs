## Information about "VGA SHARKS"

    An underwater action arcade game that utilizes unique Artificial
    Intelligence, simulation and classic animation techniques to transform
    your computer screen into a realistic ocean floor.  This the VGA
    version of ALIVE SHARKS.
    
    You are the Frogman and your mission is to collect rare marine
    creatures and recover lost treasures from the bottom of the sea. Armed
    with your trusty stun-gun, you can retreat to your electromagnetic base
    that repels sharks and the rest of your dreadful enemies.  Your diving
    uniform is state-of-the-art, but you can survive only a few shark bites
    and it is useless against the poison of the deadly
    jellyfish.
    
    This is not your typical "shoot-em-up," "eat-the-dots" kind of game.
    Your enemies are crafty and independent and they surround you in clever
    formations.  When you shoot at them from far away, they are smart enough
    to avoid your shot.

               WELCOME TO VGA SHARKS     1.0      25-APRIL-1990

   This README file contains important, last minute information in
   addition to VSHARKS.DOC . It also answers many common questions.

                        ANSWERS TO COMMON QUESTIONS
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   A) VGA :  This program requires VGA  graphics display and a minimum of
      384 K of system  memory.  The program supports the most popular VGA
      cards.  If your  card is not included in  the " GRAPH : ..."  menu,
      you have 2 options: (1) Contact your VGA card manufacturer, and ask
      what other VGA card is yours  COMPATIBLE with.  Or (2) Just try all
      selections  from the "GRAPH: MENU"  until you find  one that  works
      reliably.

   B) MOUSE :  if you plan to use the  mouse,  the mouse  driver  must be
      loaded before running VSHARKS. For best results,  your mouse driver
      should be a recent update,  1988 or later.  If you have any problem
      with the mouse due to compatibility issues just select the "POINT :
      With Keyboard" option from the installation menu.  If when  you are
      using the  mouse you run out of  desk space,  you are not  using it
      correctly, please read the OPERATION section in VSHARKS.DOC

   C) SPECIAL NOTES FOR SHAREWARE VERSION :  VGA Sharks presently includes
      3  different games:  RAYBATS,  SHARKS, and  KILLER  JELLY-FISH.  The
      Shareware  version will  only let you  play SHARKS,  the  registered
      version will however let you play all three,  plus any new games  we
      have created for  VSHARKS.EXE  since this  README.DOC  document  was
      written.
