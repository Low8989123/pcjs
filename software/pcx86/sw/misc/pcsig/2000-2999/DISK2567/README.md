Special Requirements: None.                                             
                                                                        
GRAB PLUS is a memory-resident utility that grabs an address            
typed with a wordprocessor and immediately prints it.                   
                                                                        
While using your wordprocessor, call the GRAB PLUS menu by pressing a   
selected hot key.  A box appears which is used for grabbing the address 
to be printed.  Adjust the size of the box to accommodate the longest   
addresses.  Edit the address before printing or type in a whole new     
address. GRAB PLUS also prints a default return address on the envelope.
Once the address is printed, GRAB PLUS disappears, returning you to     
normal computer operation.                                              
                                                                        
GRAB PLUS has a database that stores and organizes address information  
with easy access for printing.  Mark groups of addresses to be printed  
at one time.  Exchange data with other programs.  GRAB PLUS is the      
program to grab if you want a quick and easy way to print nicely typed  
envelopes with your computer.                                           
                                                                        
The LASERLABEL program was created to allow users of the GRAB PLUS      
Envelope Printer to turn their data files into a powerful label printing
system.  Use the data files from GRAB and print labels on your LaserJet,
DeskJet, and other printers. Use different label formats from Avery, as 
well as using soft fonts for added impact to your mailings.  The program
recognizes the tag fields of GRAB and will select by tags if you prefer.
The LASERLABEL system comes with a sample set of soft fonts to show you 
how your labels can have a creative appearance for greater impact.
