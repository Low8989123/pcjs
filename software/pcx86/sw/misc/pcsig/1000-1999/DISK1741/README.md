## Information about "PULLED FROM LIBRARY"

    A2Z is a multi-link fixed-structure database. Dynamically link to any
    number of files under macro control. It is best suited to handle
    complex database operations where text-based or home data-filers dare
    not tread.
    
    A2Z is an unusual database manager with simple relational capabilities
    linking files with a common record number. Its structure also enables
    very quick database operations. The power of this database can be used
    best by someone with a knowledge of Boolean logic or programming
    experience. Autocode, A2Z's macro compiler, uses editor-created
    external macro files to create very powerful and complex Boolean
    structures, including nested IFs, substring handling, and conditional
    access to link file data.

A2Z is an unusual database manager with rudimentary relational          
capabilities in that it is able to link files of related data in which  
the data to be linked have a common record number.  It supports three   
types of fields: 1) character fields, or combinations of texts and      
numbers which are not to be acted on mathematically (added, subtracted, 
multiplied, divided); 2) numeric fields, which are acted on             
mathematically and may be carried out to four decimal places; and 3)    
money fields, which are also acted on mathematically, but are carried   
out to two decimal places.                                              
                                                                        
A2Z consists of a series of relatively small .COM files, which act upon 
macro file modules to perform operations like creating, sorting,        
viewing, etc.  Databases consist of a series of related files, each     
containing the information required for the macro files to perform their
respective tasks.  This enables A2Z to carry out database operations    
very quickly.

## TIPS.DOC

{% raw %}
```
A2Z is one of the most flexible Data Base Management Systems.  With the
VIEW task one can change the data dictionary view of the database.  With
the NEXT task one can reset the next available record pointer at any time.
With the ZOOM task on can expand your data base as necessary.

However, one can AVOID considerable time re-engineering the data base if
the following design TIPS are followed:

1)  BEFORE entering real data, build a test data base of 25 records and
    use this to test your application.  AFTER your application is TESTED,
    then use ZOOM to expand the data base to the desired size

2)  PROFILE NAMES need NOT be used unless the application requires
    multiple reports

3)  PLAN your data base with FUTURE needs in mind.  For example, make
    ZIPCODE 9 characters to allow for expansion

4)  SEPARATE data into the SMALLEST useable form.  For example, separate
    name into LAST, FIRST, and MI

5)  POSITION the MOST ACCESSED data fields at the FRONT of the RECORD
    to avoid paging down to get to the field

6)  FIELD NAMES also function as COLUMN NAMES.  Avoid OBSCURE names and
    names which are LONGER than the FIELD

7)  ANY field can be SORTED, but take care that the CONTENT of the field
    is UNIFORM so that the sorted order is what is EXPECTED

8)  NUMERIC or MONEY fields are for calculations or subtotals.  EVERYTHING
    else should be CHARACTER

9)  Avoid OVERFLOWs by making NUMERIC and MONEY fields as large as necessary

9)  RELATE the DATA to the RECORD NUMBER.  FOR EXAMPLE, assign CUSTOMER or
    PART numbers the REC number.  ALL records can then be DIRECTLY ACCESSED
    by REC number!  In fact, A2Z uses the REC number to access MULTIPLE files
    dynamically.  RELATED files must match the ROOT file REC for REC, for
    example, REC 44 of the ROOT file and the LINKED file should contain
    related data
