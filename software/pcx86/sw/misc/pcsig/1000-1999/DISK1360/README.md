## Information about "ALCHEMY DESKTOP PUBLISHING UTILITIES"

    If your desktop publishing efforts seem a little plain, spice them up
    with this collection of seven utilities for Xerox's Ventura Publisher!
    
    GCAP imports charts, graphs, pictures or anything else in graphics mode
    that you want to use in desktop publishing.  These files are written
    directly to disk, complete with compression and a suitable GEM/IMG file
    header.  GCAP works with a CGA, EGA, or Hercules graphics card.
    
    HP-SLASH hacks unwanted characters out of your soft fonts to create
    leaner, faster files.  It works by creating a new soft font from an
    existing one but only includes the characters you want.
    
    MAC2IMG converts standard MacPaint image files into GEM/IMG-compatible
    paint files, suitable for use with Ventura 1.1.  MAC2PCX converts them
    to PC Paintbrush-compatible PCX files.
    
    MCOPY is an enhanced COPY command to copy several files onto floppies.
    It sorts through the files to be copied and begins with the largest one
    that fits on a disk.  It fills in the remaining space with smaller files
    to use as much of the floppy as possible.  If there are still files to
    be copied when the disk is full, the program pauses and asks for another
    floppy.  It then proceeds to fill that floppy as well.  MCOPY also
    performs an authentic 16-bit CRC check on every file.
    
    SCOOP lets your PC look at PC Paintbrush, MacPaint or GEM/IMG
    pictures.
    
    VENTURA FONT MACHINE is a menu-driven front-end to create width tables
    for soft fonts used with LaserJet Plus compatible printers.
