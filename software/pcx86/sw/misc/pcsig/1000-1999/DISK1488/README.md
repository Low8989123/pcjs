                              1
     
          Carl  stood  on  the trunk of a tree  that  leaned  out 
    horizontally over the water.  He looked for signs of activity 
    in the rapids below,  but couldn't see any.  Too early in the 
    season? Perhaps.  But he didn't mind not catching fish.  Just 
    to be out on the open air, alone, and away from the bustle of 
    the  office for three whole days was sufficient.   The  trout 
    could wait.  There would be time enough for trout when he had 
    his annual, September, two-week vacation.
          Carl  smiled  to himself,  thinking of the prospect  of 
    cooking  freshly  caught  Newfoundland  trout--or  perhaps  a 
    salmon--over an open fire with Sally hovering nearby, waiting 
    to  sample  his gourmet delights;  she in her  Woolrich  down 
    vest, corduroy slacks, and the rubber-soled boots that he got 
    for  her  at L.L. Beans' for Christmas and he  in  his  usual 
    unkempt, backwoods regulars of faded denims and flannel.  His 
    tent  would be just behind them with its snugly inviting nest 
    of zipped together sleeping bags.  A gentle breeze coming off 
    the  water  would  have just enough force to  keep  away  any 
    errant mosquitoes.  A salmon would leap up the rapids on  its 
    spawning journey upstream.   A huge red sun would hang in the 
    boughs of the trees on the far bank of the river...
          Was that a trout rise?   Or was it just a current swirl 
    behind that boulder?   Carl watched the water intensely for a 
    moment,  but the movement that he caught out of the corner of 
    his eye,  if indeed there actually had been any movement, did 
    not  return.   However,  the  large boulder amid stream  some 
    fifty  feet  away  was  as good  a  casting  target  as  any.  
    Besides,  it was starting to get dark, and he had only enough 
    light  to make a few more casts before returning upstream  to 
    his campsite.  
          Carl stripped the line from his reel, then roll-cast to 
    get  the line onto the water.   He double-hauled the line  to 
    get it up into the air and,  after a few false-casts, dropped 
    his fly on he far side of the boulder.  It danced on the edge 
    of  the  eddy for a fraction of a  second,  then  disappeared 
    underwater.   He  gave his line a little tug to scud the  fly          
    into  the  pocket  of calm water  behind  the  boulder,  then 
    retrieved  the line with short jerks to give the fly  action.  
    There was no strike.  He tried several more casts around that 
    boulder, but the results were the same: no trout.
          Yes, it is too early in the season, but there  will  be 
    plenty of time later, Carl thought as he climbed back off his 
    perch.
          It was now well into dusk.  Carl would just barely have 
    time  enough to get back to camp before it became too dark to 
    see where he was walking.  The river made a large, snake-like 
    bend between the place where he had been fishing and the spot 
    where he had set up his camp.   The forest appeared to be all 
    of widely-spaced, hardwood trees.  Carl thought that he could 
    save some time by cutting cross-country rather than following 
    the river back.   He consulted his topographic map.  His camp 
    was  near  a  small,  unnamed  stream.   He  questimaed  that 
    following  a  compass  heading of 5 degees  would  bring  him 
    directly to his camp, and even if he was off a little bit, he 
    would  hit  either  the river,  which he  could  then  follow 
    upstream to his camp,  or hit the brook which would lead  him 
    directly to the camp.  This seemed to him to be an excellent, 
    time-saving maneuver.  
          Carl  clipped  the Royal Coachman from the end  of  his 
    leader,  put the fly in his hatband,  wound the line onto the 
    reel,  disassembled his rod, and set out following a 5 degree  
    line with his Sunnto compass.
          Carl  hadn't  been walking for more than  five  minutes 
    before he began to have the feeling that something was wrong.  
    It  seemed to him that,  even though he had been  religiously 
    following  the  path  indicated by the  compass,  somehow  he 
    wasn't  walking in a straight line.   Although he  had  never 
    been a Boy Scout,  he knew that trusting your compass and not 
    your instincts was the prime rule for not getting lost.  
          It  must  be  the fading light that is giving  me  this 
    feeling, he thought.
          "Follow the compass," he told himself.
          Carl followed the compass for a few hundred yards  more 
    only to become more convinced that there was something wrong. 
    The  forest trees had become more spaced apart and park-like, 
    and he could see quite a distance ahead of him.   Most of the 
    trees  were  either maple or beech,  but in the  distance  he 
    could  see several white birches.   He could see two  birches 
    which  were lined up and spaced a hundred or so  feet  apart.  
    They  were  slightly to the right of his intended  path.   He 
    decided to check his compass,  mostly to reassure himself  of 
    the infallibity of Finnish compasses,  by sighting the trees, 
    then  walking to the first one,  and resighting the  furthest 
    one.
          This,  he thought to himself, will demonstrate that the 
    compass  is  giving  a straight line and should  be  followed 
    irregardless of any hunches to the contrary.
          When  Carl got to the first birch tree,  he pulled  the 
    compass out of his pocket and sighted the second tree. It had 
    moved.  Moved?
          "No,  that's impossible," he told himself,  "it must be 
    the compass."
          A  quick  inspection revealed no  apparent  damage,  no 
    bubbles in the fluid,  no dents in the housing, nothing.  Yet 
    in a hundred feet the tree had moved several degrees.
          But  if  the  tree hadn't moved--surely  I  would  have 
    noticed the tree moving,  he thought  to himself--then  there 
    must be something wrong with the compass.
          "Now don't panic," he told himself, "there is a logical  
    explanation for this."
          Perhaps  I  misread  the compass that  first  time,  he 
    thought.
          Carl  chose another tree,  a large beech,  that was  in          
    line  with his heading and set out to it in a  straight-line-
    of-sight march.  Now he had three points of reference to give 
    him a straight line to check his compass against.   Again  he 
    backsighted.   Again  the trees moved.   Not only  that,  but 
    according to the compass they shifted nearly 90 degrees.  Yet 
    he could see that they were really in a line.  
          Carl  rapidly considered he possibilities open to  him.  
    He  could go back the way he came,  then follow the river  to 
    his  camp,  but by then it would be dark,  and  besides,  the 
    forest's growth was much more tangled along the river than it 
    was here inland.   He could go foward,  ignoring the  compass 
    and following his instincts, but in what direction was he now 
    heading?   Was  he headed towards his camp,  or was he headed 
    towards somewhere into the wild interior of Maine?   Even  if 
    he  were able to instinctively follow a straight line,  if he 
    headed in the wrong direction, it might mean walking fifty or 
    one hundred miles before he came to civilization.   He  might 
    even end up in Canada first.
          Well,  no, that's not going to happen, he thought as he 
    checked  his wrist watch,  because it will be dark in  twenty 
    minutes.
          "Now don't panic," he told himself again.
          He  didn't  have  to  be at work until  the  day  after 
    tomorrow,  so he actually had a whole day to get himself  out 
    of  this silly situation.   And he would have to get  himself 
    out of it because no one would have the vaguest idea of where 
    to  look for him should he turn up missing.   Even Sally knew 
    only  that  he  was  going to do some  fishing  on  his  long 
    weekend.
          "When in doubt, don't," he told himself.
          Carl sat down at the base of a birch tree and  pondered 
    what to do next.  He got out his pipe, filled it with Amphora 
    tobacco,  and lit it.  He tried to figure out which direction 
    was  west,  but the light coming through the budding branches 
    seemed to come equally from all directions.  He couldn't  use 
    the sunset compass to get his bearings.  He couldn't hear the 
    river either.  He had no point of reference.
          "Lost," he admitted.
          Carl  looked at the compass again and shook his head in 
    disbelief.  The trees, of course, weren't moving.  Not unless 
    he had entered into some kind of Alice's Wonderland,  and  he 
    wasn't ready to believe that.
          May as well find a comfortable spot to spend the night, 
    he thought.   
          Carl noticed a clump of softwoods,  pines and firs, off 
    to  what  he  thought of as being the  east,  but  which  the 
    compass  said  was  north.   He set off  in  that  direction, 
    thinking  that he could make himself a comfortable bed out of 
    pine needles.
          As he entered the softwoods, he could see what appeared 
    to be a large ledge of cliff ahead of him.  He knew that this 
    area  was all river bottom land,  flat and some six to  eight 
    feet  above water level.   He couldn't exactly make  out  the 
    thing's shape because of the intervening trees,  but whatever 
    it  was,  it  wasn't  a forest tree.   It was  too  dark  and 
    massive.
          Perhaps it is a large,  glacial boulder that will offer 
    shelter for the night,  he thought as he made his way through 
    the firs to it.
          It wasn't a boulder.




                                  2 

          Carl  stood,  leaning against the trunk of a tree,  and 
    looked up at the monolith that was before him.  It was unlike 
    anything he had ever seen before.   It was unlike anything he 
    had  ever  read  about.   It was unlike anything  he had ever
    imagined.   What he thought might have been a glacial boulder
    turned out to be a large cube some fifty feet to a side.   It 
    was matte black in color and starkly plain.
          Is it a prehistoric relic like Stonehenge, he wondered. 
    No, it is too smoothly finished.  
          Carl  went up to it and tapped it with the tip  of  his 
    fishing  rod.   It  was no mirage or  hallucination,  for  it 
    appeared to be solid.   He touched it.   It was slightly cool 
    and  seemed to him to have the hard texture of glass.   It was 
    like a gigantic,  opaque rock crystal.   A few paces  brought 
    him to a corner.   The angle was crisp, as if it had been cut 
    off  and  polished smooth.  The second face proved to  be  as 
    featureless  as the first.   He continued to walk around  the 
    block,  wondering  how  someone  could build such  a  bizarre 
    structure  in  this isolated place.   Then he tripped  over  a 
    branch.  As he picked himself up, he noticed that the branch, 
    a  pine bough,  protruded out from under the  structure.   He 
    stared at it for a long,  indeterminate time.  The branch was 
    under the block.   The block was on top of the  branch.   The 
    branch  was here first.   Someone put the block on top of the 
    branch.   Carl  could  see all this,  but he didn't  want  to 
    believe it.  It was all too strange.
          Carl  then thought of his compass   and took it out  of 
    his pocket.   The needle was pointing directly at the  block.  
    He walked around the next corner of the block, but the needle 
    continued to point to the monolith.  He wondered if the block 
    was  radioactive.    Would  radioactivity  affect  a  compass 
    needle, or was it just magnetism?  He didn't know.  Was he in 
    any danger from this thing?   He didn't feel anything, but he 
    knew   from   his   anti-nuclear  protest   activities   that 
    radioactivity gave no indication of its presence.   He  would 
    need a geiger counter,  which, of course, he didn't happen to 
    have,  it  not being standard equipment for fishing trips  to 
    remote areas of Maine.  
          If  this thing is hot,  he thought,   it's probably too 
    late as it is.
          Carl continued to walk around the monolith;  it  proved 
    to be universally featureless.  However, when he came back to 
    his  starting side for the second time,  he found that  there 
    was  now an opening about six feet off the ground.   It was a 
    square  aperture  about  ten feet to a  side.   There  was  a 
    whitish light coming from inside.
          "'Curiouser and curiouser,' Alice said,  and so it is," 
    he mumbled.
          He couldn't see anything of the interior,  except  that 
    the  opening  seemed to be a square tunnel.   He  leaned  his 
    fishing  pole against the block and hoisted himself up to the 
    opening chin-up fashion.  He pulled himself up high enough to 
    look  in.   There  was no evidence of  a  door.   Could  this 
    opening  have been there before,  but with the light off  so 
    that he didn't notice it?   It didn't seem likely.   Besides, 
    the  light  seemed  to  be coming  from  the  interior  walls 
    themselves.  Along the walls of the passageway Carl could see 
    that  there  was  a graduation from the dark outside  to  the 
    lighted inside.  The innermost part seemed to be translucent.  
    Again,  except  for  the smooth  texture,  the  walls  seemed 
    featureless.   He couldn't see anything beyond the passageway 
    which   was  a  ten-foot  long  corridor  which  lead  to  an 
    open,interior  space.   His arms began to ache  from  holding 
    himself up, so he dropped back to the ground.
          "Now what?" he wondered.
          It  was  now  nearly  dark,  and except  for  the  area 
    illuminated by the glow from the opening,  the forest was  an 
    indistinct mass of dark shapes.  There was now no possibility 
    that  Carl could make any progress hiking through the  woods, 
    even if he had any idea about which direction to go, which he 
    didn't.  He wasn't even sure if he could find a good place to 
    bed down.  He looked up at the lighted opening.  
          Again Carl wondered about the possibility of radiation.  
    If  the glow was radiation,  but not powerful enough to  kill 
    him,  would it give him cancer?  Would it render him sterile?  
    That  last though would have been even more frightening  last 
    month, before Sally announced that she was pregnant.  Even if 
    she   didn't  marry  him--and  he  fully  expected  that  she 
    eventually would,  in spite of her independent and  liberated 
    ideas--he  would  have  that one progeny no matter  what  the 
    results would be from his encounter with this strange cube.
          Carl had been so busy thinking about the monolith  that 
    it took him a few minutes to notice that the sensation he was 
    feeling  was the pelting of occasional rain drops.   A faint, 
    distant  lightning flash warned him that a storm was  coming.  
    Again he looked up at the illuminated opening.
          Well,  if anything,  it might be a dry sort of cave, he 
    thought. 
          Carl placed his fishing pole on the lip of the  opening 
    and hoisted himself up.  It wasn't an easy task because there 
    wasn't  anything  to grab.   He lost his grip  on the  smooth 
    surface and tumbled to the ground twice before he as able  to 
    swing  a leg up and muscle his way up and in.   He lay on his 
    back  for  a moment,  recovering his  expended  energy.   His 
    entrance  had been,  he discovered,  complicated by the  fact 
    that the floor of the passageway actually angled upward, thus 
    giving the lip of the opening an angle of greater than ninety 
    degrees.                          
          Carl  stood  and picked up his fishing pole.   He  then 
    walked slowly and cautiously towards the interior.  It seemed 
    to  him that not only did the walls become  brighter  towards 
    the  interior,  they became softer.   He touched the wall and 
    found that his idea was correct.  The walls were also warmer.
          At  the  end  of  the  passageway  Carl  found  himself 
    standing before a huge,  empty room.   The ceiling must  have 
    been  thirty  feet high and the far wall about as  far  away.  
    The  light was bright,  but not blinding.   Excellent reading 
    light.
          This  would make a great library,  Carl thought  as  he 
    stepped into the room.
          Behind him,  Carl could hear the rain and the wind.  He 
    turned  and looked back at the forest.   A flash of lightning 
    gave him a brief glimpse of the storm that was just starting, 
    but the interior of this strange cube was warm and  dry.   He 
    walked to the center of the room.   He noticed that he had no 
    shadow.  He had equal light from all sides.
          Wouldn't   Sally  love  this  for  a   studio?     What 
    absolutely marvelous lighting, he thought.
          Carl  looked  around at the walls.   They were  all  as 
    featureless  as the outside walls.   It was a minute before he 
    realized that there was something missing.   He spun  around.  
    All six interior walls were identical.
          There was no passageway.

          "Good. What I want you to do is to project a rural road 
    scene,  either  an  actual scene,  or one that is made up  of 
    ecclectic  views,  on the walls before the exercise  bike  so 
    that  the  impression  will  be of  riding  down  that  road.  
    Furthermore, I want the scene to change with a rapidity which 
    is  coordinated with the pedaling speed of the exercise bike.  
    Now, can you do that?"
          "CARL WISHES THE SCENE TO DUPLICATE THE VIEW THAT WOULD 
    BE  HAD  BY RIDING DOWN THE HYPOTHETICAL ROAD  AND  HAVE  THE 
    SCENE GO PAST ON THE TWO WINGS OF THE CORNER?"
          "That is the exact idea.  Can it be done?"
          "AFFIRMATIVE.   ROBERT ONCE OBSERVED MARY ...  SPECIMEN 
    QR23  AS  SPECIMEN  QR23 WALKED  ALONG  A  RURAL,  UNOCCUPIED 
    COUNTRY  LANE.   SEVERAL  MILES OF AMBULATING WERE  RECORDED.  
    ROBERT THINKS THAT THE SCENE WOULD PROVE SATISFACTORY FOR THE 
    PURPOSES REQUIRED BY CARL."
          "Good. Let's give it a try."
          The  woods  scene  winked in on  the  walls,  and  Carl 
    climbed  aboard the exercise bicycle.   April stood  slightly 
    behind and to one side of Carl, watching.
          Carl started off very slowly, the balloons and baseball 
    cards  giving off lazy clicks, and the scene changing  almost 
    imperceptively.  Then he started picking up speed.  The trees 
    started flashing past them as the scene followed the tempo of 
    the  noisemakers.   April had moved in and held on to  Carl's 
    waist,  staring at the moving scene in front of  them.   Then 
    the  road  appeared  to veer to the right and dip  through  a 
    little valley.   April's squeal of delight brought Carl  back 
    from  the momentary fantasy that he was again a child, riding 
    his  bicycle.   He slowed the bike down and stopped  it;  the 
    scene followed exactly.
          "Now  it's  your turn," he said to April as he got  off 
    the bike.
          It  didn't  take  April very long to become  a  bicycle 
    enthusiast,  and  when  the balloons burst and  the  baseball 
    cards fell off, she didn't even notice.  She pedaled in happy 
    silence  down a country lane in Maine that was,  in  reality, 
    hundreds of lightyears away.
          Later  Robert suggested that a repertoire of  different 
    scenes be offered to April.   Rides along the beach,  through 
    the  desert,  and  along  various other  roads  in  different 
    seasons  were added.   Carl thought that it might be nice  to 
    have  scenes from different planets,  but Robert insisted  on 
    confining  the scenes to April and Carl's own  planet,  since 
    the  disposition of their case couldn't be  determined  until 
    after  the voyage,  and the offering of such scenes might  be 
    construed  as a violation of the non-dissemination clause  of 
    the Regulations of Robert's own cultural matrix.  Carl argued 
    that the addition of a ride around Mars' Mt. Olympus wouldn't 
    present  anything which would be "new knowledge," since  that 
    scene has already been viewed by Earth's robot explorers, but 
    Robert  declined; he  said that it would be  better  for  all 
    concerned  to  err on the side of caution because he  had  no 
    idea  how  this unprecedented matter would be handled by  his 
    superiors.
          The  exercise bike,  cum scenery,  proved to be a great 
    success  with  April.    Carl,   watching  her  one  morning, 
    commented  to  Robert that,  while this was a great  form  of 
    exercise  for  the  legs,   the  arms  were  being   somewhat 
    shortchanged.   Robert agreed that it was not a complete form 
    of  exercise,  but it was contributing to the maintenance  of 
    Carl and April's muscle tone.
          "THE  OBJECTIVE  WAS NOT THE  DEVELOPMENT  OF  ATHLETIC 
    ABILITIES, BUT TO PREVENT MUSCLE DETERIORATION."
          "Perhaps true,  but there is no harm in doing more than 
    just  maintaining  the  status  quo.   What  about  adding  a 
    rowing machine for developing the arms,  shoulder,  and  back 
    muscles?"
          "THE  EXISTENCE  OF  SUCH MACHINES IS  MENTIONED  IN  3 
    VOLUMES IN STORAGE, BUT SPECIFICATIONS ARE NOT GIVEN."
          Carl laughed.
          "For a man who has replicated a fully functioning human 
    being, the development of a simple exercise machine should be 
    a piece of cake."
          "STATEMENT NOT LOGICAL.  'PIECE OF CAKE' IS TAKEN AS AN 
    IDIOMATIC PHRASE INDICATING EASE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT.   IS THAT 
    CORRECT?"
          "Yes,  but don't worry about it.   I'll build a  rowing 
    machine myself.   I've used a couple on my rare excursions to 
    commercial  gyms,  so  I  have some  ideas  about  them,  and 
    besides, it'll give me something to do."
          "WILL   CARL  DESIRE  VISUAL  SIMULATION  TO  ACCOMPANY 
    ROWING?"
          "Let's just leave it as a simple exercise machine.   If 
    April ever has to fit back into her society on Earth, then it 
    would probably be best if she weren't treated to too much  of 
    a fantasy world.   As it is now, she has already been exposed 
    to powers far beyond our cultural matrix."
          "AFFIRMATIVE.   ROBERT  HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT NEGLIGENT  IN 
    LIMITING  THE EXPOSURE OF CARL AND APRIL TO DEVELOPMENTS MADE 
    BY  ADVANCED  CULTURAL MATRIXES.   HOWEVER,  SOME  DEGREE  OF 
    EXPOSURE   WAS  NECESSARY  TO  PROVIDE  SATISFACTORY   LIVING 
    CONDITIONS FOR THIS VOYAGE.  ROBERT TAKES FULL RESPONSIBILITY 
    FOR  ALL  SUCH  INSTANCES,  BUT DOES NOT WISH  TO  INCUR  ANY 
    PENALTY FOR EXCEEDING WHAT IS MINIMALLY  REQUIRED.   BESIDES, 
    SHOULD  CARL  AND APRIL BE RETURNED TO THE PLANET  THEY  CALL 
    EARTH,  NO  ONE ON THAT PLANET WILL BELIEVE THEIR ACCOUNT  OF 
    THIS VOYAGE."
          "Oh,  so true," Carl agreed,  "so why not pull out  all 
    the  stops, and show us what your cultural matrix can  really 
    do?"
          "WILLFUL  VOILATION  OF  THE  NON-DISSEMINATION  CLAUSE    
    IS CONSIDERED TO BE A MOST SERIOUS CRIME.  ALL TRANSGRESSIONS 
    MADE  TO  DATE  HAVE  BEEN NECESSITATED  BY  THE  UNIQUE  AND 
    UNPRECEDENTED CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS VOYAGE."
          "Oh.  I'd  find you not guilty,  but I'd still like  to 
    take that bike ride around Mt. Olympus.
          "WERE   CARL  TO  BECOME  AN  INTEGRATED  PART  OF  THE 
    INFORMATION GATHERERS OF THE CULTURAL MATRIX OF ROBERT,  SUCH  
    A BICYCLE TRIP WOULD BE POSSIBLE.   SUCH CONSIDERATIONS  MUST  
    AWAIT THE JUDGEMENTS OF THE SUPERIORS OF ROBERT."
       "Well,  while  we're  wating,  I'm going to go build  that 
    rowing machine."

                                  26  

          "Just  between you and me,  I don't mind admitting that 
    this pregnancy thing scares me.  I mean, what do I know about 
    birthing babies?  The making part is easy, but the delivering 
    part ... what if something should go wrong?"
          "CARL WILL HAVE ROBERT TO ASSIST CARL."
          "Yeah, but you're on one side of the wall, and we're on 
    the other.  For me it's going to be all hands-on experience."
          "CIRCUMSTANCES ARE INALTERABLE."
          "Yeah,  well,  I'll just have to muddle  through.   I'm 
    concerned  about April,  though.   She can't  intellectualize 
    about what's going on.  I don't know how well she understands 
    what's been happening inside her body.   When the birth pains 
    come,   she'll   be  terrified.    Talk  about  a   traumatic 
    experience:  she's  having a baby when she is no more than  a 
    big baby herself.   What kind of effect will that have on her 
    psyche?  What a mess!"
          "SINCE  CARL  REFUSED  TO LET ROBERT  RETURN  APRIL  TO 
    MOLECULAR  STORAGE,  CARL MUST DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCES  OF 
    THE ACTS OF CARL."
          "That's what I've been trying to do.  I've even thought 
    of not having sex with her,  but ... well, I need it, and she 
    enjoys  it  too.   It  makes her so happy she  purrs  like  a 
    kitten.   She  doesn't  know that infants aren't supposed  to 
    enjoy  sex ...  even infants with  eighteen-year-old  bodies.  
    She  enjoys  it  so much ...  what kind of  monster  have  we 
    created?   An  infant nymphomaniac with an  eighteen-year-old 
    body.   I know,  nymphomania is a sexist myth, but what would 
    the Baptists say about us?"
          "BAPTIST  OPINIONS  ARE  IRRELEVANT.   APRIL  DOES  NOT 
    BELONG TO THE BAPTIST CULTURAL MATRIX.  APRIL DOES NOT BELONG 
    TO  ANY  CULTURAL  MATRIX.   CARL IS THE CULTURAL  MATRIX  OF 
    APRIL."
          "That makes me one hundred percent responsible, doesn't 
    it?"
          "WITHIN  THE CONTEXT OF ALMOST ALL CULTURAL  MATRIXRES, 
    ESPECIALLY THE CULTURAL MATRIX OF CARL,  CARL IS  RESPONSIBLE 
    FOR APRIL.   ALSO, WITHIN THE CULTURAL MATRIX OF ROBERT, CARL 
    ADDITIONALLY   LEGALLY   OWNS  APRIL:   CARL  PAID  FOR   THE 
    REPLICATION   OF   APRIL.    THEREFORE,   CARL   HAS   DOUBLE 
    RESPONSIBILITY.    FURTHER   COMPLICATION:   CARL  COULD   BE 
    INTERPRETED--NEBULOSITY  OF  LEGAL  SYSTEM  EXISTS  ON   THIS 
    POINT--AS  BEING THE FATHER OF APRIL.   THEREFORE,  CARL  HAS 
    TRIPPLE RESPONSIBILITY.  ALSO POSSIBLE ..."
          "Enough of your legalisms!   I plead nolo contendre and 
    take full responsibility for April.  She's my ward, my child, 
    my  girl friend,  my lover,  my mate,  my ...  my everything.  
    It's just that I'm worried about how to get her through  this 
    pregnancy  without  doing her any harm ...  physical harm  or 
    psychological harm.   And then there is the baby to consider.  
    I'm not worried about after it's born,  after all,  I've been 
    doing alright with Baby April,  I think,  but getting it born 
    bothers me.   I've been trying to figure out what you do with 
    the unbilical cord.   When, where, and how is that taken care 
    of?"
          "STORAGE LEVEL CONTAINS 5 VOLUMES ON THE HUMANOID BIRTH 
    PROCESS  IN  THE LANGUAGE OF CARL,  3 VOLUMES IN  THE  FRENCH 
    LANGUAGE, 6 IN THE ..."
          "Oh,  I intend to read everything I can,  but it is one 
    thing  to  read a page of a book,  and it is quite  something 
    else to have a wet,  squirming new-born in your  hands.   Oh, 
    Dr.  Spock,  where  are you when I need you ...  or even  Mr. 
    Spock ...  or even a country midwife--a wise,  gentle country 
    midwife for Baby April's baby."
          "MARY  JANE  ...  SPECIMEN QR23 WROTE AND SANG  A  SONG 
    CALLED  'THE  MIDWIFE'S HYMN.' PERHAPS SPECIMEN QR23 KNEW  OF 
    THE ARTS OF MIDWIFERY."
          "Perhaps,  but then you let her escape,  didn't you, so 
    she's no help to us in this fix, is she?"
          "IF  SPECIMEN  QR23  DID NOT REMOVE  HERSELF  FROM  THE 
    SPECIMEN  CHAMBER,  THEN STOWAWAY CARL EDWARD CHANDLER  WOULD 
    NEVER  HAVE  COME  ON BOARD,  AND THIS  SITUATION  WOULD  NOT 
    EXIST."
          "True  enough,  but I don't mind telling you  that,  if 
    specimen Mary Jane had any midwifery skills,  I wouldn't mind 
    having  her  on  board  right now.   It's too  bad  that  you 
    couldn't replicate a midwife,  but then if you did, then we'd 
    just have another adult-like infant to worry about,  and that 
    wouldn't solve our birth problem."
          "HMMMM ... CARL MAY HAVE AN IDEA ..."
          "Now  wait a minute,  I'm not ready to start a  nursery 
    school for grown-up infants.  April is about all I can handle 
    at one time."
          "REPLICATON   OF   APRIL   PROCEEDED   ALONG   STANDARD 
    PSYCHOLOGICAL  AND BIOLOGICAL LINES.   ALMOST  COMPLETE  DATA 
    EXISTS ON THAT SUBJECT IN STORAGE.   WHERE INCOMPLETE DATA OR 
    NON-EXISTENT  DATA  WAS  FOUND,  INTERPOLATION WAS  MADE  ...

    MATRIXES.    EVIDENCE  OF  SUCCESSFUL  REPRODUCTION--MONITORS

    ESCAPE.   FIRST  LEVEL MEMORY PATTERNS  RECORDED.   SECONDARY 
    LEVEL MEMORY PATTERNS PARTIALLY RECORDED,  INTERRUPTED BY ... 
    ESCAPE."
          "What exactly are you driving at?"
          "LARGE MINORITY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPONENT OF  SPECIMEN 
    QR23   RECORDED  IN  STORAGE.    TECHNIQUE  FOR   REPLICATING 
    HUMANOIDS  PERFECTED.   CONCLUSION:  REPLICATION OF  HUMANOID 
    SPECIMEN QR23 AT NON-INFANT LEVEL POSSIBLE.  HIGH PROBABILITY 
    OF REPLICATION AT FULLY FUNCTIONING ADULT LEVEL.  POSSIBILITY 
    OF   MIDWIFING  SKILLS  CONTAINED  IN  FIRST  MEMORY   LEVEL.  
    THEREFORE:  REPLICATION  OF  SPECIMEN  QR23  WITH  FUNCTIONAL 
    MIDWIFERY SKILLS POSSIBLE."
          "Let me think about that for a minute.  It took you six 
    days  to replicate April,  and during that time the  climatic 
    systems were functioning at a minimal level.  I can take that 
    kind  of stuff,  but I'm not sure how well a pregnant  woman, 
    especially a pregnant April ...  the psychological factors, I 
    mean ... how well she could take it."
          "MINIMUM    MAINTENANCE    OF    CLIMATIC    CONDITIONS

    ESTIMATED  TO  NOW REQUIRE ONLY DIVERSION OF .52  PERCENT  OF 
    ENERGY  LEVELS  FOR  .6 CYCLES.   REPLICATION COULD  BE  DONE 
    DURING SLEEP PHASE TO MINIMIZE EFFECTS ON APRIL."
          "Let's give this a day's thought, or even several day's 
    thought.  What we're talking about is creating a human being, 
    not just a handy tool.  It wouldn't be fair to replicate this 
    person, use her, then just return her to molecular storage."
          "ROBERT  HAS  NO INTENTION OF RETURNING  MARY  JANE  TO 
    MOLECULAR STORAGE!"
          "That is even more reason for giving this thing careful 
    thought."
          "ROBERT  HAS MADE CAREFUL THOUGHT.   ROBERT SHOULD HAVE 
    THOUGHT OF REPLICATING SPECIMEN QR23 BEFORE."
          "Can  you analyze your  own  motivations,  Robert?   An 
    unbiased  observer  might suspect that you were acting on  an 
    emotional level, not an intellectual one."
          "IS AN INSULT INTENDED?"
          "On the contrary,  my friend, on the contrary.  Look at 
    April  and me.  There is very little in our relationship that 
    could  be called intellectual.   It's almost  all  emotional.  
    That  doesn't  mean that she hasn't become very important  to 
    me.   Could  a similar situation have been happening  between 
    you and this Mary Jane?"
          "IMPOSSIBLE!   ROBERT IS ATTEMPTING TO AID CARL IN  THE 
    MIDWIFE REQUIREMENTS.  IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR ROBERT TO CROSS 
    THE  BARRIER  BETWEEN CHAMBERS TO PERSONALLY ASSIST CARL  AND 
    APRIL,  BUT  IT IS POSSIBLE FOR ROBERT TO REPLICATE  THE  ONE 
    HUMANOID  FOR  WHOM A PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE PARTIALLY  EXISTS 
    AND WHO MAY HAVE MIDWIFERY SKILLS."
          "Okay,  you're just trying to help.   Thanks.  But give 
    me some time to think about this replicating business.  There 
    wasn't  really  a  whole lot of thought on  my  part  on  the 
    consequences of this kind of thing with April."

    TERMINATION  OF THIS VOYAGE.   IF CARL  OBJECTS,  REPLICATION 
    WILL  BE DELAYED UNTIL THE LAST CYCLE.   IT IS SUGGESTED THAT 
    SERIOUS  CONSIDERATION  BE GIVEN TO REPLICATION  OF  SPECIMEN 
    QR23 AS BIRTHING ASSISTANT.  SUGGEST SERIOUS CONSIDERATION BE

          "What you say does make sense, it's just my quams about 
    going around manufacturing people.   But you are right,  I am 
    going to need help,  and the earlier I get it, the better off 
    the  whole situation will be for April and her  baby.   Okay, 
    but let's wait until April is asleep.   Tomorrow night, let's 
    say.   I've got to prepare her for having another person come 
    into her life.    After all,  all she's ever known is me  and

                                27 

          Just a moment after specimen QR23 winked in,  she did a 
    double-take.
          "What the hell am I doing back here?"  Then she noticed 
    Carl  who had been sitting at the table cube with a glass  of 
    brandy before him.  "You in charge here,  or are you  another 
    ... specimen?"
          "I am not in charge here in the way that you mean,  nor 
    am I a specimen in the ordinary sense.   Other than that,  my 
    status here is somewhat undefined.   One could consider me to 
    be a paying passenger, except that I have never seen the coin 
    of  this  realm,  and I don't know where we're going.   I  am 
    somewhat  of an employee--a junior research  assistant,  sort 
    of.   Sometimes  I  am a hired artisan.   Sometimes  I  am  a 
    babysitter--a service performed gratis.  Other times, I don't 
    do much of anything.  When required, I serve as the welcoming 
    committee."
          She glared at him in silence.
          "I  also  offer damsels with distressed looks on  their 
    faces glasses of brandy."
          "This  nightmare just goes on and on and gets  stranger 
    at every turn."
          Carl  filled an empty brandy snifter and held it out to 
    her, saying: "I'm Carl Chandler."
          After  a  moment's  hesitation,  she  took  the  glass.  
    "Thanks.  I'm Mary Jane Galatea."
          "Welcome, Mary Jane Galatea, to Robert's cube."
          "You  will  excuse me if I don't act  overjoyed  to  be 
    here.   Only a few minutes ago I got out of here, but now I'm 
    back again,  and in the interval the place has filled up with 
    all  this."   She indicated the contents of the cube  with  a 
    sweep  of  her  hand.   "In fact,  I suspect that  I'm  in  a 
    different cube."
          "No,  it  is  the same cube,  but the interval of  time 
    between your escape and the present is almost a year."
          "Impossible!"
          "Impossible?   No,  the impossible is commonplace here, 
    the improbable barely raises an eyebrow,  and the unlikely is 
    everyday fare."
          "Oh,  I  know  that  there is some kind  of  trap  door 
    mechanism  here someplace because food kept appearing,  but I 
    know that it is just a slick magician's trick."
          "Yes,  it  does  appear  to be magic,  but it  is  not.  
    Advanced technology always seems to be magical to members  of 
    a primitive society."
          "Primitive?"
          "We  both are,  we members of Homo sapiens--a  colossal 
    misnomer, if ever there was one.  It takes awhile to get used 
    to it all, but you adjust."
          "I prefer to think of it as magic."
          "Oh,  but  it  is  that too.   What do  you  wish?   An 
    elephant?   No,  too common a trick.   Something more exotic?  
    Niagara Falls in your living room perhaps?"
          "Humph!"
          "Robert,  I know that you're listening.  Turn that wall 
    into Niagara Falls please."
          The  shelves,   tool  benches,  and art objects  winked 
    out.   For  a  brief instant the wall was a  plain,  glowing, 
    white plane.   Then Niagara Falls winked in.   Water  plunged 
    from  near the top of the ceiling and fell to the floor  were 
    it  disappeared.   The  air filled with a fine mist  and  the 
    smell  of  water.   The  roar  of the  waterfall  filled  the 
    chamber.
          Mary  Jane stared at the  sight open-mouthed.   Slowly, 
    timidly,  she walked to the falls, then, standing on the edge 
    where the water disappeared,  she stuck her hand out into the 
    cascade.  Her sleeve instantly got wet to the elbow.
          "Thank you,  Robert,  that is an excellent job; a first 
    rate  piece  of  work for such short  notice.   We  can  turn 
    things back to normal now."
          The waterfall winked out to a blank wall, then all Carl 
    and April's stuff returned.
          "How did you do that?"
          "Magic.   Illusion.   Technology.   God.   All  of  the 
    above.  None of the above.  Take your pick."
          "Carl?  Noise gone?"  
          "Oh.   Yes,  April,  the  noise is gone.   Go  back  to 
    sleep."
          "April thirsty.  Milk please?"
          "Okay.  Come have a glass of milk."
          April  pushed back the opaque curtain and jumped out of 
    bed.   She  stopped  short  when she saw Mary  Jane  who  had 
    returned to join Carl at the table cube.
          "It's okay,  April,  we have a visitor.   You  remember 
    that  I told you we were going to have a visitor.   Come meet 
    Mary Jane."
          April approached cautiously.
          "This  is April," Carl said to Mary Jane as  he  handed 
    April her glass of milk.
          "Hello, April."
          "Marr Jame?"
          "Mary Jane," Carl corrected.
          "Mary Jame?"
          "No, Mary Jane"
          "Mary Jane?"
          "Yes, that's right.  Her name is Mary Jane."
          "Mary Jane stand please," April requested.
          Mary Jane, puzzled, stood.
          April  grinned.  "Mary Jane high." She turned to  Carl. 
    "Is Mary Jane giant?"
          "No,  April,  Mary  Jane is not a giant,  she is just a 
    tall woman," Carl said with a smile.
          In  her stocking feet Mary Jane stood at six feet even.  
    The  high-lofted, dark, curly hair which framed her face  and 
    fell  over her shoulders and her slim figure made her  appear 
    even taller.   April,  of course,  had only herself,  at five 
    foot  four,  and  Carl,  with  two  more  inches,  as  height

          "Mary Jane tall because May Jane old?"
          Carl laughed. "No, April, you don't keep getting bigger 
    as  you get older."  He glanced at Mary Jane.  "Mary Jane  is 
    probably younger than Carl, but older than April."
          April patted her rotund belly.  "April getting bigger."  
    She  grinned  and put her now empty milk glass  back  on  the 
    table.   Then she touched her breasts.  "April bigger lots of 
    places."
          "Yes, April is doing very well," Carl agreed, "but soon 
    April will be smaller."
          "How old?" April asked Mary Jane.
          "I am twenty-two."
          "April eight." She held up her hands with eight fingers 
    extended.   Then  she grabbed a piece of carrot stick from  a 
    bowl  on  the table and stuffed it into  her  mouth.   "April 
    ate!"  She giggles, then scampered back to bed.
          "Yes, go back to sleep, April," Carl called after her.
          "Good night, Carl.  Good night, Mary Jane."
          "Good night, April." Carl and Mary Jane said together.
          April pulled the curtain shut behind her.
          "She thinks she's eight?  Retarded?"
          "April  is  not retarded!   And she  is  eight.   Eight 
    months."
          "You mean eight months pregnant?"
          "Yeah, that too."
          "Hugh?"
          "April  has  existed for eight months,  and she's  been 
    pregnant for almost as long."
          "Now  wait a minute.   Magic and technology tricks  are 
    one thing, but she acts like a three-year-old and is about as 
    pregnant as you can get, and you say she isn't a 'tard?"
          "Look,  you  were  in this cube for  less than  a  day, 
    right?"
          "Yes."
          "And what did you do during that time?"
          "Most of the time I was interrogated about anything and 
    everything  by  some invisible guy with a  creepy  voice.   I 
    slept  for what seemed to be a long period of time--more than 
    my  usual.   I think that I was drugged,  but I'm  not  sure.  
    This creepy-voiced guy said that he was going to take me on a 
    long  trip to someplace from which I would never return.   It 
    was  bizarre.   The questioning was bizarre too.   It  didn't 
    seem  to follow any pattern.   It seemed that he didn't  care 
    what I said, just as long as I kept talking."
          "Yes,  your  answers were being reassembled in  logical 
    order by the translating mechanism."
          "Whatever.   Then I escaped.   I went out the door, and 
    then I was back here again, but suddenly the place was filled 
    with all this stuff and you and the retarded girl ..."
          "Damn it!  She's not retarded.  She's eight months old.  
    How  many  eight-month-old kids do you know who can speak  in 
    complete  sentences?   How many eight-month-old kids  do  you 
    know  who can make a pun on the word 'eight?'   Retarded?   I 
    think that she just might be a genius."
          Mary Jane didn't say anything.
          "Don't get fooled by her  body.   She's  built  like an
    eighteen-year-old  sex kitten because that's the way she  was 
    made.  Now she's a pregnant eighteen-year-old sex kitten."
          "Pregnant by you?"
          "You don't see anyone else about, do you?"
          Mary  Jane said nothing,  but Carl could see her  tense 
    up.
          "Yeah,  I  know it looks bad.   Had I known then what I 
    know now,  it never would have happened,  but there is no way 
    to  go  back and correct the past.   April is a  child  in  a 
    woman's  body,  and soon she is going to have a child of  her 
    own.   I  am  presuming  that  the  kid  will  be  normal  in 
    development.   I  guestimate  that April's intelligence  will 
    catch  up  with her apparent biological age in  three  years.  
    Until then I'll have the job of bringing up both babies."
          "Well,  don't let me interfere with your  plans.   Just 
    let me off at the next corner."
          "That,  I'm afraid,  is absolutely impossible.   We are 
    probably hundreds of lightyears away from planet Earth."
          "But just a few minutes ago ..."
          "No.   I  know  what you're going to  say,  but  you're 
    wrong."   Carl  refilled her brandy snifter.   "Have  a  good 
    stiff  drink.   I'm  going to fill you in on  some  startling 
    details."           
          She  took  a  sip  of brandy  and  waited  for  him  to 
    continue.
          "A few basic facts:  it is now some eleven months since 
    Mary Jane Galatea escaped from this cube ..."
          She  started  to protest,  but he held up his hand  for 
    silence.
          "Let me finish.  It is eleven months as time apparently 
    flows  here inside the cube.   I don't know if  they've  been 
    able  to  get around Einstein's relativity of time or  not--I 
    suspect  that  they have,  but perhaps a million  years  have 
    elapsed  back on Earth.   Perhaps Einstein's time and  light-
    speed ideas aren't valid.   I don't know, and it doesn't make 
    any  difference.   Mary Jane Galatea exited,  then I  entered 
    this cube.   Three months after I started this voyage.  April 
    was  replicated  ...  was born a full grown  woman,  but  her 
    intelligence  wasn't  developed.   She came  into  the  world 
    innocent  and fertile;  I was drunk and  horny.  Viola!   One 
    pregnant woman.  I didn't discover her mental condition until 
    the  next day.   She was a toy,  made for my amusement.   Her 
    pregnancy  was  a surprise.   Everything about  April  was  a 
    surprise.  Time passed and the pregnancy became obvious.  I'm 
    not  a doctor.   Delivering a baby scares the bejesus out  of 
    me.   What if something starts to go wrong?   What, me worry?  
    You'd  better believe it.   So along comes the idea that what 
    we need is,  if not a doctor,  then at least a midwife.   Now 
    the  situation is this:  April and I are locked in this  cube 
    until the voyage is over,  which is to say,  until after  the 
    baby is due.   There is no way to get outside help.  However, 
    Robert--that creepy-voiced fellow--gets the idea that,  since 
    he  has  perfected the technique for replicating  people--and 
    April is a replicated humanoid,  a manufactured human being--
    then  the  only  way for us to get help for the  baby  is  to 
    replicate another human being.   However, replications result 
    in  a developed body,  but not a developed  mind.   The  only 
    other  mind,  other  than  April  or  me,  available  is  the 
    psychological  recordings of one Mary Jane  Galatea.   Robert 
    suspects that this Mary Jane Galatea may know something about 
    midwifery because she once wrote a song called 'The Midwife's 
    Hymn.'  It was a long shot,  but the situation was desperate, 
    and  there was no other possible source of help.   Using  the 
    information  developed during the replication of  April,  and 
    using  the information collected by the monitors and recorded 
    from  Mary Jane's replies to questions and also the  probings 
    of her mind made while she as in a hypnotically induced  deep 
    sleep ... with all of that, Mary Jane Galatea was replicated.  
    You are that replication."
          "What?  That's impossible!"
          "Is it?   Today is ..." Carl consulted the wrist  watch 
    which was on the table,  "April 15th,  l984.  Do you have any 
    recollection  of  the events between today and that  May  day 
    when you escaped."
          "The  last thing I remember is going out the door,  but 
    that  doesn't mean anything if I don't accept your  assertion 
    that today is April 15th, l984."
          Carl laughed.
          "I just thought of something," he said,  still smiling, 
    "I'm going to be in big trouble for not filing my income tax.  
    Can  you  imagine trying to explain to the  Internal  Revenue 
    Service that you failed to file because you were on a 'flying 
    saucer' in outer space for the last year.   Just think  about 
    that for a minute."
          Mary Jane was silent.
          "Okay,  back to business.   How can I prove to you that 
    you  are  not  Mary Jane Galatea,  but a copy  of  Mary  Jane 
    Galatea ...   replicaion,  a clone, an entirely new creature, 
    but  one with a large portion of Mary Jane  Galatea's  memory 
    and psychology and all of her body?"
          "This is insane.   I was kidnaped  by some force that I 
    don't   understand.   I  was  held  in  a  strange  cube  and 
    questioned.   Was, by your admission, hypnotized and examined 
    somehow.  Then I escaped, but almost instantly was brought to 
    a different cube ...  this cube with you and that girl.   And 
    now I am here, and you are telling me this strange story that 
    I am a copy of myself.  That's all I know."
          "Is there something about Mary Jane Galatea that wasn't 
    revealed during those interrogations?"
          "I don't know."
          "Perhaps something physical?"
          "The  voice  even wanted to examine my body.   I  don't 
    know why I did it,  but I disrobed for it ... spite, I think, 
    or maybe I was trying to seduce it.   In any case,  it didn't 
    work, but it saw all of me."
          "A dead end."
          "I  have  a small birthmark inside my thigh,  maybe  it 
    didn't notice that ... or maybe it did ..."
          "Is it still there?"
          "You expect me to strip?"
          "Well I am naked, and April was naked.  In fact, except 
    for  diapers before she was toilet trained,  April has  never 
    worn  clothes.   I haven't worn anything myself  for  months.  
    The climate is controled, so clothes are unnecessary."        
          Mary Jane didn't say anything.
          "You  just shy,  or are you afraid that I might try and 
    rape you or something."
          "The idea crossed m mind."
          "It  would be an interesting match.   The monitor  says 
    that we have exactly the same weight,  even though you are  a 
    lot  taller  than I am.   Besides,  rape is really an act  of 
    violence,  not  sex,  and  I am a  very  non-violent  person.  
    Furthermore,  I  can  get all my sexual  needs  satisfied  by 
    April.   Her condition makes regular intercourse inadvisable, 
    but she has a very talented tongue."
          "You're disgusting!"
          "You mean you've never tried fellatio?"
          "I'm  not going to discuss my sexual activities with  a 
    stranger."
          "Nor are you required to.   Besides,  you aren't  eight 
    months  pregnant,  so  there  are no limits  on  your  sexual 
    activities.   The issue at hand,  however,  is not our sexual 
    practices, but who you are.  Let's see your birthmark."
          Silently,  Mary  Jane  stood up,  then pulled down  her 
    jeans.  She looked at herself, then went wide-eyed.
          "It  was  right there!"  She pointed to a spot  on  her 
    inner  thigh  about three inches below her crotch.  "A  tiny, 
    wine-colored splotch.  It's gone, but that's impossible."
          "No,  the mark continues to exist on Mary Jane Galatea, 
    but you are someone else."
          She looked at him,  then looked back at her body.   She 
    sat back down without bothering to pull up her jeans.
          "I'm sorry, but you had to be made to face the facts of 
    this admittedly bizarre situation."
          "But, damn it!  I feel like me."
          "Yes,  and  a goodly part of you is Mary Jane  Galatea, 
    but  she escaped from this cube nearly a year ago and  wasn't 
    recaptured.  Her life, in whatever fashion it exists, goes on 
    back on Earth,  while you,  an entirely new person,  exist in 
    this cube."
          "I  don't  know ...  maybe this is all some sort  of  a 
    trick."
          "It's  no  trick.    Apparently  Robert's   replication 
    techniques  involve  separate steps for the physical and  the 
    psychological  components.   Thus,  you  were aware  of  your 
    birthmark, but it was overlooked by Robert's physical scan of 
    your body.  It's nice to know he's not infallible ... perhaps 
    he was distracted at the time.   Anyway,  if my understanding 
    of his analysis is correct,  there should be a lot of gaps in 
    your   memory--things  that  weren't  recorded  by   Robert's 
    preliminary investigation.   Let's give it a test.   What  do 
    you remember about your fifth grade?"
          "Fifth  grade?   Let's see ...  fifth grade?   I  can't 
    think  of anything.   My mind is a blank.   God!   Maybe  I'm 
    going crazy."
          "No, you're not going crazy."
          "But  I'm  not  really  a  person.   I'm  just a thing. 
    Something someone made."
          "You  are a person.   What difference does it make  how 
    you came into the world?   You're here.  Your body is as full 
    functional  as anyone's.   April's pregnancy proves that  the 
    technology of replication equals that of human birth.   Okay, 
    you have a borrowed personality.   A lot of Mary Jane Galatea 
    exists  in  you.   But  you are now your  own  person.   What 
    happens  to  you from now on depends on you,  not  Mary  Jane 
    Galatea."
          "But  I feel like I am Mary Jane Galatea.   I have  her 
    memories, don't I?"
          "Yes, but they are your memories too."
          "If  I  look  in  a  mirror,  except  for  the  missing 
    birthmark, I see Mary Jane Galatea, but who am I?"
          "You  are  Mary Jane Galatea.   No the same one as  the 
    other,  but similar.  You are a six foot tall woman with pale 
    blue eyes and curly,  rich auburn hair.   Your body is  thin, 
    your breasts small,  your hips narrow, your legs long ... all 
    exactly like Mary Jane Galatea.   What you don't have is your 
    birthmark    and   perhaps   some   other   minor    physical 
    characteristics.   You don't have all her childhood memories.  
    There  are  gaps where Mary Jane didn't get recorded  by  the 
    translator while she was captive.   But what you do have is a 
    life  to live in any way that you choose.   Admittedly it  is 
    limited  in potential at the moment by the fact that you  are 
    confined  in this cube.   April and I are also confined here, 
    but who knows what tomorrow will bring?   What next year will 
    bring?  Can you accept being this new person?"
          "I don't have any choice,do I?"
          "If a situation becomes too unbearable, there is always 
    the choice of not continuing to exist."
          "Suicide?"
          "In  this particular case all you'd have to do is  have 
    yourself unreplicated, and you'd wink out of existence.  Just 
    think of all the money we could make if we could peddle  this 
    technology to the Mafia."
          "Buster, that's not even funny."
          "Isn't  it?   Isn't  this  whole  situation  ludicrous.  
    Think about it for a minute.   Here we are with more power at 
    our fingertips than any human being ever had before ... power 
    to do whatever we wish.   What do you want?  Diamonds?  Furs?  
    Fancy cars?   Money?  How about a pile of gold as tall as you 
    are?   All  we need do is say:  Robert,  may I have a cube of 
    pure gold, six feet on a side please ..."
          Mary  Jane  jumped  as a huge cube of  gold  winked  in 
    beside her.
          "Robert!   I was speaking retorically,  and you  bloody 
    well know it.   Take that thing back, and  don't credit it to 
    my account."
          "REPLICATION  OF 216 CUBIC FEET OF GOLD NOT CHARGED  TO 
    THE  ACCOUNT  OF  CARL.    REPLICATION  WILL  BE  CHARGED  TO 
    DISCRETIONARY  FUNDS  OF  ROBERT.   SENSE OF  HUMOR  OF  CARL 
    DEFICIENT.   SUGGEST  EXCESSIVE  CONSUMPTION OF  ALCOHOL  THE 
    CAUSE."
          "I will thank you not to monitor my drinking.  Besides, 
    I  am  merely sharing a drink with this  slightly  distressed 
    damsel."
          "HUMOR SENSE CONTINUES DEFICIENT.  ROBERT ENTERING REST 
    PERIOD.  COMMUNICATIONS TERMINATED."
          "You don't think that I'm going to believe you, do you?  
    Just when you have this opportunity to eavesdrop?"
          There was no reply from Robert.
          "Was  that gold for real,  or did I just  dream  that," 
    Mary Jane asked.
          "Oh,  it was quite real.  Two hundred and sixteen cubic 
    feet  of gold,  probably a quarter of a million pounds of it, 
    probaby  worth something on the order of a  billion  dollars.  
    Since  Robert's paying for the replication himself,  that was 
    probably  an  expensive little joke,  unless it  was  hollow.  
    Like  I was saying,  we've go all this fantastic power and no 
    way to use it.  A six foot cube of gold is as useful to us as 
    ...  in fact it is less than useful.   It is totally useless, 
    valueless,  since it takes up useful space, and the one thing 
    we have in limited supply is space.   You see,  it is a  very 
    funny  situation.   It brings you down to the bare essentials 
    of what is valuable and what is not valuable."
          Mary  Jane was silent for a minute,  then took a sip of 
    her  brandy.  "You  said that this replication  business  was 
    charged to accounts?"
          "I'm  charged for the energy that is used to  replicate 
    something,  not  for the 'value' of the item itself,  for  in 
    this situation, all things are of equal value, but each thing 
    requires  a  different amount of energy for its  replication.  
    There is no charge for unreplicating things, however."
          "You said that I am ... am replicated.  Somebody had to 
    pay for me?"
          "Hmmm.  Now that you mention it,  yes.   Hey, Robert, I 
    know you're listening. Put down Mary Jane's replication on my 
    account, but charge it at one monitary unit per energy unit--
    she's an essential item, not a luxury."
          "Buster, if you think that you own me ..."
          "Damp  down the hostile vibrations.   I'll gladly  sign 
    any  proclamation of emancipation for you.   You're  on  your 
    own,  even  though  the legal system of Robert's culture  may 
    continue  to consider you to be  my  responsibiity.   Robert, 
    start  a new account for Mary Jane Galatea and start charging 
    her  now.   Keep  the brandy on me,  but her air is  her  own 
    affair."
          "Air?  I'm being charged for air?"
          "Anything requiring energy is charged for.   Keeping us 
    supplied  with  fresh oxygen takes energy for  which  we  are 
    charged  at  a  rate of one monitary unit  per  energy  unit.  
    Luxuries,  like  cubes of gold,  are charged at two  monitary 
    units per energy unit."
          "But I don't have any money."
          "Then you'll just have to earn some.   Perhaps you  can 
    entertain Robert by doing strip teases."
          Mary Jane went grim faced,  then:  "Oh!"  She go up and 
    pulled up her jeans.  "I seem to have forgotten that my jeans 
    were down."
          Carl laughed.
          "I  had forgotten how erotic a semi-clothed woman could 
    be.  You may have noticed that I'm naked ..."
          "Well, yes."
          "...  and April doesn't even have any clothes. The only 
    thing  she's  ever worn was diapers--that was before she  was 
    toilet trained,  of course.   Oh, I made a couple of attempts 
    at  getting her properly dressed,  but she didn't like it  at 
    all.  April is the best-natured person I've ever met, but she 
    does have a rarely exhibited stubborn streak.   If April sets 
    her  mind to not doing something,  she's not going to do  it, 
    and that is that.   Wearing clothes was one of those  things.  
    Of course, with the climate in here clothes are superfluous."
          "Diapers?"
          "I  told  you,  April is eight  months  old.   Being  a 
    genius,  she  was toilet trained before two months,  but  even 
    with  her super development rate,  she did start at the  same 
    place  were  all babies start,  meaning that someone  had  to 
    change her diapers and wipe her pretty, little ass for her."
          "Am I expected to run around here nude too"
          "You'll  find that rather little is expected from  you, 
    and  as  far  as  your  clothing,  or  lack  of  clothing  is 
    concerned, that is entirely up to you."
          "Just what is expected of me?"
          "The  only  thing expected of you is to assist  at  the 
    birth of April's baby.  A midwife."
          "What?"
          "You aren't a midwife?"
          "Of course not."
          "I really didn't think so.   Robert thought that, since 
    you  wrote  a song on the subject,  you would know  something 
    about it.   It is,  of course,  entirely possible to write  a 
    song  about  something  and  know only  a  little  about  the 
    subject.   I  knew that.   That  was a basic flaw in Robert's 
    logic.   Perhaps  in  his      cultural matrix  only  experts 
    write songs about things on which they are expert."
          "Well,  I don't have any experience as a midwife.   You 
    should have had someone else replicated."
          "I  would  have preferred a medical  doctor,  but  that 
    wasn't possible.   You see, although Robert has perfected the 
    technique  of replicating human beings--he can make any  kind 
    of physical body--he has no way of replicating a personality.  
    You--Mary  Jane  Galatea--were the only personality he had  a 
    record of.   You were the only intellectually devloped entity 
    that  we could call upon for help.   And we do need  help.  I 
    need help.   April needs help.  Even if you aren't a midwife, 
    you  are  a woman.   Will you help us with  the  delivery  of 
    April's baby."
          "I  don't know how much help I'd be ...  but  ...  yes, 
    I'll do what I can for April when the time comes."
          "That's  all  anyone  could ask.   Now I'll pour  us  a 
    nightcap,  and we can call it a night.  We don't have a spare 
    bedroom, obviously.  Robert, are you there?"
          There was no response.
          "Either  he is really resting,  or he is going to do  a 
    good job of imitating it.   In either case,  we won't be able 
    to  replicate  you a bed tonight.   If you aren't a  restless 
    sleeper,  you can join April and me.  The bed is plenty large 
    enough."
          "Yesterday ...  I mean,  when I was here  before,  when 
    Mary Jane Galatea was here before,  I,  she,  we slept on the 
    floor.   It  kept  saying:  'Does  specimen  require  resting 
    apparatus?'  but  I ...  she ignored it.   The  floor  wasn't 
    uncomfortable."
          "It is obvious that you can't differentiate between the 
    replicated  you  and  the original one,  so why  make  things 
    confusing for yourself by trying?   As far as I am concerned, 
    you  are the one and only Mary Jane Galatea."
          "It  is  confusing,  knowing that you are not  who  you 
    think you are.  But you're right.  I'm Mary Jane Galatea, and 
    if there is another one someplace, that's her problem."
          "Yes, your problem is bed."
          "I'm not going to sleep with you."
          "I'm  talking about sleep as in rest,  not sleep as  in 
    sex.  I've slept on the floor here too, and I assure you that 
    our bed is a lot more comfortable."
          "Might that cause trouble with your girlfriend?"
          "I don't think that April is aware of the word jealousy 
    yet  and  all that it means.   In any case,  she  won't  have 
    anything to be jealous of since I'll be snuggled up with  her 
    the way we usually are, and what goes on on the other side of 
    the bed ... who cares who's there?"
          "The idea of sleeping in a bed,  rather than the floor, 
    does sound appealing."
          "I'm  glad that you're going to be sensible.   You  can 
    throw  your clothes on that box beside the bed.   April likes 
    this edge, so you can have the far side to yourself."
          "My clothes ...?  I'm expected to join you nudists?"
          "Does nudity bother you?"
          "Among friends,  no.  But I don't know you, and I'm not 
    sure what to expect.   Everything that's happened to me today 
    has been so unexpected."
          "Did you notice the commode?" Carl indicated the  water 
    closet  in the corner behind him with his hand.   "Out in the 
    open.   The shower:  no partition or shower curtain.   We all 
    will  be seeing each other naked in performing  our  ordinary 
    bodily functions.   That's the way we've been living,  but if 
    you  can't live in that kind of openness,  say so,  and we'll 
    fix things up so that you won't be uneasy."
          "No,  it's okay.  It'll just take a little getting used 
    to.   I'm not a Victorian.  Maybe I'll even come to like this 
    sort of Polynesian nakedness that you've got  here."
          "Good.   I've seen you with your pants pulled down, and 
    I'm curious to see what you look like without the panties and 
    tee shirt."
          "Listen,  buster, I'm not some kind of object to be put 
    on display."
          "Now don't take offense.   I'm just saying that I liked 
    what  I  saw,  and I'm looking foward to seeing more  of  it. 
    After all,  it's only fair.  You've seem all of me and all of 
    April."
          Mary Jane laughed.
          "If  you weren't so young,  I'd suspect you of being  a 
    dirty, old man."
          "Au contraire,  mademoiselle, a dirty, young man," Carl 
    said  with a smile as he set their glasses in the  center  of 
    the cube and put the bottle away on the set of shelves beside 
    his chair.   Then he pushed a button on the side of the cube, 
    and  the  dirty glass winked out.   "Did I mention  that  the 
    highest  achievement  of Robert's culture is that they  never 
    have to do the dishes?"
          "I won't object to not doing dishes."
          "Nor I.   Even liberated,  dirty,  young men hate to do 
    the dishes.   But it is late, so we'll leave the exploring of 
    the housekeeping wonders of this place for  tomorrow.   Come.  
    Time for bed."  
          Carl noticed hesitation in Mary Jane.
          "Relax,"  he said,  "I'm only interested in seeing that 
    that  lean,  viginal  body of yours gets its forty  winks  of 
    beauty rest."
          "Listen,  buster,  my  sexual  history is none of  your 
    business.  Humph!  Virginal, indeed!"
          "You may think that you're experienced,  and Mary  Jane 
    Galatea's  hymen may have been battered out of existence long 
    ago,  but  the fact remains that that body," he poked her  in 
    the  shoulder with his finger,  "was replicated only a  short 
    time  ago,  and,  unlike your mind,  is absolutely  pure  and 
    virginal."
          Mary Jane said nothing.
          "Well you may do as you wish, Mary Jane, but I am going 
    to sleep.   So good night and welcome to the menagerie," Carl 
    said as he strolled over to the bed,  then disappeared behind 
    its opaque curtains.
          A  minute  later Mary Jane cautiously entered  the  bed 
    from  the other side.  They looked at each other  in  silence 
    over  the curled up,  sleeping body of April.   Mary Jane was 
    still wearing her bra and panties.  Carl just smiled.
          "Oh,  what the hell," she said,  unclasping her bra and 
    tossing it out.   She slid off her panties and threw them out 
    also.  "There, satisfied?  There's not much meat on my bones.  
    I'm not like your voluptuous friend."
          "Who cares how you're built,  just as long as you don't 
    snore."
          "Humph!  Good night, Mr. Chandler."
          She  pulled  the curtain shut,  plunging the  bed  into 
    darkness. 
          "Good night, Mary Jane, and again welcome."

          April was awake and sitting up in bed.   Carl was still 
    asleep on her left.   Mary Jane was lying on her back, awake.
          April put a finger to her mouth.  "Ssssss.  Carl sleep. 
    April  'wake,"  she  whispered.   She  put her  hand  on  her 
    stomach.  "Baby 'wake, too.  Feel?"
          Mary  Jane  got  up  on one elbow  and  gently  touched 
    April's belly. "That's going to be a big baby."
          April grinned.  "Wanna see baby?"
          "Er ... all right."
          "Out bed!" April ordered.
          Mary  Jane go out of the  bed.   April  followed,  then 
    scampered  past  her  to the workbench where she  got  Carl's 
    sketchbook from the bottom shelf.  
          April  sat  on the floor and opened  the  book.   "Come 
    look."
          Mary Jane hunkered beside April.
          "See baby!"
          In  the  pages of the sketchbook,  Carl had  drawn  the 
    various  stages  of the development of the fetus.   The  last 
    sketch was of a baby.
          "Carl sat baby soon."
          "Yes, another month, April."`
          April touched Mary Jane's flat stomach with a tentative 
    caress.  "Mary Jane thin.  No baby?"
          "No.  No baby."
          "Oh." There was a moment of disappointment,  then April 
    brightened. "Want Carl give Mary Jane baby?"
          Mary  Jane smiled at April's innocence.  "No,  I  think 
    not.  I'm not ready for a baby, April."
          Just  then  Carl  poked  his  head  outside  the  bed's 
    curtains. "Ah, there you two are.  I had wondered what became 
    of my bedmates."
          "Carl  'wake!"  April announced.    She  abandoned  the 
    sketchbook and Mary Jane to rush (as much as she could in her 
    condition)  back to the bed and threw her arms  around  Carl.  
    They  kissed.   By now April had the art of kissing perfected 
    to the Nth degree.
          Carl  got out of the bed and went to the  water  closet 
    where he urinated.   Then he stepped under the showerhead and 
    turned on the water.   April followed him and then joined him 
    under the hot spray.
          "Hey! You want to join us?" Carl called to Mary Jane as 
    April soaped his back.  He stepped back under the spray, then 
    came out and soaped April all over.
          Mary  Jane now stood a few feet away.  "I feel like  an 
    intruder in your lives."
          "Nonsense.  Get wet and I'll soap you."
          When she didn't move,  Carl reached out and grabbed her 
    arm.   Then he shoved her under the spray.  He pulled her out 
    and began rubbing her body down roughly with soap.
          "Hey," she protested, "take it easy."
          "We've got plenty of soap,  and one thing we don't need 
    here is dirty, young women.  House rules require a minimum of 
    a daily shower," Carl said as he propelled her back under the 
    spray to wash the soap off.
          April,  drying herself off with a fluffy,  white towel, 
    stood by watching Carl and Mary Jane.   "Carl, be more gentle 
    with Mary Jane," she admonished in a serious tone.
          "All  right,  I will be gentle with Mary Jane from  now 
    on, but we had to make sure that she was clean."
          Mary Jane,  still under the shower,  said: "Clean?  You 
    just wanted to ..."
          "Wanted  what?   To  touch  you all  over?   Guilty  as 
    charged.   I  hereby  sentence  me  to  provide  you  with  a 
    scrumptious  breakfast," Carl said as he shut off the  water, 
    then handed her a towel.  "Three minutes to breakfast."
          "Carl, can I make breakfast?" April asked.
          "Sure you can.  What do you want to make?"
          "Can   I  make  waffles?"  April  grinned  with   eager 
    anticipation.
          "Waffles with strawberry jam and maple syrup?"
          "Can I?  Can I?"
          "How does that sound to you?" Carl asked Mary Jane.
          "That sounds very nice."
          "April,  you may make three plates-full of waffles with 
    strawberry jam and syrup,  and you may make three glasses  of 
    orange  juice,  and you may make two cups of coffee,  and you 
    may make one large glass of milk."
          "May ... oh, I forgot."
          "You'll remember the next time."
          "I  may make waffles.   Oh,  goodie!"  April  went  off 
    towards the table cube to request breakfast from Robert.
          "Grammar lessons?" Mary Jane asked.
          "She may be a genius,  but you've got to keep after the 
    kid's  grammar all the time,  especially because I'm the  one 
    unthinkingly  making  the mistakes,  and she just copies  me.  
    Keeping tract of her is doing wonders for my own grammar.
          After breakfast was finished,  April remembered:  "Carl 
    forget exercise!  Exercise now?"
          "It's  not  good to do exercise so soon  after  eating.  
    We'll do our exercising before lunch, okay?"
          "'Kay."
          "Do you want to finish your drawing this morning."
          "'Kay. Carl do dishes?"
          "Yes, I will unreplicate the dishes."
          "Um-replicate?  New word?"
          "Hmmm.  I  guess  so.   I must have used it  only  with 
    Robert.   It's a technical word that means to make  something 
    wink out, as in making the dirty dishes disappear."
          "Um-replicate."
          "No. Unreplicate."
          "Unreplicate?"
          "Yes, unreplicate."
          "Unreplicate.  Unreplicate.  April got it."
          "Good.  Now go finish your drawing."
          April  went over to the workbench,  cleared a space for 
    herself, and began to work in her sketchbook.
          "She sort of talks baby talk,  but you don't answer her 
    that way," Mary Jane commented.
          "If  I did,  she'd never learn.   She's actually  doing 
    very well.  She used to have only a collection of nouns and a 
    collection  of  verbs at her disposal.   She's only  recently 
    started  putting  the  two kinds of words  together  to  make 
    sentences.   It's  really a fascinating process  because  her 
    progess  is  so rapid that you can almost hear  her  language 
    complexity develop daily.  It's a good thing that we've got a 
    good  library  at out disposal because I've got  the  feeling 
    that  it  won't  be long before she outstrips my  ability  to 
    teach her.  Then she'll be on her own."
          "Then you'll have to retire from the classroom."
          "Not  necessarily.   Perhaps it will be April  teaching 
    me.  That is, however, a future problem, not one that we have 
    to worry about this week."
          "April said that you forgot your exercise?"
          "Yes,  you arrival disrupted our schedule, but what are 
    schedules for if not to be disrupted?   Besides, now that you 
    are here, a new schedule will have to be devised."
          "What was the original schedule like?"
          "Extermely  lax   in most matters.   Being confined  in 
    this  cube,  it  would be an easy matter to  let  our  bodies 
    deteriorate into flabby jelly.  As a preventative, we usually 
    do  a  half  hour's exercise before breakfast.   We  have  an 
    exercise  bike and a rowing machine.   We would alternate  on 
    the two machines.   Today was my day to row.   A tipical  day 
    was exercise, showers, breakfast, school, lunch, an afternoon 
    of  work  for  me and play or self-entertainment  for  April, 
    dinner,  music hour--we have a good music library from  which 
    we   can   replicate   either   classical   or   comtemporary 
    selections--,  and  any  of a variety of  activities  between 
    music  hour  and  bed ...  that final  activity  often  being 
    immediately  proceeded  by  sex,   an  activity  which  might 
    interrupt any other activity,  including music hour, showers, 
    story  time,  et cetera.   The day is concluded with snuggled 
    sleep."
          Mary Jane didn't comment.
          "That  brings  us around to the  original  question  of 
    schedules  for exercise.   So that you don't get flabby,  you 
    should have a half hour's exercise a day.   What do you think 
    of our pedal and paddle program?"
          "I'm  not much of a physical enthusiast,  but I do  see 
    your point about being cooped up in here.   There's not  much 
    opportunity  for  long  hikes,  so I  guess  I'll  join  your 
    pedlar's row."
          "As  a  long-time  fisherman,  rowing was  my  form  of 
    exercise,  and  every  kid  should have  a  bike,  hence  the 
    exercise bike for April,  but now that there are three of us, 
    we   should  expand  our  repetoire  to   include   something 
    particularly suited to you."
          I'm  afraid that,  except for long walks along the  sea 
    shore  or  in  the country,  swimming was the  only  form  of 
    exercise that I enjoyed.  Considering our circumstances, that 
    is not a very practical sport to have indulged in."
          "Swimming.   Hmmmm.   I'll  bet April would enjoy that.
    She's never even been in a bath tub.   I can see her now just 
    lazily  floating on her back with just her  face,  tits,  and 
    big,  baby-filled  belly above the surface ...  and I can see 
    your long, lean body going past her, doing the breast stroke, 
    churning up the water, and making April bob up and down."
          Mary Jane's nervous little laugh proceeded: "You've got 
    sex on the brain ... and maybe water on the brain too."
          "Perhaps it is that, being confined to this cube for so 
    long,  I  am  beginning to revert  to  primitive  archetypes.  
    Ancient  man worshiped female fertility.   Many of our oldest 
    art  artifacts depict women in the last stages of  pregnancy.  
    Having  watched April's body develop to that  state,  I  know 
    exactly how they felt."
          "Don't get any ideas about me,  buster.   You just keep 
    your thing in your pants."
          Carl laughed.
          "Pants?   I  did have a pair of pants somewhere  around 
    here, but I haven't seen them for months."
          Mary Jane was grimly silent.
          "Our  nudity aside,  the subject under  discussion  was 
    your  exercise requirements.   As you can see,  we have  just 
    begun  to make use of the fact that our vertical space equals 
    our  other dimensions," Carl said as he gestured towards  the 
    mezzanine  above the table cube.  "We have room  for  several 
    more balconies.   I don't see why Robert couldn't make one of 
    them into a swimming pool."
          "Are you serious?
          "It  might  be  expensive--all that  water  won't  come 
    cheap--and  I'm  not  sure about the structural  strength  of 
    Robert's  building materials ... all that water suspended  up 
    there will weigh quite a bit,  but we can inquire.   Are  you 
    afraid of heights?"
          "No.  Why do you ask?"
          "I  was thinking that,  if we install a pool,  the best 
    out-of-the-way place would be up near the ceiling.  How about 
    diagonally  across  the  ceiling?   That would  give  you  he 
    longest distance."
          Mary Jane looked up at the ceiling, trying to imagine a 
    swimming pool up there.  Carl did a couple of rapid  sketches 
    which  resulted  in a design of an eight foot wide  and  five 
    foot  deep  pool going from corner to corner.   It had  seven 
    feet  of clearance between the water level and  the  ceiling.  
    One of the corners was filled in as a deck with an opening in 
    it to allow access from the mezzanine via a sloped ladder.
          Carl  stretched  his sketch out on the table and  said: 
    "Robert,  is  this feasible from a  structural,  supply,  and 
    financial point of view?"
          "STRUCTURE  INDICATED  WOULD  CONTAIN  1540  UNITS   OF 
    AQUEOUS  FLUID  AT  A WEIGHT OF 28.3 UNITS PER  VOLUME  UNIT.  
    SUSPENSION  OF SUCH MASS IS POSSIBLE AT THE POINT  INDICATED.  
    REPLICATION  OF  SUCH A STRUCTURE  CONTAINING  THE  REQUISITE 
    VOLUME  OF LIQUID WOULD DEPLETE THE FINANCIAL BALANCE OF CARL 
    BY  A FACTOR OF 93 PERCENT.   MAINTENANCE OF TEMPERATURE  AND 
    PURITY OF FLUID ESTIMATED TO BE 2 MONITARY UNITS PER CYCLE."
          "In  other words,  my bank account would be  wiped  out 
    again,"
          "SUBSTANTIALLY AFFIRMATIVE."
          "Are  you  figuring  this  at the luxury  rate  or  the 
    necessity rate?"
          "SWIMMING POOL ADJUDGED LUXURY ITEM WITHIN THE CULTURAL 
    MATRIX OF CARL, APRIL AND MARY JANE."
          "Ah,  but  under  these restrictions of limited  space, 
    such  a pool is necessary for the maintenance of  the  health 
    and  muscle tone of this lithe body," Carl said,  placing his 
    hand on Mary Jane's shoulder."
          "REPLICATION  OF  SWIMMING POOL CLASSIFIED  AS  LUXURY.  
    SEARCH  OF  INFORMATION  STORAGE  INDICATES  THAT  EQUIVALENT 
    SITUATION  ADJUDGED SIMILARLY BY ORGANIZATION  IDENTIFIED  AS

    MATRIX PHENOMENON REQUIRED?"
          Carl burst into laughter.
          "Billions of miles away,  and the IRS is still  putting 
    the  screws  to  me.   What the hell are you doing  with  IRS 
    regulations anyway, Robert?"

          "You mean that you've been breaking all the information 
    in  the newspaper down into catagories and them  filing  them 
    appropriately."
          "AFFIRMATIVE."
          "Why on Earth--or elsewhere--for?"

          "Perhaps, but what about our swimming pool?  Do we have

          "AFFIRMATIVE.   MAINTENANCE  OF  SWIMMING POOL  MAY  BE

          "Okay,  if that's the best you can do,  we'll take it."  
    Carl turned to Mary Jane.   "I'm glad I'm not trying to buy a 
    car from this character.  He drives a hard bargain."
          "Are you really going to buy me a swimming pool?"
          "I'm buying us a swimming pool."
          "PREPARE  FOR  DIVERSION OF 35 PERCENT OF  ENERGY  FROM 
    CLIMATIC CONTROLS SYSTEM DURING REPLICATION OF AQUEOUS  FLUID 
    SUPPLY."
          The  lights  dimmed  for  a  minute,  then  immediately 
    returned to full power as the swimming pool winked in.
          "Good God!" Mary Jane exclaimed as she stared up at the 
    pool.
          Except for a slight translucency on the vertical sides, 
    it appeared to be made of glass.
          "Mademoiselle,  would  you  care  to  inspect  our  new 
    swimming pool?" 
          "Is that real?"
          "As real as you are."
          "Why roof change?" April demanded.  She too was staring 
    up at the new addition.
          "Come,  April,  it  is time that you learned to  swim," 
    Carl said.
          "What is swim?"
          "You'll see.  Come on.  Everyone up to the pool."
          A  minute later they stood on the deck at the  edge  of 
    the  pool.   Only the slight translucency of the pool's sides 
    indicated the change from solid to liquid,  for the water was 
    colorless, still, and came up even to the deck.
          "This,  April,  is  a swimming pool," Carl said  as  he 
    hunkered down and splashed a bit of water at April's feet.
          "Water!" she squealed in wide-eyed amazement.
          Carl's  disturbance  sent  small  ripples  fanning  out 
    across the pool.
          "Yes,  and it is deep water, so we'll have to teach you 
    how  to  move  in it.   Moving in water is  called  swimming, 
    April."
          "I'll  be  glad  to give a  demonstration,"  Mary  Jane 
    offered.    She   hesitated  about  diving  in  because   the 
    appearance  was of diving into space--she could  clearly  see 
    their  living area down below through the clear bottom of the 
    pool.   She eased herself in and held onto the edge until she 
    felt  the bottom with her feet.  Then she pushed herself  off 
    gently and floated on her back for a moment.
          "Mary Jane fly!" April exclaimed.
          Carl laughed,  then said:  No,  you don't fly in water, 
    you float in it.  You can also swim in it."
          "What noise?" April asked.
          "Damn!  We've got a flood!"
          Water  was cascading over the far rim of the  pool  and 
    falling  onto the floor below.   The addition of Mary  Jane's 
    body volume caused the already full pool to overflow.
          "Quick!  Out of the pool!" Carl shouted at Mary Jane.
          She clambered out of the water.
          "What's the matter?" she asked.
          Carl  merely pointed to the water still going over  the 
    edge.
          "Oh, no.  Did it ruin anything, do you think?"
          "It doesn't look like it, but we may have to sleep in a 
    soggy bed."
          "Oh."
          "Why water fall?" April asked.
          "The pool was already full,  and Mary Jane made it over 
    full  by getting in.   The water had to go  someplace.   See, 
    some of it lapped at out feet, and some went over the edge."
          April  studied the situation for a moment with a  frown 
    on her face.  "Pool no good?" she asked.
          "We'll just have to change it.   Robert,  can you  draw 
    down about four inches of water and make the far edge about a 
    foot higher?"
          "ADJUSTMENT PROCEEDING." 
          The modifications winked in.
          "Thank you, Robert.  Now, Mary Jane, you can give April 
    a demonstration of the fine art of swimming."
          Looking down at the room below,  she again hesitated at 
    the  edge of the pool.   She then took a deep breath and dove 
    in.   For  the next twenty minutes,  Mary Jane put on a  fine 
    display of aquatic skills.   Later in the morning, she taught 
    April the rudiments of swimming.
          April was delighted.   "April swim-fly," she proclaimed 
    as she dog-paddled around the pool.
          In  spite  of the requirements of gramatical  exegesis, 
    Carl  had  to agree that swimming in  a  glass-bottomed  pool 
    suspended from a ceiling was akin to flying.



                                   29

          Mary  Jane  noticed Carl's harmonica on  the  workbench 
    where it was serving in the humble capacity of a paperweight.  
    She picked it up and blew a few practice notes, then launched 
    into  a  quick-paced tune.   When she realized that she had an 
    audience, she abruptly stopped.
          "Sorry,  your  harmonica?   I should have asked first," 
    she said, starting to put it back.
          "Not my harmonica,  our harmonica.   Everything here is 
    community property.   You are, I am happy to report,  in  the 
    midsts  of the universe's most anarchistic,  communist  state 
    ... perhaps anarchistic communism can only be successful with 
    a  population  of three citizens and one  benevolent,  unseen 
    patron,  but while it lasts we'll make the most of it.  Go on 
    with the harmonica playing.  It's certainly a lot better than 
    mine," Carl said.
          "Mary Jane play good.  Carl play bad," April commented.
          Carl laughed,  then said:  "Out of the mouths of  babes 
    ... but do play on."
          Mary  Jane  returned to the  harmonica,  finishing  her 
    tune,  then  launching  into  a spirited  rendition  of  "San 
    Francisco Bay Blues."
          "Goodie!  Goodie!  Goodie!" April said in appreciation, 
    and Carl applauded.
          "Clap your hands, April.  When you approve of someone's 
    performance,  you  show it by clapping like I'm doing,"  Carl 
    said.
          April began to clap with enthusiasm.
          Mary  Jane  smiled a bit sheepishly.  "It  wasn't  that 
    good, but it is always nice to have a friendly audience."
          "Of course it was good!  You're the best damn harmonica 
    player  within  a  billion  miles--me being  the  only  other 
    harmonica in the territory and, as April said: 'Carl bad.'"
          "I'm not really a harmonica player,  but everybody goes 
    through  their Dylan phase--non-electric,  early Dylan,  that 
    is.   When he went electric,  I didn't mind,  but when he got 
    religion ... exit me."
          "But when Dylan went electric,  you must have been just 
    a little kid," Carl suggested.
          "Precocious, I guess."
          "Carl laughed,  then said: "As a kid, I was more in the 
    line of obnoxious myself."
          "That's  funny  ...  not your pun ...  wait a  minute."  
    Mary  Jane closed her eyes and paused for a moment.   "I  can 
    remember the musical stuff from my early years,  but the rest 
    has been wiped clean."
          "That's understandable.  Music was a major part of Mary 
    Jane  Galatea's life.   It stands to reason  that,  when  her 
    primary levels of memory were recorded,  all of the music was 
    included."
          "You must be right.  I'm glad I haven't lost that."
          "Me too.  Otherwise we'd have to listen to my harmonica 
    playing."
          "Carl  no play harmonica.   Mary Jane play  harmonica," 
    April said.
          "Yes,  give  us  another  tune,  please....  No,  wait.  
    Robert,  are  you going to pay Mary Jane union scale for  her 
    performance?"
          "FINANCIAL   CREDITS   AT  APPROPRIATE  LEVELS  WILL BE 
    CREDITED PROVIDED THAT RECORDING OF PERFORMANCES BE ALLOWED."
          "As her new agent,  that sounds okay to me.   How  long 
    will she have to play to earn her keep?"
          "PERFORMANCE  OF  .03125  CYCLES  DURATION  WILL  YIELD 
    BALANCED  ACCOUNT  FOR EACH CYCLE.   SUGGEST THAT  MARY  JANE 
    RECEIVE REMUNERATION FROM CARL AND APRIL ALSO."
          "Should we pay?  But we're her roadies!"
          "ROADIES  NULL CONCEPT.   SEARCH OF ALL LEVELS FAILS TO 
    YIELD INTERPRETATION."
          "I  mean  that  we're her  assistants.   I  polish  her 
    harmonica  and  April  is  in charge of  seeing  that  it  is 
    restored  to  its proper place after each performance  as  my 
    paperweight."
          "REMUNERATION  FROM  'ROADIES' TO BE DECISION  OF  MARY 
    JANE.  ACCOUNTS WILL BE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY."
          Mary Jane chuckled,  the said:  "Roadies don't pay, but 
    in this case ...  they don't get any salary either.  Accounts 
    between  Carl,  April,  and myself are balanced as far as  my 
    music playing goes."
          ""ACCOUNTS SO ADJUSTED."
          "If  Mary  Jane is goint to  be  musician-in-residence, 
    then she should have more instruments than a cheap  harmonca.  
    Mary Jane Galatea's guitar playing is,  of course, legendary.  
    What other instruments do you play?"
          "I started with a ukulele at age two,  but I positively 
    refuse to play that instrument,  the sound is so ... poor.  I 
    do credible work on a dulcimer,  panio,  harpsichord,  silver 
    flute and fiddle ... and the guitar, of course."
          "This  sounds  like  the addition of a  music  room  is 
    necessary.   Robert?   How about extending the mezzanine over 
    the  bed  to make it L-shaped?   A twenty-two by eight  space 
    should  easily  accomodate a baby grand panio and  the  other 
    instruments  that  Mary Jane plays.   Do you have  plans  for 
    musical instuments in storage?"
          "AFFIRMATIVE.   INFORMATION  STORAGE CONTAINS PLANS FOR 
    3  TYPES  OF  PANIO,   INCLUDING  THE  BABY  GRAND  TYPE,   1 
    HARPSICHORD, COPIED BY A BOSTON CRAFTSMAN FROM A 17TH CENTURY 
    FRENCH MODEL,  2 DULCIMER DESIGNS,  4 FLUTE DESIGNS, 6 GUITAR 
    DESIGNS,  OF  WHICH 3 ARE ACOUSTIC AND 3 ELECTRIC,  7  VIOLIN 
    DESIGNS, BUT 0 UKULELE DESIGNS.  SORRY ..."
          "No great loss," Mary Jane commented.
          "AND  2 DESIGNS FOR MORE SOPHISTICATED  HARMONICAS.   A 
    TOTAL  OF  139 OTHER INSTRUMENT DESIGNS ALSO  IN  INFORMATION 
    STORAGE."
          "Gee.    We   could  outfit  a  whole  symphony,"  Carl 
    commented.
          "Carl!  We've got to be responsible.  Besides, the ones 
    I  mentioned  are  the  only  instruments  I  play  with  any 
    reasonable  amount  of skill,  and at this stage  of  life  I 
    prefer  to  perfect  what I already play,  not  take  up  new 
    instruments."
          "That's fine.  Besides, you're paying for it all."
          "Another consideration.   You seem to forget that  I've 
    got to play for my supper.   I don't know if I can afford any 
    instrument,  let alone a whole room full ...  not to  mention 
    paying for the room itself."
          "Robert, what would it cost Mary Jane to have a balcony 
    with a harpsichord,  baby grand, flute, violin, dulcimer, and 
    your two best guitars."
          "CALCULATIONS INDICATE THAT THE BALANCE OF THE  ACCOUNT 
    OF  MARY  JANE  WOULD  BE DEFICIENT  BY  56  MONITARY  UNITS.  
    BALANCED  ACCOUNTS  COULD BE ACHIEVED BY  PLAYING  RECORDABLE 
    MUSIC FOR .062 CYCLES PER CYCLE FOR 35 CYCLES."
          Carl  turned  to Mary Jane.  "There you have  it.   The 
    finance  department has spoken.   Give an hour and  a  half's 
    concert every day for the next five weeks and the instruments 
    are yours."
          "I don't know ...  I never buy things on credit.   It's 
    always been cash or I-can't-afford-it."
          "A wise policy on planet Earth, but here ... Robert, do 
    it!"
          "Carl!"
          "If  she won't pay for it,  I will.   I'll co-sign  her 
    loan."
          "AFFIRMATIVE."
          The  lights  dimmed  for a moment as  the  balcony  and 
    musical instruments winked in.
          "Just  out of spite,  I ought to refuse to pay and  let 
    you get stuck with the bill, Carl," Mary Jane threatened.
          Carl laughed,  then said:  "I don't think that you'd be 
    able  to  refrain from playing music,  even if it wasn't  how 
    you're  earning your keep.   And besides,  even if you  could 
    stick  me with the bill,  it'd be worth it.   To have one  of 
    America's finast troubadours give us private  concerts,  even 
    just her practice sessions, is a momentous thing.  Even Saudi 
    Arabian princes can't buy that.   Besides,  not only that, we 
    get  to  enjoy Mary Jane Galatea's company,  which is  itself 
    priceless ..."
          "Buster,  if  you  think that you can get  anywhere  by 
    flattery,  forget it!  The music business is filled with that 
    kind of stuff, and I've seen the best."
          "But  I  really do admire your music,"  Carl  protested 
    with a pained look on his face.
          "Carl,   Mary  Jane  angry?"  April,  puzzled  by  this 
    exchange, asked.
          "I'm  not  angry,  April."  Then she  turned  to  Carl:  
    "When  I'm  angry,  you'll  know about it."  Back  to  April: 
    "We're just having a minor disagreement."
          "Yes," Carl said, "so minor that we're going to dismiss 
    the whole subject.   Come,  April, we're going to inspect the 
    new music room."
          "Carl play other musics like Carl play harmonica?"
          Carl  winked at Mary Jane,  then said  to  April:  "The 
    harmonica  is  my best instrument,  but I will defer  in  all 
    musical  matters to Mary Jane.   She'll play the music around 
    here from now on."
          "Good!   Mary  Jane play good."  April tugged  on  Mary 
    Jane's  arm and pulled her towards the ladder that lead to he 
    mezzanine.  "Show me new music machines, please."
          Mary  Jane  smiled and shrugged her shoulders at  Carl. 
    "With such an appreciative audience, how can I resist?"

                                   31

          "How come Carl not love Mary Jane?   Carl not like Mary 
    Jane." April asked from out of the blue.
          "I like Mary Jane.   I love Mary Jane ...  I ..."  Carl 
    turned  to  Mary  Jane.  "How do you explain  the  difference 
    between love and sex?  For April it's always been the same."
          "April,  Carl loves me,  because we're friends, but you 
    have  to  have  love for a special person to make  their  two 
    bodies  come  together.   I'm not ready for Carl to  be  that 
    special lover.  Do you understand?"
          April frowned.  "No.  Carl ready.  April can see.  Mary 
    Jane  not  ready?   Will Carl still be ready when  Mary  Jane 
    ready?"
          Carl chuckled softly,  then said:  "Yes, April, I think 
    that  I would be ready,  but I have to wait until  Mary  Jane 
    gets ready all by herself."
          "Mary Jane should hurry get ready.   Carl make April so 
    good inside.  Good all over," she said with a grin.
          "Yes,  I know, and that's very nice for you, April, but 
    are you sure that you wouldn't get jealous?"
          "Jea-lous?  Jealous?  New word?"
          "It  means that April would be angry with me if I  made 
    love with Mary Jane," Carl explained.
          "Why April get angry?"
          "If you thought that I wouldn't love you because I made 
    love with Mary Jane ..."
          April's eyes widened,  and she looked from Carl to Mary 
    Jane and back to Carl.  "Happen?"
          "No it is not going to happen because even if I were to 
    make love with Mary Jane, I'm always going to love you."
          "Then   jealous  is  silly  idea,"   April   concluded, 
    dismissing the idea with a wave of her hand.
          "Yes,  it  is  a silly idea and we won't have  anything 
    more to do with it.   I love you and I love Mary Jane and you 
    love me and you love Mary Jane too."
          "Yes," April quickly agreed.
          "And  I love you both," Mary Jane said,  "but I'm   not 
    ready to sleep with Carl."
          "Sleep?   But  Mary Jane sleeps with Carl  and  April," 
    April observed correctly.
          Mary Jane laughed.
          "Mary  Jane made a mistake.   She meant that she wasn't 
    ready to have sex with me."
          April was puzzled.   "Sex?   Mary Jane is sex.   Female 
    sex."
          Carl  laughed,  then commented to Mary Jane:  "I  think 
    that  this may be the first time the term 'having  sex  with' 
    has come up ... no pun intended.  We always called it 'making 
    love.'
          "What  Carl  means is that I am not ready to make  love 
    ...  to have Carl inside me ... but I can still love him as a 
    friend."
          "April understand ...  maybe.   Love,  sex hard to talk 
    about.  Easier to do."
          Carl and Mary Jane both laughed.
          "Yes, and if you weren't so damn pregnant ... but we're 
    going  to  do the best we can for you," Carl  said,  sweeping 
    April up in his arms.  He carried her off to the bed where he 
    gently deposited her,  winked back at Mary Jane,  then pulled 
    the curtains shut.

                              *    *    *

          Mary  Jane  was  sitting  at  the  table  cube,  softly 
    fingering high, sad chords on her guitar.
          "Sorry about the abrupt departure," Carl said.  "Trying 
    to  explain  to  April  that  for  some  people  there  is  a 
    difference between love and sex just turned me on ..."
          Mary  Jane put down her guitar and refilled her  brandy 
    snifter.  With her raised eyebrow answered by a nod of Carl's 
    head, she got another glass for him and poured his drink.
          "You needn't apologize.  After all, you and April are a 
    family," she said, handing him the glass.
          "No,  we're  a family.   We're a billion miles from the 
    nearest  moralist.   We've only ourselves to deal  with,  and 
    therefore  we have the right to make whatever definitions  of 
    family  we  want for ourselves.   At the  moment  our  family 
    consists  of  one  male  and two  females,  one  of  whom  is 
    pregnant.   Soon  the family will include an infant.   In the 
    future,  our definition of family can be modified to fit  the 
    circumstances.   Whatever  happens,  you're as much a part of 
    this  family as anyone.   You are no an intruder.   You're  a 
    necessary  and indispensable part.   In fact,  since you  and 
    April  are  the  only  two replicated  human  beings  in  the 
    universe,  you  two are sisters.   Since you were make at  my 
    request,  perhaps  I can be considered to be your father  ... 
    no,  don't  do  that.   Then maybe we'd have to  worry  about 
    incest  taboos.   Consider  Robert as  your  father,  or  the 
    replicating  machine  ...  no  ...  that's not a  good  idea, 
    either.    See,  all  the old ideas about  relationships  and 
    family  don't apply.   We're a unique relationship:  the,  in 
    order  of  appearance,   Carl-April-Mary  Jane-baby   family.  
    Okay?"  He clinked the edge of her glass with his.
          Mary  Jane  raised her glass in toast:  "To  the  Carl-
    April-Mary Jane-baby family."
          "Good.  And now the Carl member of this family wants to 
    present what remains of his libidinal energy to the Mary Jane 
    member  after having made a similar presentation to the April 
    member."
          "Oh  ... but it's the wrong time of the month."
          "Ah, but I'm not fastidious."
          "Not that time of the month,  just the opposite time of 
    the month."
          "Oh, that time of the month: ovulation."
          "Yes."
          "Well,  perhaps  it would be nice for April's  baby  to 
    have a sibling ..."
          "No! ...  I didn't mean to bark at you.   I'm not ready 
    for babies."
          "Okay,  fine.   I love you anyway.   Besides, there are 
    easy  ways  to  get around that time of the  month  problems.  
    Roger,  I  know  you're listening.   I can  hear  your  heavy 
    breathing."
          "SITUATION  IMPOSSIBLE.  BREATHING CHARACTERISTICS  NOT 
    TRANSLATABLE."
          Carl laughed, then said: "Want to bet?  I can feel your 
    heavy breathing."
          "NOT POSSIBLE."
          "Here  I am about to explore all the deep mysteries  of 
    Mary  Jane's charms with you wide-eyed watching and you  mean 
    to tell me you're not hot and bothered?  Not possible."
          "MARY JANE ATTRACTIVE WOMANNESS AFFIRMED."
          "Oh, I agree, which is why I need a rubber."
          "RUBBER?"
          "A   male   contraceptive   device.     You   know,   a 
    prophylactic.    Who   knows,   she  might  have  herpies  or 
    something."
          "NOT POSSIBLE.   MEDICAL CONDITION OF MARY JANE IS  100 
    PERCENT SATISFACTORY," Robert said as the prophylactic winked 
    onto the table.
          Carl raised his glass in salute to the wall,  and said: 
    "Sir,  I  thank  you."  He drained his glass,  put it on  the 
    table, and picked up the red foil packet.  "Mademoiselle?"
          "I haven't said that I want you for my lover ... I will 
    admit  that you seem a lot nicer than that last bastard,  but 
    appearances are deceptive.  On the other hand, I don't have a 
    lot  of men to chose from,  do I?   ...  I'm still  a  little 
    afraid of April being jealous, aren't you?"
          "April jealous?   'Not possible,' as Robert might  say.  
    Two concepts not in her repertoire are jealosy and frigidity.  
    In  fact,  I'd  suspect  her of being a  nymphomaniac  if  it 
    weren't   for  the  fact  that  recent  studies  have   shown 
    nymphomania to really just be male myth."
          "I  thought  that  nymphomania  was  supposed  to  have 
    something  to do with the inability to love.   April is  very 
    loving."
          "QED she is not a nymphomaniac,  just extremely erotic, 
    which is very nice.   But at the moment she's asleep, and I'm 
    tumescent.  Mademoiselle, we procrastinate."
          "But where?"
          "On the float in the middle of the pool," Carl said.

                              *    *    *

          Mary Jane and Carl lay snuggled together on the float.
          "Carl,  that  was  sooo nice," she dreamily said in his 
    ear.
          "Mutual,   I thoroughly enjoyed taking your cherry,  or 
    as  one particularly  delicate student of mine once  put  it: 
    devirginize you."
          "Are you going to start that again?  Devirginize?"
          "The  girl  couldn't bring herself to say rape,  as  in 
    'The   Rape   of  the  Lock,'  so  she  invented   the   term 
    'devirginize'  for herself.   On the other topic:  I  promise 
    never  to bring up the question of your  virginity,  or  lack 
    thereof,  again.   Hear that, Robert?  You be sure and remind 
    me  if it ever appears that I am about to step over the  line 
    of probity."
          "Don't be paranoid, it's not listening."
          "Roger is not 'it,' he's Roger."   
          "Well,  when I was here before, he was 'it.'  Remember, 
    he kidnaped me.  I didn't know what to expect.  I didn't know 
    if  I was going to be raped,  or killed,  or eaten,  or what.  
    I'm  still  not  certain he's as benevolent as  you  seem  to 
    think.   Maybe  we're just being fattened for soup,  or  kept 
    contented so that we're tender."
          Carl laughed,  then playfully nibbled on her  shoulder.  
    "Mmmm.  Your nice and tender already, but perhaps you've read 
    too  much  science fiction.   In the case of you  and  April, 
    you're replications,  so he could make as many edible  bodies 
    as  he  wanted.   In my case and in the case of the  original 
    Mary  Jane  Galatea,  to transport a mere one and  a  quarter 
    hundredweight  of meat for a journey of over a year,  and  in 
    such   luxurious  accommodations,   to  merely  make  a   few 
    hambergers--people bergers--is absurd.   No, you're not going 
    to be lunch."
          "MMMMMMM. MARY JANE RARE DELICACY."
          Carl took the opportunity  of Mary Jane's dropped mouth 
    to plant a deep kiss there.  "He's only joking," he told her.  
    Then  to  Roger he said:  "See,  I knew you  were  listening.  
    Does your language have the term voyer?"
          "SEXUAL PERVERSION NOT SUBJECT FOR COMMUNICATION."
          "I didn't say that I thought that you were a pervert, I 
    was merely asking a question about your language."
          "CORRECTION.  CULTURAL  MATRIX  OF  ROBERT  SIMILAR  IN 
    CONTENT   TO  CULTURAL  MATRIX  OF  CARL.   SEXUAL  FUNCTIONS 
    CONSIDERED PRIVATE MATTER BETWEEN PERSONS  INVOLVED.   VOYERS 
    TREATED   UNDER  STATUTES  CONCERNING  INVASION  OF  PRIVACY.  
    INVASION  OF  PRIVACY CONSIDERED A  MAJOR  CRIMINAL  OFFENSE.  
    OCCURRANCES  ARE RARE.   DOES ANSWER MEET THE NEEDS OF CARLS?  
    DOES  CARL DESIRE STATISTICAL INFORMATION ON  OCCURRANCES  OF 
    INVASION OF PRIVACY CRIME?"
          "Thanks,  but  no  thanks."
          "Speaking of  invasions of privacy,"  Mary  Jane  said, 
    "what  about  what you're doing to us?   You're  watching  us 
    parade around nude, watching us shit, shower, and everything, 
    even  watching  us  make  love.    Aren't  you  invading  our 
    privacy?"
          "CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE MONITORING OF ACTITIES TO INSURE 
    SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF SPECIMENS ..."
          "And besides, it's fun," Carl interrupted.
          "BESIDES,  IDENTICAL  BEHAVIOR  EXHIBITED BY  SPECIMENS 
    WITH NO APPARENT DISSENSION."
          "Well,  that  may be true,  but we have been  a  little 
    discreet in sexual matters," Mary Jane said.
          "NEGATIVE SITUATION"
          "What do you mean?" Carl asked.
          The  answer came in the form of giggles from down below 
    them.
          "April, we thought that you were asleep," Carl said.
          Mary Jane said: "Oh, no."
          April  was  lieing on the floor,  looking  up  at  them 
    through the transparent pool and equally transparent float.
          "Mary  Jane  looks funny from down here when Mary  Jane 
    and Carl make love.   Mary Jane and Carl make lots of  waves.  
    Big waves."  Again April giggled.
          "When viewed from that angle, coitus probably does look 
    a bit ridiculous," Carl commented.
          "You're  not angry with us,  are you April?" Mary  Jane 
    asked.
          "Carl make Mary Jane feel good?" 
          "Yes, very good."  Mary Jane could not help smiling.
          "Good!   Carl  make April feel good too.   April happy.  
    Mary Jane happy?"
          "Yes."
          "Good.   April go back to sleep now."  So  saying,  she 
    got  up  from  the floor and went back to  bed,  drawing  the 
    curtains closed behind her.
          "She is a remarkable woman," Mary Jane said.
          "You're  both  remarkable women.   We  know  from  what 
    position  April watched us,  what I want to know is from what 
    position Robert watched us."
          "MONITORING   FROM   ALL  POSITIONS   POSSIBLE   EITHER 
    SIMULTANEOUSLY OR SEQUENTIALLY."
          "Ah, voyer's heaven.  We'll try to keep you entertained 
    as much as possible," Carl said,  then gave Mary Jane a  kiss 
    on the cheek.
          "Haven't you had enough?"
          "Between  April and you,  my hydraulic system is pretty 
    well exhausted, but I don't need an erection to kiss a pretty 
    lady."  He kissed her nipple.   "Besides, you taste so nice."  
    He kissed her beside the naval.   "Robert is right, you are a 
    rare  delicacy.   I could kiss you for hours."  He gave her a 
    series  of  kisses,  each one a little lower than  the  last.  
    "Nothing  wrong  with your hydraulics,"  he  mumbled  between 
    kisses.
          "Carl. Oooooo."

                              *    *    *

          "He  probably just recorded you kissing me to  orgasm." 
    Mary Jane commented.
          "Now don't be so hard on the lad,  Mary Jane.   Did you 
    record it?"
          "FAILURE  TO  THINK  OF  RECORDING  MUST  BE  REPORTED.  
    STATEMENT OF APPRECIATION FOR THE VALUABLE SUGGESTION OF MARY 
    JANE."
          "Hey, buster, I'm not suggesting it."
          "PERMISSION TO RECORD SEXUAL ACTIVITIES DENIED?"
          "Let him have his fun, Mary Jane, after all, all he can 
    do  is  watch.   We have all the fun of  doing  it,  and  his 
    watching and/or recording does us no harm."
          "Oh, all right.  Do whatever you wish."
          "STATEMENT OF PROFOUND APPRECIATION.   WILL OBSERVE BUT 
    NOT  RECORD  IN DIFFERENCE TO THE WISHES OF MARY JANE  UNLESS 
    MATTER OF CLINICAL INTEREST OCCURS CONCERNING MATTERS RELATED 
    TO UNDERSTANDING OF CULTURAL MATRIX."
          "As  you wish," Mary Jane said,  dismissing the  matter 
    with  a  wave  of her hand.   "We couldn't tell  if you  were 
    recording or not, anyway."
          "RECORDING DESIRED OF REACTION OF NIPPLES DURING SEXUAL 
    STIMULATION  AND REACTION OF TOES TO DETERMINE IF  PHENOMENON 
    INITIATED SIMULTANEOUSLY OR SEQUENTIALLY, IF SEQUENTIALLY, TO 
    DETERMINE  ORDER  OF REACTION.   PERMISSION TO RECORD  DURING 
    NEXT OPPORTUNITY DESIRED."           
          "The  next time it might be Carl and April," Mary  Jane 
    said.
          "RECORDING OF REACTIONS OF MARY JANE PREFERRED."
          "Why," she asked.
          "RECORDING  OF  REACTIONS OF MARY  JANE  PREFERRED  ... 
    SUBJECTIVE  JUDGEMENT  INDICATED REACTIONS OF MARY JANE  MORE 
    SEVERE."
          "Maybe  that's just because she's been getting it  more 
    than me.  I've been sex-starved for awhile."
          "Not  any more,  you're going to be," Carl assured  her 
    with a grin.
          "Oh, you're impossible!"  She gave him a shove and sent 
    him tumbling off the float and into the water.
          Carl  tried to pull the float out from under  her,  but 
    she jumped clear and landed on the deck.
          "Maybe  April and I will get together and make you  the 
    sex-starved one," she threatened with a grin.
          "Here I do you the great honor of plucking your cherry, 
    and you treat me in such a fashion.  Tisk-tisk!"
          Mary Jane had to laugh.  Well,  my ravisher," she said, 
    "come out of the water and dry yourself off so that we can go 
    down the ladder and we both can snuggle with April."
          "A very good idea."

SUMMARY OF ABRIDGED CHAPTERS:

     Robert explains how the replication process works.
     
     Mary  Jane  suggests  that April start  doing  exercises  to 
strengthen the muscles used during the birth process.

     Carl  suggests  the  replication of a  second  man,  perhaps 
Robert Redford,  be undertaken  for Mary Jane,  but Robert points 
out that such a man would arrive mentally undeveloped, and no one 
wants to deal with Baby Robert Redford.

          First Mary Jane wanted to cry,  then she wanted to slug 
    Carl   when,   after   she   trepidatiously   explained   her 
    conversation  with  Robert on the subject of  erotic  contact 
    between herself and April,  he flippantly said:  "So,  you've 
    got  the  hots  for April too."  Carl instantly  grasped  the 
    seriousness of his  faux pas,  so he wrapped his arms  around 
    her and gave her a kiss.
          "I don't blame you in the least," he said gently.  "The 
    three  of  us  have so much love for each  other  that  we're 
    really at a loss as to how to express its  enormity.   No,  I 
    don't think it would be inappropriate for you to express your 
    feelings towards April in a more physical way.  I'm surprised 
    that  it just hadn't erupted spontaneously.   Perhaps I  have 
    been  an  inhibiting factor for you women.   In any  case,  I 
    don't think that any harm would come to April from it.  Quite 
    to  the contrary,  I agree with Robert that it would be  good 
    for all of us.   Hell,  we've got so much love here that we'd 
    have  enough  to   include Robert no matter  what  he  looked 
    like."
          "What do you mean, 'no matter what he looked like?'"
          "Er ...  well ...  we only know him through his  voice, 
    and  that is merely the voice of the translating machine,  so 
    we've  never really had any direct contact with  him  ...  if 
    indeed  he  is  a 'he.'  He could be a 'she' or an  'it,'  we 
    don't  really  know.   Robert could look like a  crab,  or  a 
    shapeless blob of protoplasm."
          Mary Jane didn't say anything.
          "CARL HAS AN OVERACTIVE IMAGINATION."
          "Do I?   Perhaps.   Will we see what our friend  Robert 
    looks like at the end of this voyage?"
          "AFFIRMATIVE.  AT THE END OF THE VOYAGE WE WILL MEET."
          "I will look forward to that," Carl said.
          Mary Jane just smiled.

                              *    *    *

          Late that evening,  sitting beside the pool,  Mary Jane 
    asked: "Xan, what do you look like?"
          "DOES IT MATTER?"
          Mary  Jane smiled and said:  "I ...  I can't  fantasize 
    about  you because I have no point  on which to focus.   Carl 
    says that you could look like a crab, and maybe you are ..."
          Robert laughed,  then said: "CARL HAS BEEN READING FROM 
    MY SCIENCE FICTION COLLECTION AGAIN." 
          "Can you replicate a picture of yourself for me?"
          "IF  I  WERE A CREATURE OF UGLINESS,   WOULDN'T  IT  BE 
    BETTER THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW?"
          Mary  Jane  was silent for a  moment,  then  said:  "No 
    matter  what your shape was,  I'd still know that you  really 
    were a beautiful person.  Isn't that what really matters?"
          "ALTHOUGH  THERE IS TRUTH IN WHAT YOU SAY,  BEAUTY IS A 
    CONCEPT  WHICH IS DEFINED BY THE PARAMETERS OF  THE  CULTURAL 
    MATRIX  WITHIN  WHICH IT OPERATES.   THE  MALAKAIS   CONSIDER 
    THEMSELVES  TO  BE BEAUTIFUL--THEY LOOK SOMEWHAT  LIKE  FURRY 
    VERSIONS  OF   TEN-ARMED  OCTOPUSES,  NOT VERY CUDDLY BY  OUR 
    STANDARDS--BUT  THEY  ARE  THE BEST MUSICIANS  IN  THE  KNOWN 
    UNIVERSE,  AND TO SIT DOWN WITH THEM AND LISTEN TO THEM  PLAY 
    IS ONE OF THE  GREATEST EXPERIENCES POSSIBLE.  ONCE THE MUSIC 
    STARTS, YOU FORGET ALL ABOUT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE."
          "You're  avoiding  the  subject  of  you,"  she  gently 
    chided.
          "AM I?"
          "Look,  I  know that you're not going to look like  the 
    knight in shining armor of my adolescent fantasies.  Think of 
    it  in terms of equality.   You know what we look like.   The 
    fact  that  we've been parading around here in the  nude  all 
    this  time  is  indicative of the fact that  we've  lost  our 
    bodily  self-consciousness ...  Wear your full dress  uniform 
    if you're shy."
          "IT SHALL BE AS YOU WISH ..."
          An image of Robert winked in on the water at the end of 
    the  pool.   He was a man of about Carl's height,  but with a 
    much slighter build--a shortened and thinned version of  Mary 
    Jane.   At first Mary Jane thought that he was bald, but then 
    she  saw  that  his  hair  was  short,   curled,  and  almost 
    translucent.   He  was definitely humanoid--sort of an albino 
    Negro--but  his eyes were green.   He wore a  loose,  flowing 
    robe which shimmered with multicolored iridescence.  He stood 
    with  his forearms held out at right angles to his body  with 
    the palms facing out.
          "GREETINGS, MARY JANE GALATEA."
          She smiled,  then said:  "Greetings Xan.  You're a fine 
    species of crustacean."
          The image was expressionless.  Silence hung in the air.
          "Did I say something wrong?"
          After a brief silence,  Robert said:  "NO, I APOLOGIZE.  
    THERE  WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING ON MY PART.   YOU  SEE,  I  WAS 
    SPEAKING WITHOUT THE TRANSLATOR, AND THE WORD 'CRUSTACEAN' IN 
    YOUR  LANGUAGE  IS VERY SIMILAR TO A VERY VULGAR WORD  IN  MY 
    LANGUAGE.    I  WAS  MOMENTARILY  TAKEN  ABACK.   I  COULDN'T 
    UNDERSTAND  WHY YOU WERE SUDDENLY INSULTING ME,  SO FINALLY I 
    RAN YOUR COMMENT THROUGH THE TRANSLATOR, AND NOW I UNDERSTAND 
    THAT  YOU  WERE REFERRING TO A COMMENT MADE  EARLIER BY  CARL 
    CONCERNING  THE  POSSIBILITY  THAT I MIGHT  BE  GROTESQUE  IN 
    APPEARANCE."
          "It is obvious that that is not the case.   I can't see 
    what you were so secretive about.  True, you don't fit any of 
    the  racial groupings on Earth,  but among some of  our  more 
    avantguarde New York or L.A.  sub-cultures you'd pass without 
    much comment."
          "IT  IS  TRUE I AM NOT VERY DIFFERENT IN APPEARANCE  TO 
    THE  GENERAL  CHARACTERISTICS  OF  MEMBERS  OF YOUR  CULTURAL 
    MATRIX,  EVEN  DOWN TO THE SAME NUMBER OF  FINGERS,  HOWEVER, 
    RELATIVE  TO THE BODY TYPE WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO  BE  NORMAL 
    AMONG THE MEMBERS OF MY CULTURAL MATRIX,  I AM AN ANOMALY.  A 
    PERSON OF MY STATURE WOULD NORMALLY HAVE TWICE MY MASS.  SOME 
    METABOLIC  QUIRK  HAS PREVENTED ME FROM ATTAINING THE  NORMAL 
    CORPULENCE.   SINCE EARLY CHILDHOOD,  I HAVE BEEN CALLED 'THE 
    HALF-MAN.'"
          "Yeah,  I know how how feel.  Being tall sometimes made 
    me an outcast too."
          "BUT YOU ARE WELL WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE OF BODY TYPES 
    FOR YOUR CULTURAL MATRIX.   THERE ARE A LOT OF TALL PEOPLE ON 
    YOUR PLANET,  MANY SIGNIFICANTLY TALLER THAN YOU.  I AM ... I 
    AM ALMOST THE THINEST MAN ON MY PLANET."
          "You have been ostracized?"
          "NO,  OF  COURSE NOT,  BUT IT HAS HAD AN EFFECT ON  THE 
    SOCIAL COMPONENT OF MY LIFE.   I AN NOT CONSIDERED TO BE VERY 
    DESIRABLE BY WOMEN, AND WHO CAN BLAME THEM?"
          "You don't look too bad to me.   Come sit beside me and 
    tell me about your planet's people."
          "SIT?  IT IS AN IMAGE THAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT."
          "Oh,  yeah.   You  look so real,  like you were  really 
    standing there."  Mary Jane giggled.  "But of course it is an 
    image.  You're standing on the water.  Unless you've achieved 
    becoming god ..."
          Robert laughed.  "NO, NOT YET, BUT I CAN MANIPULATE THE 
    IMAGE  TO  DO INNUMERABLE SEEMINGLY  IMPOSSIBLE  THINGS  LIKE 
    WALKING  ON AIR ..."  The image took several steps up an non-
    existent  staircase  and thus appeared to be walking  up  the 
    air.  "OR THE OLD HOUDINI ILLUSION ..."  The image rotated to 
    a horizontal position and floated in the air.  "OR MAKE TWINS 
    ..."   A  second image appeared floating  beside  the  first, 
    stayed for a moment, then winked out.  "OR FULFILL ADOLESCENT 
    FANTASIES ..."  The image became encased in shining, midieval 
    armor for a moment, then returned to it's original form.
          "You'd be great at parties."
          "THE  MUNDANE  OF AN ADVANCED  CULTURAL  MATRIX  ALWAYS 
    APPEARS TO BE MAGIC TO A LESS ADVANCED ONE.   THERE IS ALWAYS 
    THE  TENDENCY  TO  MAGIFY  OR DEIFY  ANYTHING  WHICH  IS  NOT 
    UNDERSTOOD."
          "Yes,  it's  always  easy to entertain  us  primitives, 
    isn't it?"  Mary Jane mockingly said.
          "IT IS NOT A MATTER OF BEING PRIMITIVE OR ADVANCED  ... 
    PERHAPS  I  EXPRESS MYSELF IMPROPERLY.   IT IS THAT  YOU  ARE 
    STARTING  OUT ON THE PATH OF DEVELOPMENT AT A LATER POINT  OF 
    TIME  THAN OTHER CULTURAL MATRIXES.   THERE ARE,  OF  COURSE, 
    ALSO  CULTURAL  MATRIXES WHICH ARE BEHIND YOU ON  THAT  PATH.  
    THINK  OF YOUR GRANDPARENTS.   IN THEIR YOUTH THEIR MEANS  OF 
    TRANSPORTATION WAS PROBABLY AN ANIMAL POWERED VEHICLE.   YOUR 
    CULTURAL  MATRIX HAS NOW MADE VEHICLES WHICH HAVE STARTED  TO 
    TRAVEL  OUTSIDE YOUR SOLAR SYSTEM.   IN THE LIFETIME OF  YOUR 
    GRANDPARENTS,  DEVELOPMENT  HAS GONE FROM ANIMAL POWER TO THE 
    FIRST  STEPS TOWARDS INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL.   DO  YOU  CONSIDER 
    YOUR GRANDPARENTS TO BE 'PRIMITIVES?'"
          "Of course not!"
          "WOULD  NOT EVERYTHING  THAT IS COMMON  IN  YOUR  WORLD 
    APPEAR  TO  BE MAGICAL IF IT WERE SOMEHOW TRANSPORTED BACK  A 
    HALF A CENTURy OR SO?  DEMONSTRATE A WORD PROCESSING COMPUTER 
    TO A SECRETARY OF 1934,  AND WOULD NOT SHE CONSIDER IT TO  BE 
    MAGIC?"
          "It seems like magic even to me," Mary Jane said with a 
    smile.  "You've made your point."
          "BESIDES,  IT  IS  CONSIDERED GAUCHE IN MY  CULTURE  TO 
    FLAUNT   ONE'S ADVANCES BEFORE A PERSON FROM A LESS DEVELOPED 
    CULTURAL  MATRIX ...  TO SAY NOTHING OF THE FACT THAT  IT  IS 
    ILLEGAL."
          Mary  Jane laughed,  then said:  "But isn't that what's 
    been happening throughout this voyage?   All this replication 
    stuff has been flaunting your advances ..."
          "IT  HAS  BEEN NECESSARY TO REPLICATE CERTAIN  SUPPLIES 
    FOR YOUR SURVIVAL ..."
          "Ah,  but  it hasn't been necessary to do so in such  a 
    dramatic way ...  The Niagara Falls bit?   Our swimming pool?  
    Even  this  exquisite holographic image of yourself  standing 
    there  on the water?   Necessary?   Admit   it,  you've  been 
    showing off to impress us"
          "PART  OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS VOYAGE WAS TO ACCLIMATIZE 
    THE  PERSON   WHO  WAS TO HAVE  BEEN  INCORPORATED  INTO  OUR 
    CULTURAL  MATRIX ...  TO GET HER USED TO THE IDEA THAT  THESE 
    AREN'T MIRACLES, BUT JUST ORDINARY ASPECTS OF OUR CULTURE."
          "In other words,  the original Mary Jane Galatea was to 
    have  been accustomed to living  within your cultural  matrix 
    by the time that she arrived at your planet."
          "IT  WAS ADJUDGED FROM PRELIMINARY DATA THAT THIS WOULD 
    BE  THE RESULT OF THE VOYAGE.   OTHERS  HAVE  ...  ALSO,  OUR 
    KNOWLEDGE  OF  THE MUSIC OF YOUR CULTURAL MATRIX  WOULD  HAVE 
    BEEN  EXPANDED FROM THE INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM HER DURING 
    THE VOYAGE.   ALTHOUGH THE MISSION HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY ... 
    BOTCHED  IS  THE  PROPER WORD,  I THINK  ...  THE  AMOUNT  OF 
    INFORMATION  ON  MUSIC  WHICH  YOU   HAVE  PROVIDED  FOR  OUR 
    RECORDINGS WILL GO A CONSIDERABLE WAY TOWARDS FULFILLING  THE 
    ORIGINAL  GOALS OF THE MISSION.   HAVING AN ERSATZ MARY  JANE 
    GALATEA INSTEAD OF THE ORIGINAL ONE DOES MEAN THAT A  PORTION 
    OF   HER  POTENTIAL   CONTRIBUTION  TO  OUR  ACCUMULATION  OF 
    KNOWLEDGE MAY BE LOST,  HOWEVER,  I AM HOPEFUL THAT THIS WILL 
    BE A VOYAGE WHICH WILL BE VIEWED AS A SUCCESS."
          "But  what  if  it  is viewed  as  a  failure  by  your 
    supervisors?"
          "THEN I SIMPLY WILL NOT BE MAKING ANY OTHER VOYAGES."
          "Is it that simple?  Such a monumental failure wouldn't 
    be treated so lightly in my cultural matrix, I assure you."
          "WELL, THERE IS ONE COMPLICATION.  I MAY BE REQUIRED TO 
    REIMBURSE THE COSTS OF THIS VOYAGE."
          Mary Jane let out a low whistle.   "Boy,  I'll bet that 
    won't come cheap."
          "CONSIDERING THE TROUBLE I WENT THROUGH TO GET ASSIGNED 
    TO THIS VOYAGE, THAT IS TRUE."
          "How is  it that you,  a person  of  ...  anomalization 
    within your cultural matrix because of your physique, got the 
    job of collecting this obscure troubadour, Mary Jane Galatea?  
    And  speaking of whom,  what is this 'preliminary data?'   Do 
    you mean that you've been spying on me all along?
          "OBSERVATIONS  HAVE  BEEN  MADE,  BUT  IT  WAS  NOTHING 
    PERSONAL.    WHEN   NEW  CULTURAL  MATRIXES  ARE  DISCOVERED, 
    SCANNING TEAMS ARE SENT TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT 
    AND PINPOINT AREAS OF INFORMATION WHICH WOULD BE SUITABLE FOR
    INCLUSION  IN  THE UNIVERSAL  INTERGALACTIC  ENCYCLOPEDIA  OF 
    CULTURAL  MATRIXES.   THEY ALSO ATTEMPT TO LOCATE PERSONS WHO 
    MIGHT BE AMENABLE TO RELOCATION ...  THAT IS TO  SAY,  PEOPLE 
    WHO  ARE  DISSATISFIED WITH ASPECTS OF THEIR CULTURAL  MATRIX 
    AND WHO HAVE SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON ASPECTS OF CULTURE WHICH 
    ARE OF INTEREST TO THE COMPILERS OF THE ENCYCLOPEDIA.   MUSIC 
    AND ART ARE TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF ANY CULTURE, 
    AND IT IS THESE AREAS THAT INTEREST US MOST--OBVIOUSLY WE ARE 
    NOT  INTERESTED IN YOUR TECHNOLOGIES.   ART AND MUSIC DO  NOT 
    NECESSARILY PROGRESS LINEARLY.   UNLIKE TECHNOLOGY,  THEY ARE 
    MORE  LIKELY  TO BE CYCLIC,  THUS  TECHNOLOGICALLY  PRIMITIVE 
    SOCIETIES  MAY HAVE ADVANCED LEVELS OF ART--YOUR WRITERS  ARE 
    NOW  BEGINNING TO USE COMPUTERS,  BUT INSTEAD OF  SHAKESPEARE 
    YOU JUST HAVE SIMON.   OUR INTEREST IN THESE AREAS MAY  EXIST 
    BECAUSE  OUR  CULTURAL MATRIX HAS ADVANCED TO A  HIGH  DEGREE 
    ALONG  TECHNICAL  LINES,  BUT  HAS NOT BEEN  ABLE  TO  ATTAIN  
    SIMILAR  ACHIEVEMENTS IN ART OR MUSIC.   A PRELIMINARY SURVEY 
    TEAM  DOING  WIDE-ANGLE  SCANNING  LOCATED  A  MUSICIAN   WHO 
    APPEARED  TO BE DISILLUSIONED WITH THE MILIEU OF HER CULTURAL 
    MATRIX.   THAT MUSICIAN WAS ADJUDGED TO BE A PRIME  CANDIDATE 
    FOR RELOCATION TO OUT CULTURAL MATRIX."
          "Politically dissatisfied to be sure,  but that doesn't 
    necessarily mean that I was culturally dissatisfied."
          "YES,  THE  DISTINCTION  WAS  OBVIOUS  WHEN  MARY  JANE 
    GALATEA  ESCAPED.   VERY  FEW CULTURAL MATRIXES HAVE  SUCH  A 
    GREAT  GULF  BETWEEN THE POLITICAL AND THE CULTURAL  ASPECTS.  
    MOST  ARE  FAIRLY  WELL INTEGRATED SO THAT  IF  YOU  MAP  THE 
    CULTURE,  YOU HAVE A REASONABLE IDEA ABOUT THE  POLITICS,  OR 
    VICE-VERSA.   IN THIS RESPECT, YOUR CULTURAL MATRIX IS ... AN 
    ANOMALY."
          "Okay,  I'll agree, we're all screwed up.  Forget about 
    our anomalies for the moment.  What I want to know is why you 
    were involved with this project."
          "ONCE  THE PRELIMINARY SURVEY LOCATES A  PRIME  SUBJECT 
    FOR  INCORPORATION INTO OUR CULTURAL MATRIX,  THEN THE  KNOWN 
    FACTS  OF THE CASE ARE PUBLISHED AND MEMBERS ARE  INVITED  TO 
    SUBMIT PROPOSALS OF METHODS OF ...  ENTICING THE SUBJECT INTO 
    ACCEPTING  A  POSITION  WITH  THE  UNIVERSAL    INTERGALACTIC 
    ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CULTURAL MATRIXES AS AN INFORMATION SOURCE."
          "Entice?   Your  modius operandi could hardly be called 
    enticement.  You kidnaped me!"
          "I WILL HAVE TO CONFESS THAT I MISCALCULATED YOUR LEVEL 
    OF DISENCHANTMENT WITH YOUR CULTURAL MATRIX."
          "But  didn't you say that your plan had to be  approved 
    by some kind of committee?"
          "ORDINARILY, YES.  BUT THERE ISN'T A LOT OF INTEREST IN 
    THIS  GALAXY SINCE ALL OF THE CULTURAL MATRIXES ARE  ISOLATED 
    DUE  TO THE FACT THAT  INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL IS NOT YET  COMMON 
    AND MOST OF THE CULTURES THAT HAVE IT ARE IN THE OTHER ARM OF 
    THE GALAXY.   THE AREA OF GREATEST INTEREST IS IN THE INITIAL 
    CONTACT  BETWEEN CULTURAL MATRIXES,  ESPECIALLY WHEN BOTH ARE 
    EXPERIENCING  THEIR  FIRST  CONTACT  WITH  ANOTHER   CULTURAL 
    MATRIX.   MOST  OF HE RESEARCH FUNDS ARE SPENT IN THAT  AREA.  
    YOUR  CULTURAL MATRIX IS ...  A BACK BURNER ITEM.  THERE ARE, 
    HOWEVER,  A FEW SPECIALISTS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN IT  EXACTLY 
    BECAUSE  IT IS 'ALL SCREWED UP' AND ALSO HAPPENS TO BE AT THE 
    NUCLEAR  WEAPONS  DEPLOYMENT  STAGE ....   PERHAPS  THEY  ARE 
    INTERESTED  BECAUSE  THEY  THINK THAT IT IS  GOING  TO  SELF-
    DESTRUCT.   IN ANY CASE, FUNDS WERE APPROPRIATED TO COLLECT A 
    LIMITED  NUMBER  OF SPECIMENS.    I WAS  ABLE TO  PERSUADE  A 
    MEMBER  OF  THE  ASSIGNMENT COMMITTEE TO GIVE  ME  THIS  TASK 
    WITHOUT STIPULATING A PLAN OF ENTICEMENT.  WHEN MY AUNT ASKED 
    FOR  THE PLAN,  I JUST TOLD HER THAT I WOULD THINK ONE UP  ON 
    THE WAY TO YOUR PLANET.  I ADMIT THAT THE IDEA DIDN'T GO OVER 
    TOO  WELL,  BUT  SINCE  THERE WAS ONLY ONE  OTHER  PARTY  WHO 
    EXPRESED  AN  INTEREST IN SPECIMEN QR23,  AND THEIR  PROPOSED 
    LIST  OF EXPENSES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN MINE,  I  GOT 
    THE ASSIGNMENT WITH THE STIPULATION THAT I FILE AN OUTLINE OF 
    ENTICEMENT PLANNING BEFORE EMBARKING."
          "But you said that you didn't have a plan."
          "THE  PLAN  I  FILED  WAS MERELY  A  STATEMENT  THAT  I 
    INTENDED A RETURN VOYAGE OF 400 OF YOUR CYCLES,  DURING WHICH 
    TIME  I  WOULD COLLECT AND CATALOG THE INFORMATION  THAT  WAS 
    EXPECTED TO BE DERIVED FROM SPECIMEN QR23.   ABOUT MY METHODS 
    OF  ENTICEMENT,  I SAID NOTHING.   THE COMMITTEE MERELY NOTED 
    THAT A PLAN WAS ON FILE.   THEY NEVER CHECKED THE CONTENTS OF 
    THAT FILE BEFORE ISSUING A COLLECT AND REPORT ORDER."
          Mary Jane laughed,  then said:  "I see that you  higher 
    cultural  matrix  types  haven't solved the  inefficiency-of-
    bureaucracy problem yet."
          Roger also laughed.  "NO CULTURAL MATRIX HAS SOLVED THE 
    BUREAUCRACY PROBLEM.    IN MORE COMPLICATED CULTURAL MATRIXES 
    THERE  ARE  MORE METHODS OF  SIDE-STEPPING  THE  BUREAUCRACY, 
    WHEREAS  IN  LESSER DEVELOPED ONES IT IS  NECESSARY  TO  PLOW 
    THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF IT."
          "Now  that  I  know how you got  this  assignment,  the 
    question  is:  why?   After  all,  this is  an  uninteresting 
    backwater of the universe."
          There was a long silence before Robert replied.
          "ALTHOUGH WE ARE DIFFERENT SPECIES AND ARE  GENETICALLY 
    INCOMPATABLE,  THERE  IS A REMARKABLE SIMILARITY BETWEEN  THE 
    PHYSICAL  ASPECTS OF OUR TWO SPECIES.   PHYSIOLOGICALLY I  AM 
    ACTUALLY  CLOSER  TO  YOU  THAN TO MOST  MEMBERS  OF  MY  OWN 
    CULTURE.   I  THOUGHT  THAT ...  I HOPED THAT ...  PERHAPS  A 
    FRIENDSHIP  BETWEEN  US  COULD  RESULT  FROM  OUR  RESPECTIVE 
    ESTRANGEMENTS   FROM   OUR   OWN   CULTURAL   MATRIXES.    MY 
    MISCALCULATION  OF  MARY JANE GALATEA'S UNWILLINGNESS  TO  BE 
    ASSIMILATED  BY  A NEW CUTURAL MATRIX SHOWS HOW  FAR  OFF  MY 
    IDEAS WERE."
          "There  is a difference between being dissatisfied with 
    your  culture  in  wanting  to  make  it  better  and   being 
    disillusioned  to the degree that you would welcome a  chance 
    to run away.   Maybe what you were doing was projecting on to 
    me your own feelings."
          "IT IS TRUE THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN ENTIRELY HAPPY WITH MY 
    FATE, BUT I AM NOT RUNNING AWAY.  INDEED, I AM AT THIS MOMENT 
    EMBARKED  ON  SOCIALLY USEFUL WORK AND AM IN THE  PROCESS  OF 
    RETURNING TO THE BOSOM OF MY CULTURAL MATRIX."
          "From  some  of the things that you have said and  from 
    what  Carl has told me,  I got the idea that the duration  of 
    this  voyage could have been considerably less.   If that  is 
    true,  isn't it a kind of running away,  or at least a hiatus 
    from your cultural matrix?"
          "THE   VOYAGE   COULD  HAVE   BEEN   COMPLETED   ALMOST 
    INSTANTANEOUSLY  HAD  THE  PROGRAM BEEN SET FOR THAT  AT  THE 
    BEGINNING.   ONCE THE SPEED OF TRAVEL HAS BEEN SET IT CAN NOT 
    BE CHANGED WITHOUT CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY AND AT THE COST OF 
    TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF ENERGY."
          "Again the question is: why such a long voyage?"
          "I  HAD  HOPED  THAT A LEVEL  OF  FRIENDSHIP  COULD  BE 
    DEVELOPED ..."
          "And so it has,  even though you are stuck in your part 
    of the ship, and I am stuck in here."
          "OH, I DIDN'T MEAN PHYSICAL FRIENDSHIP."
          "No?"
          "ER ... THAT WAS TOO MUCH TO HOPE FOR.  BESIDES, WE ARE 
    GENETICALLY INCOMPATABLE."
          "But our bodies are,  it seems to me,  not incompatable 
    in  other  ways.   We could snuggle together and  touch  each 
    other  and ...  how do your reproductive organs conpare  with 
    those of the males of my species?"
          "EXTERNALLY  THEY  ARE SIMILAR IN SHAPE  AND  FUNCTION, 
    ALTHOUGH YOUR MALES SEEM TO ACHIEVE ERECTION MORE EASILY THAN 
    IS THE NORM FOR MEN OF MY CULTURAL MATRIX."
          "In  other  words,  intercourse is  possible,  but  not 
    babies."
          "YES, THAT IS TRUE."
          Mary  Jane giggled,  then said:  "You have no idea  how 
    that little fact  would make you so popular with the women of 
    my  society.   Project  me  an  image  of  you  without  your 
    clothes."
          There was a pause in which nothing happened.
          "Look,  Xan,  you've  been wacthing me in the nude  all 
    this time.  I want to see you."
          Roger's image appeared, sans clothes.
          Mary Jane giggled,  then said:  "I see that there is no 
    deficiency in your male member at the moment."
          "I  FIND  THAT CONVERSATION WITH YOU IS MORE THAN  JUST 
    INTELLECTUALLY STIMULATION."
          "Check  your  monitor.    How  is  my  pulse  rate  and 
    breathing doing?  The stimulation is reciprocal," she said as 
    she reached out for his hand.
          Her hand passed right through his.
          "Oh!"
          "THE IMAGE IS THREE DIMENTIONAL,  BUT NOT CORPOREAL."
          "Damn!   I  wanted to be able to touch you.   You  look 
    real enough to touch."
          "I  TOO  WISH  THAT  IT  WERE  POSSIBLE.    I  HAD  NOT 
    ANTICIPATED THE PAIN OF BEING ABLE TO SEE YOU,  BUT NOT BEING 
    ABLE TO TOUCH YOU. WHEN I WATCH YOU AND CARL ..."
          "You're jealous?"
          "I AM NOT JEALOUS!  I HAVE BECOME VERY FOND OF CARL AND 
    I  CERTAINLY DO NOT BEGRUDGE HIM THE PLEASURE OF  YOUR  BODY.  
    IT IS JUST THAT I LONG TO ENJOY THOSE PLEASURES MYSELF."
          "When this voyage is over it will be possible for us to 
    physically  get  together ...  I mean our atmospheres  aren't 
    mutually poisonous or anything?"
          "NO,  THEY  ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY  DISSIMILAR  TO  CAUSE 
    DISCOMFORT.   THERE  IS  MORE OXYGEN IN MINE,  BUT THAT  WILL 
    BE BENEFICIAL TO YOU."
          "Then why the impenetrable barrier between us?"
          "THIS SHIP IS CONSTRUCTED SO AS TO BE ABLE TO TRANSPORT 
    ANY LIFE FORM IRRESPECTIVE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ITS LIFE 
    SUSTAINING REQUIREMENTS AND OURS.    THE BARRIER IS TO ASSURE 
    THE  MUTUAL SAFETY OF BOTH SPECIES.   IT IS JUST A QUIRK THAT 
    IT IS UNNECESSARY IN THIS CASE."
          "As soon as we can, within the bounds of the decorum of 
    your culture,  why don't just the two of us go off  someplace 
    for  a  couple  of  cycles to get  ourselves  acquainted  ... 
    physically acquainted.  Would that be possible?
          "SEVERAL CYCLES OF DEBRIEFING,  TRANSFERING INFORMATION 
    FROM  THIS VESSEL TO THE MAIN STORAGE BANKS OF THE  UNIVERSAL 
    INTERGALACTIC   ENCYCLOPEDIA  OF   CULTURAL   MATRIXES,   AND 
    CEREMONIES  OF  WELCOME WILL BE REQUIRED,  BUT AFTER THAT  WE 
    COULD  WITHDRAW  TO MY AUNT'S VACATION VILLA WHICH  IS  IN  A 
    SPLENDIDLY ISOLATED, BUT SCENIC LOCATION."
          "Xan, you've got a date!"

          Both  Carl  and  Robert agreed with Mary Jane that  the 
    increase  in her level of physical attention to April  should 
    take  place  gradually.   Mary Jane was  concerned  that  any 
    sudden move on her part might startle or confuse April.  Carl 
    thought  that April could take any gesture from Mary Jane  in 
    stride,  but he conceded that caution couldn't hurt.   Over a 
    period  of several cycles,  Mary  Jane's increasingly  erotic 
    attention to April was readily greeted with reciprocity.
          One  afternoon the two women were lounging on the float 
    in  the middle of the pool.   April was resting on  her  side 
    beside Mary Jane who was on her back,  catnapping.  April was 
    watching  Carl working below the pool on a sketch of the  two 
    women  sitting  in bed together with their arms  around  each 
    other's sholders.
          "Wouldn't  it be nice to sometimes have the bed all  to 
    ourselves,  Mary Jane?   Sometimes Carl sleeps so restlessly, 
    but  you always sleep so calm.   Now that I am big,  the  bed 
    isn't  as large as it was before," April said,  ignoring  the 
    fact that the bed now held three people instead of two.
          "Ah.  make  Carl sleep on the cot," Mary Jane  dreamily 
    suggested from her half-sleep state.
          "But we don't have a cot ..."
          "All  the  worse  for  Carl,"  Mary  Jane  interrupted, 
    becoming more awake.
          "Besides,  it wouldn't be nice for Carl.  It's just ... 
    I  don't know.   Even asleep Carl is more strenuous than Mary 
    Jane,  and  when  Carl  is awake  ..."  April  laughed,  then 
    continued: "Carl is so excited, and Mary Jane is so calm with 
    me.   Maybe  it  is because I am so big with  the  baby,  but 
    sometimes  I think t would be nice if Carl was more calm  and 
    Mary Jane was more ... more ... well, less calm."
          "I'm not always so sedate," Mary Jane asserted.
          April  grinned and said:  "Sometimes when Mary Jane  is 
    with  Carl  in the pool it is hard to see who is  less  calm.  
    Sometimes Mary Jane is very uncalm."
          "You've seen us ... after that first time?"
          "Most of the times I am asleep when Carl and Mary  Jane 
    go  up  to  the pool,  but sometimes I am awake and  I  watch 
    through the curtains."
          "Oh."
          "I like to watch Carl and Mary Jane,  but most times it 
    is late and I fall asleep.  Why do you wait so long?"   April 
    paused and thought about this for a moment.  "Is it because I 
    am asleep?"
          "We  didn't  want to upset you with  our  love-making," 
    Mary Jane said,  smiled, then continued: "We didn't know that 
    you sometimes watched us."
          "Not  often.   Is it because Mary Jane thought I  would 
    become this jealous thing we talked about before?   How could 
    I be jealous of Mary Jane?  Aren't we like sisters?  Maybe it 
    is Carl I should be jealous of.   Some cycles he gets more of 
    Mary Jane's attention than I do."
          Mary Jane wrapped her arms around April's shoulders and 
    hugged her.   She said:  "Oh,  April, we are sisters.  Better 
    than sisters."
          "How better?"
          "We're  the best of friends and we love each other  ... 
    we  all  love each other."  Mary Jane  paused,  took  a  deep 
    breath,  then went on to explain the discussions she had with 
    Carl  and  Robert  concerning the  distribution  of  physical 
    attentions between Carl and the two women.
          April  passed  her hand down the front of  Mary  Jane's 
    body,  pausing for a moment at her delta of rich auburn hair. 
    "Mary  Jane very nice,  but Mary Jane like April,  not  Carl.  
    Have to make different love ...?"
          Mary Jane waited apprehensively for April to  continue.  
    Had she been wrong to broach the subject so frankly?    True, 
    April's  maturation had proceeded rapidly in he time that she 
    had known her,  but had this been too sudden?   Gazing at the 
    smiling face of April,  Mary Jane's apprehension faded.   No, 
    she knew that everything would work out fine.
          " I think ...  many things.  If Mary Jane and Carl want 
    to make waves in the pool,  they should not have to wait  for 
    me  to  be asleep.   If I want to touch all of Mary Jane  and 
    want Mary Jane to touch all of me,  Carl should not feel left 
    out  ...  Carl should not be left out.   And after  the  baby 
    comes,  after  I  am  small again,  we should all  make  love 
    together."
          "Oh,  yes,  yes,  it's going to be wonderful for all of 
    us,"  Mary Jane said.   For a brief instant she  wondered  if 
    they'd  be able to get Xan to make it a menage a  quatre, but 
    she was confident that he would fit in wonderfully too.
          "Now I am tired," April announced.   "I want to take my 
    nap snuggled with Mary Jane.  Let's sleep on the float on our 
    sides with the baby between us,"
          They  shifted to that position which proved to be  very 
    comfortable on the buoyant float.
          "Oh, this is very nice, Mary Jane said, draping her arm 
    around April.  "We're making a sandwich of your baby."
          "Our baby."
          "A baby with three parents."
          "And Robert makes four," April said with a giggle.
          "Oh, I love you, April."
          "I love us all."

                              *    *    *

          Mary  Jane,  having both stayed up later than usual the 
    previous night and gotten up earlier than usual this morning, 
    was refreshed by her additional afternoon hour's sleep.
          "Oh, that  was a very nice little nap ...  just what  I 
    needed.   It was sweet of you to invite me to join you," Mary 
    Jane said.
          "April sweet?" April asked in mock innocence.
          "Grrrrr.   Yes,  my  little bon-bon,  and I'm going  to 
    gobble you all up," Mary Jane teased as she playfully  gnawed 
    on April's shoulder.
          "Mary Jane sweet too?  April taste."
          "Mmmmmm. April's good."
          "Mary Jane good too.  April taste all over."

                              *    *    *

          Carl,  having finished his sketch, was on the mezzanine 
    reading  a  copy  of D.  H.  Lawrence's Women  In  Love.   He 
    chuckled  to  himself.   He  had just  finished  reading  the 
    chapter in which Gerald spends the night at  Halliday's.   It 
    was not Lawrence's prose which he found amusing, but the fact 
    that  Gerald's minx as named Minette.   Years ago Carl had  a 
    friend who was an aficinado of Lawrence and,  in fact,  wrote 
    his Ph.D. thesis on that British writer.  The startling thing 
    was  that his friend's wife was named Minette.   She was  the 
    only  person of that name Carl had ever known,  and until  he 
    had  encountered  it  in Lawrence,  he  had  always  wondered 
    exactly how it was spelt.   Carl closed his eyes and wondered 
    what ever happened to his friends,  Gene and Minette.  Had he 
    married  her  because of her Lawrencesque name,  or  was  she 
    perhaps  so  named by her parents from the character  in  the 
    book ....
          Carl's  reverie  was  interrupted  by the  sounds  from 
    above.   Mary  Jane  and  April were engaged in some kind  of 
    nestled  together,  light,  kittenish  playing  which  evoked 
    giggles from both women.
          "Mary  Jane,  what  are you doing to  my  woman?"  Carl 
    called out in a mock serious tone.
          "Your woman?  Our woman, don't you mean?"
          "'All for one, and one for all,' eh?"
          "I'm    no    Musketeer!"   Mary    Jane    proclaimed.  
    "Aristocratic pigs, off with their heads!"
          Carl laughed,  then said:  "Speaking of heads, what are 
    you two doing?"
          "We want to know if we all taste the same, or if one of 
    us is ... sweeter," April answered.
          "Ah,  perhaps  I  should  come up and  consult  in  the 
    matter."
          "No  thank you," Mary Jane said,  "this is just between 
    us women.  Besides, you're not likely to be an unbiased judge 
    in the matter."
          "I  will have to admit that you both taste very  sweet, 
    but I have been tasting April for longer than Mary Jane, so I 
    might be slightly tilted in her favor," Carl said.
          April giggled and patted her swollen belly.  "Carl  has 
    done a lot more than taste."
          "Very true,  but you also taste quite delicious.  Don"t 
    you think that April tastes very nice, Mary Jane?"
          "Let  me check," Mary Jane said,  then  buried her head 
    in  that  enchanted box canyon formed by April's  thighs  and 
    Mount Baby.
          April  squealed  with  delight as  Mary  Jane's  tongue 
    probed  amid the curled thicket.  Then there was a sharp yelp 
    of pain from April.
          "Mary  Jane!   What  the  hell  are  you  doing?"  Carl 
    shouted, more from concern than anything else.
          Mary Jane looked up, confused. "I ... I don't know."
          "Not Mary Jane," April said, reassuring her  companion, 
    "not Mary Jane.  Baby."
          "Baby?" Mary Jane and Carl said together.
          "What does the baby have to do with cunnilingus?"  Carl 
    asked.
          Robert  laughed.  "FATHER  ANXIETY  BEING PROJECTED  AS 
    OVERPROTECTIVENESS  TOWARDS  THE MOTHER.   MONITORS  INDICATE 
    THAT THE BIRTH PROCESS IS COMMENCING."
          "Hugh?" from Carl.
          April grinned.
          "Oh," said Mary Jane. "Oh! A contraction."
          After an initial moment of stunned inactivity, they all 
    sprung into action,  following the plans which had been  long 
    in preparation.   April was helped into bed,  propped up in a 
    comfortable position with pillows, and given lavish attention 
    from all sides.
          Under  Mary  Jane's  guidance,   with  Carl's   nervous 
    attention,  and  assisted by Robert's reassuring commentaries 
    from the sidelines,  April proceeded through the first  stage 
    of labor with ease.
          "Shouldn't  Robert  boil  water,  or  something,"  Carl 
    asked.
          Robert laughed,  then said:  "WITHIN THE TRADITIONS  OF 
    THE  CULTURAL  MATRIX  OF CARL,  THE PURPOSE OF THE  TASK  OF 
    BOILING LARGE QUANTITIES OF WATER IS TO GET THE MEN OUT  FROM 
    UNDERFOOT WHILE THE WOMEN ATTEND TO ASSISTING  AT  THE  BIRTH 
    PROCESS.  IT  IS TO TRANQUILIZE THE MEN BY MAKING THEM  THINK 
    THAT  THEY  ARE DOING SOMETHING USEFUL.   INTEGRATION OF  THE 
    SEXES AS FULL PARTICIPANTS IN THE BIRTH PROCESS IS ONE OF THE 
    IMPORTANT  PSYCHOLOGICAL  DEVELOPMENTS  IN  THE  PROCESS   OF 
    MATURATION  OF ANY CULTURAL MATRIX.  IT IS ONE OF THE FACTORS 
    WHICH LEADS TO THE SUPPRESSION OF GROUP AGGRESSION.   IN  THE 
    CULTURAL MATRIX OF CARL, THE FEMALE, SINCE SHE IS INVOLVED IN 
    THE  BIRTH PROCESS--THE CONTINUATION OF LIFE--IS UNLIKELY  TO 
    PARTICIPATE   IN  GROUP  AGGRESSION  ...   EXCEPT  WHEN  MALE 
    PROPAGANDA  OVERCOMES HER NATURAL TENDENCIES.   THERE ARE  NO 
    VERIFIABLE INSTANCES OF WARS BEING INITIATED BY WOMEN."
          "Perhaps  that  is only for lack of opportunity,"  Carl 
    ironically  suggested.   "Who knows what kind of  hell  these 
    women  could  unleash  if  they were put  in  charge  of  the 
    military."
          "Listen  to these two,  blathering political philosophy 
    like a pair of gossiping truck drivers," Mary Jane said  with 
    mock  contempt.   "Make  yourselves useful by  getting  us  a 
    short, cold drink of orange juice."
          Two glasses appeared in the air in front of Mary Jane.
          "Ah, thank you, Robert," she said, plucking the glasses 
    out  of the air and handing one to April.  "Someone is  being 
    useful around here at least."
          "And what about me?" Carl demanded.
          "Oh,  fathers  are entirely superfluous at this point," 
    Mary Jane said with a devilish grin.
          "No ...  not entirely," April asserted,  taking  Carl's 
    hand.
          Carl  kissed  her  on the  forehead.   "Thank  you,  my 
    sweet."
          "Oh!" April said, then smiled.  "Baby again."
          Robert  reported  that  the  contractions  were  .00833 
    cycles apart, that the cervix was less than half dilated, and 
    that birth was not imminent.
          "Does  anyone want to bet on the sex of the kid?"  Carl 
    asked.
          "ROBERT  WILL  COVER ALL  WAGERS,  EVEN  MONEY.  ROBERT 
    CONTERNDS THAT THE SEX OF THE CHILD WILL BE MALE."
          Carl   winked  at  Mary  Jane  and  said:   "He  sounds 
    confident, must have checked it out with the monitor."
          "THE  FETUS HAS BEEN MONITORED VERY CAREFULLY TO ASSURE 
    ITS  SAFETY AND FREEDOM FROM DEFECTS.   HOWEVER,  THE MONITOR 
    WAS NOT PROGRAMMED TO EXAMINE THE SEX OF THE CHILD SINCE THAT 
    IS NOT A HEALTH DETERMINANT."
          "But  what was it that W.  C.  Fields said about it not 
    being  a  game of chance the way he played it?   I  have  the 
    feeling that you know something that you're not telling us."
          "IT  IS  A  SIMPLE MATTER  OF  GENETICS.   THE  GENTEIC 
    PATTERN  OF CARL WAS USED IN THE REPLICATION OF THE  BODY  OF 
    APRIL,  EXCEPT  THAT  MINOR  CHANGES WERE MADE TO  YIELD  THE 
    FEMININITY OF APRIL.  SINCE BOTH PARENTS HAVE ESSENTIALLY THE 
    SAME  GENE  PATTERN--THE  PATTERN  OF  CARL--THE  CHILD  WILL 
    RECEIVE THAT ONE PATTERN TWICE.  THEREFORE IT IS LOGICAL THAT 
    THE CHILD WILL HAVE THE SEX OF ITS FATHER."
          "In that case, I withdraw my offer to make a bet," Carl 
    said.
          Mary  Jane  dragged a chair to  April's  bedside.   "We 
    might as well all get comfortable.  It's going to be awhile."               
          
                              *    *    *

          It was late evening,  and Mary Jane had just placed the 
    new-born infant on April's breast.   She kissed April on  the 
    cheek,  arose,  and  grinned  down on the smiling mother  and 
    child.  "Isn't she marvelous?"    
          "Yes, April is just grand," Carl agreed.
          "They both are."
          "Both ...?"  Carl examined the infant more closely than 
    he had done during the excitement of birth.  He laughed, then 
    said: "So they are!"
          "MY  CONGRATULATIONS TO THE NEW PARENTS.   YOU  HAVE  A 
    VERY FINE DAUGHTER."




                               EPILOGUE  

    IT IS THE FINDING OF THIS COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO THE FIRST 
    VOYAGE OF XANATHROPLASSE THE YOUNGER             

          THAT   Xanathroplasse   The  Younger  failed   in   the 
          accomplishment  of his mission to  collect,  transport, 
          and derive musical information from Specimen QR23, also 
          known as Mary Jane Galatea;

          THAT  Xanathroplasse  The Younger expended  147  energy 
          units  in  excess  of  that for which  his mission  was 
          budgeted;

          THAT  Xanathroplasse The Younger allowed a specimen  of 
          no  interest,  identified as Carl Edward  Chandler,  to 
          inadvertently stowaway in the transportation vessel and 
          subsequently   be  exposed  to developments of cultural 
          matrixes more advanced than his own;

          THAT Xanathroplasse The Younger,  without authorization 
          and in conspiracy with Carl Edward Chandler, engaged in 
          replication  experiments  which  lead directly  to  the 
          replication of two life forms,  Mary Jane  Galatea--not 
          the same Mary Jane Galatea as Specimen QR23--and April, 
          and  indirectly  lead to the creation of a  third  life 
          form,  identified  as Phoebe,  the natural offspring of 
          April and Carl Edward Chandler;

          THAT  Carl  Edward  Chandler  entered  the  vessel   of 
          Xanathroplasse The Younger without fraudulent intent.

    IT  IS  THE JUDGEMENT OF THIS COMMITTEE OF INQUERY  INTO  THE 
    FIRST VOYAGE OF XANATHROPLASSE THE YOUNGER

          THAT  Xanathroplasse  The  Younger shall be  fined  147 
          monitary units,  being the rate of 1 monitary unit  per 
          unit  of energy expended in excess of budgeted  levels, 
          except  that  75 monitary units shail be suspended  for 
          replicaion  information developed during the course  of 
          the  voyage  and further excepted shall be  1  monitary 
          unit per information unit placed in storage as a result 
          of efforts of Carl Edward Chandler, Mary Jane Galatea--
          not  the  same Mary Jane Galatea  as  Specimen  QR23--, 
          April,  and/or  Pheobe,  up  to  but not  exceeding  72 
          monitary units;

          THAT Xanathroplasse The Younger shall be ineligible for 
          participating    in  any  voyage  of   collection   and 
          transportation for a period of 425 cycles;

          THAT  Xanathroplasse  The Younger shall be assigned  to 
          the  position  of  watch  and  ward  for  Carl   Edward 
          Chandler,  Mary  Jane  Galatea--not the same Mary  Jane 
          Galatea  as Specimen QR23--, April, and Phoebe for  the 
          duration of their visit.

          THAT  any monitary or other agreements entered into  by 
          Xanathroplasse  The Younger and Carl  Edward  Chandler, 
          Mary  Jane Galatea--not the same Mary Jane  Galatea  as 
          Specimen QR23--, April and/or Phoebe shall be  declared 
          null  and  void,  except  that  the  agreement  between 
          Xanathroplasse  The  Younger and Carl  Edward  Chandler 
          concerning  the  acceptance of full responsibility  for 
          April  by Carl Edward Chandler shall binding  and  that 
          the  responsibility for Phoebe shall be shared by  Carl 
          Edward  Chandler  and  April  as a  corollary  to  that 
          agreement,  and  further  excepting that  the  artistic 
          artifacts made by Carl Edward Chandler,  including  but 
          not  limited  to cellulose  based  bowls  and  plumbago 
          sketches,  for  which 1 monitary unit shall be  granted 
          per unit of information;

          THAT   Xanathroplasse  The  Younger  and  Carl   Edward 
          Chandler share equally the responsibility for Mary Jane 
          Galatea--not  the  same Mary Jane Galatea  as  Specimen 
          QR23--,  except  that Mary Jane Galatea--not  the  same 
          Mary  Jane  Galatea as Specimen QR23--has  reached  the 
          stage  of responsible adulthood and is therefore  self-
          responsible   and   shall   be   so   adjudged   unless 
          incapacitated  so  as to become a ward of  society,  in 
          which case the responsibility shall revert back equally 
          to Xanathroplasse The Younger and Carl Edward Chandler;

          THAT  Carl Edward Chandler is not guilty  of  violating 
          any   Regulation   and   therefore  absolved   of   any 
          responsibility  which might arise out  his  association 
          with  Xanathroplasse  The  Younger except as  noted  in 
          these  findings  and  judgements of  the  Committee  of 
          Inquiry  into  the First Voyage of  Xanathroplasse  The 
          Younger.

          THAT  Carl Edward Chandler,  Mary Jane Galatea--not the 
          same Mary Jane Galatea as Specimen QR23--,  April,  and 
          Phoebe be granted visitors' status for a period not  to 
          exceed  426  cycles,   but  that  they,  singularly  or 
          collectively,  may  not  claim monitary credit for  any 
          information   which  might  accrue  to  the   Universal 
          Intergalactic  Encyclopedia  of Cultural Marixes  as  a 
          result  of  their  visit and may  not  exceed  personal 
          expenditures  in excess of the stipend to  subsequently 
          be   determined  by  the  Committee  of   Housing   and 
          Hospitality for Visting Aliens except as noted in these 
          findings  and  judgements of the Committee  of  Inquiry 
          into the First Voyage of Xanathroplasse The Younger;

          as Specimen QR23--shall be granted 1 monitary unit  per 
          unit  of musical informaton recorded subsequent to  the 
          termination  of the First Voyage of Xanathroplasse  The 
          Younger;

          THAT the expenses involved in the return of Carl Edward 
          Chandler,  Mary  Jane  Galatea--not the same Mary  Jane 
          Galatea as Specimen QR23--,  April and Phoebe to  their 
          own cultural matrix be entirely borne by Xanathroplasse 
          The Younger;

          THAT  the matter of the possible violation of the  non-

SUMMARY OF ABRIDGED CHAPTERS:

     Carl's new toilet arrives, a 1904 water closet.  Maneuvering 
of the cube continues.

     Carl discovers that the walls are suitable for drawing,  and 
he  sketches the scene of his discovery of the cube.   He wonders 
why he is so calm about this situation--it doesn't fit any of the 
"I was kidnapped by a flying saucer" stories he ever read.

     Carl dreams about his girl friend,  Sally.  In the dream she 
is  dressed  as  the Maid of Leather,  and she  attacks  him  for 
abandoning her.   Upon awakening, he does a sketch of Sally as he 
remembers her from the dream.

          "MONITOR  IS IN ALL-PHASE RECORD MODE.   STOWAWAY  WILL 
    IDENTIFY HIMSELF."
          Carl  had  just  received  his  requested  after-dinner 
    brandy  in  the form of an empty crystal snifter and  a  full 
    bottle of St.  Remy.   He would have been more than satisfied 
    with  a  small  glass  of Jenkins,  but he  wasn't  about  to 
    complain,  or  send  the bottle back into the molecular  soup 
    from which it came.
          "Would  a  person  from your culture be offended  if  I 
    drank some of this very fine brandy during our conversation?"
          "COMMUNICATIONS PERMITTED DURING AND SUBSEQUENT TO  THE

    been talking to a computer?"
          "ALL TRANSLATIONS ARE MADE BY AND PASS THROUGH CULTURAL 
    STORAGE,  ANALYSIS,  AND  RESEARCH COMPUTERS.   AFFIRMITVE ON

    COMPUTER."
          "What  I am doing is speaking through a computer  to  a 
    real, live creature?"
          "AFFIRMATIVE."
          "Can  I  invite  you to share some  of  this  excellent 
    brandy?"
          "MASS   TANSFERENCE   BETWEEN  SPECIMEN   CHAMBER   AND 
    MANEUVERING   CHAMBER  NOT  POSSIBLE  UNTIL  TERMINATION   OF

          "In other words, you can see me, but I can't see you."
         "SPECIMEN  CHAMBER NOT EQUIPPED TO MONITOR  MANEUVERING 
    CHAMBER."
          "Specimen chamber? ... More like a specimen bottle ..."

    WITHIN CONTEXT OF TERM'S USE.  DOES SPECIMEN PREFER REFERENCE 
    CHANGED TO BOTTLE TERM IN SUBSEQUENT USE?"
          Carl  could see that,  in spite of his many  levels  of 
    language  translation,  his host couldn't comprehend a simple 
    pun.  Or perhaps it was that he didn't have a sense of humor. 
    "No, 'chamber' is fine.  Continue using that term, please."
          "IS    SPECIMEN    READY    TO    BEGIN    INTRODUCTORY 
    COMMUNICATIONS?"
          Carl took another sip of brandy. "Sure."
          "STOWAWAY WILL IDENTIFY HIMSELF FOR RECORDING MONITORS, 
    PLEASE."
          "Who   am  I?    Carl  Chandler,   formerly--apparently 
    fomerly--of Cape Neddick, Maine."
          "SPECIMEN   CARL   CHANDLER  WILL   GIVE   BIOGRAPHICAL 
    SUMMARY."
          "Biographical  summary?   Born Carl Edward Chandler  to 
    Caroline Mayberry Chandler and Edward Mann Chandler, June 16, 
    1955, Boston Massachusetts.  He was a happy, untroubled boy, 
    given  only  to occasional fits of stubborness  according  to 
    relatives' reports which may or may not be accurate.  Chandler 
    began  his  education in Miss  Karymer's  kindergarten  where 
    stubborness was not tolerated.   An uneasy truce was effected 
    between  Chandler and the educational system by Grade  Three, 
    but  violaions by both sides persisted throughout Chandler's 
    school  days.   Nevertheless,  Chandler did benefit from  his 
    sojourn  in  academia.   It brought him to  the  position  of 
    salutatorian  in l972.   Four years later he graduated magnum 
    cum laude with a degree in art history from the University of 
    Massahusetts."
          Carl took another sip of brandy.   "One quirk might  be 
    Chandler's failure to mention that degree to his lady friend, 
    Sally  MacPherson  who has a degree in art herself.   Was  it 
    insecurity?   Did the fact that he had never used that degree 
    in  any utilitarian way have something to do  with  it?   Ah, 
    well,  I  digress  from  the  point,  which  is  biographical 
    summation.   After  graduating from college,  Chandler took a 
    job  with a school district which was looking for  a  bizarre 
    hybrid to teach half-time Art,  half-time U.S.  History,  and 
    coach girl's softball.   They thought that Chandler, with his 
    Art History degree,  his minor in American History, his dozen 
    and  a  half  credits  in the field  of  Education,  and  his 
    experience  with  college  baseball--mostly  playing   bench-
    warmer,  although  he didn't mention this fact to the  hiring 
    committee--made him the ideal man for the job.  He thought so 
    too.   It didn't take long for each to disabuse themselves of 
    this  notion.   Why  did  Chandler  think  that  transferring 
    himself  from one side of the podium to the other would  make 
    any  difference?   Shouldn't his seventeen years of schooling 
    taught  him  at least that?   Shouldn't he  have  known  that 
    education  was the least important part of schooling--woe  to 
    any teacher who thought he was there to teach something.  But 
    young,   foolish  Chandler  thought  that  he  could  make  a 
    difference,  that  he could have classes where students could 
    actually learn something.  Well, perhaps he did make a little 
    difference  to  a few students,  but it wasn't  enough  of  a 
    difference to satisfy him.   He made enough difference to the 
    schoolboard,  however,  that his contract was not renewed for 
    the following year." 
          Carl   poured  himself  another  glass  of  brandy  and 
    continued.    "Chandler   drifted  for  awhile,   until   his 
    meanderings  chanced  to bring him in contact  with  a  small 
    playhouse   that   was  in  need  of  a   jack-of-all-trades.  
    Fortunately  acting was not one of the trades  required,  for 
    Chandler had no talent along those lines.   He painted flats, 
    erected stages,  ushered,  sold tickets, operated the lights, 
    swept  the floors,  drew the posters,  wrote the  advertising 
    brochures,  and did whatever was required to get the show on, 
    including,  on two occasions,  sewing costumes.   For several 
    years  he  was  constantly  busy,   frequently   happy,   and 
    occasionally  broke.  The playhouse rarely made a profit  and 
    finally  was forced to shut down.   Chandler decided what  he 
    needed to do next was to make some money.   With a braiseness 
    that  he  would  not  have been able  to  muster  before  his 
    association   with  actors   and--especially--actresses,   he 
    parlayed  his small advertising experience into a well-paying 
    copy  writing  position  for  a  large,  mail-order  hardware 
    company.  He was a surprising success, for writing skills had 
    so degenerated in the country that his modest efforts  seemed 
    to be prodigious accomplishments in comparison with others in 
    that  trade.   Chandler  wasn't fooled,  but he confined  his 
    laughter to his sleeve all the way to the  bank.   Chandler's 
    pitiful  finances  began to blossom,  and so  encouraged,  he 
    began to play the corporate game,  or at least dress for  the 
    part.  This seemed to bring him even more financial success--
    bonuses--even  though an objective observer wouldn't be  able 
    to detect any improvement in his writing.  Perhaps Chandler's 
    association  with  the  actors and actresses rubbed  some  of 
    their talent onto him.   About this time he began to date one 
    Sally MacPherson.  He discovered that with her he could leave 
    off the corporate mask on weekends and pick it up on  Monday, 
    for  she,  in her own way,  was doing the same thing.   Sally 
    drew the illustrations for the company catalog,  but her real 
    ambitions  lay in the realm of painting--a notoriously  poor-
    paying   endeavor.    Sally   considered   her   nine-to-five 
    illustration  work  as a subsidy for her painting  which  was 
    judiciously  pursued from seven to eleven nightly and  during 
    entire  alternate  weekends.  In  spite  of  Chandler's  best 
    efforts, she doggedly kept to her rigid schedule." 
          Carl  added  another splash of brandy to the bottom  of 
    his glass.   "But this is Carl Chandler's story that you  are 
    interested in,  not Sally MacPherson's.   So, when in keeping 
    with  her self-imposed schedule,  Sally refused to take a day 
    off  to accompany Chandler on an excursion into the  interior 
    wilds of Maine, in spite of the fact that ... but, anyway ... 
    Chandler's story concludes with him sallying of by himself to 
    get away from the craziness of the office and,  in the course 
    of  that excursion,  stumbling across a  strange  cube-shaped 
    monolith into which he enters and disappears.   End of story.  
    And  now what of you,  my friend?   Does your cultural matrix 
    allow for reciprocity in introductory communications?"
          "STATEMENT  OF FACTS REGARDING ERROR ALLOWING  STOWAWAY 
    TO  ENTER  SPECIMEN CHAMBER ALREADY  ISSUED.   DOES  SPECIMEN 
    REQUIRE  SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REGARDING RELATIONSHIP WITH 
    SPECIMEN?"
          "A  few simple questions:  who are you,  what  are  you 
    trying  to  do,  why  were you going to transport  this  QR23 
    woman, where were you going with her, and what were you going 
    to do when you got there?  Likewise, what are you going to do 
    with  me  when you get whereever it is that  you  are  going.  
    Finally, where are we going, and how long will it take to get 
    there?  As I said, a few simple questions."
          "MY   NAME   IS  NOT  TRANSLATEABLE  TO  AN   ANALOGOUS 
    CONTEXTUAL SOUND IN YOUR LANGUAGE."
          "But  I  have  to call  you  something  ...  anything." 
    Several  obscene  words flashed through Carl's mind,  but  he 
    didn't want to alienate his host/captor until he knew exactly 
    where  he  stood.   Survival of this  unknown  might  require 
    maintenance  of  at least the appearance of being a  creature 
    capable  of  ingratiating  himself  into the good graces of a 
    horrible despot.   He wasn't about to discard that pawn until 
    he  knew  what he was giving up in the  process.   "Call  you 
    Ishmael ...  Call you Smitty.   Call you Melmoth ... Call you 
    ...  Robert, or Bob for short.  Do you have any objections to 
    taking the name Robert?"
      "SATISFACTORY.   TRANSLATOR  WILL RECOGNIZE THE NAME ROBERT 
    AND/OR BOB.   CONTINUING WITH YOUR QUESTIONS: ALREADY STATED:

    CYCLES."
          "You mean that I'm going to be locked up in this box for 
    more than a year?"
          "VOYAGE SCHEDULED TO TAKE 410 1/2 CYCLES."
          "Did this specimen QR23 know that the voyage was to  be 
    so long?"
          "MAR  ...   SPECIMEN  QR23  INFORMED  OF  THE  DURATION 
    COMPONENT."
          "No wonder she escaped.   You could rob a bank and  get 
    less time than that ...  if you had a good lawyer.   I wonder 
    what F. Lee Bailey would charge for an interplanetary writ of 
    habeas corpus."
          "YOUR LEGAL PARAMETERS HAVE NO STATUS BEYOND THE LIMITS 
    OF YOUR CULTURAL MATRIX."
          "Oh,  so  true.   Sometimes they don't even have status 
    within the culture unless you have sufficient money.  Anyway, 
    a moot point."
          "DOES SPECIMEN CARL EDWARD CHANDLER HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL 
    QUESTIONS?"
          "Oh, millions!"
          "MILLIONS?  PLACE QUESTIONS IN ORDER OF PRIMACY."
          "I guess that my biggest question is what I am going to 
    do for the next thirteen or so months.   Solitary confinement 
    for  that  stretch  of time would  be  considered  cruel  and 
    unuasual punishment in anybody's culture."
          "FALSE  ASSUMPTION.   IN THE LOLOAN CULTURE,  WHICH HAS 
    ONE  OF  THE  HIGHEST  POPULATION  DENSITIES  IN  THE   KNOWN

    CONSIDERED A STATE OF EXTREME ECSTASY."
          "I'll  revise  my statement.   Anyone from  my  culture 
    would consider it to be a horrible sentence."
          "DURATION   OF   VOYAGE   UNALTERABLE   ONCE    INITIAL

          "What did she do to deserve such a horrible fate?"

          "I'm not sure that I understand that.  Do you mean that 
    you were going to pick every scrap of her brain?"
          After   a  pause:   "SPECIMEN  QR23  NOT  SUBJECT   FOR 
    COMMUNICATION."
          Carl laughed.
          "But  you're the one who keeps bringing her up.   Sure, 
    I'm curious.   After all,  this whole caper was designed  for 
    her benefit ...  or for her detriment,  or for her something.  
    I have the feeling that you would like nothing better than to 
    talk  about specimen QR23,  but I know nothing about her,  so 
    can tell you nothing."
          "SPECIMEN QR23 NOT SUBJECT FOR COMMUNICATON."
          Carl smiled.  He thought that by biding his time Robert 
    would  eventually  tell him all about specimen  QR23  because 
    Robert was preoccupied with her.
          "Okay,  forget about specimen QR23.  What are you going 
    to do about me for the next thirteen months?"
          "NO CONTINGENCY PLANS EXIST FOR TREATMENT OF STOWAWAYS.

          "Woah  there!   I have the feeling that you could go on

SUMMARY OF ABRIDGED CHAPTERS:

     Carl  gives a series of art history lectures,  including one 
about  Aphrodisisa in what is now Turkey.   Comments on  art  and 
religion spice the discussion.

     Carl had always wanted to take up woodworking.  He now tries 
his  hand at lathe work.   It turns out that hand made  articles, 
such  as  lathe  turned bowls,  are  highly  prized  in  Robert's 
culture.

     Carl  discovers  that  Specimen QR23 is a  woman  songwriter 
named Mary, but Robert refuses to discuss her.

          For  a  time  Carl  wavered between  a  career--if  one 
    accepts the idea that one's academic major has some relevance 
    to  what  one's career field might eventually be--in art  and 
    one in architecture.   Art,  of course, won out, but the road 
    not taken, architecture, still had a fascination for him.  In 
    fact, there were times when he couldn't figure out why he had 
    gravatated  towards art.   When he paused to think about  the 
    question,  he  remembered:  that  redhead  who  was  studying 
    painting  during  his  sophomore  year  when  he  was  mostly 
    studying her.   What ever happened to her?   How long ago  it 
    seems.
          There  was  one particular week that was seen from  his 
    perspective  as  a student as pure heaven.   They  cut  their 
    classes  on a Thursday and Friday to give themselves  a  long 
    weekend  to  go to New York City to take in a showing of  the 
    girl's  aunt's  art work.   They stayed,  snuggled  in  their 
    sleeping  bags,  at the aunt's apatment,  but it was  a  rare 
    evening if they got to sleep before three in the morning, for 
    the apartment always seemed to be full of everchanging crouds 
    of artists,  poets, critics, hangers-on, and undefined people 
    who  fluttered  in  the moth-light of Mary  Abraham's  Photo-
    Abstractionist  showing.   The  great  controversy,  as  Carl 
    recalled,  was  if  Mary's  paintings were a  return  to  the 
    realist mode of art,  or if they were a new facet of abstract 
    expressionism.    Carl   had   been   a   partisan   of   the 
    abstractonists,   whereas  his  girl  friend  supported   the 
    realists  without  asserting any validity for the  return-to-
    the-old-school idea.   She claimed that it was a new kind  of 
    realism.    The   artist  herself  remained  aloof  from  the 
    argument, claiming that her job was to paint, not to play the 
    role of critic.   "Too many critics and not enough  artists," 
    she had said.   Over the weekend several people had attempted 
    to  draw  her into discussions of the "meaning" of her  work, 
    but  she always declined to participate.   Carl  himself  had 
    almost  succeeded  in  drawing her in by asserting  that  the 
    artist had an obligation to be an articulate advocate of  art 
    to ameloriate the misconceptions that ere held by the public.  
    She  agreed  that the artist shouldn't remain aloof from  the 
    masses,  but then went on to claim that the artist must  make 
    her  statement  at the appropiate time and on the  appropiate 
    occasion and that the time and occasion was not yet right for 
    her.
          The  New York trip succeeded in drawing Carl deep  into 
    the art world and away from his architectural interests.  The 
    girl  dropped out of school the following year,  but by  then 
    Carl  was commited to his art studies.   Now the  archiecture 
    was returning.
          Although  Carl was not a strict adherant to  the  "form 
    follows  function" dictum,  he did admire the works of  Frank 
    Lloyd  Wright,  especially Fallingwater.   What particularily 
    intrigued Carl was the ambiguity of the exterior/interiorness 
    of  the  building.    Carl  also  admired  those   stubbornly 
    independent  spirits,  Helen and Scott Nearing,  whose  stone 
    house constructon techniques were so well suited to rocky New 
    England.*   He  had  the idea that it might  be  possible  to 
    combine the masonry technques of the Nearings with the design 
    principles of Wright.
          He  sat  down  with his sketch pad and  began  to  make 
    architectural  doodles.   He started with a large window on a 
    south wall because he knew that he would want to have bright, 
    sunny  rooms.    After  several  hours  of  tiral  and  error 
    sketching,  he  completed  his first design for  the  Wright-
    Nearing House.

          Carl's lectures grew perfunctory.  He suspected that he 
    was boring Robert as much as he was boring himself,  but that 
    his  host  was  too  genteel to  complain.   Or  perhaps  the 
    lectures were recorded on automatic,  and Robert himself  had 
    long  ago given up attending the daily monologue.   More  and 
    more  frequently--whether  by  Robert  or  by  the  automatic 
    translator,  Carl  didn't know--the lectures were interrupted 
    by: "SUBJECT MATTER WAS DISCUSSED ON PREVIOUS OCCASION.  DOES 
    CARL INTEND TO ELABORATE ON ALREADY RECORDED MATERIAL?"  Carl 
    would usually respond by changing the subject.   He long  ago 
    has exhausted the subjects that interested him.
          When  his  lecture had been interrupted for  the  third 
    time in fifteen minutes,  Carl burst out with: "The hell with 
    it!   School's out!  Class dismissed!  I have nothing more to 
    say  on any art subject."  He got out of his chair and  began 
    pacing the perimeter of the cube.
          After  a few minutes: "MONITORS INDICATE  PHYSIOLOGICAL 
    CHANGE.   HEART  AND RESPATORY SYSTEMS INCREASE NOTED.   DOES 
    CONDITION INDICATE ONSET OF EMERGENCY CONDITION?"
          "Emergency?   What emergency?  For you perhaps.  You've 
    picked  my brain clean.   I've given up every last art  fact, 
    opinion, and hypothesis.  There's nothing left."
          "INFORMATION AMOUNT RECORDED SATISFACTORY.  STATEMENT OF 
    OBSERVATION:  THE  ACCOUNT  OF CARL  HAS  SUFFICIENT  CREDITS 
    ACCUMULATED  TO  PROVIDE CLIMATIC AND FOOD  REQUIREMENTS  FOR 
    DURATION OF VOYAGE."
          "In  other words,  I could live off my savings for  the 
    next year."
          "AFFIRMATIVE,  PROVIDED  THAT  LUXURY REPLICATIONS  ARE 
    MADE  ONLY  IN  MODERATION.   CONTINUED  ACCRUAL  OF  CREDITS 
    THROUGH  ARTIFACT  INFORMATION  POSSIBLE.   ONLY  REPLICATION 
    REQUIRING  LARGE  ENERGY MASS WOULD RESULT  IN  DEPLETION  OF 
    CREDIT BALANCE PRIOR TO TERMINATION OF VOYAGE."
          "Fine,  fine," Carl said, dismissing the subject with a 
    wave of his hand.
          The   fact  was  that  Carl's  creative  energies  were 
    exhausted.   His woodworking desire had been satiated, he was 
    no longer interested in architecture--you could only build so 
    many castles in the sky,  and Carl already had a drawer  full 
    of  achitectural designs--,  his drawing lacked  inspiration, 
    and  his desire to read,  in spite of the enormous variety of 
    material  at hand in Robert's  storage  level,  waned.   Carl 
    filled his brandy snifter and continued pacing the cube.
          "INTERPRETATION  OF MONITORS INDICATE THAT CONDITION OF 
    EMERGENCY   OF   PSYCHOLOGICAL   NATURE   POSSIBLY   PRESENT.  
    CONFIRMATION OF DIAGNOSIS REQUESTED."
          "'Emergency of psychological nature possibly  present?'  
    That's  a  nice  euphemistic way of putting  it.   Don't  you 
    people ever get bored?"
          "CONDITION  OF BOREDOM NOT POSSIBLE WHEN LARGE  AMOUNTS 
    OF  NEW INFORMATION IS PRESENT FOR ANALYSIS AND  EXAMINATION.  
    ANALOGOUS SITUATION ONLY POSSIBLE WITHIN THE CULTURAL  MATRIX 
    OF   ROBERT   WHEN  INFORMATION  DEPREVATION  COEXISTS   WITH 
    CONDITION  OF  INACTIVITY.   INVESTIGATION  OF  NEW  AREA  OF 
    KNOWLEDGE SUGGESTED."
          "I'm stuffed to the gills with new knowledge.   I  read 
    more  books  in  the last two months than I did in  all  four 
    years of college,  and I was considered to be an avid  reader 
    then."
          "DIVERSION  THROUGH  PARTICIPATION  IN GAME  OF  CHANCE 
    SUGGESTED."
          Carl's laugh had a harsh edge to it.
          "Teaching  you to play poker may have been  a  mistake.  
    Infatuation  with  random  chance  may be  addicting  to  you 
    information-gathering cultural matrix types.  It affects some 
    human  beings that way too,  but I am not one  of  them.   An 
    infrequent evening of small-stakes cards is enough to satisfy 
    my minute gambler's craving,  and we have already had several 
    sessions this week.  Thanks, but no thanks."
          "CHESS?"
          Carl waved off this idea with his hand.   He was beside 
    his work table where there was a pile of books and magazines.  
    He  accidently  knocked over a pile of magazines and  one  of 
    them fell open at the center.  He picked it up.
          "There!   That's  what I need!   Replicate me  a  'Miss 
    April,.'"  he  said,   holding  out  the  centerfold  of  the 
    voluptuous, nude woman for Robert's inspection.
          There  was  a  long  silence,   then:  "REPLICATION  OF 
    HUMANOIDS  WITHIN  THE  REALM  OF  THEORY.   REPLICATION  NOT 
    PREVIOUSLY ATTEMPTED DUE TO ABUNDANCE OF ORIGINAL ITEMS ..."
          "There  isn't an abundance of supply here," Carl  said, 
    interrupting.
          "...  AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE AND 
    SEQUENTIAL NATURE OF THE CHEMICAL SUB-ASSEMBLIES."
          "In practical words, it can't be done."
          "PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT EXTENSIVE RESEARCH 
    ON  INFORMATION  STORAGE  NECESSARY  TO  DEVELOP  REPLICATION 
    TECHNIQUE FOR HUMANOIDS.  BOTH RESEARCH AND REPLICATION WOULD 
    INVOLVE  EXTENSIVE  UTILIZING  OF  ENERGY  SUPPLIES.   FEMALE 
    HUMANOIDS  CONTAIN SUB-ASSEMBLIES OF CONSIDERABLE  COMPLEXITY 
    DUE  TO REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTIONS.   SUGGEST THAT MALE  HUMANOID 
    REPLICATION BE CONSIDERED,  BEING SIMPLER AND INVOLVING LOWER 
    LEVELS OF ENERGY USE."
          "Oh,  a male humanoid would be of no use to me at  all.  
    I  am one hundred percent heterosexual.   Boys don't interest 
    me.  No, it's Miss April that is required."
          "REPLICATION   OF   FEMALE   HUMANOID   CLASSIFIED   AS 
    OUTRAGEOUS LUXURY, CHARGEABLE AT THE RATE OF 2 MONITARY UNITS 
    PER ENERGY UNIT."
          Carl looked down at the centerfold. "Ah, but Miss April 
    would be cheap at twice the price, don't you think?"
          "INITIAL   EXAMINATION  OF  SITUATION  INDICATES   THAT 
    REPLICATION  OF FEMALE HUMANOID WOULD DEPLETE THE BALANCE  OF 
    THE MONITARY CREDITS OF CARL BY A FACTOR OF 110 PERCENT."
          "All my poker winnings and everything, eh?"
          "REPLICATION   WOULD  EXCEED  PRESENT  BALANCE  BY   10 
    PERCENT."
          "I have always been a cash buyer,  but this may be  the 
    exception that proves the rule.  Do you extend credit?"
          "CONDITION    OF   DEFAULT   UNLIKELY   UNDER   PRESENT 
    CONDITIONS."
          "Okay, then do it. Replicate me Miss April."
          "STATEMENT  OF CAUTION REQUIRED REGARDING WISDOM OF NOT 
    ACTING IN HASTE."
          "Ah,  yes,  caution.    Well,  if I acted cautiously, I 
    wouldn't  be  in  this mess,  and if  you  acted  cautiously, 
    specimen  QR23 would never have escaped.   So there you  have 
    the  results of caution."  Carl took a gulp from  his  brandy 
    snifter.  "I'm  putting in my requisition:  replicate me Miss 
    April, a fully functioning female human being."
          "FULFILLMENT  OF  REQUEST  FOR  REPLICATON  OF  FEMALE 
    HUMANOID IN THE FORM OF MISS APRIL SUSPENDED PENDING COMPLETE 
    ANALYSIS OF FEASIBILITY.   REPORT ON SITUATION TO COMMENCE IN 
    1/4  CYCLE,  WITH  DECISION ON REPLICATION TO BE  MADE  AFTER 
    DISCUSSION OF ANALYSIS."
          "Do what you will.   Miss April is what I need.  In the 
    meantime,  however,  I  will studiously apply myself to  this 
    bottle of very fine brandy."
                              
                              *    *    *

          Robert returned early in the morning.
          "INITIAL  ANALYSIS  OF REPLICATION OF  FEMALE  HUMANOID

          "In  other words,  you don't know quite how to put  the

          "Of course not.  If a thing is worth doing, it is worth

    that  you can accomplish this feat,  then by all means do  it

          "If I have to ask the price,  I can't afford  it.   But

          "Getting more and more expensive all the time.   I once

    INFORMATION CREDITS YIELDS BALANCED BALANCE."
          Carl laughed.
          "Lad,  I  like  the way you do business.   What  you're 
    saying  is  that you'll take all  my  money,  poker  winnings 
    included, and give me Miss April."

    replication trick--a little anxiety,  yes,  boredom,  no.   I 
    mean, look at her!" Carl held out the magazine that contained 
    the  pictoral article on Miss April and flipped  through  the 
    half-dozen pages of photographs.   "Who in the world could be

          "Let's see,  how about a copy of War and Peace and,  as

          All  the  items winked in,  including  six  bottles  of 
    brandy.   The  food  was  in puffy foil packets  with  each's 
    contents  depicted on the outside,  and the coffee was  in  a 
    silver globe with a small spigot in its side.  The brandy was 
    in regular glass bottles.  Carl picked up one of the bottles.

          Carl's   assessment  of  the  boredom  factor  was  not 
    accurate.   His condition was much worse than it was  before.  
    Now  he didn't even have enough light by which to  read,  and 
    the freezing temperatures made anything else impractical.  By 
    the fifth day he took to harmonica playing and drinking,  the 
    latter of which did nothing for the former.
          On  the sixth day he gave up harmonica playing entirely 
    to concentrate on the study of brandy.  He was sitting at the 
    table  cube with the down comforter wrapped around him and  a 
    nearly empty bottle before him when the room's light returned 
    to  its normal brightness.   The shielded his eyes  with  his 
    hands and squinted out between his fingers.
          "Hey, man, iz that you, Robert?"
          "AFFIRMATIVE.     THE   EXPECTATIONS   OF   CARL   WERE 
    OTHERWISE?"
          "Oooh, what time is it?  What day is it?"
          "IT  IS 7/8THS OF A CYCLE INTO THE 6TH CYCLE SUBSEQUENT 
    TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE REPLICATION PROJECT."
          "Replication project?  Oh, yeah, Miz April. Do we drink 
    to success, or to drown the sorrows of bitter defeat?"
          "MONITORS   INDICATE   THAT  THE  CONDITION   OF   CARL 
    CORRESPONDS  TO THAT OF EXCESS CONSUMPTION OF  ALCOHOL  LACED 
    LIQUIDS."
          "'I"ve  been drunk before,  but this is a masterpiece.'  
    But forget about my condition, what about Mzz April?"
          "PROCEDURE  FOR REPLICATION OF HUMANOID CREATURE OF THE 
    FEMALE  TYPE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND ENTERED INTO THE  MEMORY 
    OF THE REPLICATOR.  DOES CARL WISH THAT SUCH A REPLICATION BE 
    INITIATED?"
          "That was the whole idea,  my unseen  friend.   Deliver 
    the merchandise to yond bed."
          Carl's  bed,  a  draped and canopied  four-poster  with 
    which he created the illusion of darkness,  was in  disarray; 
    he  had the comforter draped across his sholders and the rest 
    of the bedding was half on the matress and half on the floor.  
    The drapes were drawn back irregularly.
          Miss April winked onto the bed.
          Carl sat gape-frozen for a full minute,  then said: "My 
    con-grad-you-lay-tons.   It seems that yuv' done a fine job a 
    becomin'  god."  He  raised  his glass  and  drank  down  its 
    contents  in  salute.  "I'll go an introduce  maself  ta  Miz 
    April."
          Carl  got to his feet,  but had to steady himself for a 
    minute by holding on the the edge of the table cube.  "Mus be 
    'sperencin' sum turb'lence,  eh, R'bert?  Yer ship seem a bit 
    unstable.   Well,  any  port in-er storm." He lurched  foward 
    dragging   the  comforter  behind  him  like  some  kind   of 
    serpentine tail.
          Miss  April  did not respond to his  introduction,  but 
    just stared up at him with wide eyes. 
          "I 'pollogize fer ma inebriated condtition,  'mam.  You 
    were 'spected,  a-course, but ah had no idea when, an' ah had 
    a long wait."
          Just wide-eyed silence from Miss April.
          "Yer  ...  yer skin ...  goose bumps?" He  touched  her 
    shoulder. "Yer cold!  A-corse, the temperature."  Carl picked 
    the  sheets  and blankets off the floor and spread them  over 
    Miss April.  "Better?"
          Those blues stared in silence.
          "Mind if ah join ya?"
          Silence.
          Like  a  fisherman  casting a  net,  Carl  whirled  the 
    comforter  in the air and dropped it over the  supine  girl's 
    body.   Then  he awkwardly threw off his  clothes,  stumbling 
    twice  against the bed in the process before managing to  get 
    himself in.
          "Yer still cold.  R'bert! What 'bout da temperature?"
          "CLIMATIC  CONDITIONS WILL RETURN TO PREVIOUS  SETTINGS 
    IN .11 CYCLES."
          "Good!   Ah. Mz April, let me give ya a message to warm 
    ya up."
          Under  the  covers Carl began to message  Miss  April's 
    shoulders,  the work slowly towards her thighs,  then back up 
    to her breasts.
          "Oh,  baby,  ya feel sooo good.  An yer startin ta warm 
    up.   We're under this nice quilt,  but I"m helpin' ya aren't 
    I?  I'm gettin' ya warm."
          Carl began to repeat his message sequence.
          "Oh,  baby,  ya got such a great body ...  mmmmm ... so 
    nice.   Yer breasts ... so firm, so plump.  Such hard thighs. 
    I'm  in terrible shape,  compared ta you.  Les get our thighs 
    together fer comparin' ...  so firm ...  yes, yes ... suck on 
    me  ...iz funny,  but ...  wit you iz as good az kissin'  ... 
    yes,  put yer arm around me ...  oh,  wit yer touch I've  got 
    erogenous  zones in my shoulder ...  yes ...  let's rub  each 
    other heart-to-heart ...  oh, baby, is that yer heart racin', 
    or is it mine? ... oh, baby ... oh, yer all warmed up now ... 
    our skins are red hot ... I'm gonna heat you on da inside ... 
    let me ...  oh, yes, baby, yes ... so tight ... so hot ... so 
    ... oooo.



                                  20 

          Carl awoke to find himself snuggled against April.  She 
    was  curled  up semi-fetally.   He was astonished to discover 
    that  she had the thumb stuck in her mouth and  silent  tears 
    were leaking from her eyes.
          "Oh,  April baby,  what's the matter?   Last night ...?  
    Did I ... did I hurt you?  Are you okay?"
          April just looked at him with wide-eyed silence.
          "Oh,  baby, I'm sorry.  I was a cad, a drunken bounder.  
    I was totally sloshed, but that's no excuse, is it?"
          Silence.
          "I'm sorry.  What more can I say?  I wish I had been as 
    sober and gentlemanly as a prince, but that doesn't alter the 
    case.  What can I do to make up for it?"
          Silence still, but the tears stopped.
          "Please  say  I'm forgiven.   What did I  do?   Robert?  
    ROBERT?  What happened last night?  My memory is fuzzy and my 
    head is still buzzing."
          "CARL COMMITED AN ACT OF CARNAL KNOWLEDGE."
          "Hugh?   Oh, yeah.  But she's acting so ... regressive.  
    I'm not sure ...  She didn't say to stop.   I don't  remember 
    her saying anything."
          "AFFIRMATIVE.    MISS   APRIL   HAS  NOT   COMMUNICATED 
    VERBALLY."
          Carl  shifted from resting on his elbow to sitting  up.  
    "Oh, April, tell me what I can do to make it up to you."
          "MISS APRIL UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE VERBALLY."
          "What do you mean?  What's wrong with her?"
          "THE  BODY OF MISS APRIL IS FULLY FUNCTIONAL,  BUT  THE 
    FACILITY FOR VERBAL COMMUNICATION IS NOT DEVELOPED."
          "You mean she's retarded or something?"
          "RETARDATION IS NULL CONCEPT.  ALL SPECIES HAVE A RANGE 
    OF  INTELLECTUAL POTENTIAL.   ALL MEMBERS OF A SPECIES   HAVE 
    INTELLECTUAL   ACTIVITY  DEPENDING  UPON  THE  INTERPLAY   OF 
    NUMEROUS  INHERENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS.   TO HOLD TO  A 
    THEORY OF RETARDATION WOULD BE TO ASSERT THAT ALL MEMBERS  OF 
    THE  CULTURAL MATRIX OF CARL ARE RETARDED IN RELATION TO  ALL 
    MEMBERS OF THE CULTURAL MATRIX OF ROBERT.   SUCH A CONTENTION 
    WOULD BE A POSITION OF EXTREME ARROGANCE WHICH FAILS TO  TAKE 
    INTO  CONSIDERATION  THE  DISCONTINUUM  OF  INTER  AND  INTRA 
    GALACTIC TIME DIFFERENTIALS."
          "Hugh?   Look, if she isn't retarded, what is she?  She 
    doesn't  say anything.   She doesn't do anything.   She  just 
    lies there sucking her damn thumb!"
          "THE   BODY  OF  MISS  APRIL  IS  AT  THE  6757   CYCLE 
    DEVELOPMENT  POINT.   THE  MIND OF MISS APRIL IS AT  THE  1/4

    NEW-BORN  INFANT.   THUMB SUCKING IS BASIC HUMANOID  INSTINCT 
    INDICATING NEED FOR SECURITY AND BODILY NOURISHMENT."
          "Do  you  mean to say that  this  absolutely  beautiful 
    young woman is actually an infant?"
          "REPLICATION  OF  THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF  MISS 
    APRIL  FROM THE ILLUSTRATIONS OF MISS APRIL IN  THE  MAGAZINE

          "Lord!  I've got to bottle feed her?  This is getting a 
    bit more than a man with a hangover bargained for."
          "FAILURE  TO  ANTICIPATE CONSEQUENCES OF  TABULA  ROSSA 
    MENTAL CONDITION ADMITTED.  IF CONDITIONS ARE UNSATISFACTORY, 
    DOES  CARL  WISH  ROBERT TO RETURN MISS  APRIL  TO  MOLECULAR 
    STORAGE?"
          "Just kill her?  How could anyone harm such a beautiful 
    body"
          "UNREPLICATION.  WITHIN THE CULTURAL MATRIX OF CARL THE 
    CONCEPT OF EUTHANASIA WOULD BE ANALOGOUS."
          "But  it's not like she were suffering,  was  seriously 
    defective,  or was dying.  It's not her fault she was born an 
    infant  with  an  eighteen-year-old  body.   We're  all  born 
    infants,  aren't we?  Someone has got to take care of us even 
    if it isn't convenient.  Unreplicate her?   Damn it,  no!  If 
    mothering  her is the price that I have to pay for a  night's 
    pleasure,  then  so be it.   Damn it,  replicate me a nursing 
    bottle of warm milk."
          After the milk winked in,  Carl gently removed  April's 
    thumb  from her mouth and substituted the baby  bottle.   She 
    greedily  slurped it down,  slobbering the milk down her chin 
    and into her hair.
          Carl laughed.
          "I  guess  you really were hungry,  but take  it  easy, 
    there's  plenty  more  where that came from," he said  as  he 
    wiped up the spilt milk with the corner of the sheet.
          "REPLICATION  OF AN ADVANCED DESIGN FEEDING BOTTLE  WAS 
    EFFECTED  SO  THAT  BURPING  OF MISS  APRIL  WILL  LIKELY  BE 
    UNNECESSARY."
          "Thank  you,  but April is one baby nobody  would  mind 
    burping.   Any  excuse to touch that marvelous body would  be 
    welcomed.   However,  I  wonder  if this kind of  feeding  is 
    necessary.   Afterall,  she  has all the adult equipment  for 
    eating solid food."
          "IT  IS AFFIRMED THAT MISS APRIL HAS A FULLY FUNCTIONAL 
    ADULT BODY.  HOWEVER, MISS APRIL DOES NOT HAVE THE EXPERIENCE 
    OF  EATING.   IT  IS  RECOMMENDED THAT  A  SLOW  AND  GRADUAL 
    INCREASE OF THE VISCOSITY OF THE NOURISHMENT OF MISS APRIL BE 
    EMBARKED UPON TO DEVELOP EATING EXPERIENCE."
          "Well,  we  don't have to worry about teaching  her  to 
    drink.  She's gone through most of the milk bottle already."
          "IT  IS  TO BE NOTED THAT A DIET OF MILK CAN SUSTAIN  A 
    HUMANOID INFANT,  HOWEVER MISS APRIL HAS ALMOST 15 TIMES  THE 
    MASS  OF  AN  INFANT AND REQUIRES  A  PROPORTIONATELY  LARGER 
    QUANTITY  OF  NOURISHMENT.   IT IS SUGGESTED THAT  A  PROTEEN 
    PUREE  BE FED TO MISS APRIL UPON THE COMPLETION OF THE LIQUID 
    NOURISHMENT  SO  THAT BODILY FUNCTIONS CAN BE  MAINTAINED  AT 
    OPTIMUM LEVELS."
          "Good idea.  Make that puree filet mignon flavored.  We 
    might  as well start to get our baby used to the  good  stuff 
    because  anybody with a body like that is going to be able to 
    command the best."
          "AFFIRMATIVE  OF  POLICY  OF  REPLICATION  OF   QUALITY 
    NOURISHEMENT FOR MISS APRIL."
          "Considering  the  fact  that our April is just  a  big 
    baby,  your referring to her as 'Miss April' does seem a  bit 
    stuffy.  we're all informal people here.  Let's just call her 
    April."
          "AFFIRMATIVE  OF HENCEFORTH REFERRING TO MISS APRIL  AS 
    APRIL,   DOES CARL WISH THE REPLICATION OF THE BOWL OF  FILET 
    MIGNON  FLAVORED PUREE TO BE REPLICATED IN THE BED OR AT  THE 
    TABLE?"
          "Oh,  I  think  that breakfast in bed with April  is  a 
    marvelous idea, and I do expect that we will be sharing a lot 
    of them, but perhaps we shouldn't start off teaching her such 
    bad habits.  I guess we'll eat at the table."
          Carl slid out of bed and, standing next to it, extended 
    a hand to April, saying: "Come, let's have a proper breakfast 
    ... of course, you don't understand me, do you?"
          He  took  her hand and gently tugged,  but  she  didn't 
    respond.
          "Now what?  Robert, can't she even walk to the table?"
          "APRIL HAS NO EXPERIENCE WITH WALKING."
          "Well,  damn  it,  she doesn't have any experience with 
    anything, does she?"
          "A  STATEMENT OF AFFIRMATION OF THE STATEMENT  OF  CARL 
    MUST  BE  MADE.   IT  WILL  BE NECESSARY FOR  CARL  TO  TEACH 
    EVERYTHING HUMAN TO APRIL."
          "That's  a tall order.   For the moment I  guess  we'll 
    just have to carry her to the table."
          Carl scouped April out of bed, carried her to the table 
    cube, and set her down on the chair cube.
          With  his arms still around April,  he asked:  "Can she 
    sit, or will she fall over like a newborn would?"
          "ALTHOUGH  APRIL HAS NO EXPERIENCE  WITH  SITTING,  THE 
    MUSCLE  DEVELOPMENT  OF APRIL WAS REPLICATED AT  THE  OPTIMUM 
    LEVEL FOR THE BODY TYPE OF APRIL.  APRIL SHOULD SIT."
          April   was  sitting,   but  just  to  give  her  added 
    stability, Carl placed her arms on the table cube.
          "Yes,  Robert,  April's body is at the optimum level of 
    development,"  Carl  said as he,  with his arms still  around 
    her, caressed her right breast. "I've never seen a woman with 
    such perfictly shaped tits."
          "THE   TOPOGRAPHY   OF  APRIL  IS  IDENTICAL  TO   THE 
    ILLUSTRATION OF MISS APRIL IN THE MAGAZINE."
          Carl  knew,  but  Robert did not  know,  that  magazine 
    girl's  breasts were secretly shaped and supported by  rubber 
    bands which were later air-brushed out of the photographs. As 
    a result, April had large, firm breasts which did not require 
    artificial  supports.    Numerous  photographic   tricks--the 
    special  lights and filters,  and plastic bags of ice cubes--
    were used to create the illusion of perfection for Miss April, 
    but April was perfection itself.
          "Now about breakfast: I think that I will join April in 
    the  filet  mignon  puree,  but I'll have coffee  with  mine.  
    Also,  some  orange juice,  a glass for me and a  bottle  for 
    April, please."
          Carl  tried  to  get April to  feed  herself,  but  her 
    muscles  were  not  yet  coordinated enough  to  perform  the 
    required motions without getting filet mignon puree all  over 
    herself,  the  table,  and Carl.   In the end,  Carl ended up 
    sitting  on  the table,  helping himself  to  the  puree  and 
    alternately  spoon-feeding April.   After their  puree,  Carl 
    started  drinking  his coffee.   April watched the  cup  with 
    intense  interest,  as  if a man drinking from a cup was  the 
    most fantastic thing she had ever seen.
          "Want to try some?" he asked as he held the cup for her 
    to take a sip from.  Her hands went up to his and held his as 
    she sloppily slurped the coffee.
          Carl  wondered if he was going to be erect  every  time 
    she  touched him.  Perhaps it was that he was without a woman 
    for so long.  Perhaps the intensity of his reactions to April 
    would  fade  in time--he hoped not.   They would have  to  be 
    touching  all  the time as Carl taught her.   The  first  cup 
    lesson  went reasonable well,  for Carl was rewarded  with  a 
    purred "Mmmmmm" and a smile.
