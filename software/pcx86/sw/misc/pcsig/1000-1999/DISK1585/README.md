## Information about "THE COMPLETE OFFICE (1586 ALSO)"

    Until now, you could either keep your office organized by using hundreds
    of forms printed on tons of paper, or select numerous different software
    applications for the various tasks related to office management.  THE
    COMPLETE OFFICE is designed to be a better solution.  This is a fully
    menu-driven program which integrates the important functions necessary
    to any office operation into one application.
    
    You can record and track personal records, such as client files, or
    employee files.  You can organize such files using several different
    field types -- name, code, etc.  A complete letter writing and mail
    merging function is included, you don't even have to go to your
    wordprocessor to handle those one-page letters.  An envelope and label
    printing function is provided that accesses the data from your personal
    records and prints those envelopes for you automatically. To help you
    manage your time, important business and personal dates can be kept in
    the calendar.  You can also record birthdays, anniversaries, and
    holidays. You can keep track of petty cash, inventory, office supplies
    or other resources, and even make inventory orders. A function for
    backing up your files to another disk for safe keeping is also provided.
    This will protect your important business information.  For most
    offices, this program covers all the bases.
    
    The main menu presents all the primary functions to choose from such as
    personal records, printing, calendar, editing, various office functions,
    and utility operations, but it also lists key commands to directly
    execute specific functions.  This allows you to move through the program
    directly from the main menu, thereby bypassing several submenus.
