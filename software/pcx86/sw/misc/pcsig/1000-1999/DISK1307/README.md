    investing, and the 100 best companies to work for in America.  Other

	 Welcome to the second year of EthInves.  A what a year it's
	 been: a new tax environment, the Soviet-U.S. missile treaty,
	 the rising Latin American debt crisis, the falling dollar,
	 the ever-present trade deficit and how can you mention 1987
	 without mentioning Bloody Monday.
 
	 In spite of all this uncertainty and rapid change, you are
	 still looking for sound investment options.  Your task is to
	 earn a comfortable return on your investment while monitoring
	 its social, political and environmental impact. No small
	 task.
 
	 I hope that the information and resources contained in
	 EthInves will make those decisions a little bit easier for
	 you.  As you may have noticed, ver. 2.0 is considerably
	 larger than 1.3  I hope that you find much of this new
	 material helpful.  If not, write or e-mail me and let me
	 know.  What do you need?  What don't you use?  What can't you
	 find?
 
	 My future plans for EthInves include more ancillary material
	 that may be of interest to EthInves users.  For example, this
	 edition includes a list of all the nuclear free zones world
	 wide.  The next edition (ver 2.1, 7/88) will have a database
	 of the members of Congress including address, phone and
	 committee memberships.  I have recently acquired Borland's
	 Quattro.  Expect to see much of the financial data in
	 spreadsheet/database form from now on.  If there's interest
	 from folks, I can also bundle other author's shareware: IRA
	 calculators, loan rate utils, etc.
 
	 The response the last 6 months to EthInves has been very
	 positive.  If this good fortune continues, EthInves will
	 become a quarterly publication by year's end.
 
	 EthInves readers can receive a free sample copy of RECON, the
	 newsletter that keeps its eye on the Pentagon, by writing
	 editor Chris Robinson and mentioning EthInves.
 
	 The periodical of the year award goes to The Whole Earth
	 Review for their Winter '87 issue "Signal".  If you are a
	 hacker, media freak, samizdat or committed culture watcher
	 you'll want to catch up with a copy of this excellent
	 magazine.  $5 from Whole Earth Review, 27 Gate Five Road,
	 Sausalito, CA, 94965.  In fact, you should be a subscriber
	 ($20/year).
 
	 Ramblings ...
 
	 With all-digit phone numbers, how long are they going to keep
	 putting letters on phones?  In other words, when will we lose
	 being able to spell out phone numbers?
 
	 When is someone going to put a clock/calendar into my
	 answering machine so that I can program it like I do my VCR?
	 I could simply tell it my regular working hours and never
	 have that sudden flash the minute I get to work.
 
	 Now that all of us with day gigs are in the habit of
	 timeshifting David Letterman AND VCR's are in 52% of American
	 homes, when will the advertisers get hip and push for
	 programming around the clock?
 
	 What public library will be first to put a jukebox of
	 CD-ROM's on-line accessable via your modem?  Local call so
	 that's free.  All we need now are lots and lots of reference
	 books and journals on disk with an elegant search routine on
	 the front end.  I'm not holding my breath but one day ...
 
	 Anybody else get a mailing from their local cable company
	 offering a computer hook-up, software and on-line services as
	 an option?  Will cable companies with their large installed
	 infrastructure start to rival phone line based information
	 utilities (CompuServe, The Source, etc.)?
 
	 I've been hearing more and more about progressive personal
	 computing throughout the Soviet bloc.  Will glasnost bring
	 about telecommunication and floppy disk exchanges with folks
	 in the Soviet bloc?  What would a public Soviet-US computer
	 network be like?  Will your local user group have a sisterSIG
	 in Poland?
 
	 Can you honestly tell me you have seen a non-trivial
	 HyperCard stack?  Not a glorified hyperDA but a real app I'll
	 use day in and day out.  I have faith.  Just wish I had the
	 time to play with HyperTalk.  One of my few New Year's
	 resolutions, along with PostScript.
 
	 If I were to win the lottery tommorrow, I'd buy a Compaq 386
	 to run Windows386.  I would never turn it off because I'd
	 configure Windows to run comm software in the background and
	 periodically download stuff from designated networks.  The
	 rest of the time it's in auto answer mode.  And when I sit
	 down to use it, all of this is transparent to me.
 
	 Or I'd get a Mac II with an AST 286 card and wait for Apple
	 to release A/UX, their flavor of Unix and be able to run all
	 three operating systems.
 
	 Then I'd get a 976- exchange number locally or a 900 area
	 code number nationwide and you could download stuff from me,
	 having it billed to your phone.  I'd don't know what the
	 phone company's attitude is but you could have pay as you go
	 information utilities.
 
	 The Spell-Checkers-Are-Great-But ... Dept.: They are but
	 until they're hypertext or randomized or in some different
	 form, you're gonna miss out on all the great new words you
	 learn while you're looking for the something else in a
	 printed dictionary.
 
	 Once again, thanks to all of you have provided me with both
	 information and inspiration during the last year.  EthInves
	 started with my own search for ethical investment vehicles
	 for my own I.R.A.  After looking high and low for what little
	 information is generally available, I decided to share this
	 information with you.

	 Community development and revolving loan funds provide the
	 credit and financial support that small businesses, community
	 groups, cooperatives and others need but are unable to obtain
	 from more traditional sources (banks and savings & loans). 
	 Because the focus of community development loan funds is
	 local, you'll know exactly where your money is and what it is
	 doing.  Help strengthen your community by supporting a local
	 community loan or revolving loan fund.
	 
	 As of 6/30/87, N.A.C.D.L.F. members had 604 loans outstanding
	 totaling $14,844,000.  (This doesn't include loans commited
	 but not yet disbursed.)  They also had 1,522 lenders with a
	 total capitalization of $34,181,000.

	 I have been unable to locate or put together an up-to-date
	 list of nuclear weapons contractors.  To the best of my
	 knowledge there is no one place you can go to get a
	 comprehensive list.  The best I've been able to come up with
	 is the following.  The odds are if a company was heavily
	 involved in nuclear weapons research and/or production in
	 1983, they still are now.  I hope to have more comprehensive

	 EthInves is an shareware almanac that provides you with handy
	 reference material on socially responsible investing.
	 EthInves is distributed as both ASCII text-only files
	 (MS-DOS) and MacWrite files (Macintosh).  To begin using
	 EthInves, just open the EthInves files with your favorite

	 publication.  You can print all or part of it out or use it
	 as a handy on-disk reference when you need a specific piece
	 of information.
	 
	 EthInves is packed full of information of interst to people
	 who are concerned about how their investments are impacting
	 the world around them.  EthInves' files contain information
	 about newsletters, magazines and books on ethical investment;
	 financial profiles of socially conscious mutual funds, money
	 market funds and other investment vehicles; and lists of
	 utility companies involved with nuclear power plants.  You'll
	 also find the top 100 Dept. of Defense contractors, all the
	 Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars) contractors, the
	 companies that still do business in South Africa and much,
	 much more.  I strongly suggest you browse through the MISC

	 archiving utilities are enclosed.  All I ask are two things
	 of you: that you distribute all of the EthInves files in

	 No other facet of the ethical investment movement has
	 received as much attention or had as deep an impact as the
	 divestment movement.  Public outcry and investor pressure has
	 played a pivotal role in pressuring American companies into
	 leaving South Africa.
	 
	 As an investor you must decide what level of involvement with
	 South Africa you are comfortable with.  Many companies have
	 responded to public pressure by ending their direct investment 
	 but continue to profit through franchises, licensing agreements 
	 or other means that let them have their cake and eat it too.
	 
	 On June 3, 1987, Rev. Leon Sullivan abandoned his efforts of
	 trying to influence Pretoria through the examples set by
	 American businesses in South Africa and called for a complete
	 withdrawal.  You must decide for yourself if a company's
	 signing of the Sullivan Principles was a skirt to hide behind
	 or was a sincere effort to bring about progressive change.
	  
	 For interesting, if disheartening, articles on the impact of
	 divestment on South Africa, consult The New York Times,
	 7/27/87, p21; New York Times, 9/7/87, p17; Wall Street
	 Journal, 9/21/87, p20.
	 
	 Five organizations active in the fight against apartheid have
	 recently issued their own "Guidelines for Divestment".  A
	 copy of their statement follows.

			      >>> signed 1/87 <<<
	 
	 We support an end to all corporate involvement in or with South
	 Africa and Namibia.  A corporation is doing business in or with
	 the Republic of South Africa or Namibia if it, its parent, or its
	 subsidiaries:
	 
	 1) have direct investments in South Africa or Namibia, or have
	 entered into franchise, licensing or management agreements with or
	 for any entity in those countries; or
	 
	 2) are financial institutions that have not prohibited new
	 investments, loans, credits or related services, or the renewal of
	 existing agreements, including those for the purpose of trade,
	 with any entity in those countries; or
	 
	 3) have more than 5% of their common stock beneficially owned or
	 controlled by a South African entity.
	 
	 A company with operations in South Africa or Namibia for the sole
	 purpose of reporting the news shall not be considered doing
	 business in those countries.

	 I have been unable to locate or put together an up-to-date
	 list of nuclear weapons contractors.  To the best of my
	 knowledge there is no one place you can go to get a
	 comprehensive list.  The best I've been able to come up with
	 is the following.  The odds are if a company was heavily
	 involved in nuclear weapons research and/or production in
	 1983, they still are now.  I hope to have more comprehensive
	 information included in future updates of EthInves.  A more
	 up to date list will soon be available from:

	 Welcome to the second year of EthInves.  A what a year it's
	 been: a new tax environment, the Soviet-U.S. missile treaty,
	 the rising Latin American debt crisis, the falling dollar,
	 the ever-present trade deficit and how can you mention 1987
	 without mentioning Bloody Monday.
 
	 In spite of all this uncertainty and rapid change, you are
	 still looking for sound investment options.  Your task is to
	 earn a comfortable return on your investment while monitoring
	 its social, political and environmental impact. No small
	 task.
 
	 I hope that the information and resources contained in
	 EthInves will make those decisions a little bit easier for
	 you.  As you may have noticed, ver. 2.0 is considerably
	 larger than 1.3  I hope that you find much of this new
	 material helpful.  If not, write or e-mail me and let me
	 know.  What do you need?  What don't you use?  What can't you
	 find?
 
	 My future plans for EthInves include more ancillary material
	 that may be of interest to EthInves users.  For example, this
	 edition includes a list of all the nuclear free zones world
	 wide.  The next edition (ver 2.1, 7/88) will have a database
	 of the members of Congress including address, phone and
	 committee memberships.  I have recently acquired Borland's
	 Quattro.  Expect to see much of the financial data in
	 spreadsheet/database form from now on.  If there's interest
	 from folks, I can also bundle other author's shareware: IRA
	 calculators, loan rate utils, etc.
 
	 The response the last 6 months to EthInves has been very
	 positive.  If this good fortune continues, EthInves will
	 become a quarterly publication by year's end.
 
	 EthInves readers can receive a free sample copy of RECON, the
	 newsletter that keeps its eye on the Pentagon, by writing
	 editor Chris Robinson and mentioning EthInves.
 
	 The periodical of the year award goes to The Whole Earth
	 Review for their Winter '87 issue "Signal".  If you are a
	 hacker, media freak, samizdat or committed culture watcher
	 you'll want to catch up with a copy of this excellent
	 magazine.  $5 from Whole Earth Review, 27 Gate Five Road,
	 Sausalito, CA, 94965.  In fact, you should be a subscriber
	 ($20/year).
 
	 Ramblings ...
 
	 With all-digit phone numbers, how long are they going to keep
	 putting letters on phones?  In other words, when will we lose
	 being able to spell out phone numbers?
 
	 When is someone going to put a clock/calendar into my
	 answering machine so that I can program it like I do my VCR?
	 I could simply tell it my regular working hours and never
	 have that sudden flash the minute I get to work.
 
	 Now that all of us with day gigs are in the habit of
	 timeshifting David Letterman AND VCR's are in 52% of American
	 homes, when will the advertisers get hip and push for
	 programming around the clock?
 
	 What public library will be first to put a jukebox of
	 CD-ROM's on-line accessable via your modem?  Local call so
	 that's free.  All we need now are lots and lots of reference
	 books and journals on disk with an elegant search routine on
	 the front end.  I'm not holding my breath but one day ...
 
	 Anybody else get a mailing from their local cable company
	 offering a computer hook-up, software and on-line services as
	 an option?  Will cable companies with their large installed
	 infrastructure start to rival phone line based information
	 utilities (CompuServe, The Source, etc.)?
 
	 I've been hearing more and more about progressive personal
	 computing throughout the Soviet bloc.  Will glasnost bring
	 about telecommunication and floppy disk exchanges with folks
	 in the Soviet bloc?  What would a public Soviet-US computer
	 network be like?  Will your local user group have a sisterSIG
	 in Poland?
 
	 Can you honestly tell me you have seen a non-trivial
	 HyperCard stack?  Not a glorified hyperDA but a real app I'll
	 use day in and day out.  I have faith.  Just wish I had the
	 time to play with HyperTalk.  One of my few New Year's
	 resolutions, along with PostScript.
 
	 If I were to win the lottery tommorrow, I'd buy a Compaq 386
	 to run Windows386.  I would never turn it off because I'd
	 configure Windows to run comm software in the background and
	 periodically download stuff from designated networks.  The
	 rest of the time it's in auto answer mode.  And when I sit
	 down to use it, all of this is transparent to me.
 
	 Or I'd get a Mac II with an AST 286 card and wait for Apple
	 to release A/UX, their flavor of Unix and be able to run all
	 three operating systems.
 
	 Then I'd get a 976- exchange number locally or a 900 area
	 code number nationwide and you could download stuff from me,
	 having it billed to your phone.  I'd don't know what the
	 phone company's attitude is but you could have pay as you go
	 information utilities.
 
	 The Spell-Checkers-Are-Great-But ... Dept.: They are but
	 until they're hypertext or randomized or in some different
	 form, you're gonna miss out on all the great new words you
	 learn while you're looking for the something else in a
	 printed dictionary.
 
	 Once again, thanks to all of you have provided me with both
	 information and inspiration during the last year.  EthInves
	 started with my own search for ethical investment vehicles
	 for my own I.R.A.  After looking high and low for what little
	 information is generally available, I decided to share this
	 information with you.

	 Community development and revolving loan funds provide the
	 credit and financial support that small businesses, community
	 groups, cooperatives and others need but are unable to obtain
	 from more traditional sources (banks and savings & loans). 
	 Because the focus of community development loan funds is
	 local, you'll know exactly where your money is and what it is
	 doing.  Help strengthen your community by supporting a local
	 community loan or revolving loan fund.
	 
	 As of 6/30/87, N.A.C.D.L.F. members had 604 loans outstanding
	 totaling $14,844,000.  (This doesn't include loans commited
	 but not yet disbursed.)  They also had 1,522 lenders with a
	 total capitalization of $34,181,000.

	 EthInves is an shareware almanac that provides you with handy
	 reference material on socially responsible investing.
	 EthInves is distributed as both ASCII text-only files
	 (MS-DOS) and MacWrite files (Macintosh).  To begin using
	 EthInves, just open the EthInves files with your favorite
	 word processor or place the files into a PageMaker
	 publication.  You can print all or part of it out or use it
	 as a handy on-disk reference when you need a specific piece
	 of information.
	 
	 EthInves is packed full of information of interst to people
	 who are concerned about how their investments are impacting
	 the world around them.  EthInves' files contain information
	 about newsletters, magazines and books on ethical investment;
	 financial profiles of socially conscious mutual funds, money
	 market funds and other investment vehicles; and lists of
	 utility companies involved with nuclear power plants.  You'll
	 also find the top 100 Dept. of Defense contractors, all the
	 Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars) contractors, the
	 companies that still do business in South Africa and much,
	 much more.  I strongly suggest you browse through the MISC
	 file. :-)
	 
	 EthInves is shareware and you are encouraged to pass it on to
	 friends, relatives and co-workers.  Each copy includes an
	 archived version to make uploading and downloading EthInves
	 both quicker and cheaper.  The necessary archiving and de-
	 archiving utilities are enclosed.  All I ask are two things
	 of you: that you distribute all of the EthInves files in
	 total without changing the contents and that it not be sold
	 for more than the cost of reproduction and distrubtion.  I
	 still retain the copyright to EthInves. 
	 
	 If you find EthInves of use, please become a registered owner
	 for $20.  Registration to this biannual almanac gives you a
	 year's subscription.  You get two copies: the one you have
	 now and the next scheduled release.  EthInves issues come out
	 in January and July.
	 
	 I welcome feedback, suggestions for improvement and
	 corrections of errors or omissions.  Please tell me where you
	 heard about EthInves.  Many thanks to all of you who have
	 helped me compile and distribute this material.  I always
	 appreciate your feedback.  
	 
	 THE MATERIAL IN ETHINVES IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.  IT
	 IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE NOR IS IT TO BE INTERPRETTED AS
	 FINANCIAL COUNSELING.  IT IS FOR YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION;
	 HOW YOU APPLY IT WITH YOUR MONEY IS YOUR BUSINESS.

	 No other facet of the ethical investment movement has
	 received as much attention or had as deep an impact as the
	 divestment movement.  Public outcry and investor pressure has
	 played a pivotal role in pressuring American companies into
	 leaving South Africa.
	 
	 As an investor you must decide what level of involvement with
	 South Africa you are comfortable with.  Many companies have
	 responded to public pressure by ending their direct investment 
	 but continue to profit through franchises, licensing agreements 
	 or other means that let them have their cake and eat it too.
	 
	 On June 3, 1987, Rev. Leon Sullivan abandoned his efforts of
	 trying to influence Pretoria through the examples set by
	 American businesses in South Africa and called for a complete
	 withdrawal.  You must decide for yourself if a company's
	 signing of the Sullivan Principles was a skirt to hide behind
	 or was a sincere effort to bring about progressive change.
	  
	 For interesting, if disheartening, articles on the impact of
	 divestment on South Africa, consult The New York Times,
	 7/27/87, p21; New York Times, 9/7/87, p17; Wall Street
	 Journal, 9/21/87, p20.
	 
	 Five organizations active in the fight against apartheid have
	 recently issued their own "Guidelines for Divestment".  A
	 copy of their statement follows.

			      >>> signed 1/87 <<<
	 
	 We support an end to all corporate involvement in or with South
	 Africa and Namibia.  A corporation is doing business in or with
	 the Republic of South Africa or Namibia if it, its parent, or its
	 subsidiaries:
	 
	 1) have direct investments in South Africa or Namibia, or have
	 entered into franchise, licensing or management agreements with or
	 for any entity in those countries; or
	 
	 2) are financial institutions that have not prohibited new
	 investments, loans, credits or related services, or the renewal of
	 existing agreements, including those for the purpose of trade,
	 with any entity in those countries; or
	 
	 3) have more than 5% of their common stock beneficially owned or
	 controlled by a South African entity.
	 
	 A company with operations in South Africa or Namibia for the sole
	 purpose of reporting the news shall not be considered doing
	 business in those countries.

	 Beware of recent mergers, spin offs and acquisitions.  The
	 ever turbulent business world has blurred this list of parent
	 companies (e.g. Sperry & Burroughs haved merged and are now
	 calling themselves Unisys and GE bought RCA etc.).  You'll
	 have to check to see who's doing what today.  This is a good

	 I have been unable to locate or put together an up-to-date
	 list of nuclear weapons contractors.  To the best of my
	 knowledge there is no one place you can go to get a
	 comprehensive list.  The best I've been able to come up with
	 is the following.  The odds are if a company was heavily
	 involved in nuclear weapons research and/or production in
	 1983, they still are now.  I hope to have more comprehensive
	 information included in future updates of EthInves.  A more
	 up to date list will soon be available from:

			      >>> as of 10/87 <<<
			      
	 Why care about Nuclear Free Zones?  If you don't live in one,
	 why concern yourself with something four states away? 
	 Remember my friend, the arms build-up, nuclear fall out and
	 nuclear waste know no geographic boundaries.  We all live at
	 Chernobyl.

	 As an investor you may look to municipal bonds for guaranteed
	 long term growth.  With munis you can be reasonably sure of
	 where your  money is going and what it is being used for. 
	 You might like to support communities that have taken a
	 stand against nuclear power and/or nuclear weapons.
	 
	 Or you may notice by looking at the list that your city or
	 county is not on the list.  Time to get busy ...  Nuclear
	 Free America claims that14,914,397 Americans live in 139
	 nuclear free zones in this country.
	 
	 Or perhaps you have some vacation time coming up.
	 
	 There are lists of all the nuclear free zones in America, US
	 NFZ campaigns underway and data on NFZ's around the world.
	 The lists are arranged alphabetically by state, cities listed
	 first then counties.

	 You want your personal beliefs guide your investment
	 decisions because you care about how your money is working
	 for you. You need hard data upon which to base such important
	 decisions.  EthInves provides you with just such data.  Facts
	 on ethical investment vehicles like mutual funds & money
	 market accounts; lists of companies that still do business in
	 South Africa; major nuclear weapons contractors; the top
	 Dept. of Defense contractors; utilities that own nuclear
	 power plants and much much more.
 
	 This is an imperfect world we live in.  Nothing is black and
	 white.  Everything is complicated.  You should sit down and
	 list your priorities and concerns. How do you want your money
	 to work?  What companies or industries would you like to
	 avoid?  Which do you want to support?  In short, what are
	 your priorities?  Now is a good time to sit down with a
	 pencil and paper and make a list.  Number the issues 110.
	 What are you prepared to compromise on?  What are your
	 non-negotiables?  Possible criteria for evaluating a
	 potential investment might include:
 
	 * Defense-related activities, including the manufacturing of
	 arms, radar or communications equipment, aircraft, ships,
	 submarines, missiles, etc. and/or research on any of the
	 above
 
	 * South African investments or trade.  The last year has seen
	 a continued departure of American firms from South Africa.
	 Not all opponents of apartheid support the complete
	 withdrawal of American companies from South Africa, believing
	 that the presence American companies can provide a positive
	 and constructive influence.  How do you feel about firms that
	 are still in South Africa but have signed the Sullivan
	 Principles?  (Rev. Sullivan himself has changed to a position
	 of advocating the withdrawal from South Africa. See his
	 6/3/87 statement elsewhere in this issue of EthInves.)  How
	 do you feel about companies that have no more "direct"
	 investments but have set up franchises or other alternatives
	 to continue to have a business presence in (and profit from)
	 South Africa?
 
	 * Pollution and environmental track record.  Does the company
	 in question pollute, strip mine, dump toxic waste,
	 manufacture pesticides/herbicides/insecticides, etc.?
 
	 * Labor history.  Is the company known for its poor labor
	 record, breaking strikes, not negotiating in good faith,
	 hiring outside union busting firms, discrimination against
	 minorities and/or women, etc.?
 
	 * Nukes, commercial or military.  Involvement in the resarch,
	 design, manufacturing, construction and/or maintenance of
	 nuclear power plants?  Exploration, mining and/or refining of
	 uranium, plutonium or other nuclear material?  Research,
	 design, manufacturing, installation, maintenance, and/or
	 delivery of nuclear weapons?
 
	 There are those who purchase minimal amounts of a company's
	 stock in order to participate in stockholders' protests.
	 Others use proxy voting.  Several religious and divestment
	 groups have used this tactic with great success.  If you have
	 the time and energy to devote to this more activist approach,
	 it can raise social, environmental and political issues at
	 annual meetings.  Such stockholders' actions have pressure
	 firms to leave South Africa.
 
 
			     >>> READING LIST <<<
			       >>> Articles <<<
 
	 This reading list includes articles that have appeared in
	 1987.  Consult EthInves ver 1.3 for references to older
	 articles.
 
	 Articles about South Africa and divestment continue to be so
	 frequent that I have only included selected articles.  If you
	 still need background reference material on aparthied and the

	    >>> >>> REV. SULLIVAN & THE DIVESTMENT MOVEMENT <<< <<<
	    
	    
		 >>> Rev. Leon Sullivan's 6/3/87 Statement <<<
	    
	 I have assessed, to the best of my ability, the situation as
	 it now exists in the Republic of South Africa, and I have
	 reached the decision that the time has come for American
	 companies, and the United States of America, to take a
	 definitive stand against the evils of apartheid.
	    
	 Therefore, today, I am calling for the withdrawal of all
	 United States companies from the Republic of South Africa,
	 and for a total United States embargo against that country,
	 until statutory apartheid is ended, and Blacks have a clear
	 commitment for equal political rights, and I am calling on
	 the President of the United States to end diplomatic
	 relations with South Africa until the atrocities against
	 Black people end, and apartheid is dismantled.
	    
	 As of May, 1985, I stated if in twenty-four months statutory
	 apartheid was not ended, and there was not a clear commitment
	 of the vote for Blacks, equal to whites, I would call on the
	 companies to leave South Africa, and call for an American
	 embargo.  The conditions have not been remotely met. 
	 Therefore, after careful, painstaking, and prayerful
	 consideration, I am making this statement.
	    
	 This action comes after years of effort with the Sullivan
	 Principles to help, along with other thrusts, to bring about
	 fundamental change in that country; and I want it clearly
	 known, I am proud of the work of the Sullivan Principles, and
	 proud of the efforts of those companies who have followed
	 them. The Sullivan Principles, initiated March 1, 1977, ten
	 years ago, have been a tremendous force for change in South
	 Africa.
	 
	 When the Sullivan Principles were introduced ten years ago, a
	 Black man did not even have the legal status as a worker in
	 South Africa.  The Principles broke new ground for Black
	 rights in South Africa that had not existed for 300 years. 
	 They have caused a revolution in industrial race relations
	 for Black workers in that country.
	 
	 These equal rights standards, followed by many American
	 companies, have lead the way in promoting equal pay for equal
	 work, fair employment practices, recognition of independent
	 free Black trade unions, extensive educational training
	 programs, the promotion of Blacks to management and
	 supervisory jobs, the initiation of hundreds of Black owned
	 businesses, the building of schools and health facilities,
	 and the improvement of the quality of life in many other ways
	 for hundreds of thousands of Blacks, far, far beyond the
	 small number employed by American companies.
	 
	 The Sullivan Principles have been a catalyst for change
	 throughout the Republic of South Africa.  Also, in recent
	 years, as the Principles have evolved, some United States
	 companies have begun to challenge the apartheid system
	 itself, and have begun to practice "corporate civil
	 disobedience" against apartheid practices, regulations and
	 laws.
	 
	 Many United States companies engaging in this effort have
	 left a notable record in corporate social responsibility in
	 South Africa.  Whatever happens in the future, the work of
	 many of the companies to change conditions for Blacks has
	 been outstanding.  Still, in spite of these and other
	 efforts, the main pillars of apartheid still remain, and
	 Blacks are still denied simple basic human rights in their
	 own country, and are still deprived of the right to vote.
	 
	 In spite of appeals, and protests, and cries for change and
	 justice within South Africa, repression grows, thousands are
	 jailed without trial, including little children, people are
	 brutalized, beaten and killed, dissent is ruthlessly
	 suppressed, and the press is muzzled.  Intransigence to
	 fundamental change continues, and, today, the government
	 pushes back even minimal progress and reform.  South Africa
	 has become a nation of oppression and a police state, and the
	 continuation of apartheid and its inhumanities against Blacks
	 goes on.  There is no greater moral issue in the world today
	 than apartheid!
	 
	 Somewhere, somehow, it must be said, as loudly and as
	 clearly, and as firmly possible, that what is happening in
	 South Africa to Black people is immoral, and it is wrong, and
	 it must be brought to an end.  Not ten years from now, or
	 five years from now, or three years from now, but now.
	 
	 The winds of change have reached South Africa, and the winds
	 will not be subdued until the people have no less than their
	 full economic, social and political freedom.  And violently,
	 or non-violently, Black people in South Africa are going to
	 have it.  And nothing can, or will, end the rising surge of
	 the people's aspirations for their freedom and for justice in
	 South Africa, but the elimination of the apartheid system
	 itself, which is the root cause of the nation's problems.
	 
	 South Africa is at the crossroads.  Either South Africa can
	 go the direction of a unitary free South Africa, or the
	 direction of a chaotic revolution, with the killing of
	 millions people, the destruction of a country, and the
	 devastation of the entire southern region of Africa; leading
	 to the possibility of the confrontation of the world's great
	 nuclear powers at that strategic point of the world, as a
	 race war would certainly become an ideological war.  And
	 should the United States become involved in such a war, as
	 most assuredly we would, one way or the other; race riots
	 would break out in every major city in the country, far worse
	 than anything ever seen in the history of America.
	 
	 It is in the interest of peace in South Africa, and peace in
	 the world, and peace in America, that apartheid must be
	 ended.  The evils of apartheid are broader than South Africa.
	 Apartheid is against the will of God, and the humanity of
	 man; and like Nazism and Facism, it must be stopped.  America
	 and the world must draw a line, and speak out, and act
	 against it.  If the world had stopped Hitler in time, we
	 might not have had World War II.
	 
	 It is clear the South African government does not intend to
	 end apartheid on its own.  Since the recent elections, the
	 government ahs become more defiant to further change. 
	 Therefore, something must be done now to dramatize the issue
	 before America and before the world.  Every moral, and
	 economic, and political force must be brought to bear to help
	 influence the South African government to move towards
	 dismantling the apartheid system, while there is still time.
	 
	 In this regard, America, a leader of the free world, should
	 take the lead, including our companies and our government,
	 hoping others in the world will follow.
	 
	 Therefore, today, as the strongest possible American non-
	 violent protest against the continuing existence of
	 apartheid, and with the maximum non-violent use of moral,
	 corporate, and government force against that inhumane system,
	 I call on all American companies to withdraw from the
	 Republic of South Africa, until statutory apratheid has been
	 abolished, and there is a clear commitment of the vote for
	 Blacks, in accordance with agreements reached with authentic 
	 and representative Black South African leaders.
	 
	 Also, I call on the United States to enact, with urgency, a
	 total United States economic embargo against South Africa,
	 all exports and imports, including gold and diamonds, and to
	 seek South African sourced vitally needed materials
	 elsewhere, or to seek alternatives, or to stockpile, or to
	 recycle, or to do without.
	 
	 I further call on the Congress to consider stringent
	 penalties against United States trading partners who assume
	 markets left by departing United States companies, and who
	 continue to do business in South Africa, such as the
	 Japanese.
	 
	 I, also, call on the President of the United States to break
	 all Diplomatic Relations with South Africa, until atrocities
	 against Black people end, and apartheid is dismantled.
	 
	 Should, at any time, the South African government abolish
	 statutory apartheid, and commit itself to equal voting rights
	 for Blacks, in accordance with agreements reached with
	 authentic and representative Black South African leaders,
	 restrictions against American companies operating in South
	 Africa should be lifted, and American companies should be
	 free to return to the country, along with unlimited United
	 States investments in a unitary Free South Africa.
	 
	 This Call for Withdrawal excludes Philanthropic and
	 Educational initiatives, and the Media.
	 
	 This is my message to the companies of America, the Congress
	 and the President of the United States, and to the Government
	 of South Africa.

		       >>> Listed by Utility Company <<<
			     >>> as of 1/1/87 <<<
	 
	 This is the most accurate list that I have been able to
	 compile of all the owners of each nuclear reactor.  It is
	 sorted by utility company.  Below is another listing sorted
	 by reactor, listing its location and the operating utility
	 company.  
	 
	 Ownership changes hands frequently and you should double
	 check before accepting this listing as gospel truth.  In
	 researching this list, I get the distinct impression that no
	 one wants you to know this stuff.  What are they hiding?
	 
	 Bond buyers may well want to consider the nuclear profile of
	 a given utility.  Nuclear power plant owners are often
	 saddled with high debt and face the uncertain future of
	 nuclear power in the immediate and long-range future
	 post-Three Mile Island and post-Chernobyl.

	 Community development and revolving loan funds provide the
	 credit and financial support that small businesses, community
	 groups, cooperatives and others need but are unable to obtain
	 from more traditional sources (banks and savings & loans). 
	 Because the focus of community development loan funds is
	 local, you'll know exactly where your money is and what it is
	 doing.  Help strengthen your community by supporting a local
	 community loan or revolving loan fund.
	 
	 As of 6/30/87, N.A.C.D.L.F. members had 604 loans outstanding
	 totaling $14,844,000.  (This doesn't include loans commited
	 but not yet disbursed.)  They also had 1,522 lenders with a
	 total capitalization of $34,181,000.

	 Why care about Nuclear Free Zones?  If you don't live in one,
	 why concern yourself with something four states away? 
	 Remember my friend, the arms build-up, nuclear fall out and
	 nuclear waste know no geographic boundaries.  We all live at
	 Chernobyl.

	 As an investor you may look to municipal bonds for guaranteed
	 long term growth.  With munis you can be reasonably sure of
	 where your  money is going and what it is being used for. 
	 You might like to support communities that have taken a
	 stand against nuclear power and/or nuclear weapons.
	 
	 Or you may notice by looking at the list that your city or
	 county is not on the list.  Time to get busy ...  Nuclear
	 Free America claims that14,914,397 Americans live in 139
	 nuclear free zones in this country.
	 
	 Or perhaps you have some vacation time coming up.
	 
	 There are lists of all the nuclear free zones in America, US
	 NFZ campaigns underway and data on NFZ's around the world.
	 The lists are arranged alphabetically by state, cities listed
	 first then counties.

		       >>> Listed by Utility Company <<<
			     >>> as of 1/1/87 <<<
	 
	 This is the most accurate list that I have been able to
	 compile of all the owners of each nuclear reactor.  It is
	 sorted by utility company.  Below is another listing sorted
	 by reactor, listing its location and the operating utility
	 company.  
	 
	 Ownership changes hands frequently and you should double
	 check before accepting this listing as gospel truth.  In
	 researching this list, I get the distinct impression that no
	 one wants you to know this stuff.  What are they hiding?
	 
	 Bond buyers may well want to consider the nuclear profile of
	 a given utility.  Nuclear power plant owners are often
	 saddled with high debt and face the uncertain future of
	 nuclear power in the immediate and long-range future
	 post-Three Mile Island and post-Chernobyl.

		    >>> >>> NUCLEAR FREE ZONES LIST <<< <<<
			      >>> as of 10/87 <<<
			      
	 Why care about Nuclear Free Zones?  If you don't live in one,
	 why concern yourself with something four states away? 
	 Remember my friend, the arms build-up, nuclear fall out and
	 nuclear waste know no geographic boundaries.  We all live at
	 Chernobyl.

	 As an investor you may look to municipal bonds for guaranteed
	 long term growth.  With munis you can be reasonably sure of
	 where your  money is going and what it is being used for. 
	 You might like to support communities that have taken a
	 stand against nuclear power and/or nuclear weapons.
	 
	 Or you may notice by looking at the list that your city or
	 county is not on the list.  Time to get busy ...  Nuclear
	 Free America claims that14,914,397 Americans live in 139
	 nuclear free zones in this country.
	 
	 Or perhaps you have some vacation time coming up.
	 
	 There are lists of all the nuclear free zones in America, US
	 NFZ campaigns underway and data on NFZ's around the world.
	 The lists are arranged alphabetically by state, cities listed
	 first then counties.

	 You want your personal beliefs guide your investment
	 decisions because you care about how your money is working
	 for you. You need hard data upon which to base such important
	 decisions.  EthInves provides you with just such data.  Facts
	 on ethical investment vehicles like mutual funds & money
	 market accounts; lists of companies that still do business in
	 South Africa; major nuclear weapons contractors; the top
	 Dept. of Defense contractors; utilities that own nuclear
	 power plants and much much more.
 
	 This is an imperfect world we live in.  Nothing is black and
	 white.  Everything is complicated.  You should sit down and
	 list your priorities and concerns. How do you want your money
	 to work?  What companies or industries would you like to
	 avoid?  Which do you want to support?  In short, what are
	 your priorities?  Now is a good time to sit down with a
	 pencil and paper and make a list.  Number the issues 110.
	 What are you prepared to compromise on?  What are your
	 non-negotiables?  Possible criteria for evaluating a
	 potential investment might include:
 
	 * Defense-related activities, including the manufacturing of
	 arms, radar or communications equipment, aircraft, ships,
	 submarines, missiles, etc. and/or research on any of the
	 above
 
	 * South African investments or trade.  The last year has seen
	 a continued departure of American firms from South Africa.
	 Not all opponents of apartheid support the complete
	 withdrawal of American companies from South Africa, believing
	 that the presence American companies can provide a positive
	 and constructive influence.  How do you feel about firms that
	 are still in South Africa but have signed the Sullivan
	 Principles?  (Rev. Sullivan himself has changed to a position
	 of advocating the withdrawal from South Africa. See his
	 6/3/87 statement elsewhere in this issue of EthInves.)  How
	 do you feel about companies that have no more "direct"
	 investments but have set up franchises or other alternatives
	 to continue to have a business presence in (and profit from)
	 South Africa?
 
	 * Pollution and environmental track record.  Does the company
	 in question pollute, strip mine, dump toxic waste,
	 manufacture pesticides/herbicides/insecticides, etc.?
 
	 * Labor history.  Is the company known for its poor labor
	 record, breaking strikes, not negotiating in good faith,
	 hiring outside union busting firms, discrimination against
	 minorities and/or women, etc.?
 
	 * Nukes, commercial or military.  Involvement in the resarch,
	 design, manufacturing, construction and/or maintenance of
	 nuclear power plants?  Exploration, mining and/or refining of
	 uranium, plutonium or other nuclear material?  Research,
	 design, manufacturing, installation, maintenance, and/or
	 delivery of nuclear weapons?
 
	 There are those who purchase minimal amounts of a company's
	 stock in order to participate in stockholders' protests.
	 Others use proxy voting.  Several religious and divestment
	 groups have used this tactic with great success.  If you have
	 the time and energy to devote to this more activist approach,
	 it can raise social, environmental and political issues at
	 annual meetings.  Such stockholders' actions have pressure
	 firms to leave South Africa.

			       >>> Articles <<<
 
	 This reading list includes articles that have appeared in
	 1987.  Consult EthInves ver 1.3 for references to older
	 articles.
 
	 Articles about South Africa and divestment continue to be so
	 frequent that I have only included selected articles.  If you
	 still need background reference material on aparthied and the
	 divestment movement, spend an afternoon or evening at your
	 local public library.
 
	 With the New York Times or Wall Street Journal, page numbers
	 may differ slightly between regional editions.

	 if there's only one article you read this year about the
	 ethical investing, this is it
 
	 NY Times of 9/27/87, Section 3 p 1
	 There's a very interesting if depressing article in the that
	 discusses the impact of a nuclear weapons treaty on the
	 stock price and earnings of major weapons contractors.
	 Since conventional weapons sales are likely to go up in the
	 aftermath of a nuclear weapons treaty and conventional
	 weapons have a higher profit margin than nuclear weapons,
	 major defense contractors may stand to make more money
	 *after* a nuclear weapons treaty between US & USSR.  Let's
	 hope the author's thesis is flawed.
 
	 New York Times, 10/4/87, p16
	 A unique program to encourage small organic farmers to stay
	 in business. End consumers pay for produce up front to
	 ensure farmer's survival.  In effect, organic produce
	 futures.  An idea that could easily catch on and be a grass
	 roots (pun intended) program that supports organic farmers
	 around the world.

	 Columnist reviews impact of US trade sanctions against South

	 No other facet of the ethical investment movement has
	 received as much attention or had as deep an impact as the
	 divestment movement.  Public outcry and investor pressure has
	 played a pivotal role in pressuring American companies into
	 leaving South Africa.
	 
	 As an investor you must decide what level of involvement with
	 South Africa you are comfortable with.  Many companies have
	 responded to public pressure by ending their direct investment 
	 but continue to profit through franchises, licensing agreements 
	 or other means that let them have their cake and eat it too.
	 
	 On June 3, 1987, Rev. Leon Sullivan abandoned his efforts of
	 trying to influence Pretoria through the examples set by
	 American businesses in South Africa and called for a complete
	 withdrawal.  You must decide for yourself if a company's
	 signing of the Sullivan Principles was a skirt to hide behind
	 or was a sincere effort to bring about progressive change.
	  
	 For interesting, if disheartening, articles on the impact of
	 divestment on South Africa, consult The New York Times,
	 7/27/87, p21; New York Times, 9/7/87, p17; Wall Street
	 Journal, 9/21/87, p20.

	    >>> >>> REV. SULLIVAN & THE DIVESTMENT MOVEMENT <<< <<<
	    
	    
		 >>> Rev. Leon Sullivan's 6/3/87 Statement <<<
	    
	 I have assessed, to the best of my ability, the situation as
	 it now exists in the Republic of South Africa, and I have
	 reached the decision that the time has come for American
	 companies, and the United States of America, to take a
	 definitive stand against the evils of apartheid.
	    
	 Therefore, today, I am calling for the withdrawal of all
	 United States companies from the Republic of South Africa,
	 and for a total United States embargo against that country,
	 until statutory apartheid is ended, and Blacks have a clear
	 commitment for equal political rights, and I am calling on
	 the President of the United States to end diplomatic
	 relations with South Africa until the atrocities against
	 Black people end, and apartheid is dismantled.
	    
	 As of May, 1985, I stated if in twenty-four months statutory
	 apartheid was not ended, and there was not a clear commitment
	 of the vote for Blacks, equal to whites, I would call on the
	 companies to leave South Africa, and call for an American
	 embargo.  The conditions have not been remotely met. 
	 Therefore, after careful, painstaking, and prayerful
	 consideration, I am making this statement.
	    
	 This action comes after years of effort with the Sullivan
	 Principles to help, along with other thrusts, to bring about
	 fundamental change in that country; and I want it clearly
	 known, I am proud of the work of the Sullivan Principles, and
	 proud of the efforts of those companies who have followed
	 them. The Sullivan Principles, initiated March 1, 1977, ten
	 years ago, have been a tremendous force for change in South
	 Africa.
	 
	 When the Sullivan Principles were introduced ten years ago, a
	 Black man did not even have the legal status as a worker in
	 South Africa.  The Principles broke new ground for Black
	 rights in South Africa that had not existed for 300 years. 
	 They have caused a revolution in industrial race relations
	 for Black workers in that country.
	 
	 These equal rights standards, followed by many American
	 companies, have lead the way in promoting equal pay for equal
	 work, fair employment practices, recognition of independent
	 free Black trade unions, extensive educational training
	 programs, the promotion of Blacks to management and
	 supervisory jobs, the initiation of hundreds of Black owned
	 businesses, the building of schools and health facilities,
	 and the improvement of the quality of life in many other ways
	 for hundreds of thousands of Blacks, far, far beyond the
	 small number employed by American companies.
	 
	 The Sullivan Principles have been a catalyst for change
	 throughout the Republic of South Africa.  Also, in recent
	 years, as the Principles have evolved, some United States
	 companies have begun to challenge the apartheid system
	 itself, and have begun to practice "corporate civil
	 disobedience" against apartheid practices, regulations and
	 laws.
	 
	 Many United States companies engaging in this effort have
	 left a notable record in corporate social responsibility in
	 South Africa.  Whatever happens in the future, the work of
	 many of the companies to change conditions for Blacks has
	 been outstanding.  Still, in spite of these and other
	 efforts, the main pillars of apartheid still remain, and
	 Blacks are still denied simple basic human rights in their
	 own country, and are still deprived of the right to vote.
	 
	 In spite of appeals, and protests, and cries for change and
	 justice within South Africa, repression grows, thousands are
	 jailed without trial, including little children, people are
	 brutalized, beaten and killed, dissent is ruthlessly
	 suppressed, and the press is muzzled.  Intransigence to
	 fundamental change continues, and, today, the government
	 pushes back even minimal progress and reform.  South Africa
	 has become a nation of oppression and a police state, and the
	 continuation of apartheid and its inhumanities against Blacks
	 goes on.  There is no greater moral issue in the world today
	 than apartheid!
	 
	 Somewhere, somehow, it must be said, as loudly and as
	 clearly, and as firmly possible, that what is happening in
	 South Africa to Black people is immoral, and it is wrong, and
	 it must be brought to an end.  Not ten years from now, or
	 five years from now, or three years from now, but now.
	 
	 The winds of change have reached South Africa, and the winds
	 will not be subdued until the people have no less than their
	 full economic, social and political freedom.  And violently,
	 or non-violently, Black people in South Africa are going to
	 have it.  And nothing can, or will, end the rising surge of
	 the people's aspirations for their freedom and for justice in
	 South Africa, but the elimination of the apartheid system
	 itself, which is the root cause of the nation's problems.
	 
	 South Africa is at the crossroads.  Either South Africa can
	 go the direction of a unitary free South Africa, or the
	 direction of a chaotic revolution, with the killing of
	 millions people, the destruction of a country, and the
	 devastation of the entire southern region of Africa; leading
	 to the possibility of the confrontation of the world's great
	 nuclear powers at that strategic point of the world, as a
	 race war would certainly become an ideological war.  And
	 should the United States become involved in such a war, as
	 most assuredly we would, one way or the other; race riots
	 would break out in every major city in the country, far worse
	 than anything ever seen in the history of America.
	 
	 It is in the interest of peace in South Africa, and peace in
	 the world, and peace in America, that apartheid must be
	 ended.  The evils of apartheid are broader than South Africa.
	 Apartheid is against the will of God, and the humanity of
	 man; and like Nazism and Facism, it must be stopped.  America
	 and the world must draw a line, and speak out, and act
	 against it.  If the world had stopped Hitler in time, we
	 might not have had World War II.
	 
	 It is clear the South African government does not intend to
	 end apartheid on its own.  Since the recent elections, the
	 government ahs become more defiant to further change. 
	 Therefore, something must be done now to dramatize the issue
	 before America and before the world.  Every moral, and
	 economic, and political force must be brought to bear to help
	 influence the South African government to move towards
	 dismantling the apartheid system, while there is still time.
	 
	 In this regard, America, a leader of the free world, should
	 take the lead, including our companies and our government,
	 hoping others in the world will follow.
	 
	 Therefore, today, as the strongest possible American non-
	 violent protest against the continuing existence of
	 apartheid, and with the maximum non-violent use of moral,
	 corporate, and government force against that inhumane system,
	 I call on all American companies to withdraw from the
	 Republic of South Africa, until statutory apratheid has been
	 abolished, and there is a clear commitment of the vote for
	 Blacks, in accordance with agreements reached with authentic 
	 and representative Black South African leaders.
	 
	 Also, I call on the United States to enact, with urgency, a
	 total United States economic embargo against South Africa,
	 all exports and imports, including gold and diamonds, and to
	 seek South African sourced vitally needed materials
	 elsewhere, or to seek alternatives, or to stockpile, or to
	 recycle, or to do without.
	 
	 I further call on the Congress to consider stringent
	 penalties against United States trading partners who assume
	 markets left by departing United States companies, and who
	 continue to do business in South Africa, such as the
	 Japanese.
	 
	 I, also, call on the President of the United States to break
	 all Diplomatic Relations with South Africa, until atrocities
	 against Black people end, and apartheid is dismantled.
	 
	 Should, at any time, the South African government abolish
	 statutory apartheid, and commit itself to equal voting rights
	 for Blacks, in accordance with agreements reached with
	 authentic and representative Black South African leaders,
	 restrictions against American companies operating in South
	 Africa should be lifted, and American companies should be
	 free to return to the country, along with unlimited United
	 States investments in a unitary Free South Africa.
	 
	 This Call for Withdrawal excludes Philanthropic and
	 Educational initiatives, and the Media.
	 
	 This is my message to the companies of America, the Congress
	 and the President of the United States, and to the Government
	 of South Africa.

	 programs, the promotion of Blacks to management and
	 supervisory jobs, the initiation of hundreds of Black owned
	 businesses, the building of schools and health facilities,
	 and the improvement of the quality of life in many other ways
	 for hundreds of thousands of Blacks, far, far beyond the
	 small number employed by American companies.
	 
	 The Sullivan Principles have been a catalyst for change
	 throughout the Republic of South Africa.  Also, in recent
	 years, as the Principles have evolved, some United States
	 companies have begun to challenge the apartheid system
	 itself, and have begun to practice "corporate civil
	 disobedience" against apartheid practices, regulations and
	 laws.
	 
	 Many United States companies engaging in this effort have
	 left a notable record in corporate social responsibility in
	 South Africa.  Whatever happens in the future, the work of
	 many of the companies to change conditions for Blacks has
	 been outstanding.  Still, in spite of these and other
	 efforts, the main pillars of apartheid still remain, and
	 Blacks are still denied simple basic human rights in their
	 own country, and are still deprived of the right to vote.
	 
	 In spite of appeals, and protests, and cries for change and
	 justice within South Africa, repression grows, thousands are
	 jailed without trial, including little children, people are
	 brutalized, beaten and killed, dissent is ruthlessly
	 suppressed, and the press is muzzled.  Intransigence to
	 fundamental change continues, and, today, the government
	 pushes back even minimal progress and reform.  South Africa
	 has become a nation of oppression and a police state, and the
	 continuation of apartheid and its inhumanities against Blacks
	 goes on.  There is no greater moral issue in the world today
	 than apartheid!
	 
	 Somewhere, somehow, it must be said, as loudly and as
	 clearly, and as firmly possible, that what is happening in
	 South Africa to Black people is immoral, and it is wrong, and
	 it must be brought to an end.  Not ten years from now, or
	 five years from now, or three years from now, but now.
	 
	 The winds of change have reached South Africa, and the winds
	 will not be subdued until the people have no less than their
	 full economic, social and political freedom.  And violently,
	 or non-violently, Black people in South Africa are going to
	 have it.  And nothing can, or will, end the rising surge of
	 the people's aspirations for their freedom and for justice in
	 South Africa, but the elimination of the apartheid system
	 itself, which is the root cause of the nation's problems.
	 
	 South Africa is at the crossroads.  Either South Africa can
	 go the direction of a unitary free South Africa, or the
	 direction of a chaotic revolution, with the killing of
	 millions people, the destruction of a country, and the
	 devastation of the entire southern region of Africa; leading
	 to the possibility of the confrontation of the world's great
	 nuclear powers at that strategic point of the world, as a
	 race war would certainly become an ideological war.  And
	 should the United States become involved in such a war, as
	 most assuredly we would, one way or the other; race riots
	 would break out in every major city in the country, far worse
	 than anything ever seen in the history of America.
	 
	 It is in the interest of peace in South Africa, and peace in
	 the world, and peace in America, that apartheid must be
	 ended.  The evils of apartheid are broader than South Africa.
	 Apartheid is against the will of God, and the humanity of
	 man; and like Nazism and Facism, it must be stopped.  America
	 and the world must draw a line, and speak out, and act
	 against it.  If the world had stopped Hitler in time, we
	 might not have had World War II.
	 
	 It is clear the South African government does not intend to
	 end apartheid on its own.  Since the recent elections, the
	 government ahs become more defiant to further change. 
	 Therefore, something must be done now to dramatize the issue
	 before America and before the world.  Every moral, and
	 economic, and political force must be brought to bear to help
	 influence the South African government to move towards
	 dismantling the apartheid system, while there is still time.
	 
	 In this regard, America, a leader of the free world, should
	 take the lead, including our companies and our government,
	 hoping others in the world will follow.
	 
	 Therefore, today, as the strongest possible American non-
	 violent protest against the continuing existence of
	 apartheid, and with the maximum non-violent use of moral,
	 corporate, and government force against that inhumane system,
	 I call on all American companies to withdraw from the
	 Republic of South Africa, until statutory apratheid has been
	 abolished, and there is a clear commitment of the vote for
	 Blacks, in accordance with agreements reached with authentic 
	 and representative Black South African leaders.
	 
	 Also, I call on the United States to enact, with urgency, a
	 total United States economic embargo against South Africa,
	 all exports and imports, including gold and diamonds, and to
	 seek South African sourced vitally needed materials
	 elsewhere, or to seek alternatives, or to stockpile, or to
	 recycle, or to do without.
	 
	 I further call on the Congress to consider stringent
	 penalties against United States trading partners who assume
	 markets left by departing United States companies, and who
	 continue to do business in South Africa, such as the
	 Japanese.
	 
	 I, also, call on the President of the United States to break
	 all Diplomatic Relations with South Africa, until atrocities
	 against Black people end, and apartheid is dismantled.
	 
	 Should, at any time, the South African government abolish
	 statutory apartheid, and commit itself to equal voting rights
	 for Blacks, in accordance with agreements reached with
	 authentic and representative Black South African leaders,
	 restrictions against American companies operating in South
	 Africa should be lifted, and American companies should be
	 free to return to the country, along with unlimited United
	 States investments in a unitary Free South Africa.
	 
	 This Call for Withdrawal excludes Philanthropic and
	 Educational initiatives, and the Media.
	 
	 This is my message to the companies of America, the Congress
	 and the President of the United States, and to the Government
	 of South Africa.

	 Welcome to the second year of EthInves.  A what a year it's
	 been: a new tax environment, the Soviet-U.S. missile treaty,
	 the rising Latin American debt crisis, the falling dollar,
	 the ever-present trade deficit and how can you mention 1987
	 without mentioning Bloody Monday.
 
	 In spite of all this uncertainty and rapid change, you are
	 still looking for sound investment options.  Your task is to
	 earn a comfortable return on your investment while monitoring
	 its social, political and environmental impact. No small
	 task.
 
	 I hope that the information and resources contained in
	 EthInves will make those decisions a little bit easier for
	 you.  As you may have noticed, ver. 2.0 is considerably
	 larger than 1.3  I hope that you find much of this new
	 material helpful.  If not, write or e-mail me and let me
	 know.  What do you need?  What don't you use?  What can't you
	 find?
 
	 My future plans for EthInves include more ancillary material
	 that may be of interest to EthInves users.  For example, this
	 edition includes a list of all the nuclear free zones world
	 wide.  The next edition (ver 2.1, 7/88) will have a database
	 of the members of Congress including address, phone and
	 committee memberships.  I have recently acquired Borland's
	 Quattro.  Expect to see much of the financial data in
	 spreadsheet/database form from now on.  If there's interest
	 from folks, I can also bundle other author's shareware: IRA
	 calculators, loan rate utils, etc.
 
	 The response the last 6 months to EthInves has been very
	 positive.  If this good fortune continues, EthInves will
	 become a quarterly publication by year's end.
 
	 EthInves readers can receive a free sample copy of RECON, the
	 newsletter that keeps its eye on the Pentagon, by writing
	 editor Chris Robinson and mentioning EthInves.
 
	 The periodical of the year award goes to The Whole Earth
	 Review for their Winter '87 issue "Signal".  If you are a
	 hacker, media freak, samizdat or committed culture watcher
	 you'll want to catch up with a copy of this excellent
	 magazine.  $5 from Whole Earth Review, 27 Gate Five Road,
	 Sausalito, CA, 94965.  In fact, you should be a subscriber
	 ($20/year).
 
	 Ramblings ...
 
	 With all-digit phone numbers, how long are they going to keep
	 putting letters on phones?  In other words, when will we lose
	 being able to spell out phone numbers?
 
	 When is someone going to put a clock/calendar into my
	 answering machine so that I can program it like I do my VCR?
	 I could simply tell it my regular working hours and never
	 have that sudden flash the minute I get to work.
 
	 Now that all of us with day gigs are in the habit of
	 timeshifting David Letterman AND VCR's are in 52% of American
	 homes, when will the advertisers get hip and push for
	 programming around the clock?
 
	 What public library will be first to put a jukebox of
	 CD-ROM's on-line accessable via your modem?  Local call so
	 that's free.  All we need now are lots and lots of reference
	 books and journals on disk with an elegant search routine on
	 the front end.  I'm not holding my breath but one day ...
 
	 Anybody else get a mailing from their local cable company
	 offering a computer hook-up, software and on-line services as
	 an option?  Will cable companies with their large installed
	 infrastructure start to rival phone line based information
	 utilities (CompuServe, The Source, etc.)?
 
	 I've been hearing more and more about progressive personal
	 computing throughout the Soviet bloc.  Will glasnost bring
	 about telecommunication and floppy disk exchanges with folks
	 in the Soviet bloc?  What would a public Soviet-US computer
	 network be like?  Will your local user group have a sisterSIG
	 in Poland?
 
	 Can you honestly tell me you have seen a non-trivial
	 HyperCard stack?  Not a glorified hyperDA but a real app I'll
	 use day in and day out.  I have faith.  Just wish I had the
	 time to play with HyperTalk.  One of my few New Year's
	 resolutions, along with PostScript.
 
	 If I were to win the lottery tommorrow, I'd buy a Compaq 386
	 to run Windows386.  I would never turn it off because I'd
	 configure Windows to run comm software in the background and
	 periodically download stuff from designated networks.  The
	 rest of the time it's in auto answer mode.  And when I sit
	 down to use it, all of this is transparent to me.
 
	 Or I'd get a Mac II with an AST 286 card and wait for Apple
	 to release A/UX, their flavor of Unix and be able to run all
	 three operating systems.
 
	 Then I'd get a 976- exchange number locally or a 900 area
	 code number nationwide and you could download stuff from me,
	 having it billed to your phone.  I'd don't know what the
	 phone company's attitude is but you could have pay as you go
	 information utilities.
 
	 The Spell-Checkers-Are-Great-But ... Dept.: They are but
	 until they're hypertext or randomized or in some different
	 form, you're gonna miss out on all the great new words you
	 learn while you're looking for the something else in a
	 printed dictionary.
 
	 Once again, thanks to all of you have provided me with both
	 information and inspiration during the last year.  EthInves
	 started with my own search for ethical investment vehicles
	 for my own I.R.A.  After looking high and low for what little
	 information is generally available, I decided to share this
	 information with you.

	 Community development and revolving loan funds provide the
	 credit and financial support that small businesses, community
	 groups, cooperatives and others need but are unable to obtain
	 from more traditional sources (banks and savings & loans). 
	 Because the focus of community development loan funds is
	 local, you'll know exactly where your money is and what it is
	 doing.  Help strengthen your community by supporting a local
	 community loan or revolving loan fund.
	 
	 As of 6/30/87, N.A.C.D.L.F. members had 604 loans outstanding
	 totaling $14,844,000.  (This doesn't include loans commited
	 but not yet disbursed.)  They also had 1,522 lenders with a

	 EthInves is an shareware almanac that provides you with handy
	 reference material on socially responsible investing.
	 EthInves is distributed as both ASCII text-only files
	 (MS-DOS) and MacWrite files (Macintosh).  To begin using
	 EthInves, just open the EthInves files with your favorite
	 word processor or place the files into a PageMaker
	 publication.  You can print all or part of it out or use it
	 as a handy on-disk reference when you need a specific piece
	 of information.
	 
	 EthInves is packed full of information of interst to people
	 who are concerned about how their investments are impacting
	 the world around them.  EthInves' files contain information
	 about newsletters, magazines and books on ethical investment;
	 financial profiles of socially conscious mutual funds, money
	 market funds and other investment vehicles; and lists of
	 utility companies involved with nuclear power plants.  You'll
	 also find the top 100 Dept. of Defense contractors, all the
	 Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars) contractors, the
	 companies that still do business in South Africa and much,
	 much more.  I strongly suggest you browse through the MISC
	 file. :-)
	 
	 EthInves is shareware and you are encouraged to pass it on to
	 friends, relatives and co-workers.  Each copy includes an
	 archived version to make uploading and downloading EthInves
	 both quicker and cheaper.  The necessary archiving and de-
	 archiving utilities are enclosed.  All I ask are two things
	 of you: that you distribute all of the EthInves files in
	 total without changing the contents and that it not be sold
	 for more than the cost of reproduction and distrubtion.  I
	 still retain the copyright to EthInves. 
	 
	 If you find EthInves of use, please become a registered owner
	 for $20.  Registration to this biannual almanac gives you a
	 year's subscription.  You get two copies: the one you have
	 now and the next scheduled release.  EthInves issues come out
	 in January and July.
	 
	 I welcome feedback, suggestions for improvement and
	 corrections of errors or omissions.  Please tell me where you
	 heard about EthInves.  Many thanks to all of you who have
	 helped me compile and distribute this material.  I always
	 appreciate your feedback.  
	 
	 THE MATERIAL IN ETHINVES IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.  IT
	 IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE NOR IS IT TO BE INTERPRETTED AS
	 FINANCIAL COUNSELING.  IT IS FOR YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION;
	 HOW YOU APPLY IT WITH YOUR MONEY IS YOUR BUSINESS.

			     >>> Introduction <<<
			     
			     
	 No other facet of the ethical investment movement has
	 received as much attention or had as deep an impact as the
	 divestment movement.  Public outcry and investor pressure has
	 played a pivotal role in pressuring American companies into
	 leaving South Africa.
	 
	 As an investor you must decide what level of involvement with
	 South Africa you are comfortable with.  Many companies have
	 responded to public pressure by ending their direct investment 
	 but continue to profit through franchises, licensing agreements 
	 or other means that let them have their cake and eat it too.
	 
	 On June 3, 1987, Rev. Leon Sullivan abandoned his efforts of
	 trying to influence Pretoria through the examples set by
	 American businesses in South Africa and called for a complete
	 withdrawal.  You must decide for yourself if a company's
	 signing of the Sullivan Principles was a skirt to hide behind
	 or was a sincere effort to bring about progressive change.
	  
	 For interesting, if disheartening, articles on the impact of
	 divestment on South Africa, consult The New York Times,
	 7/27/87, p21; New York Times, 9/7/87, p17; Wall Street
	 Journal, 9/21/87, p20.
	 
	 Five organizations active in the fight against apartheid have
	 recently issued their own "Guidelines for Divestment".  A
	 copy of their statement follows.

	 We support an end to all corporate involvement in or with South
	 Africa and Namibia.  A corporation is doing business in or with
	 the Republic of South Africa or Namibia if it, its parent, or its
	 subsidiaries:
	 
	 1) have direct investments in South Africa or Namibia, or have
	 entered into franchise, licensing or management agreements with or
	 for any entity in those countries; or
	 
	 2) are financial institutions that have not prohibited new
	 investments, loans, credits or related services, or the renewal of
	 existing agreements, including those for the purpose of trade,
	 with any entity in those countries; or
	 
	 3) have more than 5% of their common stock beneficially owned or
	 controlled by a South African entity.
	 
	 A company with operations in South Africa or Namibia for the sole
	 purpose of reporting the news shall not be considered doing
	 business in those countries.

	 Beware of recent mergers, spin offs and acquisitions.  The
	 ever turbulent business world has blurred this list of parent
	 companies (e.g. Sperry & Burroughs haved merged and are now
	 calling themselves Unisys and GE bought RCA etc.).  You'll

	 knowledge there is no one place you can go to get a
	 comprehensive list.  The best I've been able to come up with
	 is the following.  The odds are if a company was heavily
	 involved in nuclear weapons research and/or production in
	 1983, they still are now.  I hope to have more comprehensive

			      >>> as of 10/87 <<<
			      
	 Why care about Nuclear Free Zones?  If you don't live in one,
	 why concern yourself with something four states away? 
	 Remember my friend, the arms build-up, nuclear fall out and
	 nuclear waste know no geographic boundaries.  We all live at
	 Chernobyl.

	 As an investor you may look to municipal bonds for guaranteed
	 long term growth.  With munis you can be reasonably sure of
	 where your  money is going and what it is being used for. 
	 You might like to support communities that have taken a
	 stand against nuclear power and/or nuclear weapons.
	 
	 Or you may notice by looking at the list that your city or
	 county is not on the list.  Time to get busy ...  Nuclear
	 Free America claims that14,914,397 Americans live in 139
	 nuclear free zones in this country.
	 
	 Or perhaps you have some vacation time coming up.
	 
	 There are lists of all the nuclear free zones in America, US
	 NFZ campaigns underway and data on NFZ's around the world.
	 The lists are arranged alphabetically by state, cities listed
	 first then counties.

	 You want your personal beliefs guide your investment
	 decisions because you care about how your money is working
	 for you. You need hard data upon which to base such important
	 decisions.  EthInves provides you with just such data.  Facts
	 on ethical investment vehicles like mutual funds & money
	 market accounts; lists of companies that still do business in
	 South Africa; major nuclear weapons contractors; the top
	 Dept. of Defense contractors; utilities that own nuclear
	 power plants and much much more.
 
	 This is an imperfect world we live in.  Nothing is black and
	 white.  Everything is complicated.  You should sit down and
	 list your priorities and concerns. How do you want your money
	 to work?  What companies or industries would you like to
	 avoid?  Which do you want to support?  In short, what are
	 your priorities?  Now is a good time to sit down with a
	 pencil and paper and make a list.  Number the issues 110.
	 What are you prepared to compromise on?  What are your
	 non-negotiables?  Possible criteria for evaluating a
	 potential investment might include:
 
	 * Defense-related activities, including the manufacturing of
	 arms, radar or communications equipment, aircraft, ships,
	 submarines, missiles, etc. and/or research on any of the
	 above
 
	 * South African investments or trade.  The last year has seen
	 a continued departure of American firms from South Africa.
	 Not all opponents of apartheid support the complete
	 withdrawal of American companies from South Africa, believing
	 that the presence American companies can provide a positive
	 and constructive influence.  How do you feel about firms that
	 are still in South Africa but have signed the Sullivan
	 Principles?  (Rev. Sullivan himself has changed to a position
	 of advocating the withdrawal from South Africa. See his
	 6/3/87 statement elsewhere in this issue of EthInves.)  How
	 do you feel about companies that have no more "direct"
	 investments but have set up franchises or other alternatives
	 to continue to have a business presence in (and profit from)
	 South Africa?
 
	 * Pollution and environmental track record.  Does the company
	 in question pollute, strip mine, dump toxic waste,
	 manufacture pesticides/herbicides/insecticides, etc.?
 
	 * Labor history.  Is the company known for its poor labor
	 record, breaking strikes, not negotiating in good faith,
	 hiring outside union busting firms, discrimination against
	 minorities and/or women, etc.?
 
	 * Nukes, commercial or military.  Involvement in the resarch,
	 design, manufacturing, construction and/or maintenance of
	 nuclear power plants?  Exploration, mining and/or refining of
	 uranium, plutonium or other nuclear material?  Research,
	 design, manufacturing, installation, maintenance, and/or
	 delivery of nuclear weapons?
 
	 There are those who purchase minimal amounts of a company's
	 stock in order to participate in stockholders' protests.
	 Others use proxy voting.  Several religious and divestment
	 groups have used this tactic with great success.  If you have
	 the time and energy to devote to this more activist approach,
	 it can raise social, environmental and political issues at
	 annual meetings.  Such stockholders' actions have pressure
	 firms to leave South Africa.

	    >>> >>> REV. SULLIVAN & THE DIVESTMENT MOVEMENT <<< <<<
	    
	    
		 >>> Rev. Leon Sullivan's 6/3/87 Statement <<<
	    
	 I have assessed, to the best of my ability, the situation as
	 it now exists in the Republic of South Africa, and I have
	 reached the decision that the time has come for American
	 companies, and the United States of America, to take a
	 definitive stand against the evils of apartheid.
	    
	 Therefore, today, I am calling for the withdrawal of all
	 United States companies from the Republic of South Africa,
	 and for a total United States embargo against that country,
	 until statutory apartheid is ended, and Blacks have a clear
	 commitment for equal political rights, and I am calling on
	 the President of the United States to end diplomatic
	 relations with South Africa until the atrocities against
	 Black people end, and apartheid is dismantled.
	    
	 As of May, 1985, I stated if in twenty-four months statutory
	 apartheid was not ended, and there was not a clear commitment
	 of the vote for Blacks, equal to whites, I would call on the
	 companies to leave South Africa, and call for an American
	 embargo.  The conditions have not been remotely met. 
	 Therefore, after careful, painstaking, and prayerful
	 consideration, I am making this statement.
	    
	 This action comes after years of effort with the Sullivan
	 Principles to help, along with other thrusts, to bring about
	 fundamental change in that country; and I want it clearly
	 known, I am proud of the work of the Sullivan Principles, and
	 proud of the efforts of those companies who have followed
	 them. The Sullivan Principles, initiated March 1, 1977, ten
	 years ago, have been a tremendous force for change in South
	 Africa.
	 
	 When the Sullivan Principles were introduced ten years ago, a
	 Black man did not even have the legal status as a worker in
	 South Africa.  The Principles broke new ground for Black
	 rights in South Africa that had not existed for 300 years. 
	 They have caused a revolution in industrial race relations
	 for Black workers in that country.
	 
	 These equal rights standards, followed by many American
	 companies, have lead the way in promoting equal pay for equal
	 work, fair employment practices, recognition of independent
	 free Black trade unions, extensive educational training
	 programs, the promotion of Blacks to management and
	 supervisory jobs, the initiation of hundreds of Black owned
	 businesses, the building of schools and health facilities,
	 and the improvement of the quality of life in many other ways
	 for hundreds of thousands of Blacks, far, far beyond the
	 small number employed by American companies.
	 
	 The Sullivan Principles have been a catalyst for change
	 throughout the Republic of South Africa.  Also, in recent
	 years, as the Principles have evolved, some United States
	 companies have begun to challenge the apartheid system
	 itself, and have begun to practice "corporate civil
	 disobedience" against apartheid practices, regulations and
	 laws.
	 
	 Many United States companies engaging in this effort have
	 left a notable record in corporate social responsibility in
	 South Africa.  Whatever happens in the future, the work of
	 many of the companies to change conditions for Blacks has
	 been outstanding.  Still, in spite of these and other
	 efforts, the main pillars of apartheid still remain, and
	 Blacks are still denied simple basic human rights in their
	 own country, and are still deprived of the right to vote.
	 
	 In spite of appeals, and protests, and cries for change and
	 justice within South Africa, repression grows, thousands are
	 jailed without trial, including little children, people are
	 brutalized, beaten and killed, dissent is ruthlessly
	 suppressed, and the press is muzzled.  Intransigence to
	 fundamental change continues, and, today, the government
	 pushes back even minimal progress and reform.  South Africa
	 has become a nation of oppression and a police state, and the
	 continuation of apartheid and its inhumanities against Blacks
	 goes on.  There is no greater moral issue in the world today
	 than apartheid!
	 
	 Somewhere, somehow, it must be said, as loudly and as
	 clearly, and as firmly possible, that what is happening in
	 South Africa to Black people is immoral, and it is wrong, and
	 it must be brought to an end.  Not ten years from now, or
	 five years from now, or three years from now, but now.
	 
	 The winds of change have reached South Africa, and the winds
	 will not be subdued until the people have no less than their
	 full economic, social and political freedom.  And violently,
	 or non-violently, Black people in South Africa are going to
	 have it.  And nothing can, or will, end the rising surge of
	 the people's aspirations for their freedom and for justice in
	 South Africa, but the elimination of the apartheid system
	 itself, which is the root cause of the nation's problems.
	 
	 South Africa is at the crossroads.  Either South Africa can
	 go the direction of a unitary free South Africa, or the
	 direction of a chaotic revolution, with the killing of
	 millions people, the destruction of a country, and the
	 devastation of the entire southern region of Africa; leading
	 to the possibility of the confrontation of the world's great
	 nuclear powers at that strategic point of the world, as a
	 race war would certainly become an ideological war.  And
	 should the United States become involved in such a war, as
	 most assuredly we would, one way or the other; race riots
	 would break out in every major city in the country, far worse
	 than anything ever seen in the history of America.
	 
	 It is in the interest of peace in South Africa, and peace in
	 the world, and peace in America, that apartheid must be
	 ended.  The evils of apartheid are broader than South Africa.
	 Apartheid is against the will of God, and the humanity of
	 man; and like Nazism and Facism, it must be stopped.  America
	 and the world must draw a line, and speak out, and act
	 against it.  If the world had stopped Hitler in time, we
	 might not have had World War II.
	 
	 It is clear the South African government does not intend to
	 end apartheid on its own.  Since the recent elections, the
	 government ahs become more defiant to further change. 
	 Therefore, something must be done now to dramatize the issue
	 before America and before the world.  Every moral, and
	 economic, and political force must be brought to bear to help
	 influence the South African government to move towards
	 dismantling the apartheid system, while there is still time.
	 
	 In this regard, America, a leader of the free world, should
	 take the lead, including our companies and our government,
	 hoping others in the world will follow.
	 
	 Therefore, today, as the strongest possible American non-
	 violent protest against the continuing existence of
	 apartheid, and with the maximum non-violent use of moral,
	 corporate, and government force against that inhumane system,
	 I call on all American companies to withdraw from the
	 Republic of South Africa, until statutory apratheid has been
	 abolished, and there is a clear commitment of the vote for
	 Blacks, in accordance with agreements reached with authentic 
	 and representative Black South African leaders.
	 
	 Also, I call on the United States to enact, with urgency, a
	 total United States economic embargo against South Africa,
	 all exports and imports, including gold and diamonds, and to
	 seek South African sourced vitally needed materials
	 elsewhere, or to seek alternatives, or to stockpile, or to
	 recycle, or to do without.
	 
	 I further call on the Congress to consider stringent
	 penalties against United States trading partners who assume
	 markets left by departing United States companies, and who
	 continue to do business in South Africa, such as the
	 Japanese.
	 
	 I, also, call on the President of the United States to break
	 all Diplomatic Relations with South Africa, until atrocities
	 against Black people end, and apartheid is dismantled.
	 
	 Should, at any time, the South African government abolish
	 statutory apartheid, and commit itself to equal voting rights
	 for Blacks, in accordance with agreements reached with
	 authentic and representative Black South African leaders,
	 restrictions against American companies operating in South
	 Africa should be lifted, and American companies should be
	 free to return to the country, along with unlimited United
	 States investments in a unitary Free South Africa.
	 
	 This Call for Withdrawal excludes Philanthropic and
	 Educational initiatives, and the Media.
	 
	 This is my message to the companies of America, the Congress
	 and the President of the United States, and to the Government
	 of South Africa.

			     >>> as of 1/1/87 <<<
	 
	 This is the most accurate list that I have been able to
	 compile of all the owners of each nuclear reactor.  It is
	 sorted by utility company.  Below is another listing sorted
	 by reactor, listing its location and the operating utility
	 company.  
	 
	 Ownership changes hands frequently and you should double
	 check before accepting this listing as gospel truth.  In
	 researching this list, I get the distinct impression that no
	 one wants you to know this stuff.  What are they hiding?
	 
	 Bond buyers may well want to consider the nuclear profile of
	 a given utility.  Nuclear power plant owners are often
	 saddled with high debt and face the uncertain future of
	 nuclear power in the immediate and long-range future
	 post-Three Mile Island and post-Chernobyl.

		       >>> Listed by Utility Company <<<
			     >>> as of 1/1/87 <<<
	 
	 This is the most accurate list that I have been able to
	 compile of all the owners of each nuclear reactor.  It is
	 sorted by utility company.  Below is another listing sorted
	 by reactor, listing its location and the operating utility
	 company.  
	 
	 Ownership changes hands frequently and you should double
	 check before accepting this listing as gospel truth.  In
	 researching this list, I get the distinct impression that no
	 one wants you to know this stuff.  What are they hiding?
	 
	 Bond buyers may well want to consider the nuclear profile of
	 a given utility.  Nuclear power plant owners are often
	 saddled with high debt and face the uncertain future of
	 nuclear power in the immediate and long-range future
	 post-Three Mile Island and post-Chernobyl.
