## Information about "MYFAMILY"

    Genealogical records and family histories can be easy to maintain.
    MYFAMILY puts an emphasis on flexibility and menu-driven ease of use.
    Records may be entered in any order.  There are no limits placed on the
    number of children or previous marriages entered for each individual.
    The program accommodates children from previous marriages.  When reports
    are produced children are automatically ordered by birthdate, and
    previous marriages by date of marriage.  The programmable macro key
    feature allows the user to assign values to seven function keys to ease
    the data entry and editing processes.
    
    MYFAMILY produces 14 different types of reports, including ancestor and
    descendant charts, individual and family sheets, various types of lists,
    and blank charts or sheets.  Reports may be displayed on the screen,
    printed, or saved to a disk file.  The file manager feature allows the
    user to copy files, erase files, and view a directory listing without
    leaving the program.  Selected records may be copied from one genealogy
    file to another.  The date calculator feature allows you to view a
    calendar for a selected date and perform arithmetic on dates.  A sample
    genealogy file is included on the program diskette so that you may
    easily try out the program's various features.
