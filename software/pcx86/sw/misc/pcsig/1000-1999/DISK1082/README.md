## Information about "EASY PROJECT"

    For the office manager on the go, EASY PROJECT is a comprehensive
    project management, tracking, and controlling system.  Context-sensitive
    help screens are a standard feature of this menu-driven package, and the
    files it creates are compatible with dBase III.
    
    EASY PROJECT supports up to 20 user-defined project phases and an
    unlimited number of resources.  It uses variable-scale Gantt charts to
    show planned-versus-actual dates of completion, and has extensive
    reporting abilities.  It has two automatic installation programs, which
    simplify the setup process for either hard disk or dual floppy disk
    installations, and 11 pages of understandable documentation.
