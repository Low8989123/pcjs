## Information about "QBSCR SCREEN ROUTINES 3OF3 (1712,1713)"

    Want to make your screen displays look like the professional programs,
    fast and dazzling?  You can, with very little effort, using QBSCR
    SCREEN ROUTINES.
    
    QBSCR SCREEN ROUTINES is a collection of utilities for the
    discriminating QuickBASIC programmer.  With these routines, and very
    little effort, your own programs can be extremely professional in
    appearance.  The screen routines are especially useful if you are in a
    hurry.  The QBSCR package can cut development time of any project in
    half, since all the display routines are already written for you.
    Incorporate the QBSCR routines into your program with a single line of
    code, and all of the QBSCR resources are at your disposal.
    
    Screen routines are available for building menus, windows, banners,
    color control, pop-down windows, exploding/imploding displays, text
    input and control, etc.  You also get a complete ASCII color screen
    editor program to help you design complex screens for fast loading.  A
    demo program is included to demonstrate all the features available to
    your programs.
    
    The screen routines are more than just a toolbox, they can also fill the
    role of tutor.  By reading through the source code of these routines,
    you will quickly find yourself learning how to do new things with
    QuickBASIC.
