## Information about "CHECKEASE"

    CHECKEASE is an electronic checkbook that functions like a personal
    finance manager for the everyday tedious checkbook accounting details.
    CHECKEASE is fully menu-driven and intuitive to operate, with very
    little need to refer to printed documentation. First you establish an
    account (maximum of 18), which consists of bank name, address, etc., and
    account balance. Then you can select one of several options to perform
    against that account. You can write checks or make deposits and the
    account balance will be automatically adjusted. You can even mark
    checks as a tax item for use in calculating your yearly taxes. You can
    search for past checks and even void invalid checks. Deposit slips
    listing all of your deposits can be printed by this program.
    
    CHECKEASE has a bill paying feature that will automatically print out
    the monthly bills that need to be paid. When you establish an account
    you enter your monthly bills, creditor name, payment amount, account
    balance, etc., and CHECKEASE will maintain these personal account
    balances as you write checks for payments on these accounts. Various
    reports can also be printed, such as a listing of bills due and bills
    paid, a listing of all checks and deposits, a listing of outstanding
    checks and deposits, and a listing of tax category items.
