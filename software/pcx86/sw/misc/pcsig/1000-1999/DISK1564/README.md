## Information about "MAST MAIL"

    MAST MAIL's focus is on making the interaction between user
    and computer smooth and simple, yet it is an advanced and versatile
    mailing list manager.  The commands for elementary tasks essential to a
    mailing list, such as adding, editing, finding, and deleting data, are
    direct and straightforward.  More powerful features
    include an unlimited comment area for each record, user-definable group
    and company number fields, as well as prefix, suffix, and
    salutation fields.  There is even an undelete function.
    
    Clear menus list and describe the command options on the screen and
    point to the on-line manual, which is just one keystroke away.
    MAST MAIL also provides command level functionality for other
    essential tasks such as reports, labels, envelopes, Rolodex cards,
    merging, exporting, and importing.
    
    MAST MAIL works well as a contact, lead, or direct mail program for
    salespersons.  With MAST MAIL's comment field you can store and
    track pertinent information on each of your clients.  A complex
    record selection feature makes MAST MAIL a productive tool for
    anyone who needs to phone, write letters, or send memorandums to
    selected people in the database.  You can also create multiple
    lists that are separate from one another.
    
    MAST MAIL is also an automated on-line Rolodex card system.  Names,
    addresses and phone numbers can be accessed in a fraction of the
    time of conventional Rolodex cards.  MAST MAIL can even speed dial your
    phone with only the touch of two keys.
    
    Data files are fully compatible with dBase III/III+ data files,
    making it possible to use your MAST MAIL data with any other
    database program that makes use of this file structure.  For mail
    merge, the secondary merge format of WordPerfect is supported, as well
    as two merge formats for PC-Write.

                                  WARRANTY

Micro Automation Software Technologies makes no warranty of any kind, 
expressed or implied, including without limitation, any warranties of 
merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose.  If you use or 
evaluate MAST Mail you accept the program as it is, and agree that Micro

damage to any data, programs, or hardware, directly or indirectly, anywhere in 
the computer or system in which it is used. 

Micro Automation Software Technologies will not be liable to you for any 
damages, including any financial debts or losses, or other incidental or 
consequential damages arising out of your use or inability to use the program, 
or for any claim by any other party. 



                            LICENSE FOR MAST MAIL 


MAST Mail is not public domain software, nor is it free software.  MAST Mail 
is a Shareware product.  Non-Registered users are granted a limited license to 
use MAST Mail for evaluation purposes to determine if MAST Mast is suitable 
for their needs.  Use of MAST Mail except for evaluation purposes, requires 
registration.  Use of non-registered copies of MAST Mail beyond evaluation 
purposes by any person, business, or institution is forbidden.  

Registration of MAST Mail gives the user a license to use MAST Mail on one 
computer or terminal.  If MAST Mail is used on a multiuser network or 
computer, each terminal or computer workstation which uses MAST Mail must be 
registered. A registered user may use MAST Mail on another computer, but may 
not use MAST Mail on more than one computer at a time. 

No user may modify MAST Mail in any way, including but not limited to 
decompiling, disassembling or otherwise reverse engineering the program.

All users are granted a limited license to copy MAST Mail for the evaluation 
purposes of others if the following criteria are met:

    MAST Mail must be copied in unmodified form, complete with this file 
    (LICENSE.DOC), containing the license information,  and all batch and 
    archived files. 

    Archiving all of MAST Mails files into one file is permitted for 
    electronic bullentin board and electronic mailing purposes only.

    A maximum service charge of $10 may be charged by anyone distributing 
    MAST Mail.  Any such distribution fee is completely unrelated to the 
    registration fee of MAST Mail and does not make the user exempt from 
    paying the complete registration fee.

    If MAST Mail is distributed in conjunction with any other product(s)
    it must be made very clear to the consumer that MAST Mail is not a part 
    of the product(s), and that MAST Mail must be registered through MAST 
    only.

Operators of electronic bulletin boards, distributors of public domain 
software, distributors of user supported software, or any other distributor 
may distribute copies of MAST Mail as long as the above conditions are met. 

If you have any questions please write or call MAST.





                               REGISTRATION

Registration of MAST Mail gives you a license to use your version of MAST Mail 
indefinitely.  If you decide to use MAST Mail beyond evaluation purposes, 
register MAST Mail by sending $35 for each copy of MAST Mail which you use. 
Washington State residents add 7.8% sales tax. Registration gives you the 
legal right to use this program beyond evaluation purposes.  Bulk discount 
rates are as follows:  
                       10-19 copies = 10% discount
                       20-29 copies = 15% discount
                       30+   copies = 20% discount

To print out the registration form, run MAST Mail and press P at the first 
screen.

The registration fee does not include guaranteed phone support, but Micro 
Automation Software Technologies does try to make someone available as often 
as possible to accept phone calls.  Registered users or unregistered 
evaluators can call for any reason as long as the following criteria are 
observed: 

    It is understood that if no one is available who can answer your question 
    at the current time, or you leave a message on the answering machine, MAST  
    will not return your call if it is long distance.  You are welcome to try 
    back again later.  If the phone rings three times and you are calling long 
    distance, hang up or an answering machine may answer, and you will be 
    billed by your phone company. 

    All phone calls must be from Monday through Friday between 10:00 AM to 
    6:00 PM Pacific Time.  Note: if you call after 5:00 it might cost less,
    depending on your long distance company.

    Collect calls are not accepted.

    MAST will not be liable or responsible for the phone bills incurred by 
    calling MAST.  (509)-489-9650

                            LICENSE FOR MAST MAIL 


MAST Mail is not public domain software, nor is it free software.  MAST Mail 
is a Shareware product.  Non-Registered users are granted a limited license to 
use MAST Mail for evaluation purposes to determine if MAST Mast is suitable 
for their needs.  Use of MAST Mail except for evaluation purposes, requires 
registration.  Use of non-registered copies of MAST Mail beyond evaluation 
purposes by any person, business, or institution is forbidden.  

Registration of MAST Mail gives the user a license to use MAST Mail on one 
computer or terminal.  If MAST Mail is used on a multiuser network or 
computer, each terminal or computer workstation which uses MAST Mail must be 
registered. A registered user may use MAST Mail on another computer, but may 
not use MAST Mail on more than one computer at a time. 

No user may modify MAST Mail in any way, including but not limited to 
decompiling, disassembling or otherwise reverse engineering the program.

All users are granted a limited license to copy MAST Mail for the evaluation 
purposes of others if the following criteria are met:

    MAST Mail must be copied in unmodified form, complete with this file 
    (LICENSE.DOC), containing the license information,  and all batch and 
    archived files. 

    Archiving all of MAST Mails files into one file is permitted for 
    electronic bullentin board and electronic mailing purposes only.

    A maximum service charge of $10 may be charged by anyone distributing 
    MAST Mail.  Any such distribution fee is completely unrelated to the 
    registration fee of MAST Mail and does not make the user exempt from 
    paying the complete registration fee.

    If MAST Mail is distributed in conjunction with any other product(s)
    it must be made very clear to the consumer that MAST Mail is not a part 
    of the product(s), and that MAST Mail must be registered through MAST 
    only.

Operators of electronic bulletin boards, distributors of public domain 
software, distributors of user supported software, or any other distributor 
may distribute copies of MAST Mail as long as the above conditions are met. 

If you have any questions please write or call MAST.





                               REGISTRATION

Registration of MAST Mail gives you a license to use your version of MAST Mail 
indefinitely.  If you decide to use MAST Mail beyond evaluation purposes, 
register MAST Mail by sending $35 for each copy of MAST Mail which you use. 
Washington State residents add 7.8% sales tax. Registration gives you the 
legal right to use this program beyond evaluation purposes.  Bulk discount 
rates are as follows:  
                       10-19 copies = 10% discount
                       20-29 copies = 15% discount
                       30+   copies = 20% discount

To print out the registration form, run MAST Mail and press P at the first 
screen.

The registration fee does not include guaranteed phone support, but Micro 
Automation Software Technologies does try to make someone available as often 
as possible to accept phone calls.  Registered users or unregistered 
evaluators can call for any reason as long as the following criteria are 
observed: 

    It is understood that if no one is available who can answer your question 
    at the current time, or you leave a message on the answering machine, MAST  
    will not return your call if it is long distance.  You are welcome to try 
    back again later.  If the phone rings three times and you are calling long 
    distance, hang up or an answering machine may answer, and you will be 
    billed by your phone company. 

    All phone calls must be from Monday through Friday between 10:00 AM to 
    6:00 PM Pacific Time.  Note: if you call after 5:00 it might cost less,
    depending on your long distance company.

    Collect calls are not accepted.

    MAST will not be liable or responsible for the phone bills incurred by 
    calling MAST.  (509)-489-9650
