NEWSLETTER: First-time registration includes a four-issue subscription to our

                             IMPORTANT INFORMATION

   All our "Unusual Software" products are sold as shareware. This is a "try
before you buy" system; you may use the trial version of a program for a
limited period (usually 2 to 3 weeks) to evaluate it. If you like the pro-
gram, you are expected to register your use by paying the registration fee.
As a registered user, you receive the most advanced version of the program.
Trial versions of our programs are distributed by most shareware disk
vendors, who generally charge between $1 and $8 per disk. (This fee is for
the distribution service only; it is not paid to us, and is not part of the
registration fee.) You may also obtain the trial version of any of our pro-
ducts by sending a double-sided, double-density 5 1/4" diskette in a sturdy,
reusable mailer with sufficient return postage (enough postage for a 4-ounce,
first-class letter for the first 1 or 2 disks; an additional first class
stamp for each subsequent disk. Send 3 disks for Creativity Package). If you
don't want to bother with disks and postage, send $5 for the trial version of
1 disk, $7 for 2, $8 for 3, and $1 for each additional disk. The trial
version is a fully-functioning program, but in some cases may lack some of
the extra features of the registered version. If you don't like the program,
you are free to erase it, or pass it on to someone else to try. Otherwise,
you can send in the fee and get the registered version. Of course, you may
register a program without going through the trial version first. In a few
cases, there are no additional features in the registered version, but you
still must register if you like and use the program. Registered users receive
support by mail, a newsletter with upgrade notifications, as well as special
discount and bonus offers.
   We distribute a limited selection of shareware and public domain programs
from other authors. The fee paid to us for these "Bonus Disks" is for our
copying and distribution service. It is not paid to the authors and is not
part of the registration fee. See the Bonus Disk section for details.
   Note that some programs are "ARCed". This means that in order to fit
several large files on a single disk, a special archiving (compressing)
process has been used. The files must be un-arced before use. We provide the
un-arcing program.
   Before ordering software, read the description carefully, and pay special
attention to the system requirements. Some programs require a hard disk,
graphics capability, or additional memory. As far as we know, our software
will run on most "IBM compatible" personal computers. However, since equip-
ment configurations vary greatly, we cannot guarantee correct results for
everyone. If you have a problem, please let us know.

                                   HOW TO ORDER:

REGISTRATION is $6 for Penname, $10 for Cliche Finder or Curses, $19 for
Crystal Ball. Registration for M-LABEL is $10 if you are a registered user of
MAILLIST, $39 if you are not. WORKBASE registration is $49. All other
programs are $29 each. MAILLIST and THUNDER THOUGHT (part of Creativity
Package) registrations include source code. Source code is NOT provided for
other programs. CURSES! registration includes a free bonus disk.

Take $5 off your registration if you send a double-sided, double-density
5 1/4" diskette in a sturdy, reusable mailer with sufficient return postage.
(For POETRY GENERATOR, send 2 disks.) Postage should be the same amount
needed for a 4-ounce, first-class letter for the first 1 or 2 disks, and an
additional first-class stamp for each subsequent disk. This discount does NOT
apply to CREATIVITY PACKAGE, MAILLIST, or programs with registration fees
less than $20, and is not to be combined with other discounts. If you want
the discount, don't skimp on the stamps! The disk mailer you send is the one
we will return to you.

If you are already a registered user of one or more products from our
"Unusual Software" catalog (not Bonus Disks), take $5 off your registration
of any new program. (Discount does not apply TO MAILLIST, CREATIVITY PACKAGE,
or programs with registration under $18, and may not be combined with any
other discount offer.)

BONUS DISKS: $3 for each disk. Add a $3 shipping fee to your total order.
(Shipping fee applies only when Bonus Disks are ordered.) This is not
registration, just a copying fee. Registration should be paid to the authors
of the programs.

FOREIGN ORDERS: Countries other than Canada, please add $4 for special
postage and handling. Unfortunately, we are unable to handle foreign funds.
Payment must be in U.S. dollars, payable through a U.S. bank. Canadian postal
money orders in U.S. funds are also acceptable.

RUSH ORDERS: We usually fill orders within 2 working days of receipt. How
long it takes the mail to travel between you and us is out of our hands. If
you feel that you MUST have your order right away, you can add $10 for
overnight mail (U.S.A. only).

3 1/5" DISKS: We normally provide 5 1/4" disks. If you must have 3 1/5"
disks, please include an extra $1.00 per disk. Under no circumstances will we
ship unregistered versions on 3 1/5" disks.

NOTE: Some users have reported compatibility problems with the utility used
to un-arc large files (this is rare). If you prefer to receive un-arced
programs, please include an extra $3 per disk to cover special handling and
materials.

All prices and discounts listed in this bulletin expire 6/30/90. We reserve
the right to change product descriptions, system requirements and other
information without notice, and to modify or rescind any discounts or special
offers at any time.                               BONUS DISKS

We are not the authors of these programs, nor are we associated with the
authors in any way other than as a distributor of the programs in accordance
with the authors' terms of distribution. Some of these programs require a
shareware registration fee from satisfied users. Our $3.00 fee per disk is a
payment for copying and distributing the disks; it is not the registration
fee. Please direct shareware registration payments and specific questions
about these programs to the authors whose names appear in the documentation.

Most of the files on these disks have been archived in order to fit more
files on a single disk. Archiving (also known as compressing) creates a file
with the extension ARC (or ZIP). The compressed file may contain several
related files. To use these files, you must un-compress them. An un-
compressing utility is included on each disk for your convenience.

These programs have been tested, but due to the many possible hardware and
software configurations, we cannot guarantee that any program will run on any
particular system. We do not warrant these programs in any way. If we provide
you with an unreadable disk, you may return it for a replacement copy of the
same disk. Read the file descriptions carefully; some of these programs have
special requirements.

ARCE Command                                          Version 3.1c
------------                                          Feb 06, 1988
Purpose:  Use ARCE to extract files from an ARC archive file.
Format:
      ARCE  [d:][path]filename.ext  [filespecs...] [d:outpath]
                                    [/R]
                                    [/Q]
                                    [/P]
                                    [/T]
                                    [/Gpassword]
Remarks:
      The drive and path names are optional. If omitted, the  current
      drive and path name is used.
      The filename must be  supplied. The extension defaults  to ARC.
      All files matching the supplied filename are processed. The ARC
      filename may contain the * and ? wildcard characters.
      If  no  filespecs  are   supplied,  all  files  are   extracted.
      Otherwise, only those ARC members  which match one of the  up to
      16 filespecs are extracted.
      The extracted files  may be placed  on another drive,  and/or in
      another subdirectory by following the optional filespecs with  a
      drive designator and/or path name.
      If  the  file  being  extracted  already  exists,  you are asked
      whether or not you want to over-write it. You may use the |  /R
      option to bypass this prompt. Use a Y followed by the |  return
      key to over-write the file.
      Use the /Q option to suppress alarm sounds, beeps, and bells.
      Use  the  /P  option  to  write  the  extracted files to the DOS
      standard output  file. With  /P, you  may pipe  or redirect the
      output. An initial line feed  is added to the beginning  of the
      output file.
      Use the /T option to test the archive's integrity. No files will
      be extracted.
      If the file was encrypted, use the /G option to supply the  same
      password as was used to create the file, e.g. /GSECRET.

      o  Extract  all  files  from  all  ARC files in the subdirectory
         called TEST on drive C:
            ARCE C:\TEST\*
      o  Extract  all  files  from  PROGA.ARC  and  place the files in
         subdirectory OLD on drive B:

      o  Extract all files with an extension of .COM and .EXE from the
         archive PROGS.ARC in directory NEW\WORK on drive B, and place
         the  them  in  subdirectory  SAVE\TEST  on  drive  A; replace
         existing file:
            ARCE B:\NEW\WORK\PROGS *.COM *.EXE A:\SAVE\TEST /R
      o  Extract  the  file  READ.ME  from  the  archive GIZMO.ARC and

                      Error Messages
                      --------------
    'filename - premature EOF reading '
      Data  is  missing  from  the  archive  file.  The  program   is

    'filename - unable to set file datestamp'
      The file datestamp is set to the current date and time, and  the
      next archive member is processed.

      is left on the disk for your examination.
    'Invalid filespec(s)'
      The filespec syntax is incorrect. The filename part may be from
      1  to  eight  characters,  and  may  include the ? or * wildcard
      characters. The extension may be none to three characters,  and
      may  include  wildcards.  There  is  a  maximum of 16 filespecs
      allowed. The program terminates.
    'filename - file already exists. Overwrite it? (y/N) '
      The member being extracted already  exists. If you are using  a
      data  path  utility,  the  file  may  not  actually  be  in  the
      subdirectory be used for output.  Respond with the letter Y  to
      over-write the existing  file, or respond  with the letter  N to
      skip this member and continue to the next.
    'Abort: Stack overflow'
      The member  being extracted  has invalid  data. The  program is
      terminated.
    'filename - invalid decode tree count'
      The member  being extracted  has invalid  data. The  program is
      terminated.
    'filename - new archive format 7 not yet supported'
      Format 7 is a special file compression method used internally by
      SEA,  the  authors  of  ARC. Processing continues with the next
      archive member.
    'Unable to open archive > arcname'
      The  specified  ARC   archive  file  was   not  found,  or   was
      inaccessible. The program terminates.
    'CREATE failed > filename'
      There was insufficient directory  space, or a failure  accessing
      the output disk. The program terminates.
      'Invalid archive format!'
      The archive file data is invalid. The program terminates.
    'Incorrect DOS version'
      Version  2.0  or  later  of  PC  DOS  must be used. The program
      terminates
    'Not enough memory.'
      A minimum  of 112k  bytes of  memory is  required. The  program
      terminates.
    'I/O error reading from arcname'
      An incorrectable error occurred attempting to read data from the
      archive file. The program terminates.
    'I/O error writing or disk full > filename'
      There was not  enough disk space  to write the  complete archive
      member.  The  partially  extracted  file  is  scratched and the
      program terminates.
    'No matching file(s) found'
      No archive files were  found that matched the  supplied filename
      specifications. The program terminates.
    'filename - ERROR: invalid file codes'
      An error was detected while attempting to decode a crunched
      file. Either some data bytes are invalid, there are extra
      bytes, or there are bytes missing. The archive is invalid.

                  IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THESE DISKS

   BEFORE YOU START: Make backup copies of your disks. (See the DISKCOPY
command in your DOS manual.) Put the original disks in a safe place, and
use the copies for all work. If you are upgrading from an older version
of a program, make backup copies of all your old data files before you
install the new version. Files with the extensions DBF, DBT, and MEM
contain essential data. Files with the NTX extension are index files.
Some programs also create special text files which you may want to back
up.

   ARCHIVE FILES: Sometimes there are too many files to fit on a single
floppy disk. These programs are compressed and stored in special archive
files with the extension ARC or ZIP. Before you can use the program, you
must extract the files from the archive. We have provided the extraction
utility.
   If you are using a 2-floppy system, look for a file named FLOPPY.BAT
or DOTWO.BAT. Start from the A> prompt, with the master disk in the A
drive. Be prepared with 2 or 3 empty, formatted diskettes. Enter the
appropriate command, depending on the file you found. For example, if
you have FLOPPY.BAT, type FLOPPY and press <ENTER>. Follow the instruc-
tions on screen, which will tell you when to insert your floppy disks
into the B drive.
   If you are using a hard disk, be sure you have created the subdirec-
tory where you want the program to be kept. Look for a program named
ARCE.COM or UNZIP.EXE or PKUNZIP.EXE. Starting from the correct subdi-
rectory, at the C> prompt, with the diskette in the A drive, enter the
appropriate command. For example, if your archive file has the ARC
extension, you should have the program ARCE.COM. Your command will look
something like this: A:ARCE A:FORTUNE. (Instead of "fortune" use the
actual name of the archive file.) The program will automatically un-com-
press the files and place them in the current subdirectory.
   In some cases, you may have "self-extracting" archive files. These do
not require a separate utility, but will un-compress themselves. They
look like ordinary program files with the EXE extension, but can be
identified by the @ symbol in the filename. To use a self-extracting
archive, first log onto the drive and directory where you want to place
the uncompressed files. For example, if you have a two-floppy system,
you might want to place your master disk containing the archive into the
A drive, and then log onto the B drive with an empty, formatted disk. If
you are using a hard disk, create the subdirectory for the new files,
and then log into the subdirectory, with the archive disk in the A
drive. If the archive name is WAURA@.EXE, you will type A:WAURA@ and
press <ENTER>. Self-extraction will occur automatically. (Note to floppy
disk users: There may be more than one self-extracting archive on a
single disk. You must use a separate, empty, formatted diskette for each
such archive.)

   DOCUMENTATION AND INSTRUCTIONS: Most of our instruction manuals are
in special program files which allow you to view the manual on screen or
print it. These files have the COM extension, and usually have "DOC"
somewhere in the filename. Simply enter the appropriate command. For
example, if you have the program BY THE NUMBERS, the instruction manual
is called NUMDOC.COM. To view the manual, type NUMDOC and press <ENTER>.
You can page through the document on screen, or print it by pressing
<ALT><H>. For a list of helpful commands, press <F1>.
   Files which have the DOC or TXT extension are ASCII format files
(also called DOS text files) which can be viewed or printed using DOS
commands. For example, if you have a typical setup, you can print a
document called CATALOG.DOC using this command: TYPE CATALOG.DOC > LPT1:
   To view this file on screen, you would enter: TYPE CATALOG.DOC | MORE
   You can also view and print this kind of file with most word proces-
sors, using the format for "ASCII", "DOS text" or "Non-document" files.

   PROGRAM FILES: Program files can be identified by the extension EXE
or COM after the file name. To run the program, simply type its name.
For example, you have a program named WORKBASE.EXE, type WORKBASE and
press <ENTER>.
   SOURCE CODE: Registered versions of a few programs come with source
code. You do not need the source code just to run the program; you can
delete it from the disk to make more room. Source code files have the
extensions PRG, BAS, and OBJ.
   DATA FILES: Some programs create data files, with the extensions DBF,
DBT, NTX and MEM. These are important and should be backed up regularly.
Some programs also create special text files which you may also want to
back up.

   HARD DISK OR FLOPPY: Your programs will run much faster on a hard
disk than they do on a floppy. Also, some programs build large data
files which may grow as you use the program and eventually fill a floppy
disk. We recommend using a hard disk. POETRY GENERATOR requires a hard
disk, and MAILLIST and WORKBASE are much easier to use on a hard disk.
Any program which uses data files (those with the DBF and DBT exten-
sions) is best when used on a hard disk.

   NEW VERSIONS: Sometimes a new version of a program will ask your per-
mission to update your data files. Do not answer "yes" unless you have
already made a backup copy of your data. Don't copy the backed-up data
back into the directory after the files have been updated.
   CREATIVITY PACKAGE:  Disk #1 contains the complete text of Thomas A.
Easton's book, "Think Thunder! And Unleash Your Creativity". To read it,
use the command READIT, or you can read each chapter separately by
typing the chapter name (see the disk for file name). Disk #2 contains
the program THUNDER THOUGHT, and disk #3 contains VERSIFIER.
   POETRY GENERATOR: The registered version is distributed on two disks,
containing different archive files. All the files from both disks are
needed for the program to run correctly.
   BONUS DISKS: We are not the authors of these programs. Please direct
shareware payments and technical questions about a program to the author
whose name appears in the documentation. If you have trouble reaching an
author, we will do what we can to help you. All programs have been
tested. Because hardware and software configurations vary, we cannot
guarantee satisfactory results. We do not warrant these programs in any
way. To report a problem, please write a letter describing the problem
in detail, including information about your system. We cannot debug
these programs over the phone.

   Thank you for your interest in our UNUSUAL SOFTWARE. We support our
registered users. If you have questions, comments, complaints or
compliments, please write to us. Have fun!

                                 BAD DISK?

   It seems that in hot weather we are more likely to get complaints
about "bad" or unreadable disks. Floppy disks are susceptible to heat,
moisture and magnetism. A disk that sits all day in a hot mailbox or
truck where temperatures exceed 100 degrees is likely to be damaged.
Disks which have been exposed to magnetism in their travels may contain
unreadable files.
   Before assuming that a disk is bad, try reading it on a different
computer, if possible. It may be that your drive heads are dirty or
slightly misaligned. Suspect this if you frequently get disk error mes-
sages with many different disks. An inexpensive head cleaning kit may
help solve your problem.
   Sometimes the round disk gets trapped inside its square casing and
generates an error message because it can't rotate freely. Remove the
disk from the drive and tap each of the four sides sharply on the sur-
face of your desk. This may loosen the disk. Try reading the disk again.
   Norton Utilities and Mace Utilities both have features that can some-
times revive unreadable disks. We have had good results with Norton. Any
serious computer user should have one of these utility packages.
   In any case, if we have sent you an unreadable disk, we will be happy
to exchange it for a fresh copy of the same program.

                               ERROR MESSAGES

   It may happen that when you run a program, you will get an error mes-
sage something like this: Open File Error DESC.NTX (4)
   The "4" is DOS's cryptic way of telling you that the program has
tried to open more files than DOS can handle at once. To solve this
problem, you need to check the CONFIG.SYS file in your root directory.
This file should contain the following lines:

   files=20
   buffers=20

   If the numbers are smaller then 20, or if these lines are missing
from the file, you will need to edit it. If you don't have a CONFIG.SYS
file, you will need to create one. (Note that some systems and networks
may require numbers larger then 20. Check your system user's manual.)
   CONFIG.SYS must be a pure ASCII file. You can edit or create this
file using Edlin or any pure ASCII text editor. Most word processors
allow you to save files in ASCII format. (This may be referred to as a
DOS Text File. WordStar may call it "non-document".) Remember, the file
must be in ASCII format and must be in the root directory on your C
drive. If you boot with a DOS diskette in the A drive, the CONFIG.SYS
file must be in the root directory of the disk you use to boot.
   When you have corrected the CONFIG.SYS file, reboot your system and
try running the program again.
   In case you are confused and can't create a CONFIG.SYS file for your-
self, we distribute a free program called DOCONFIG which will edit or
create your CONFIG.SYS file as needed. If you would like a copy of this
program, please send a double-sided, double-density, 5 1/4" diskette in
a sturdy, reusable mailer with three first-class stamps. If you don't
want to bother with the disk and mailer, send $5.00 instead. (Sorry,
DOCONFIG is not available on 3 1/4" disks.)

                               "0" ERROR

   On rare occasions, you may see an error message similar to this one:
Open File Error NUMBERS.NTX (0)
   The number 0 and the NTX extension in the file name indicate that the
problem is a corrupted or damaged index file. Most of our programs will
automatically recreate missing index files. So, simply delete the file
in question (make sure you delete only files with the NTX extension) and
try running the program again. Some programs also have a reindexing
choice on the menu which allows you to re-create the indexes whenever
you like.

                               OTHER ERRORS

   There are many possible reasons why a program might occasionally pro-
duce an error message. In most cases, errors are not serious, and they
usually have a simple solution. If you don't understand what the error
message means, or if you don't know how to solve the problem, we can
help you.
   Make an exact, complete copy of the error message (a print-screen is
best). As soon as the error happens, write down what you were doing (or
trying to do) at the time. Have you been able to do the same thing in
the past without getting an error? Have you seen a similar error before?
Make a note of any keys you may have pressed just before the error oc-
curred. Do you think you know what may have caused the error? Could it
be related to changes in your system, a new version of the program, or
something unusual you did? Send us the information, and we will let you
know what needs to be done to correct or avoid the error.
