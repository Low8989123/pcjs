## Information about "SPACE SHUTTLE TRACKING SYSTEM"

    Look to the heavens to find the space shuttle, but first consult your
    computer and the SPACE SHUTTLE TRACKING SYSTEM. You don't have to be an
    astronaut to successfully chart the course of the space shuttle and
    figure out what time of night it will be visible overhead. You'll be
    shown the flight pattern taken around the world on an impressive looking
    map of the globe. You can plot the shuttle's location for any specified
    time into the flight, or watch the shuttle's progress during the real-
    time simulation of the flight. You can also speed up the flight to
    watch a simulation of several hours of flight time in just a few
    minutes.
    
    This program is great for all ages. It doesn't require you to
    understand longitude and latitude lines, but merely asks for some basic
    flight information which varies with every flight: direction of the
    launch, orbit time or altitude, and inclination. This information is
    readily available through the media prior to the launch. By looking at
    the orbit charted on the map of the world, you can accurately predict
    when the shuttle will be overhead in your area. An excellent tool for
    science students or space enthusiasts.
