## Information about "BLACK MAGIC 1 OF 3 (ALSO 1121, 1122)"

    Wordprocessors, databases and spreadsheets all manipulate and structure
    information in specific, but different ways.  Hypertext systems, such as
    BLACK MAGIC, enable you to expand information in another way -- by
    dynamically linking keywords, graphics and blocks of information to one
    another.
    
    For example, you are creating a document and need to define a concept or
    word but the detail of the definition would distract the reader from the
    main text.  You can tag a keyword that will indicate that the definition
    is available.  An area of the screen opens and you type the definition
    or explanation.  To explore the definition, the user triggers the tag
    and the reference is displayed.  This is a simple illustration of
    hypertext.
    
    BLACK MAGIC can shell to DOS, and link and transfer information between
    hypertext and other applications.  Build context-sensitive help systems,
    link specific items in text documents to technical drawings or
    illustrations and expand obscure references with detailed explanations.
    A screen grabber has been added to integrate graphics into BLACK MAGIC.
    The extended ASCII character set is supported for the use of
    international characters.
    
    If you are currently using a document generator for live electronic
    documents such as:  computer-based training guides, foreign language
    tutorials, interactive catalogs, or educational courseware, then you
    should be moving over to BLACK MAGIC hypertext writing.  You will find
    BLACK MAGIC to be more than you ever imagined.
