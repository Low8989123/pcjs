## Information about "IT'S A CRIME"

    It's the late 1990's in New York City.  You're a gang leader determined
    to build your gang into one of the richest, toughest and most notorious
    in the city on your way to becoming the Godfather.  Compete with up to
    500 other players, some of whom will be your enemies, while others will
    be your staunchest allies.  Each turn, you will decide how to allocate
    your resources, what moves you should make.  Mail your "turn card" with
    your moves.  A computer will then process your information and send you
    a "results" sheet.  It's your move!

                                  User's Manual
                            Version 1.5 - August 1989
                                By Bruce H. Graw

        INTRODUCTION

             The  IAC! Utility is a program designed to help the  general
        It's A Crime! gang leader plan his strategies and enter his turns
        from  week to week.  It keeps track of the last reported  statis-
        tics  of  blocks, makes suggestions of which  blocks  to  perform
        actions  on, and automatically calculates how many men  and  guns
        are being sent on each order and how many points of strength  you
        are  attacking with.  What's more, the program is so easy to  use
        that  even an inexperienced computer user can use it to make  his
        life as a gang leader easier.
             Before reading this manual, you should be familiar with  the
        It's  a  Crime! game itself.  If you don't already  know  how  to
        play,  print  out  the IAC! Rules (IACRULES.TXT),  found  on  the
        program  disk,  and read through them.  You might  also  want  to
        print one or more of the sample gang files (.TXT files that begin
        with GANG followed by a number) and the TURNCARD.TXT file.  These
        are all you need to have to get started with It's A Crime!

        STARTING THE PROGRAM

             The program (IAC.EXE), this help file (IACMAN.TXT), and  all
        gang data files (which end in the extension .IAC) must be on  the
        current  drive of your computer.  I recommend you copy them  (and
        all files on the IAC! Utility disk) to a hard disk in a  specific
        directory,  to make access time faster.  However, they will  work
        from a floppy drive without any problems.  Remember, if you use a
        hard  drive,  you must be in the directory with  your  gang  data
        files in order to use them properly.
             To start the IAC! Utility, type IAC followed by a space  and
        your game number.  For example, if you are running a gang in game
        number  35, enter IAC 35 and hit Return.  This accesses the  data
        files for game number 35.  These files are named MAP, GANGS,  and
        CARD,  each followed by the game number and the  .IAC  extension.
        For example, the map data file for game #35 would be MAP35.IAC.
             Note that you are not required to use a game number.  If you
        don't, a null (blank) game number is assumed.  However, I  recom-
        mend  you use the number in case you should ever start  a  second
        game while the first is still going.  This will avoid  confusion,
        since  you  will need two separate sets of data files  for  these
        different games.
             If  you  have two or more gangs in the same  game,  you  can
        store the information for each under the same game number.  There
        is  no  need to use different numbers when loading  the  program,
        unless your gangs are in different games.  This is to your advan-
        tage,  as  it enables gangs in the same game  to  cooperate,  and
        helps you avoid any duplication of effort.





                                        1




        THE DATA FILES

             The  Utility  will start by reading in information  on  your
        gang  from  the  data files  MAP.IAC,  GANGS.IAC,  and  CARD.IAC.
        (Remember  that  the  game number you used  when  activating  the
        program will precede the .IAC extension, as previously described,
        as in MAP35.IAC.)  The MAP file holds all the data on the map  of
        the  city as you have entered it so far.  The GANGS  file  stores
        the names and numbers of all gangs you have met during the course
        of  the  game.  Finally, the CARD file keeps a copy of  the  last
        turn  card and gang statistics you entered for this  game.   That
        way,  if you have to quit while filling in a turn card,  you  can
        come  back to it later and not have to re-enter  the  information
        again.
             IMPORTANT:  The IAC! Utility saves changes to your data only
        when  you quit the program or use the "V" command.  If  you  just
        turn the computer off, or hit Control-Break, the data will NOT be
        saved  and you'll have to re-enter it.  Of course, sometimes  you
        may want this to happen, if you've made a terrible mistake  some-
        where, but aborting like that should be used with caution.
             If any of the data files do not exist, the information  they
        normally  store will be blank.  Thus, if you are starting  a  new
        game, the map, gang list, and turn card will contain no  informa-
        tion.   The same thing will happen if you delete these files,  so
        be  careful.  All Utility data files end in the suffix  .IAC  for
        easy copying.

        USING THE PROGRAM

             Once  you've started the program, you will see a map on  the
        screen.   This map is a 5x5 view of the city, as though you  were
        on  a  helicopter  flying above the buildings,  looking  down  on
        glorious New York.  The next question you'll have is, "What do  I
        do now?"
             At  this point the IAC! Utility is waiting for you to  enter
        commands.  To enter a command, press a single key on the  keypad.
        For  example,  pressing "?" will display the Utility's  Help,  an
        online  list of commands.  "?" should be used whenever  you  need
        your memory refreshed as to what keys perform what actions.
             The  IAC  Utility's commands are further  described  in  the
        following sections.

        MOVING AROUND IN THE CITY

             Every  square you see on the screen is a block of the  city.
        The numbers on the right and bottom are the X- and  Y-coordinates
        of  these blocks.  You read across the bottom for the  first  two
        numbers  (the X-coordinate) of any block, then up along the  side
        for the second number pair, the Y-coordinate.
             To  view  any block, you first have to get to it  by  moving
        around in your "helicopter."  You can go directly to any block by
        using  the "G" command.  This will prompt you for a block  number
        to go to.  Enter the 4-digit number (no commas) and press Return.
        The map will shift to a view of the correct block, which will  be
        in  the  center of the screen.  The block in the  middle  of  the


                                        2




        screen, which will also be highlighted if it contains any  infor-
        mation, is the one all later operations will affect.
             Another  way to get to a block is to use the arrow  keys  on
        your  computer's keypad.  This will move up, down, left or  right
        in the city depending on which arrow you pressed.  Note that  you
        cannot  move outside the edges of the city, even though  you  can
        see  squares in those directions.  If you don't have a keypad  on
        your  computer,  use "H" to move left, "J" to move down,  "K"  to
        move up, and "L" to move right.

        BLOCK EDITING

             Once you're at the block you want, you can press "E" to edit
        it.   You will be asked several questions about the  contents  of
        the block, described in the following paragraphs.

             OWNER:  Enter the NUMBER of the gang who owns the block  and
        press  Return.   If  it's uncontrolled, enter "-"  instead  of  a
        number.  If the police own it, enter "Police".
             If you enter a gang number the computer doesn't know  about,
        it  will prompt you to enter the name of the gang.  Type  in  the
        name  and  hit Return.  Now the computer knows the name  of  that
        gang  and won't ask you for it any more, and it will appear  next
        to the owner number in the block on the map.
             Note:  You can enter any information you want in this  space
        (not  necessarily a number), but if you don't use a gang  number,
        the  block  will  not work properly with the  control  or  ambush
        selection commands, and it won't count the block when determining
        gang statistics such as block income.

             DEFENSE LEVEL:  Enter the NUMERIC code for the defense level
        of  the block.  These are listed on the Map/House Rules card  you
        received  with  your IAC! Rulebook.  So you don't  have  to  look
        these  up, they are shown in a box in the upper right  corner  of
        the screen when this question is being asked.  Remember that  the
        lower  a defense level, the better chance you will have  at  suc-
        ceeding in any action you attempt on that block.

             BUILDING  INFORMATION:  When asked, enter the percentage  of
        each set of buildings on the block and hit Return, followed by  a
        NUMERIC  code  for the type of building.  Numeric codes  will  be
        listed  in the upper right hand corner of the screen.  Note  that
        there is no need to type in the dollar value of the block, as the
        IAC! Utility automatically calculates and displays this for you!

             FIREBOMB/ROB/MUG:   This is a set of three "flags"  you  can
        use  to note whether or not you have performed any of  these  ac-
        tions  on a block recently.  If you enter "F" here, for  example,
        it  will toggle the firebombing flag so that an F will appear  on
        the  block to remind you not to bomb it again for a  while.   You
        can  enter any combination of "F", "R", and "M" as an  answer  to
        this  question; for example, "FM" will turn on both the  firebomb
        and mugging flags.
             If  you just hit Return here, the current set of flags  will
        remain unchanged.  To clear the flags, enter a "-" by itself.


                                        3





             After you've entered all the answers to these questions, the
        editing function is complete and the Utility will display the new
        block  information  on the map.  The owner of the  block  appears
        first, followed by the buildings, defense level, and F/R/M  flags
        (if set).  You will also see the value of the block in the  lower
        right corner, as calculated automatically by the computer.
             If  something  on a block has changed, you can use  the  "E"
        command again to modify it.  When editing, if you just hit Return
        to  answer any question (without entering any  information),  the
        current  info for that question will not be changed.
             You can also edit a specific part of a block without  having
        to answer all the questions by using any of these commands:

                         "C" - Edit block owner
                         "D" - Edit block defense level
                         "P" - Edit building percentages
                         "F" - Edit F/R/M flags

        SUGGESTIONS

             If you are looking around for a block to perform a  specific
        action  on,  the IAC! Utility can help you out.  Built  into  the
        program are several commands that suggest possible blocks to use.
        These  commands are all used by holding down on the  control  key
        while  pressing the required letter.  To remind you of this  they
        are designated with a caret, for example, "^F".

             ROBBERY:   To suggest a block to rob, use the "^R"  command.
        The Utility will look for any block with a low defense level that
        contains  office  or financial buildings.  It won't  suggest  any
        blocks more than 25 away from any block you own, or that you have
        noted  with  the R flag as having recently robbed.
             By  the way, before any of these commands you may  be  asked
        what gang you are.  This is because the program has to know where
        your  blocks are located so it won't suggest blocks farther  than
        25  away from your turf.  Enter the NUMBER of your gang  and  hit
        Return.   The  Utility won't ask you this  if  you've  previously
        entered  it, and it can be changed at any time with the "I"  com-
        mand.

             ARSON:   You can find a block to firebomb by using the  "^F"
        command.   Blocks  suggested will always have  industrial,  ware-
        house,  religious, school, or police buildings, and will  have  a
        defense  level of 4 or less.  They will also be within 25  blocks
        of your turf and mustn't have an F flag turned on.
             Note:  You get money from bombing warehouses and  industrial
        buildings,  and  notoriety for the others mentioned  above.   The
        larger percentage of block you can use, the better, but make sure
        you have enough bombs!
             Note  also that it isn't easy to find a police block with  a
        defense level less than Invulnerable, but it can be done!  Figur-
        ing out how to accomplish this feat (and what to do with it  when
        you have) is one of the more interesting side attractions of this
        game.


                                        4





             MUGGING:  Blocks that the Utility will suggest for  muggings
        (when  you use the "^G" command) contain restaurants,  entertain-
        ment,  retail, or apartments, and have a low defense  level.   As
        you might expect, they also won't be selected if they are too far
        away  or  have been recently mugged.  You never get much  from  a
        mugging, but it's good for gang promotions.

             CONTROL:   The IAC! Utility is capable of suggesting  blocks
        for you to control whenever you press "^C".  These will always be
        adjacent  to  one of your blocks, but there is no  defense  level
        requirement, plus they can be owned by anyone.

             AMBUSH:  If you use the "^A" command, the Utility will  look
        for  a block controlled by a gang you specify (it  will  actually
        ask  you  which gang to ambush, and you can get a list  of  known
        gangs  by entering a "?").  If there is no such block  within  25
        blocks  of  your turf, the suggest command  will  fail.   Defense
        levels have no effect on which block is selected.

             NICE:   The Utility can choose blocks to be nice to  if  you
        use  the "^N" command.  These will always be blocks you  own  and
        will  contain  either firebombable or robbable  buildings.   They
        will always have a high defense level (at least 6) to make  being
        nice  worthwhile.  If you ever manage to control a  police  block
        (which is possible, by the way), these may also be selected.
             The  Utility does not keep track of which game week you  are
        currently on, as this has very little effect on play.  Be  aware,
        however, that Nice orders (and certain others) do not work before
        week 5 or after Boss Level has started.

             Note  that the IAC! Utility does not attempt to suggest  the
        BEST  block, only an ACCEPTABLE block to use with the  above  or-
        ders.   Thus,  some of your own judgment will be  required.   For
        example, you will get more money by firebombing a larger percent-
        age  of buildings, so if it suggests several blocks,  you  should
        pick  the one with the larger percentage of industrial  or  ware-
        houses on it.
             The  IAC! Utility knows only the basic parameters  of  block
        percentages and defense levels, and cannot know other  attributes
        of  the database used by IAC!.  Thus, on occasion an  order  will
        fail  on  a  block this program suggests.  The  author  takes  no
        responsibility  for  such  failures.  Determining  which  of  the
        suggested blocks to use, and why, is YOUR decision.

        OTHER COMMANDS

             The following miscellaneous commands are also available:

             GANG  STATS:   You can enter the statistics  for  your  gang
        (amount of pros, punks, 'cruits, shotguns, submachine guns, small
        bombs,  streetdope,  walkie-talkies, and morale)  using  the  "S"
        command.  After entering the correct stats, the program tells you
        your total gang strength, calculated as the attack factors of all
        men  and  weapons added together.   (Walkie-talkies  are  special


                                        5




        items not available until around game week 15.)
             Note  that while asking you these questions, you will see  a
        number in brackets, such as [0].  This is the "default value" for
        that statistic and indicates its current value.  If you just  hit
        Return  without  entering a new value, this amount  will  not  be
        changed (the old value, between the brackets, will be retained).

             IDENTIFY  YOURSELF:  This command, "I", is used to  let  the
        computer  know  which gang you are playing.  Type the  NUMBER  of
        your  gang, not the name!  This information is required for  var-
        ious  actions  such as block suggestion commands.   Normally  you
        will  only  have to tell the computer who you are one  time  (the
        first  time you run the IAC! Utility), unless you are starting  a
        new game, or are playing more than one gang in the same game  and
        switching  between them.  In this latter case, be sure to  change
        your gang stats as well before trying to create a Turn Card.
             After  you enter your gang number, you will be shown a  page
        of statistics on your gang.  This includes the normal  statistics
        entered with the "S" command, as well as a breakdown of your gang
        strength,  the last gang you were suggested to ambush,  how  many
        blocks  you own, your total block income and gang  expenses,  and
        how many blocks are entered in the computer's memory.  Be sure to
        check  these  stats, especially the number of  blocks  and  block
        income,  as they are a handy way of locating errors in your  data
        entry, as well as turf changes that occurred between turns.
             You might notice that on this page the Gang Expenses may not
        match  the  similar stat shown on your Results  Sheet.   This  is
        because on the Results Sheet, the amount is calculated BEFORE the
        gang  promotions  have been added in.  The  number  the  computer
        calculates is the amount from AFTER the promotions.
             Note  that  there are a maximum number of blocks  that  your
        computer can have in memory.  If you try to add more blocks,  you
        will not be allowed to do so, and commands such as "E" will fail.
        This  is not likely to happen unless you control a LOT of  gangs,
        so it isn't something you should have to worry about.

             NAME  GANG:   If you've met another gang recently,  you  can
        enter  its  name using the "N" command.  If you ever  attempt  to
        perform  an action on another gang (such as find a block  to  am-
        bush)  that  doesn't have a name yet, this same command  will  be
        executed automatically so no confusion results.
             You  can  also use this command to change a gang's  name  if
        you've mis-entered it, or if the gang splits and you wish to name
        each  one separately (such as Bad Guys #1 and Bad Guys #2).   The
        "N" command also works equally well with Mob Boss names.
             While being asked for the gang name to change, you may enter
        a  ?  to see a list of all the gang names entered so  far.   This
        will help you find the correct gang.  This list may cover several
        screen pages, so press any key when asked to do so until you have
        returned to the gang name entry line.

             SAVE DATA:  To force the Utility to save all changes  you've
        made  so far, use the "V" command.  This writes the new files  to
        disk.   Use  this command if you want to be absolutely  sure  you
        don't lose a lot of changes by accidentally hitting Control-Break


                                        6




        or turning the computer off.  It's also useful if you're  working
        on your computer during a thunderstorm....

             ERASE BLOCK:  You can erase the information in any block  by
        using  the "X" command.  This will completely blank out the  cur-
        rent  block shown in the center of the screen.  BE SURE  you  are
        looking  at  the correct block or you'll have to retype  all  the
        information in again.

             SET  HOME BLOCK:  The "Y" command will identify the  current
        block  as  your "home" block.  All this means is  that  when  you
        start the IAC! Utility, this will be the block you see first.

             ERASE MAP:  To completely erase the entire map, use the "^Z"
        (Zap) command.  This will delete all block information, but won't
        affect  the  gang  names or gang stats you  may  have  previously
        entered,  nor will it affect your current turn card.  It has  the
        same effect as deleting the MAP.IAC file for your game.

             BLOCK BORDERS:  To set a border around a block, use the  "B"
        command followed by the direction to place the border.  If you do
        this, a thick line will appear in that direction from the current
        block.   This  is commonly used to easily show the edge  of  your
        turf,  or  to  identify police blocks.
             Blocks with an Invulnerable defense level (11) are automati-
        cally surrounded by borders after editing is complete.  Addition-
        ally, a block on the edge of the city automatically gets a border
        in the appropriate direction.  However, placing and updating your
        turf borders are your responsibility!

             NOTE  MOB BUSINESS:  The IAC Utility does not (as yet)  per-
        form Mob Boss functions, but it does have the ability to note the
        positions  of  mob businesses.  To do this, press  the  "*"  key.
        This  toggles  the mob business flag on or off  for  the  current
        block.   The  flag appears as a "*" on the map,  indicating  that
        there  is a business there.  The presence of this flag  does  not
        affect  block  suggestions  or any other action,  although  as  a
        player you should be wary of performing any actions there as they
        may have a reduced chance of success.

             ZOOM  MODE:   When you press "Z",  your  "helicopter"  rises
        higher  into the sky, and you get a long-range view of  the  city
        from  farther  away.   When in zoom mode, you see  an  11x11  map
        instead of a 5x5 one.  Obviously, at this range you can't see the
        intricate  details  of  each block, so only  the  owner,  defense
        levels,  and  mob businesses are displayed.  You can  still  move
        around in zoom mode or do anything else you normally could in the
        regular mode.  Use "Z" again to return to the normal 5x5 view.

             MOVE BLOCK:  The "M" command is used when you wish to move a
        given block to another location.  Typically, when you start a new
        game,  your initial block and surrounding 4 blocks will be  relo-
        cated by Adventures By Mail, so that they can adequately fill  up
        the city with gangs.  Thus, when you get back your first  Results
        Sheet, you may have to move your initial blocks.


                                        7




             To do this, simply go to the block you wish to move and  use
        the  "M" command.  You will be asked where you want  to  relocate
        the  block, so type in the new location.  The block will  be  in-
        stantly  moved (in its entirety) to that spot, retaining all  its
        borders,  flags, and other attributes.  In addition,  if  another
        block is already at that location, it will trade places with  the
        other one, effectively swapping block positions.

             QUITTING THE PROGRAM:  Use the "Q" command when you are done
        with  the  IAC! Utility.  After you confirm that this  is  really
        what  you want to do, all your changes (if any) will be saved  on
        disk  for later use.  If you don't want these changes saved,  hit
        Control-Break instead of using "Q".

        THE TURN CARD

             Now  it's time to learn how to use the second major  feature
        of the IAC! Utility, the Turn Card Editor (TCE).  The "T" command
        gets  you into the Editor, from which you are able to fill out  a
        normal  IAC! turn card, but with a few advantages over the  paper
        version.
             Note:  If you try to enter the Editor without having  previ-
        ously  used  the  "S" Gang Stats command, that  command  will  be
        automatically executed beforehand.  Fill in the required data  as
        requested, and the TCE will then appear.  Accurate entry of these
        values is essential to the TCE's accuracy, as you will see.
             The  Turn  Card  Editor shows 10 orders at the  top  of  the
        screen  (these  will be blank on a new turn card)  and  asks  you
        which  one you wish to edit.  To modify a given order, press  the
        number of that order (note that order #10 is accessed by pressing
        the "0" key).
             You will then be asked for the order type.  Press the single
        letter  of that order, such as "A" for Ambush, "B" for Buy,  etc.
        The  TCE  will  then proceed to the  next  question,  unless  you
        pressed  an illegal key, in which case it will abort and go  back
        to asking you which order you wish to edit.
             Now,  depending  on which order you entered above,  the  TCE
        will  ask up to three additional questions, enabling you to  fill
        in  the rest of the order parameters as described in the  It's  A
        Crime! Rulebook.  These questions are explained below.

             BLOCK NUMBER:  Many orders, such a Rob and Firebomb, require
        a  block number.  Enter the block number you've decided  to  use,
        "?" for a suggestion, or "*" for the current block (your location
        on the map before you entered the TCE).  Hit Return after  enter-
        ing  either  of these options.  Note that  the  suggestion  order
        works exactly like the appropriate command does at the map.   For
        example,  if  you're entering a Control order and  type  "?",  it
        works just like the "^C" command does.
             After you enter a block number or get a suggestion, it  will
        appear  on  the screen next to the appropriate order, and  a  de-
        scription of that block will appear.  At this point the Turn Card
        is waiting for you to confirm this choice, so press Return  again
        to  accept  it, or try a different block.  The  Editor  will  not
        proceed from this point until you press Return by itself.


                                        8





             %GANG:  A good number of orders require a %Gang as described
        in the IAC! Rulebook.  As with the block number, you can directly
        enter  a value here or use "?" for a suggestion.  Again, the  TCE
        will  wait  until  you press Return on a line  by  itself  before
        moving to the next question.
             Sometimes the suggested value will not meet your  specifica-
        tions.   In this case, you can enter "+" to increment  the  %Gang
        parameter  to  the  next value which adds a  new  pro,  punk,  or
        'cruit.   Occasionally,  it is wise to do this once or  twice  to
        send  extra 'cruits or punks as "padding" in case you get  caught
        (but  not  always!).   Note that because of  the  suggestion  and
        increment feature, you should never have to look at a %Gang chart
        again!

             BUILDING  NUMBER:  This question is asked for Rob and  Fire-
        bomb orders, and requests a building to "hit."  If you just press
        Return,  enter  an illegal number, or the block has  no  building
        information  entered,  a "1" is assumed.  The building  type  you
        enter will be highlighted for easy reference.

             OTHER QUESTIONS:  The Editor may also ask you for an  amount
        of money to spend, a gang number to spy on or defend against,  or
        similar things.  Answer these questions with your best  judgment;
        there is no suggestion capability here.
             If you are being asked for a gang number (such as in the Spy
        or Defend order types), you can use ? to get a list of previously
        entered gang names.  This works exactly as the ? query does  when
        changing a gang name with the "N" command.

             Notice  that in the middle of the screen there is a list  of
        the  current  amount of your gang's people  and  items  remaining
        unused.  As you enter orders on the turn card, this will decrease
        appropriately.  The number of men and guns you send on any  order
        will  be  displayed to the right of that order,  along  with  any
        other relevant comments.
             Items you Buy as an order on the turn card are NOT added  to
        your gang's statistics.  This intentionally pessimistic  attitude
        is  meant as a warning to you:  if you utilize items  you  assume
        you  are going to acquire, you are taking a risk that  you  won't
        get  them  as you expect to.  For example, if you Buy  drugs  and
        then try to Push them later, you are taking the chance that  your
        Buy  order  will fail (for whatever reason), and  then  the  Push
        order  will fail as a result.  Because of this  possibility,  the
        Turn Card Editor will not show the drugs you bought being Pushed.
             You  can edit any of the orders you've  previously  entered.
        Simply  choose the appropriate order number and make the  changes
        you need.  Pressing Return at any question will leave the  exist-
        ing  value  unchanged.   Note that you can enter  orders  in  any
        order;  you don't have to start from number 1.  Many players  put
        an "E 99" as their last order; this might be the first thing  you
        enter, so you won't forget to do it!
             Street  actions,  with  the W, X, and  Y  orders,  sometimes
        require  different parameters than the Editor will ask.  This  is
        because it is impossible to prepare for all the different actions

        you  might receive as part of IAC!  In these situations use  your
        best judgment.
             Block  scouting is implemented in a very simple way  in  the
        TCE.   Simply type "S" when asked for an order number,  and  then
        type  in the scouting slot (there are eight such slots, as  shown
        on  the IAC turn card).  Then enter the block to be  scouted  (or
        "*"  for your current location on the map before you entered  the
        TCE); the block information will be shown on the screen to verify
        that  you entered the correct number.  No suggestion  feature  is
        implemented here; only YOU can know what blocks are best for  you
        to scout.  This limited function is intended only as a handy  way
        for  you to record the blocks you scouted along with the rest  of
        your turn card for the current game week.
             When  you're  done with your turn card, you should  copy  it
        onto  the IAC! official card and mail it in.  I suggest that  you
        also use the Shift-PrtSc key combination to dump the turn card to
        your printer, just to be sure the Adventures by Mail people don't
        mis-enter  any  of your moves.  (This is very rare,  but  it  can
        happen.)  Alternately, after you quit the program, this turn card
        will be saved in the appropriate CARD file, which you could  then
        copy elsewhere as an archive.
             To clear the Turn Card, use "Z" when you are being asked  to
        select  an order to edit.  This is known as "zapping"  your  turn
        card.  It does not clear your gang statistics.
             To  exit the Turn Card Editor, press "Q" when you are  being
        asked to choose an order.  This will return you to the normal map
        "helicopter" view.

                            WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?

     This  is an introductory play-by-mail game.  Yes, a game that  is  played
using our postal service.  Why would you want to play a game through the mail?
Many people think it is the most enjoyable way to play.  This particular  game
makes use of all of the advantages a play-by-mail game has over other types of
games.   For  instance, unlike games where each player knows  everything,  you
know only what you need to know to begin--our computer system knows the  rest.
This  makes  for exciting mystery and allows you to make  discoveries  as  you
play.
     You  will  find It's A Crime! a fun and interesting game.  You  may  find
yourself  rushing home each day hoping to receive your results.  It's  also  a
great  way to meet new people and make new friends because there are  hundreds
of players in each game.
     Adventures  By  Mail is the impartial moderator (referee) for  the  game.
Our computer carries out your instructions.  The computer programs for It's  A
Crime!  are extremely sophisticated and, as you will discover, there's  a  lot
more to this game than meets the eye!

                                HOW DO I PLAY?

     You  use two things to play:  the TURN CARD and the RESULTS  SHEET.   You
write  your  orders on the turn card and then mail the card to us.   We  input
your orders into our computer.  The computer processes your orders and  prints
out a results sheet.  We mail this results sheet back to you.
     When  the envelope arrives, you open and examine the results sheet.   You
have now completed one turn.  After reading it, you decide what your next  set
of  orders  will be.  You then fill out another turn card and mail it  to  us.
You  repeat this procedure for as long as you want to play or until  the  game
ends (but not more often than once per game week).

                                YOUR POSITION

     You  play  the  part of a gangleader who controls a  group  of  misguided
youths.  Your gang is one of roughly 500 gangs inhabiting New York City in the
late 1990s.
     New York City is in bad shape.  The brave citizens who remain are now  in
a life-and-death struggle with the growing number of drug-crazed street gangs.
The NYPD is severely undermanned.  The street gangs rule the city.

                          WHAT DOES IT COST TO PLAY?

     Answer:  NOT MUCH!  You have all of the materials you need to begin play,
or can get them FREE from Adventures by Mail by simply sending in a  postcard.
YOUR FIRST TWO TURNS ARE FREE.  Thereafter the cost of a single turn is $1.50.
The only other cost to you is a stamp to mail your turn card to Adventures  By
Mail.  See the House Rules card for further information.

                            THE OBJECT OF THE GAME

     Your main goal as a gang leader is to control a very powerful gang.   You
must  build  your turf into one of the largest and your gang into one  of  the
richest, toughest and most notorious in the city.
     Your ultimate goal is to become the Godfather, whereupon you are declared
the winner and the game ends.  There are several steps which you must complete
before you can even try to become the Godfather.  See the section on the  Boss
Level for more information.
     We  award  MANY  prizes for various achievements.  For  example,  if  you
become Godfather you can play your next gang free for the entire game.  If you
are Capo (the Godfather's most notorious gang), you get 50 turn credits.

                               GANG COMPONENTS

     GANG  NAME AND GANG#:  You must give your gang a name.  Although  several
gangs  may have the same or similar names, each gang has a unique gang  number
identifying  it.  When you read about the actions of any gang you will  always
see the gang name followed by its gang number.
     GANG MEMBERS:  There are three types of gang members.   'CRUITS are  your
newest  recruits  and are your least experienced members.  PUNKS  have  gained
some valuable experience and are superior to 'cruits.  PROS are the leaders of
your gang.
     TURF:   Your  turf consists of all the blocks under  your  control.   You
start the game in control of 1 city block.
     NOTORIETY:  This is how strong your gang is perceived to be by  outsiders
(city  inhabitants, police, and the mob).  Notoriety will change according  to
the actions of your gang.  Compare your notoriety with other gangs to see  how
well  you  are doing.  Notoriety can go no lower than zero but  has  no  upper
limit.
     WEALTH:  This is your money.
     MORALE:  This is the state of your gang's spirit and confidence.   Morale
decreases naturally each turn (usually by one or two points).  The easiest way
to  increase  it is by partying!  Morale is on a scale of  1-100.   Keep  your
morale above 10!
     WEAPONS:   Gangs have a sufficient supply of handguns,  chains,  bottles,
and  knives.  You can also acquire special items which increase the chance  of
success of certain orders.

                                 CITY BLOCKS

     The city has almost 10,000 blocks.  Each block can have from one to three
different types of buildings.
     Think of a block as an area composed of building types which total up  to
100%.   If  all of the building types add up to less than 100%, it  means  the
block has space for construction.  It could also mean that a fire burned  down
some of the buildings in the block.
     Each  block has a "defense level."  This represents how often the  police
patrol  the  block,  and how resistive and alert the  residents  are  to  your
actions.   Lower defense levels increase your chances of success with  Control
orders vs. Uncontrolled blocks as well as on Mug, Rob, and Firebomb orders.  A
block's  defense  level has nothing to do with the defense of the  gang  which
controls it.

                               MAPPING THE CITY

     Mapping is very easy and a lot of fun.  Once you start playing, you  will
want to create a map of your gang's turf and the surrounding blocks.  The city
is  composed  of  99 x 99 blocks.  Picture it as a large grid  with  each  box
representing  a  block.  Each block on the map is numbered  in  the  following
format:  block# = XXYY.  "XX" is the x-coordinate (horizontal), while  "YY" is
the  map's y-coordinate (vertical).  Therefore, the corners are numbered  0101
(southwest corner), 0199 (northwest), 9999 (northeast), and 9901 (southeast).
     EACH BLOCK IS ADJACENT TO 4 OTHER BLOCKS (except for blocks located along
the  edges of the city).  Example:  4933 is adjacent to blocks 4934 (which  is
to  the north), 5033 (east), 4932 (south), and 4833 (west).   Diagonal  blocks
are not considered to be adjacent.
     Be careful to number your map correctly.   On the back page of the  rules
you will find  a  sample  map.  Refer to it if you make your own map using the
blank map card.   (Note:  This sample map is not included in this computerized
rulebook.   However, since the IAC! Utility program will handle all block map-
ping functions, it isn't really necessary.)

                              CONTROLLING BLOCKS

     Each  block in the city is either controlled by a gang  or  uncontrolled.
To  take control of a block, you issue a Control order and send a  portion  of
your gang to the block to perform the task.
     TAKING  CONTROL  OF  AS MANY BLOCKS AS POSSIBLE IS THE  KEY  TO  SUCCESS.
Uncontrolled  blocks are usually easier to capture than blocks  controlled  by
another gang.  BLOCKS WHICH YOU ATTEMPT TO TAKE CONTROL OF MUST BE ADJACENT TO
BLOCKS YOU ALREADY CONTROL.
     You cannot control a block which consists of only derelict buildings.
     A gang may control no more than 40 blocks.

                           GANG INCOME AND EXPENSES

     Each  turn  you will receive income from the blocks under  your  control.
This  income is from "protection money" paid by businesses so that  your  gang
will  not  hang-out in front of their buildings, harass customers,  etc.   The
income each block generates is based on the type and size of buildings present
in the block.
     Members of your gang receive some of the gang's funds each turn to  cover
their general expenses.  Each pro receives $40, each punk $20, and each 'cruit
$10.  If your gang has insufficient funds to pay these general expenses,  your
gang's morale will drop fast.
     Your  results  sheet shows the income you received from blocks  and  gang
expenses  you paid.  These figures do not include money expended and  acquired
from actions performed during this turn.

                            TRAVELING IN THE CITY

     Hop  on the subway or bus or just walk.  Public transportation is  excel-
lent  in the city.  Any orders that use a block# will automatically move  your
gang  members to that block where they will execute the order and then  return
to  your turf.  However, the farther away from your turf that they attempt  an
action, the more likely they will get lost or sidetracked along the way.

                       COMMUNICATING WITH OTHER PLAYERS

     When you see another gang you will be told its name and gang# as well  as
the name and address of the player who controls it.  This enables you to write
a  letter to another player directly and exchange information, conduct  "peace
talks,"  negotiate deals, and more.  We heartily recommend that you  write  to
other players you meet in the game.

                             BATTLE BETWEEN GANGS

     Only  two  gangs will fight each other at a time, and  battle  will  only
occur when one issues a Control or an Ambush order.
     The  gang that issues the order will specify the percentage of  the  gang
that  will  fight.  The other gang will defend with a number of  gang  members
based upon the total number of members and the size of its turf.

                                THE TURN CARD

     This is the printed card you write your orders on and mail to  Adventures
By  Mail.  On your results sheet you will find your game#, gang# and  account#
(near  the  top)--NEVER  FORGET TO WRITE THEM ON YOUR TURN CARD.   If  you  do
forget, we may be unable to process your turn card.
     To fill out your turn card, write your game#, gang#, and account# in  the
space  provided.  Next, fill in your name and gang name.  The top half of  the
turn  card has room for 4 orders, which can be any of the types  discussed  in
the following section.  Beneath this are spaces to write the block numbers  of
four blocks for your gang to scout.
     Beginning  with turn 3, if you wish to issue more than 4 orders, you  may
write up to 6 additional orders (for a total of 10) in the bottom half of  the
turn  card  labeled "Double Turn Area."  (Note that the First Gang  Turn  Card
will  not show this Double Turn Area.)  However, it may be unwise to do  this.
When  a small gang issues a lot of orders, it could be spreading  its  members
too  thinly,  possibly  failing at everything it attempts.   Note:   a  Double
Orders  Turn must be filled in on a single turn card by using the Double  Turn
Area on the card.  Do not use a second turn card!

                                    %GANG

     The  concept of %gang is the most difficult thing to understand  and  ex-
plain  in this game.  Don't expect to understand it instantly.  Once you  have
read  this  section once or twice, look at the sample turn sheet.   It  should
help you understand the %gang concept.
     Many of the orders you will give your gang require you to specify a %gang
number.   %Gang is the percentage of your gang you send on your order.  It  is
calculated for each of the three types of members (pros, punks, and  'cruits).
The  resulting  number is rounded down.  For example, 4.84 'cruits is  just  4
'cruits.   Special  rule:  At least one pro will go on the  first  order  that
requires a %gang number.
     To  assist  you in figuring out what numbers to specify for  %gang,  your
results sheet has a "%GANG Chart" for your gang.  The left half shows how many
members  of  each type will be sent if you specify certain  percentages.   The
right half shows several examples.
     On  the order in which your total %gang for the turn reaches  or  exceeds
100%,  all  unallocated gang members will be sent.  Members are  usually  left
over because "Number To Be Sent" is always rounded down.
     The %gang numbers shown in section 3 of your results sheet are valid  for
your  next turn (i.e. the one you are about to send in) and are not  dependent
on  how  many gang members you lose between turns.  If you lose  gang  members
between turns, fewer gang members will be sent on your last order(s).
     One other note:  When using a Double Orders Turn, your %gang numbers must
still total no more than 100%.  You do NOT get to send 200% of your gang.

                                 ORDER TYPES

     It  is now time for you to learn how to issue orders to your  gang.   The
following  paragraphs contain all the information about each order,  including
its  format, an explanation, and an example.  Some order types simply  consist
of  a single letter while others are made up of a single letter followed by  a
series of numbers.  The parts of the order enclosed in parenthesis are numbers
you  must supply.  The parenthesis are NOT a part of the order and should  not
be copied.  THE ORDER IN WHICH YOU WRITE YOUR INSTRUCTIONS ON THE TURN CARD IS
THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY ARE PROCESSED.  ORDER #1 IS PROCESSED BEFORE ORDER #2,
AND SO ON.
     The  specification  of "bldg#" (building#) is a number from 1 to  3.   In
section 2 of your results sheet you will see up to 3 building types listed for
each block.  Specify "1" for bldg#1 to target the first building type  listed,
"2" for the second, and "3" for the third.
     Warning:   It  is not advisable to issue the same order type  many  times
during one turn (e.g. 7 Control orders is excessive).
     All of the order types benefit you in some way and you should try each of
them at appropriate times to see what effect they have.

A (%gang) (block#)

     AMBUSH.  Ambush  another  gang on THEIR turf.  This is the  best  way  to
reduce  the number of enemy gang members.  Be sure that you specify  a  block#
which is controlled by the gang you wish to ambush.  Note that the total %gang
you  specify  in all of your Ambush orders during a turn may not  exceed  your
gang's morale (i.e. if you morale is 51 you can order no more than 51% of your
gang  to  perform ambushes this turn).  You need to send at least one  pro  to
lead the ambush.
     For  example:  A 24 4838 would send 24% of your gang to ambush  the  gang
which controls block 4838.

B (amount of money) (item#)

     BUY.  Spend gang money attempting to purchase special items.  Items  are:
(1)  shotguns, (2) submachine guns, (3) small bombs, and (4) streetdope.   The
number  shown in parenthesis before each item is the item# used in the  order.
You can use items on the same turn you purchased them, but only in orders that
occur AFTER the Buy order.
     For example, B 800 4 would have your gang attempt to spend $800  purchas-
ing streetdope.

C (%gang) (block#)

     CONTROL.  Attempt to take control of a block.  Be sure you send at  least
one pro or punk along, as 'cruits by themselves will fail.  Be sure you speci-
fy  a  block  ADJACENT (connecting) to one that your  gang  already  controls.
Diagonal blocks are not considered to be adjacent.
     For  example, C 35 4934 would send 35% of your gang to try and take  con-
trol of block 4934.
     Special note:  If you already control the block or if it is not  adjacent
to  your turf, your gang will then try to retake control of a block your  gang
lost since your last turn was processed (if there were any).

D (gang#)

     DEFEND AGAINST GANG.  Your gang will watch out for this particular  gang.
This  is  a standing order that will be in effect until you change  it.   Each
turn  you  will learn this gang's notoriety and how many blocks  it  controls.
Further,  if this gang tries to grab one of your blocks or attempts to  ambush
you,  your gang will respond with greater effectiveness and take fewer  losses
than normal.  You may only defend against one enemy gang at a time.
     The one disadvantage of this order is that your gang members tend not  to
run away when heavily outnumbered.
     For example, D 481 defends your turf against gang# 481.

E (%gang)

     ENLIST  RECRUITS.  Your gang attempts to recruit new gang  members.   You
can  use  new  'cruits on your next turn (not the turn in  which  you  recruit
them).
     For example, E 22 uses 22% of your gang to enlist new members.

F (%gang) (block#) (bldg#)

     FIREBOMB.  Your gang commits arson by firebombing a particular  building.
Arson  works best on a block controlled by another gang.  The order will  fail
if  you do not send a pro (punks and 'cruits need a leader).  It is  risky  to
send  a large portion of your gang.  You need small bombs for  maximum  effec-
tiveness, and, if they are available, your gang will use as many as necessary.
     For example, F 18 3463 2 will send 18% of your gang into block 3463,  who
will  attempt  to burn down building #2.  If they succeed, you may  receive  a
payoff.

M (%gang) (block#)

     MUG.   Mug a defenseless-looking person found on the block.  Try to  send
at least one pro or punk.
     For example, M 11 3088 sends 11% of your gang into block 3088 to mug  the
first unfortunate soul they find.

P (amount of streetdope)

     PUSH  DRUGS.  Sell drugs for profit.  Warning:  Big time pushers come  to
the attention of the police narcotics unit.
     For example, P 9 orders your gang to try to sell 9 streetdope.

R (%gang) (block#) (bldg#)

     ROB.   Rob a particular building.  Send a pro, but not a large number  of
gang members.
     For  example, R 13 2309 1 would send 13% of your gang into block 2309  to
rob something from one of the bldg#1 buildings.

S (gang#)

     SPY ON GANG.  Secretly check out a rival gang.
     For example, S 903 will cause your gang to scout gang# 903.

T (%gang)

     ACT  TOUGH.  Act tough/rowdy, play ghetto blasters at  deafening  volume,
etc.  Your gang members will seize the first opportunity to cause some trouble
or  make some bucks.  Send more than one gang member, but not a whole  lot  of
your gang.
     For example, T 8 will cause 8% of your gang to hang out and act tough  on
your turf.

U (amount of streetdope)

     USE  DRUGS.   Party!   Get your gang high.  Very good  for  boosting  low
morale.
     For example, U 12 will cause your gang to throw a party and use 12 of the
gang's streetdope.

                                   SCOUTING

     You  can  scout  any four blocks in the city each turn.   You  will  also
receive  a report of all the blocks you control and of blocks where  you  con-
ducted actions.
     If  your gang is large enough, you can scout up to four more blocks  when
you do a Double Orders Turn.  Your gang must have 55 or more members to  scout
a 5th block, 70+ for a 6th block, 85+ for a 7th, and 100+ for an 8th.

                                  BOSS LEVEL

     If your gang is very successful, your gang leader may become a mob  boss.
You can then get into prostitution, big-time drug dealing, bookmaking, fencing
stolen  goods, and laundering money.  You will employ enforcers and  may  even
hire an out-of-town hitman to do your dirtiest deeds.
     The  Boss Level will begin around the middle of game week 21.  Gangs  who
form Crime Families will receive a Boss rulebook, results sheet, and an update
of their gang.  Only 30-45 gangs form Crime Families at the start of the  Boss
Level.   To be considered, your gang must be the toughest in your  section  of
the city and have at least 30 blocks, 13 pros, $5,000, 5 submachine guns,  and
400  Notoriety.  The more you exceed these minimums, the greater your  chances
of forming a Crime Family.

                                PLAYING NOTES

     You now know quite a bit about It's A Crime!.  Still, there is much  more
to the game than what you have just read because these rules contain only  the
information we want you to know at the start of the game.  You will learn much
more  about the game through playing.  Discovering how things  work,  deducing
the  parameters which affect the success of your actions, determining  whether
or  not  to participate in special deals, etc., are all part of  the  learning
process.
     We  used  common sense in designing the possible results for  each  order
type.   Every order type, as you will discover, has a wide range  of  results,
but none are purely random.  They depend on important factors such as the num-
ber and quality of your gang members and block defense levels.
     The It's A Crime! newsletter is published 3-6 times per year and costs  2
turn  credits  per issue.  It contains questions and answers,  articles,  free
player  ads, and a whole lot more.  While it is not mandatory for you to  sub-
scribe,  it  is  very important that you at least read a  friend's  copy.   To
subscribe, write "CN" in the appropriate space on your turn card for only  one
gang under your control.

                                 A FEW HINTS

     You will occasionally receive hints picked up on the street.  Here are  a
few  to  start you off:  On your first couple of turns you should  attempt  to
capture  at least two blocks each turn.  It is quite important to establish  a
good-sized  turf early in the game.  Always use 100% of your gang every  turn.
Do  not  use an E order if your turf is smaller than 6 blocks--do  a  C  order
instead (you'll get more guys taking over a block than trying to recruit  from
a small turn).  Don't use the A order for a while.  Buy and push drugs to make
some  quick dough.  Do not worry if you have a low notoriety early  on--it  is
more  important  to build up a strong gang and sizable turf than get  lots  of
notoriety.

                              PROCESSING PERIODS

     Each game of It's A Crime! has its own game#.  YOUR STARTUP RESULTS SHEET
DOES NOT STATE A GAME#, BUT DON'T WORRY--YOUR NEXT RESULTS SHEET WILL  CONTAIN
THIS INFORMATION.
     Depending  on  the game, a processing period (also called  a  game  week)
lasts  11  or more days.  You may have one turn processed in each  game  week.
The  dates  of the next processing period for your game appear at the  top  of
your results sheet.
     1.   IF  YOUR TURN CARD ARRIVES AT ADVENTURES BY MAIL EARLY, it  will  be
processed  on the first day of the next period.  However, your turn  is  proc-
essed right away if you are eligible for a make-up turn.
     2.   IF YOUR TURN CARD ARRIVES ON TIME, it is processed immediately.
     3.   IF  YOUR TURN CARD ARRIVES LATE, it is processed  immediately.   You
have missed one or more periods--but you can make them up.

                                MAKE-UP TURNS

     For  whatever  reason, there may be times when you fail to  have  a  turn
processed  during a particular game week.  You can make up every missed  turn,
at the rate of one every three game weeks.  The top of your results sheet will
inform you when you can submit a make-up turn.
     A  MAKE-UP TURN IS DEFINES AD THE SECOND TURN PROCESSED FOR A GANG  IN  A
SINGLE GAME WEEK.
     The best way to make up turns is to send in turns as quickly as  possible
until  you  catch up.  It is risky to submit a turn before you  get  back  the
results of your last turn.

                                  INACTIVITY

     If you do not submit a turn card for your gang for 3 or more  consecutive
game weeks, we reserve the right to turn your game over to someone who  wishes
to send in turns on a regular basis.

                            SEQUENCE OF PROCESSING

     Turn events occur in this order:
     1.  Your orders are processed in the order you write them.
     2.  New 'cruits acquired during the turn are inducted into the gang.
     3.  Block income is determined and added to your gang's wealth.
     4.  Gang expenses are determined and subtracted from your gang's wealth.
     5.  Gang members are promoted.

                                   WARNING

     Your  results  sheet is current when it is printed, but things  may  have
changed by the time your next turn is processed.  You will have to  anticipate
these changes (such as enemy gangs capturing your blocks).  It is a skill  you
must develop to succeed in It's A Crime!.
     You CANNOT specify the input order for turn cards of different gangs.

                                READY TO PLAY?

     You've  finished  reading the rules.  If you've decided  this  game  just
isn't  for you, please pass these rules and the other game materials on  to  a
friend.
     However,  if you want to give it a try, look over your  enclosed  results
sheet  while re-reading the rules.  If you did not receive a start-up  results
sheet, fill in a turn card (or postcard) with your name and address, and write
on it that you wish to be set up.   We will send you a start-up results sheet,
along with credit for two free turns.
     When  you've  finished reading over your start-up  results  sheet,  begin
filling in your turn card.  Look over how we filled in the sample turn.   When
you  have filled in your turn card, mail it to us.  We start a new game  every
3-5 weeks and you will be in the next game started.
     If you are really excited about playing, you can start with up to 2 gangs
in each new game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    HOW WE FILLED OUT THE SAMPLE TURN CARD

     GANG  NAME:   We chose a gang name, which can be up to 20  characters  in
length,  including  spaces,  and filled this in.  Do not choose  a  name  that
begins  with  "The" or the leader's name.  Good choices  are  "Shamrocks"  and
"Death Scavengers."  Bad choices are "The Shamrocks" and "Dirk's Scavengers."
     NAME AND ADDRESS:  We filled in our name and complete address.
     GANG#:  We carefully copied the gang# from our results sheet.
     ACCT#:   We don't have an account number yet, so we left this area  blank
and we will then be assigned one.
     ORDER  #1:  We decided to have 19% of our gang members attempt to rob  an
apartment complex on block 4932.  (2 'cruits went plus 1 pro because it is the
first order with a %gang.)
     ORDER #2:  We decided to send 75% of our gang to attempt to take  control
of a tough block, 4934.  (1 pro, 3 punks, and 9 'cruits.)
     ORDER #3:  We decided to purchase drugs and try to spend $1550.
     ORDER  #4:  We decided to send 6% of our gang to attempt to take  control
of  block  4833, which should be a pushover.  6% would normally not  send  any
gang  members--it's not enough to send even one 'cruit--but this 6%  puts  our
total  %gang  at 100% and so whatever remains of our gang is  sent.   In  this
case, 1 punk and 2 'cruits remain unallocated.
     SCOUTING:  We decided to scout blocks 5032, 4832, 5034, and 4733.

                                 HOUSE RULES

     COST:   Startup  is FREE.  The first two turns are FREE  for  your  first
gang.  Turns thereafter are $1.50 each.  You must pay for at least eight  turn
credits at a time ($12.00).  Beginning on turn 3, you have the option of doing
a "Double Orders Turn," which costs two turn credits instead of one.
     TURN  CREDITS:  At the top left side of your results sheet  is  something
labeled "Turn Credits = #."  This is the number of turn credits you have left.
IF TURN CREDITS = 0, BE SURE YOU SEND A CHECK OR MONEY ORDER FOR AT LEAST  $12
IN AN ENVELOPE WITH YOUR TURN CARD.  You must have a sufficient number of turn
credits  for your turn to be processed.  The computer will not process a  turn
for any gang if it has insufficient turn credits.  There are no exceptions.
     Gangs may not share turn credits.  Each gang must have its own supply  of
turn credits.
     PAYMENTS:   Make checks and money orders payable to Adventures  By  Mail,
Inc.   Be sure you send your payment with your turn card.  Please  write  your
ACCT#  on  your check as well as the GANG# for which you are  purchasing  turn
credits.
     YOUR ACCOUNT:  Upon entering an Adventures By Mail game, you are assigned
an ACCT#, and all money sent to Adventures By Mail is logged in this account.
     AUTOMATIC TURN CREDIT DEDUCTION:  Players who maintain funds on  account,
usually  because they are playing other Adventures By Mail games, can  request
that turn credits automatically be added to their gang and the amount deducted
from their account.  A minimum of 16 turn credits must be specified.
     VISA/MASTERCARD WITH AUTOMATIC TURN CREDIT DEDUCTION:  Players wishing to
pay  by  this method must first obtain an authorization form  from  us.   Just
write on the turn card, "Send me a VISA/MC form."  When you return it,  please
specify on your turn card how many turn credits you want to pay for at a  time
(minimum  of  16) and whenever a gang of yours has its turn  credits  drop  to
zero,  its  turn  credits will automatically be increased by  the  number  you
specified and your account will be charged accordingly.
     PHONING  IN ORDERS:  You may phone-in your turn at any time.  Our  office
hours  are  8 a.m. - 4 p.m. Eastern Time.  From 4 p.m.- 8 a.m. you  read  your
turn  card  to  our answering machine.  You  are  charged  a  one-turn-credit,
phone-in fee.  If you are phoning from outside the continental U.S., you  will
not be charged the phone-in fee if you mention so when phoning in your turn.
     NOTE:  Upon joining this game you agree to abide by all decisions made by
Adventures By Mail that pertain to this game.
