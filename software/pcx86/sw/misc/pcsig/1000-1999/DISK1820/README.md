## Information about "DOCUHELP"

    DOCUMENTOR allows you to use your own documentation text file to create
    an on-line user's manual and an associated index file for that manual.
    Use it primarily as a display tool once the documentation files are
    created, or as a conversion tool for the documentation.  Finally, create
    the index file to be used by the program.
    
    When used as a display tool the program will window up on the lower
    portion of the screen and display the document which you have specified.
    You will also be able to use the index which you specified to go to
    various places in the document to provide an easy method for finding
    various places within the document.  If you use the program with the
    index display option you will be able to add index descriptions and line
    numbers to the index file with only a few simple keystrokes.
    
    When used as a conversion tool the program will convert a text file
    (which you create with your own wordprocessor or text editor) to a
    DOCUMENTOR file, which then can be used by the program to provide an
    on-line display tool for your document.

                           DocuMentor System Overview                         
                                                                              
        The DocuMentor program is a program which allows you to use  your     
        own  documentation  text  file as an on-line user's manual.   The     
        program may be used directly as a display tool and as  a  conver-     
        sion tool.                                                            
                                                                              
        When  used  as  a  display tool the program will window up on the     
        lower portion of the screen and display the  document  which  you     
        have specified.  You will also be able to use the index which you     
        specified  to  go to various places in the document to provide an     
        easy method for finding various places within the document.    If     
        you  use  the program with the index display option,  you will be     
        able to add index descriptions and line numbers to the index file     
        with only a few simple keystrokes.                                    
                                                                              
        When used as a conversion tool the program will  convert  a  text     
        file  (which  you  create  with  your  own word processor or text     
        editor) to a DocuMentor file  which  can  then  be  used  by  the     
        program to provide an on-line display tool for your document.         
                                                                              
        As  far  as  the  actual  use of the program goes,  it provides a     
        'command box' at the bottom of the window with most of the avail-     
        able options.   The options can be executed by  pressing  various     
        keys, and are as follows:                                             
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                      Program Features and "Function Keys"                    
                                                                              
        PageUp   -  Scrolls up 16 lines except when at top of document.       
        PageDown -  Scrolls down 16 lines except when at end of document.     
        ArrowUp  -  Scrolls up 1 line except when at top of document.         
        ArrowDown-  Scrolls down 1 line except when at end of document.       
        Home     -  Goes to the beginning of the document.                    
        End      -  Goes to the end of the last page of the document.         
        F        -  Allows you to find a string of text.                      
        I        -  Brings up an Index for selecting different topics.

        Press  the  F key from the main display screen and then type in a     
        text string to be searched for and press the enter key.  Once you     
        have done so,  the search will begin from the current  screen  to     
        the  end of the document.   If no matches are found,  you will be     
        prompted as such and then need only to press any key to  continue     
        as before.   If a match is found the line of text containing that     
        match will be displayed as the top line on  the  viewing  screen.     
        Note:  the search is not "case sensitive",  so you need not worry     
        about any capitalization.

        the index selection screen will terminate the program.   At most,     
        all  you  need  do when in doubt is press the ESC key a couple of     
        times.

        Hold down the Alt key and then press the P key, and you will then     
        be prompted with the question: OK to print Documentation ? (Y/N).     
        Press the N key if you do not want  to  print  the  Documentation     
        file,  or  make  sure  that your printer is on and is on-line and     
        press the Y key if you do want to print the file.   If you  press

        The  DocuMentor program can be used from either the DOS prompt or     
        from within the Microsoft QuickBasic environment  (by  using  the     
        DOCUMENT.QLB  file).    There are two parameter formats for using     
        the DocuMentor program,  the viewing format  and  the  conversion     
        format.                                                               
                                                                              
        Format  1 allows the use of the program as a document display and     
        indexing tool from the DOS  command  line  (or  by  calling  from     
        QuickBasic), and should be issued as follows:

        The  text file which you create for use by this program should be     
        an ASCII sequential text file which should have lines 78  charac-     
        ters  long  or  less.   The file should not contain any form feed     
        characters,  as this may produce unpredictable results when  dis-     
        playing the final documentation to the end user.   This file will     
        be read by the DocuMentor program (using the CONVERT option), and     
        will be the basis for the creation of the DocuMentor  file.  (the     
        file which the program uses for actual display purposes)              
                                                                              
        This text file can most likely be created from your word process-     
        ing  program  with  a  print  to disk option.   When you actually     
        create your 'master document' for your user's manual or  documen-     
        tation  you should use your word processor to it's full extent in     
        order to make your word processing not only easier to create, but     
        also easier to modify later on.   When you have a  'final  draft'     
        created with your word processing program, you should then create     
        a text file for use by the DocuMentor.                                
                                                                              
        After  you  have created your text file,  you will want to create     
        the DocuMentor Display file as described below.                       
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                             DocuMentor Display File                          
                                                                              
        This file will be created with the CONVERT option from  the  text     
        file (described above) which you have specified.   This is neces-     
        sary for the overall functional capabilities  of  the  DocuMentor     
        program.    There  are no limits placed on the size of either the     
        documentation text file,  or the DocuMentor display file  by  the     
        program.  Only physical disk space limitations apply as limits to

        then use the DocuMentor INDEX option to easily create or  add  to     
        an index file for the new file which you have created.

                            Index File Specifications                         
                                                                              
        The  Index  file  that  you create for your document may be named     
        with any valid DOS name, however you may want to decide on a con-     
        sistent naming convention (ie. *.IDX).                                
                                                                              
        The file must be a sequential text file with a record  length  of     
        seventy eight characters (78).                                        
                                                                              
        The first seventy characters are displayed on the screen when the     
        index records are shown to the user.                                  
                                                                              
        The  last  eight characters are evaluated for a page number,  and     
        are not displayed when the Index records are shown on the screen.     
        The 'page number' should refer to the physical page  number  that     
        the  index description appears on.   You may use whole numbers to     
        indicate the beginning of a physical page,  or fractions to begin     
        at  some  point  other  than  the  beginning  of a physical page.     
        (Example: if the page number was 1.5 and  you  had  specified  66     
        lines  per page,  viewing of the document would start on the 33rd     
        line of the first page if that index selection were made.)            
                                                                              
             As an overall example of the records in an index file,  con-     
             sider  the  following:  The text of your document has an in-     
             troduction page,  a table of contents page,  and then starts     
             with  numbered  pages...so  in  the  index records you would     
             specify the numbering as follows:                                
                  Introduction page ..........//.....   1                     
                  Table of Contents page .....\\.....   2                     
                  Your documents page 1 ......//.....   3                     
                                                                              
        This Index file may contain  up  to  320  different  records  (20     
        screens  worth) with their associated physical page numbers.   It     
        is important to correctly define the number  of  lines  per  page     
        when  using the program,  as the DocuMentor software uses the in-     
        formation you give it to calculate which line to  go  to  in  the     
        document by using the physical page number multiplied by the num-     
        ber of lines per page.                                                
                                                                              
        The most simple method for creating or making additions to an in-     
        dex file is to simply use the INDEX option of the program.   This     
        option is described more fully on the next page.

        Begin the program with the following specifications:                  
                                                                              
                                                                              
        DOCUMENT ManualFileName IndexFileName Option LinesPerPage Colors      
                                                                              
                                                                              
             ManualFileName should be the filename of the DocuMentor file     
             to be viewed by the program.  (this is the  file  which  you     
             create with the "CONVERT" option)                                
                                                                              
             IndexFileName  should be the filename of the Index Text File     
             for the Documentor file specified in the ManualFileName.         
                                                                              
             Option should be INDEX.   This option allows you to make ad-     
             ditions  to  the index file from within the viewing environ-     
             ment.                                                            
                                                                              
             LinesPerPage is the number of lines on  each  page  of  text     
             (will default to 66 if not specified)                            
                                                                              
             Colors  should be a 6 digit string that contains the follow-     
             ing two digit colors (with leading  zeroes)  in  order:  the     
             highlighted  text  color,  the standard text color,  and the     
             background color.  (will default to 150700 if left blank)        
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
        Once the program has been started with the INDEX option,  the top     
        line  of the DocuMentor display will prompt you with instructions     
        and the current index page number.   The emphasized line  at  the     
        top of the text display can be added to the index file (which you     
        specified  when  you  started  the  program)  along with its cor-     
        responding index page number.   This option enables you to simply     
        go  through  your  document and press the Alt  A key when the em-     
        phasized line should be added to the index file.   Once you  have     
        done  this you may then want to edit the index file with your own     
        word processor to "tidy it up a  bit".    The  additions  to  the     
        specified  index  file  will be made at the end of the file,  not     
        disrupting any of the current entries in that file.    The  addi-     
        tions  will  also  be left justified,  so if you want the options     
        centered or set away from the left margin,  you will also have to     
        make the required changes to the file after you have made the ad-     
        ditions.

          Use of the DocuMentor program from within the QB Environment        
                                                                              
        The  program may be called from within the QuickBasic environment     
        in the same manner which it is called from the DOS prompt.    You     
        have  a  couple  of  options  for  using the DocuMentor from your     
        program.   The first would be to simply call it as  a  DOS  SHELL     
        command  or the second would be to use the .QLB and .LIB files to     
        call the program directly from the environment, and to ultimately     
        link it to your application.                                          
                                                                              
        Method 1 - Calling the DocuMentor program as DOS SHELL.               
                                                                              
        Simply issue a shell command as you would invoke the program from     
        the command line:                                                     
                                                                              
             SHELL "Document DOCUMENT.DOC DOCUMENT.IDX VIEW/1 66 150700"      
                                                                              
        Where  DOCUMENT.DOC  is  the  name  of   the   DocuMentor   file,     
        DOCUMENT.IDX is the name of the Index File for the document, VIEW     
        is  the option with the /1 indicating that display is to begin on     
        page 1 of the document,  66 is the number of lines per page,  and     
        15,  07,  & 00 are the highlighted,  standard,  & background text     
        colors.                                                               
                                                                              
        Method 2 - Calling the DocuMentor program from within QuickBasic.     
                                                                              
        The file entitled DOCUMENT.QLB is a  QuickLibrary  for  use  with     
        Microsoft's QuickBasic Versions 4.XX.   In order to debug, or use     
        the program from within the environment,  you must first load the     
        QuickLib when you initialize QuickBasic.   Second,  you must also     
        declare the subroutine to the program which you  are  calling  it     
        from. Then finally you must call the program with all of the cor-     
        rect parameters.  See steps 1, 2, & 3 below:                          
                                                                              
        Step 1                                                                
        Load QuickBasic with the following parameters: QB /L DOCUMENT.QLB     
                                                                              
        Step 2                                                                
        At the Main Module level declare the subroutine to your program:      
        DECLARE SUB DOCUMENT(File1$,File2$,Option$,LinesPerPage%,Colors$)     
                                                                              
        Step 3                                                                
        Call  the program from your program using either of the following     
        syntax options:                                                       
        CALL DOCUMENT(File1$,File2$,Option$,LinesPerPage%,Colors$)            
          or                                                                  
        DOCUMENT File1$,File2$,Option$,LinesPerPage%,Colors$                  
                                                                              
        When calling the DocuMentor routine, the calling option names can     
        actually  be  anything  you  want,   however  calling  parameters     
        1,2,3,&5  must be string expressions,  and parameter 4 must be an     
        integer.   The defaults will be "honored" if the  parameters  are     
        left  blank  or null,  however you must issue all five parameters     
        when making the call.                                                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                        9

        For a monochrome monitor you may want to use the following  codes     
        to  produce  an  underlined  letter  or  word for the highlighted     
        characters as the color definitions will have  little  effect  on     
        the  display,  and  you  will  have  difficulty determining which

        The DocuMentor program is designed to function with a very  mini-     
        mal potential for encountering an error.  The most likely reasons     
        for unexplained errors or problems will most likely stem from one     
        of the situations outlined below.                                     
                                                                              
        Although the program is designed to work on virtually any type of     
        monitor,  if erroneous color definitions are made, you may not be     
        able to see the displayed text.   For example if all three colors     
        were defined as the same,  you would not be able to see the text.     
        Similarly,  if you choose colors that  are  incompatible  with  a     
        specific  type of monitor,  partial or incomplete displays may be     
        encountered.   When encountering these type of difficulties,  try     
        using the defaults as a starting point,  and then experiment from     
        that point forward.                                                   
                                                                              
        If the program from which the DocuMentor is being called is  very     
        large,  or if there are a lot of memory resident programs loaded,     
        a situation where the DocuMentor  program  did  not  have  enough     
        available memory to run may occur.  (the program requires ~64K of     
        RAM to function properly)  This may be corrected by checking  the     
        available  memory  immediately  prior  to invoking the DocuMentor     
        program.                                                              
                                                                              
        If a file which was specified for the  program's  use  cannot  be     
        found in the "current default directory",  an error may occur ...     
        which will result in a displayed message,  and then a  subsequent     
        return to DOS.                                                        
                                                                              
        If  an  erroneous  declaration  statement  is made when using the     
        DocuMentor from within a programming environment (where the argu-     
        ment count does not match that in the documentation),  memory al-     
        location errors are likely to occur.

DOCUMENTOR allows you to use your own documentation text file to create 
an On-line user's manual and an associated index file for that manual.  
Use it primarily as a display tool once the documentation files are     
created or as a conversion tool for the documentation.  Finally, create 
the index file to be used by the program.                               
                                                                        
When used as a display tool the program will window up on the lower     
portion of the screen and display the document which you have specified.
You will also be able to use the index which you specified to go to     
various places in the document to provide an easy method for finding    
various places within the document.  If you use the program with the    
index display option you will be able to add index descriptions and line
numbers to the index file with only a few simple keystrokes.            
                                                                        
When used as a conversion tool the program will convert a text file     
(which you create with your own word processor or text editor) to a     
DocuMentor file which can then be used by the program to provide an     
on-line display tool for your document.
