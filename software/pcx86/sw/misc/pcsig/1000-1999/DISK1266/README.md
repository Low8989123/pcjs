    Being the movie fanatic that I am, I recently noticed that there really 
isn't much out there to help keep track of the movies that are currently 
filling my library of tapes.  There are a few programs out there, but many are 
lacking in features or are bug-ridden.  My solution for the problem was to 
develop what I think will be the ultimate program for handling movies: The Home 
Movie Librarian.

    When designing the program I wanted it to be as attractive as possible 
(since I was going to be using it quite alot), so to do this I made use of a 
very attractive user-interface with windows and selector bars.  All menu items 
can be selected via the arrow keys, and the user can abort any process simply 
by pressing the `ESC'ape key.  Other keys that can be used throughout are the 
INSERT key (to add something) the DELETE key (to eliminate something) the 
page-up key (to move up a page) and the page-down key (to move down a page).

From the main menu you have the following options:

Master Movie Listing
  - This is a vast listing of many of the popular movies that are currently
    available on tape.  Currently only a small portion of the list is
    included with HML, but the entire list will be sent to donators of $20.00
    or more.

Movie Types
  - This is a list of the different types of movies such as: Drama, Comedy,      
    etc.

Tape Contents
  - This is the actual tape contents of your personal library.  It includes
    information such as movie starting position, ending position, and quality    
    of the recording.

Movie listing by Cast
  - This option allows you to list movies that have a certain cast member, for
    example you could list all the movies that Eddie Murphy is in.

Reports
  - This brings up a menu with various reports that you can print with your
    printer including:  Personal Library List sorted by Title, Personal Library
    List sorted by Tape#, & Master Movie List sorted by Title.

Exit Program
  - Duh, quit the program George.

Future options:
There are a variety of options that I have considered for future releases of 
the program.   Some of the ideas that I have had are:

  - Online help screens

  - Have a report print in a label format so that you could attach the label     
    to your tape.  Information on the label would probably be: Movie Title,      
    Rating, Starting Position, Ending, & Recording Quality.


  - Pop-up window for Media Type (Similar to MOVIE TYPE & COUNTRY windows)
    This would allow for the addition of future media types as well as the
    elimination of obsolete types.

  - Pop-up window for movie rating to allow a more flexible rating other
    than the current standard: G PG PG-13 R X NR

Other enhancements are open for discussion and I encourage you to write to me 
and give your suggestions.
