## Information about "DOS PRACTICE"

    This program is a new approach to the development of proficiency and
    speed in the use of DOS. It is not a tutorial, and is not intended
    simply to teach the basic knowledge needed to use a personal computer.
    Its purpose is to increase practical knowledge, skill, and speed in the
    use of DOS by providing what people need most -- practice.
    
    Sessions of simulated interaction with DOS can be selected for
    whatever topic or level of expertise is desired, whether the student is
    a novice or has been using personal computers for years. DOS
    PRACTICE is also a very effective refresher in DOS usage, and
    complements computer tutorials, written courses, and classes taught by
    instructors. Interaction with the program is mostly self-explanatory,
    but context-sensitive help may be called at any time.
