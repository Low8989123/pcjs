## Information about "QPACS"

    QPACS is a personal accounting program that can handle up to nine
    different bank accounts, keep track of user defined budgets, record
    investments, assets and liabilities, and estimate your federal income
    taxes.
    
    For each bank account you may record check amounts, deposits, interest
    and service charges. QPACS can balance the bank statements, and it can
    print out a complete check register or a summary register by user-
    defined categories. The program can also print out a net worth
    calculation report, which is based upon the information from the
    checking accounts, the investments, and the assets and liabilities.
    QPACS also has a built-in address and phone number index card system
    which is very helpful for keeping track of the people and businesses
    that are important to your finances, and a household inventory file. The
    latest release also prints checks and includes a recurring check file.

K. Net Worth Calculation.  Your Net Worth is calculated and printed
based on information in your Checkbook Files, Investment File, and
asset/Liability File.  To be most accurate, make sure all files have
been updated before proceeding.

L.  Federal Income Tax Estimator.

	The Income Tax Estimator is designed to help you estimate your
     federal income taxes and to compare one year to the next.  For
     example, you could estimate 1988 taxes and print and save them. 
     Then you could later re-read 1988, made some "what-if" changes and
     compare the results to the original estimate.  The new estimate
     could be stored, replacing the old estimate or could be stored with
     a separate name.  To print the results for comparisons, use the
     print-screen key.

	To calculate taxes for a year, the tax rate file for that year must
     be in the current path. The tax rate files are named TAXnn.FIL,
     where nn = the tax year.  For example, the tax rate file for 1987
     is named TAX87.FIL.  New tax rate files will be available when the
     IRS finalizes the years' rates and rules.  

	Note:  QPACS calculates taxes using the Tax Schedules.  IRS
     instructions say to use the Tax Tables if your taxable income is
     below $50,000.00.  Therefore there may be a few dollars difference
     between the QPACS calculation and your actual taxes.

	To use the Tax Estimator, key in "F" from the main menu.  

	Key in the fields as indicated by the help box in the lower right
     hand corner of the screen.  For more help press the ESCape key.

	To save a file, press F9.  Then key in the file name for the file
     to save.  Files will be saved in the current path.  Just enter the
     file name (and extension if desired).  Example:  MY1987.TAX

	To read in a previously saved file, press F1.  Then key in the file
     name of the saved file.  Reading in a saved file will overlay any
     existing file already on the screen.  

	Schedules A and B.  These schedules can be calculated separately or
     you can just enter the estimated amount on the Schedule A and B
     lines.  If you do use the separate Schedules, the amount will
     automatically be forwarded to the 1040 screen.  Be sure you perform
     the calculate function (F8) before returning to the 1040 screen.

	To calculate the tax at any point just press the F8 key.

	Note:  The calculate function (F8) only calculates the data on the
     current screen.  If you were to read in, for example, your 1987 tax
     estimate, change the tax year to 1988 and press F8, you would not
     recalculate Schedules A and B.  In order to do this properly you
     must read in 1987, go to Schedule A (F2), calculate (F8), return
     (F10), change the tax year to 88, and calculate (F8).  Follow the
     same procedure for Schedule B.

	To clear all the fields on the screen (including those on the
     Schedule A and B screens) press F7.  

	Press F10 to end the Tax session and return to the main menu.  You
     may later come back to the Income Tax Estimator and continue.  Once
     you end your QPACS session and return to DOS, however, you will
     lose all of your keyed data.  Be sure to save your file before
     exiting from QPACS.

M. Index Card File.

     First Name, Address Line 1, Address Line 2 if required, City,

     memo lines.  Press enter to bypass any field.  When all fields
     have been entered, you have the choice of bypassing the record
     (ESCape) or accepting (Enter).
 
     2. F2 or D or Enter.  To display all fields of the current
     highlighted card.  Press enter to return.
 
     3. F3 or C.  To change the current highlighted card.  Enter
     changed data or press enter.  When all fields have been
     entered, you have the choice of bypassing the record (ESCape)
     or accepting (Enter).
 
     4. F4 or L.  To delete the current highlighted card.  The
     space for the card will continue to appear until the file is
     sorted.

     the file.

     8. ESCape or H.  Help Screen.

 
N. Year End Processing.  Year End Processing clears your checkbook
transaction file of last year's transactions and sets up balance forward
totals for the new year.  Any new year transactions or uncleared prior
year's transactions are kept on the new file.  Before starting make sure
all bank statements have been balanced and all "cleared" transactions
are properly coded.
