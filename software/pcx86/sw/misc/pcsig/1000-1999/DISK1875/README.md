## Information about "THE RETIREMENT FINANCIAL PROJECTOR"

    Retiring soon?  You need to plan your retirement finances if you want
    to enjoy the good life.  THE RETIREMENT FINANCIAL PROJECTOR is just the
    program that can do it for you.
    
    The RETIREMENT FINANCIAL PROJECTOR is designed primarily for the person
    who is contemplating retirement in a few years.  However, if your
    retirement is far in the future, or if you have already retired, you
    will also find it useful.  If you plan to retire soon, the projector
    provides a guide that leads you through the process of analyzing your
    retirement assests and needs, so that you can determine what you must
    accomplish in order to achieve the retirement lifestyle you desire. The
    RETIREMENT FINANCIAL PROJECTOR consists of two unique Lotus 1-2-3
    templates, an expenses template and a projection template.
    
    The projection template allows a parametric evaluation of investment
    growth through your retirement years.  Investment returns, inflation,
    and retirement income are built-in parameters.  Investment options, such
    as annuities, life insurance, and tax deferred investments also may be
    studied parametrically.  The capability of incorporating other
    parameters is limited only by your imagination and spreadsheet skill.
    
    The expenses template tracks and projects the expenses you have today
    and what they will be during your retirement years.
    
    The RETIREMENT FINANCIAL PROJECTOR can provide you with the opportunity
    to plan and project your retirement finances so that you can really live
    the good life.
