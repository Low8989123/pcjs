## Information about "WORD FUGUE DISK 1 OF 2 (1971)"

    This a heavy duty wordprocessing program with an optional WordStar
    compatible interface.  It's ideal for the touch typist, since
    there is no need to take your hands off the home row to activate any
    functions.  Its features are extensive and include:
    
    ~ Eight editing windows
    
    ~ Context-sensitive help
    
    ~ Pull-down menus
    
    ~ Printer support that includes laser printers
    
    ~ Generation of indexes and tables of contents.
    
    ~ Macro facilities, the ability to record keystrokes, and a number of
    macro files for additional flexibility.
    
    ~ Automatic reformatting of text
    
    ~ Support of newspaper style columns, with word wrap and justification
    of each column.  Column mode blocks that can be defined and copied,
    moved or deleted.
    
    ~ Comprehensive monitor support -- Mono, CGA, EGA or VGA or Hercules
    graphics.
    
    ~ A DOS shell that permits the use of all DOS commands from within the
    program.
    
    ~ A pop up calculator with 16 functions.  The calculation result can
    be pasted into your text.
    
    ~ Support for box and line drawing, with characters available at the
    press of a key.
    
    ~ Optional on screen display of fonts and the ability to edit text
    with this mode operating (unlike WordStar).
    
    ~ Printing with multiple headers and footers, including functions such
    as current date or time.
    
    Hundreds of other sophisticated features are included such as
    insertion of current date or time (in different formats), the ability
    to mark changed text in the left hand margin, and offset page number
    on odd or even pages.  Registered users get a 100,000-word dictionary
    and an updated program that will add or delete words from the
    dictionary.
    
    The wordprocessor document files are ASCII text files, so there are no
    funny embedded characters and the files are WordStar compatible, so
    you can load them into any wordprocessor that reads WordStar files.
    
    Apart from printer control strings, all formatting commands are by use
    of dot commands (. in column one) or embedded functions ({. }) in the
    text body.
