## Information about "PC-ESTIMATOR 2 OF 2 (ALSO 1383)"

    PC-ESTIMATOR helps you estimate building costs for projects of all sizes
    and kinds, from skyscrapers to kitchen remodeling.  Developed by
    construction professionals, the program can be changed to be as large or
    small, as complex or simple as you want.  The bottom line is custom cost
    estimates with your markup and choice of detail included.
    
    You begin with pull-down menus, lots of help, documentation and sample
    files.  You will build material price lists and cost data that keeps
    accumulating.  The databases are unlimited, growing as your application
    grows.  They include markups, labor and equipment rates, standard cost
    codes and vendor tracking.  You can have different markups for
    individual estimates or multiple estimates carried out simultaneously.
    
    The program produces reports for several levels of detail in estimates
    including itemized and built-in markup applications, and allows for
    ``what if'' type analyses.  An on-screen takeoff calculator with memory
    is available at the touch of a function key.  The data files are 100%
    compatible with dBase III+ application programs and are
    translatable by Lotus and Symphony.  Lookup windows allow you to view
    any file at any time.
    
    Wage rates for a number of construction trades are included with the
    program.  They are tied to four-digit codes commonly used by the
    construction industry.  Based on union rates, they are the average of
    several major U.S. cities and can easily be customized to fit your area.
