## Information about "GRAB PLUS WITH LASERLABEL"

    GRAB PLUS is a memory-resident utility that grabs an address
    typed with a wordprocessor and immediately prints it.
    
    While using your wordprocessor, you can call up the GRAB PLUS menu by
    pressing a selected hot key.  A box then appears which is used for
    grabbing the address to be printed.  It does not matter what the size of
    the address is because you can adjust the size of the box.  You can edit
    the address before printing or even type in a whole new address.  GRAB
    PLUS also prints a default return address on the envelope.  Once the
    address is printed, GRAB PLUS disappears back into memory, returning you
    to normal computer operation.
    
    GRAB PLUS has a database that stores and organizes address information
    that you can easily  access for printing.  You can also mark groups of
    addresses to be printed at one time.  The database can import or export
    data with other programs.  GRAB PLUS is the program to grab if you want
    an easy and quick way to print out nicely typed envelopes with your
    computer.
    
    The LASERLABEL program was created to allow users of the GRAB Plus
    Envelope Printer to turn their data files into a powerful label printing
    system.  Now you can take the data files from GRAB and print labels on
    your LaserJet, DeskJet, and other printers.  The program will allow you
    to use different label formats from Avery, as well as using soft fonts
    for added impact to your mailings.  The program recognizes the tag
    fields of GRAB and will select by tags if you like.  The LASERLABEL
    system comes with a sample set of soft fonts to show you how your labels
    can have a creative appearance for greater impact.
