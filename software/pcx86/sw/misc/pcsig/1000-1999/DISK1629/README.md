## Information about "KINDERMATH"

    Up-and-coming computer hackers will love the sounds and colors of this
    educational math game. Basic enough for any age just starting to add,
    subtract, multipy, or divide. There are some quick instructions for
    Mom and Dad to get the child started, but once started, the child can
    easily run KINDERMATH.
    
    The program will ask the child what he/she wishes to practice.
    KINDERMATH then runs a timed drill (time can also be specified by the
    user), keeping track of correct answers. Encouraging beeps move the
    child along. This is an excellent way to give a youngster a head start
    in today's technological age.
