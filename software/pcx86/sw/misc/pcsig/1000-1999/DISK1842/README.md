## Information about "REFORMAT/RSTPRINT"

    REFORMAT will reformat a TurboBASIC source file by removing extra line
    feeds so that there is only one blank line between statements.  Blanks
    in sets of 8 will be replaced with tabs to save space, and some other
    spaces will be removed.  Also, all characters not in quotes will be
    changed to upper case.  Try this program on a few work files first to be
    sure you like the way it formats a program's source code.
    
    The on/off switch is often the first thing to fail with computer
    products; so quit shortening the life of your printer when RSTPRINT will
    reset your printer without ever reaching for the switch.  This easy to
    use program quickly resets any printer on a parallel port on your
    system.  It does not check for any other operation, just issues a reset.
    
    RSTPRINT is unique in that it does not require the printer to be ready,
    or on-line.  If the printer is powered on and not ready, off-line, it
    will be set to a ready condition, on-line, after RSTPRINT is run.
    RSTPRINT causes the printer to do a power-on reset, which is the same as
    turning the printer power off and back on.  RSTPRINT is an excellent
    program to use after you have done some fancy printing because it sets
    the printer back to its default settings.
