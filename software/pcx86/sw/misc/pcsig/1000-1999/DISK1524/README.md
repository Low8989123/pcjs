## Information about "SPROGH"

    If you enjoyed spiralling away hours with Spirograph(tm) as a kid, you
    won't be able to resist this computerized version of the famous drawing
    game!  And with SPROGH, you won't have to worry about your pen slipping
    at the last minute and ruining your artistic efforts!
    
    At first SPROGH is a little more difficult to use than the actual game
    since the effect of the "disks" and "rings" can be tough to visualize.
    But after some experimentation anyone can become a pro at creating the
    telltale spirograph spirals.  SPROGH is very versatile; it permits
    adjustment of image size and shape, and has the ability to rotate an
    existing drawing or even create nested spirographs.
    
    Images can be saved and reloaded for later display and there is a more
    limited version of the program for those of us more artistically inept.
    Great fun for the young, or bored, computer user.

Disk No: 1524
Program Title: SPROGH version 3.2
PC-SIG version: 1.0

If you enjoyed spiralling away hours with Spirograph(tm) as a kid, you
won't be able to resist this computerized version of the famous drawing
game!  And with SPROGH, you won't have to worry about your pen slipping
at the last minute and ruining your artistic efforts!

At first SPROGH is a little more difficult to use than the actual game
since the effect the "disks" and "rings" involved can be tough to
visualize.  But after some experimentation anyone can become a pro at
creating the telltale spirograph spirals.  SPROGH is very versatile, it
permits adjustment of image size and shape, and has the ability to
rotate an existing drawing or even create nested spirographs.

Images can be saved and reloaded for later display and there is a more
limited version of the program for us more artistically inept to use.
This great fun for the young, or bored, computer user.

Synopsis: If you enjoyed making spirals with Spirograph(tm) as a kid,
you are gonna love this computerized version!

Usage:  Amusement/Game.

LILSPROGH
by phil paustian 

Requirements:IBM PC or compatible, a Basic language, and a graphics card.

    This program creates some of the same designs as SPROGH, but is much
simpler. Load Basic, then load and run the program, and you will be given
two input prompts. Type in any two numbers, hitting [Enter] after each,
and the program will draw a design for you.  If you want a curved design
use two small numbers, between plus and minus 15 or thereabouts.  If you
use large numbers, you may find it a challenge to create aesthetically
pleasing patterns, but keep trying and you'll be rewarded when you least
expect it. You might try some of these examples for inspiration: 2 and 90;
124 and 2; 4 and 91; 42 and 238; 38 and 90; 116 and 2; 68 and 100; 124 and
240; 12 and 132; 42 and 282; 110 and 50; 34 and 64; 256 and 336; 58 and 94;
124 and 64; 132 and 48; 138 and 46; 130 and 46; 56 and 2; 3 and 60.
    If the drawings don't fit correctly on your screen, just fiddle around
with the variables E,F,G, and H in line 1 of the program until it fits.

    Sprogh is a program that simulates the curved designs of a spirograph.  
As you can probably imagine, a spirograph is something that is much easier
to use than it is to describe.  I would guess that you will learn alot more 
about this program by running it than you will by reading this manual. 
However, I will give you a brief description of all of the commands to help 
you as well as I can.
    I suggest printing out this manual and reading the appropriate sections 
as you use the program.  From DOS you can use the command
"TYPE SPROGH.DOC >PRN" to get a copy on your printer.

        RUNNING SPROGH

    From DOS type "Sprogh".  You can watch the introductory screen draw two
sample spirograph designs, or press any key to start.  Hit "C" for color or
"M" for monochrome and the program will begin.
    You will be presented a menu with seventeen choices, a rather
intimidating assortment of arcane jargon.  To enter any menu
selection simply hit the first letter of that command (the capitalized
letter).  For the novice, the commands you will want to learn first
are Disk, Ring, Pen, Go, Clear, Quit, and Examples.  Once you've mastered
these you can move on to the other commands. Start at the top and the
bottom of the menu and work your way toward the middle.

                                 GO
    Go:  This command tells the computer to draw the presently set design.  
Just hit the letter "G" and it goes to work.  You must first put numbers
into "Disk gears" and "Ring gears" so it will know what to draw.  You will 
be returned to the menu as soon as the design is completed.  If you want
to stop sooner, just hit any key while the design is being drawn to get
back to the menu.

                            CLEAR SCREEN
    Clear screen:  Hit the letter "C" to erase the screen.  Simple enough.  
Maybe too simple.  Before you go wiping out designs indescriminately, think 
for a moment of the tragic loss.  If Leonardo da Vinci had had a "C" key
the world might never have seen Mona's smile.

                                QUIT
    Quit:  Hit "Q" to quit.  You will be asked "ARE YOU SURE?"  Press "Y"
to quit or any other key to continue.  Naturally you will be so enthralled
by SPROGH that you will wish you never had to use this command.  But such
is life.  All good things must have a "Quit" command.

                            DISK and RING
    Disk and Ring: First a brief refresher course in spirography. If you
remember the spirograph you had when you were much, much younger, you had
an assortment of plastic rings which had to be pinned down onto the paper.
You also had some smaller round disks that were spun around inside the ring
to create a design. The ring and disk had alot of gear teeth around their
rim. The "Disk gear" command asks you to tell the computer how many gears
the disk should have. When you are in the menu, hit the letter "D" and a
prompt at the bottom of the screen will ask you what to change Disk gears
to. Type in a number and hit return. Or you can just hit return without any
number to leave the number unchanged. You may also hit the escape key at
any time to get out of any command you didn't want to make.
    Both Disk and Ring must be set at some number other than 0 before you
can draw a design. The larger the number, the larger the disk will be. The
same thing goes for the "Ring gear" command.
    Actually, the program will automatically draw every design the same
size, large enough to fill the screen, unless you tell it not to.  So
changing "Disk" or "Ring" will not affect the size of the design.  But the
combination of those two numbers will tell the program what design to draw. 
To create an authentic spirograph design Ring should be a larger number
than Disk (otherwise the disk wouldn't fit inside the ring, obviously), but 
the program won't complain if you throw logic out the window.
    By experimenting with these two numbers you will learn that whenever
the Ring is three times the size of Disk the program will always draw a
triangular design. But if you use very large numbers the design will be
drawn very slowly. Using smaller numbers will speed up the drawing, but if
the numbers are too small, let's say below twenty or so, the curve will not
be smooth.
    Try these examples:
        C D 20 [Return] R 60 [Return] G 
        C D 100 [Return] R 300 [Return] G
        C D 8 [Return] R 24 [Return] G
    Then try these variations:
        C D 20 [Return] R 80 [Return] G
        C D 20 [Return] R 82 [Return] G
        C D 20 [Return] R 42 [Return] G
    By now you're ready to choose your own designs.  Experiment.  Be
daring.  Let your spirit guide you to all the images you can create.  Let
the immortal Muse of Spirography inspire the artist within your soul.
    But wait.  With a real spirograph, there are two ways to make a design, 
by spinning the disk inside the ring, and by spinning it outside.  With
SPROGH creating an outside design is as simple as using a negative number
for either Disk or Ring (not both). Like this:
        D -30 [Return] R 100 [Return] G

                                 PEN
    Pen position: Another method you can use in a real spirograph to change
the way a design looks is by moving the pen position. Every disk had a
number of holes in it. If you put the pen in a hole near the edge of the
disk, you got a design with sharp points. Holes near the center gave
nothing but gentle curves. This effect is acheived with SPROGH by changing
"Pen position". If Pen is 1, the pen is set right at the edge of the disk;
if Pen is 0, the pen is in the center of the disk. You can choose any
position between those two extremes, or you can take a step beyond what was
possible with a real spirograph by setting Pen at a number greater than 1.
That puts the pen outside the physical border of the disk.
    If you are really astute you will realize that a real spirograph could
draw these impossible designs, but only by choosing a different disk size.
But please don't give yourself a headache trying to figure out how.
    Try out some examples:
        C D 30 [Return] R 120 [Return] P 1 [Return] G
        P .5 [Return] G
        P 1.5 [Return] G
        P 0 [Return] G
    Of course, all these designs are the same size because the program is
automatically making every design fill the screen.  See the section of this 
manual on "Size" to learn how to change that. 
    This might be a good time to mention a couple features of this program 
that make entering numbers easier. The left arrow key can be used as a
backspace, while the right arrow key will either type one character from
the default (previous) setting, or it will retype what you destroyed with
the backspace. Hitting the center key on the numberpad, the '5' key, will
type the entire default.
    Secondly, instead of entering numbers directly and absolutely, you have
the option of adding a number to the present setting. Simply type a '+'
before the number and it will be added to the default, or a '+-' (Plus
sign, Minus sign) to subtract. For example if P is 1.5 then typing 'P+.1'
makes it 1.6. Typing 'P+-1.1' will then set the pen position to .5.

                              EXAMPLES
    Examples:  Just hit the letter "E" and the computer will begin drawing
several examples of what this program is able to do.  At any time while a
design is being drawn you can simply hit any key and you will be returned
to the menu.  When you stop the examples, the menu will show you the
numbers that were required to create this design.
    If you have mastered these commands, you are ready to explore all the
possibilities SPROGH has to offer.  Check out each of the remaining
commands as you wish.

                                MOVE
    Move:  You can move the design anywhere you choose on the screen.  The
screen is set up so that the top of the screen is "U 100".  The
bottom is "D 100".  The left and right sides are "L 150" and "R 150". Keep 
the design within those limits.  To make a move hit "M" followed by the
letter corresponding to the direction you want to move, followed by the
distance and [Return]. Prompts at the bottom of the screen will remind you
what to do, and a crosshair will show you where you're at on the screen. 
You might choose to move the design to "R 50" so that it won't be covered
up by the menu, especially on a color monitor that uses a bigger menu.

                                TURN
    Turn:  It does what it says, it turns the design whatever number of
degrees you enter. "T 180" will set a design upside down, while "T 5" will
just turn it slightly out of its normal position.  "T+5" will turn it five
degrees from its previous setting, and this simplifies the task if you want 
to draw the same design several times turning the design just a little bit
each time.  One good turn deserves another.
    There is one special function of Turn.  If you set Turn at 999, the design 
will continue drawing from where it left off.  That allows you to stop a 
drawing in the middle, then change the color for instance, then continue with 
the rest of the design.  However, the computer won't automatically quit
drawing now until it reaches the spot where it was restarted.

                                SIZE
    Size:  To change the size of a design hit "S".  You will be given three
choices, "Auto, Fixed, or Nested".  Hit "A", "F" or "N".
    If you choose "Auto" you will be asked to enter a number, usually
between 0 and 1 if you want the design to fit on the screen.  Entering .5
will give you a design one half as large as the normal size; .1 would be
one tenth the normal size.  You get the idea.  The current size is
indicated by the number under the word size in the menu.
    Your second option is "Fixed".  Hitting the letter "F" will freeze the 
scale at the present setting.  That means that from now on, different
designs will be different sizes.  Instead of every design filling the
screen automatically, now the ring is fixed to its present position on the 
screen, and future drawings have to rotate around this ring position. 
    Setting a smaller Pen position will give you a smaller design, choosing
different Disk or Ring settings will also change the size. This option is
handy for making inner designs fit inside outer designs, or making changes
in the Pen position act exactly as they would in a "real spirograph."
(Pretty soon I'm going to have to start calling a "real spirograph" what it
really is, nothing more than a "Manually-operated Sprogh.")
    For example, choose Disk and Ring settings you like, then make several
designs using different pen positions to remind yourself what that does. 
Now clear the screen, set Pen position at '2', hit 'S F', and you are in
Fixed mode.  Draw the design, change Pen position to 1.5 and draw it again. 
Make several more drawings with Pen position anywhere between 0 and 2.  If
you make Pen position greater than 2, the design will be too large for the
screen, but I can tell you're just the kind of rebel who's going to do it
anyway just because I told you not to.  To get back to "Auto" mode, type
"S A [Return]".
    The final choice is "Nested".  Nested calculates how large a hole
exists in the center of the design.  It then changes the "Size" to cause
new designs to fit in the center.  It also changes size to "Auto" so that
any design drawn now will fit neatly inside that hole.
    Whew.  That was confusing.  If you now understand how to use the
various size options, you are truly a SPROGHmeister.  If not, a little
experimentation might teach you enough to use these commands profitably.

                                OVAL
    Oval:  You can make your drawing either a vertical or horizontal oval
by changing this number.  A setting of 1 gives you a circle.  A setting
between 0 and 1 gives a tall oval, while settings greater than 1 create wide 
ovals.  One way you might choose to use this setting is to really make
SPROGH fill the whole screen.  Here's how:
        Type "O 1.5 [Return] S A 1.5 [Return]"
This will give you an oval that is as wide and as tall as the screen.

                                HUE
    Hue: That means color, but I had to use "C" to clear the screen, so
you'll just have to get used to saying Hue. I have to admit that I only
have a Hercules monochrome monitor, so I have not tested this program with
color. Let me know if it works. With monochrome screens the only thing this
command will do is set the color black or white. Even numbers (Black) can
be used to erase designs without clearing the whole screen.

                             LOAD/SAVE
    Load/save:  For saving your masterpieces.  When you hit "L" you are
given two options, Disk or Memory.  You can save a design on disk (in
Basic Bload format) by choosing the Disk option. Simply tell the computer
whether you want to load an image from disk or save one to disk. Then enter
the file name. If you do not type in a file name, the computer will use the
default "SPIRO1".
    Your second option here is to load/save to memory.  At any time the
program can hold one image in memory.  You can use this to undo a mistake,
or to easily combine two or more images.  When you choose to load an image
from memory, there will be four options to choose from.  They are:
    RESTORE: erases whatever is presently on the screen and brings back the 
saved image exactly as it was stored.
    NEGATIVE: erases the screen and brings back the old image with the 
color reversed, so every black pixel is white and vice versa.
    SUM: adds the saved image to the image presently on the screen. Any
point that was white on either screen will remain white.
    ICON: adds the saved image in a way that allows it to be subtracted
again.  Choosing this option once adds the saved image to the present
image.  Choosing it a second time erases the saved image and returns the
screen to the same condition it was in before you loaded that image.

                               BLANK
    Blank menu:  This command erases the menu so it never hides the design.
Hitting "B" a second time will restore the menu.

                               WIPE
    Wipe: This is a paint fill-in command.  Choose a color or pattern to
fill in either inside or outside of your design.  Use the Move command to
move the crosshairs to the section of the screen you wish to fill in.  Then 
hit "W" for wipe. Now enter a number from 1 to 8 to fill in that part of
the screen with a solid color, or a number from 10 to 99 to choose a tile
pattern. The color or pattern you choose will paint the screen, filling
outward until it reaches any line that is the color of the presently set
Hue. Experiment and you'll see what I mean.
Examples:
"C W1 [Return]"
"C W96 [Return]"
"C D20 [Return] R85 [Return] G W96 [Return] M R 130 [Return] W96 [Return]"
    This program was written using a Hercules monitor.  So I confess I have 
absolutely no idea whether these patterns will work as expected on a color
screen.  I suspect most will be garbage in color. But just in case they do 
work, but you don't like the colors try patterns from 110 on up to about
5000.  These are the same 90 patterns with various color shifts. Drop me a
line and tell me how it looks.

                               AGAIN
    Again:  This is one of those commands that was created with the true
Sproghmeister in mind.  This command lets you repeat any series of commands 
over and over.  When you choose this option, you will be asked to enter the 
command list.  Simply type in the commands exactly as you would normally,
but without hitting [Return] until you're finished.  After you hit [Return] 
you will be asked how many times to repeat.
    For example, hit "A". Then at the "Again:" prompt, type
"ML5T+5P+-.1G [Return]" The computer will now ask "How many times?"
Type "10 [Return]". The computer will now Move Left 5, Turn 5 degrees,
Subtract 0.1 from the current Pen position, and draw the design. Then it
will do it again 9 more times. 
    One more feature of Again:  place an "A" at the end of the command list 
and when the computer reaches the "A" it will start over at the beginning.  
This will give you an infinite loop.  For example, at the "Again:" prompt,
type "H+1GA".  This will draw the same design over and over, just
changing the color each time.  On a monochrome screen it will draw the
design, then erase it, then draw it again, over and over and over.
    If you so desire, you can also put a number after the "G" to tell the
program who many points to draw before it quits, in case you want it to
stop drawing before the design is finished.  You'll have to use trial
and error to determine how large a number you want to use.  One possible
use on a color monitor: set Turn to 999. Then enter the Again command and
type this string:
    H+1G3A
That will draw your design in constantly changing colors.

                                FORM
    Form:  We have come to the last command.  I saved this one for last
because it is not really part of a real spirograph simulation.  Hitting "F" 
toggles the program back and forth between Gear input and Degree input. 
You will notice that when you hit "F" the numbers under Disk and Ring
change.  If a disk has 20 gear teeth around its rim, then each tooth is 18
degrees wide (20 x 18 = 360 degrees). If it has 60 gear teeth, each tooth
is 6 degrees wide. "Form Degrees" lets you enter those numbers by the
number of degrees instead of by the number of gear teeth.
    But that isn't the only thing this command changes. The Disk and Ring
sizes and rotation are also calculated differently. This command is useful
for creating unusual designs that look nothing like a spirograph. In a
spirograph you will normally use Disk and Ring settings between around 20
to around 200 or so. With "Form: Degrees" you should try using all numbers
between 1 and 360.
    It will be more of a challenge to find designs that look aesthetic with 
"Form: Degrees".  But some people like a challenge.  Hit "F" to get into
the "Form: Degrees" mode, and then hit "E" to see a half dozen examples of
what you can do.  You will see that these designs are very angular, unlike
a spirograph.  They are also more complex and varied than a spirograph. 
While running the examples, you can hit a key at any time to stop, and then 
look at the Disk and Ring settings to see what numbers created those
designs.

                             THE HIDDEN COMMANDS
    There are a couple of commands that are not mentioned in the menu.  It
sounds mysterious and vaguely ominous, but the truth is, I just ran out of
room in the menu, and the remaining commands are too trivial and useless to 
deserve mention.  Judge for yourself.  The hidden commands are:

                             INITIALIZE
    Initialize:  This command simply resets all variables to their original 
value except Disk and Ring.  It's not a command you'll use very often, but
it might save a few keystrokes once in a while.

                             VERSION
    Version:  Tells you the version number of your copy of Sprogh and
reminds you to send in your checks and money orders and IOU's and the
change you dug out of the sofa to yours truly.

                             ZILCH
    Zilch:  Does absolutely nothing except delays one second and beeps at
you. The only conceivable use for this command is to slow down an Again
Command.  Example: Type "C W10 [Return]"; Hit "A"; Enter "CW+1Z [Return]"
When you are asked "How many times?" Enter "90".  The program will now show 
you all the Wipe patterns available and give you one second to view each
before showing the next one.
