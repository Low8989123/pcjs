## Information about "VGACAD 2 OF 3 (ALSO 1587, 2122)"

    VGACAD is an all-purpose graphics editor, image processor and paint
    program to create, enhance, or colorize digitized images.
    
    VGACAD provides 21 brush shapes with 5 different brush modes, normal,
    spray, air#1, air#2, and eraser. There are 256 color fills, border
    tracing, and pattern/gradient fills. Three modes of zoom editing are
    also available. Air#1 (airbrush) adds a color mixture as you paint
    over your picture, just like a real air brush. Air#2 mixes colors in
    more gradually. Spray, when used with the Mask feature, has the
    effect of placing a stencil over the painted area. Colorize grey
    images in the same way old movies are reborn in color. Cut and Paste
    functions are also fully supported.
    
    VGACAD provides several ways of altering the size and orientation of an
    image. Rotate the entire screen 90x or continue to 180x to turn it
    upside-down. Create a mirror image, or an upside-down mirror image, of
    any defined area.
    
    VGACAD supports .BLD, .PLT, .GIF and .CLP file formats. Utilities are
    provided to convert pictures to VGA from CGA and EGA, and from VGA to
    EGA. Also available is a VGA print utility that prints any viewable
    color picture in 7 user-selected grey shades. Shrink large-sized
    pictures. Edit large .GIF files (up tp 32K x 32K x 256).
    
    VGACAD has been used by such institutions as Lawrence Livermore Labs,
    the University of Pittsburgh, Warner Brothers, and the New York Times.

Update v2.6     * Video/Monitor Adjustment to correct/adjust video modes'
                  vertical/horizontal aspect ratio, screen location and
                  screen size.  Ideal for 'GENLOCK' add-on cards which
                  send NTSC/PAL/whatever signals for video editing and
                  presentations.

                * Hardcoded Everex EV-678 support.

                * BUGFIX: Video7 mode setting occasionally failed; this
                  has been corrected.

                * BUGFIX: Trident bank-switching for interpolated screens
                  was not bank-switching; this has been corrected.

                  Note: We cannot ensure proper Trident bank-switching and
                  mode setting for all Trident-based cards since there are
                  reported inconsistencies with some manufacturers using
                  the Trident chipset. <sheesh>.

                * User-definable EEGA/SVGA modes to 2048x2048x256 !

                * NEW USER EEGA/SVGA *.CFG files (e.g., 1024x768x16 modes)

Update v2.0-2.5 * More turbo-charging - EVEN FASTER !

                * UNSUPPORTED VGA 640x400x16 mode for Amiga HAM GIFs.

                * CONTRAST and BRIGHTNESS adjustment features.

                * Bugfix: Having to go back and select from the *.BLD or
                  *.GIF filetypes for each picture need be done only once
                  for each filetype.

                * Bugfix: Incorrect file selection when using "**MORE**"
                  has been fixed.  Now select >63 files for viewing.

                * 16-color EEGA modes switch to 16-color SVGA with 16 out
                  256KB colors when GIF colors are 16 or less.
                * Enhanced 16-color posterization - better selection !
                * EGA 640x350x16 mode included for those old GIFs. EGA is
                  now the minimum video card requirement; EGA users can
                  use MVGAVU from menus or through Command-line viewing,
                  Batch viewing or Slideshows.
                * VGA 640x480x16 mode included for those old GIFs.
                * Automatic posterization of 256-color GIFs in EGA/EEGA/VGA
                  16-color modes.

                * SLIDESHOWS !!!  MVGAVU decides which mode best views your
                  GIF in EGA, MCGA, VGA, MVGA or SVGA mode.
                * SMARTER Command-line (batch) viewing: it automatically
                  selects the most appropriate mode (i.e., EGA 640x350x16,
                  VGA 640x480x16, MCGA 320x200x256, MVGA 320x400x256,
                  MVGA 360x480x256, MVGA 640x400x16, SVGA 640x400x256,
                  SVGA 640x480x256, SVGA 800x600x256) for worry-free demos.

                * Bugfix: C&T bank switching routine corrected.
                * Inclusion of C&T and Everex modes for 'smart' Slideshow.
                * Harcoded Everex and Chips & Technologies SVGA support.
                * More "SuperVGA" support; hardcoded optimization for
                  ATI VGA Wonder chips, Trident chips (Logix, Maxon,...)
                  now included aside from Tseng, Paradise and Video7
                  chips already included.

                * SVGA saves to *.RAW file (i.e., RAW2GIF conversion)
                  for ALL harcoded SVGA modes supported in MVGAVU (e.g.,
                  after downsizing to 640x400x256 and/or adjusting color
                  contrast/brightness).
                * VGACAP v5.0 and RAW2GIF v3.5 included.
                * RAW2GIF will automatically encode *.RAW file saves
                  in any of these modes supported by MVGAVU:
                                - MCGA 320x200x256
                                - MVGA 320x400x256
                                - MVGA 360x480x256
                                - SVGA 600x400x256
                                - SVGA 512x480x256 (Everex)
                                - SVGA 640x480x256
                                - SVGA 720x540x256 (Video7)
                                - SVGA 800x600x256

                * Tecmar *.CFG files included for EEGA and SVGA modes.
                * SVGA User modes now have the option of using any of the
                  hardcoded SVGA bank switching modes by specifying the
                  chip family (e.g., Tseng,Everex,Video7,Trident,C&T...)
                  resulting in FASTER decoding of those strange user
                  modes - BIOS mode is now optional.
                * Bugfix: The SVGA 256-color user-mode was using an
                  EEGA 16-color mode; this has been corrected.
                * EEGA user-definable modes up to 800x600x16 supported.
