## Information about "EXTENDED LIBRARY"

    EXTLIB is a library of over 50 C run-time video routines for the
    advanced MS-DOS C programmer.
    
    It features windows, pop-up and pull-down menus, menu bars, scroll bars,
    direct video memory I/O, and cursor control routines to be used with
    Microsoft C or QuickC.  In addition to these video routines, there are
    formatted display input routines (dollars, for instance) and advanced
    error handling functions.  The small, medium, compact, and large memory
    models are all supported.  EXTLIB also comes with the floating point
    emulator or 80x87 packages.

                          DBSCAN by SOFTSHOP

WHAT IS IT?

        DBSCAN is a utility program that provides a browse like
scroll of any dBASE III type data file. The program allows the
user to select the fields and the position on the screen where
they are viewed. DBSCAN is similar to the BROWSE command of dBASE
III except that it permits no editing or adding of data and its
position on the screen is controlled by the user. Try it, you'll
like it, and read on to learn how you can use it for your own
programming needs.


HOW DO I USE IT?

        If you have a hard disk, copy just three files DBSCAN.EXE
, DBSCAN.DBF, and DBSCAN.DOC to a directory of your choice. Execute
the program by being in the proper directory and typing DBSCAN from
the DOS prompt. If you only have a floppy drive, simple type DBSCAN
at the A: or B: prompt. You will see the following:

Database To Scan DBSCAN  (This is the sample database file provided.
                          However, you may scan any dBASE III DBF
                          type file by providing the complete pathed
                          name without the DBF extension.

        Press enter to accept the database you wish to scan. You will
then see:

Fields To View CU_CODE + SPACE(1) + DTOC(CU_DATELC) + SPACE(1)
/use right arrow to see this/           + STR(CU_TYSALES,11,2)

Title            Customer  Chg Date  Amount Chg
Starting Row            11
Starting Column         30
Length of Window        10

        The entire description of the Fields To View entry can only
be seen by panning to the right by using the right arrow key.

        The Fields To View prompt is the most critical to understand,
so don't go the sleep now. DBSCAN will show any field in the database
as long as the field is in a string type format. On the far right of
the screen the first 20 field names are shown along with their field
codes. You simply enter the field names you want, look at the example
and experiment with your own entries. For example, enter:

                CU_CODE + SPACE(1) + CU_DESCR
or try          CU_DESCR + SPACE(1) + "$" + STR(CU_LYSALES,7,0)



                               Page 1








See what I mean? All data type fields must have the DTOC conversion
applied whereas a numeric field must have the STR conversion, logical
type fields cannot be viwed. The SPACE(x) is used simply to seperate
the data as shown in the window and the + signs are used to make one
continuous string of the window record display. If you make a mistake
here you will get an error message on the top line that says QUIT?
(Q/A/I). Enter Q to quit the program and start over by typing DBSCAN
at the DOS prompt. It helps to know the various field types and sizes
of the DBF file you are scanning in order to avoid the error above.

        The Title prompt gets the description you wish to use to
headline the scan window.

        The Starting Row prompt determines the starting row for the
window scan.

        The Starting Column prompt determines the starting column
of the window scan.

        The Length of window prompt determines the number of records
shown at one time and the actual length of the window.

        Window dimensions that would go off the screen are pre-empted
with an error message. You must stay within the displayable area of
the screen.

Big Deal, so What?

        The value of DBSCAN is the ability to use its techniques in
your own dBASE programs. This can be done by purchasing the source
code with complete commented documentation. Because the source is
written in plain old dBASE III Plus code NOT utilizing any compiler
enhancements provided by CLipper, Foxbase, and QuickSilver, its PRG
file can be used for scanning DBF records for any dBASE compatible
system. DBSCAN was compiled by Clipper; however, it can be compiled
by dBASE and Foxbase as well. The source to DBSCAN can even be used
as a DO PROCEDURE from the dBASE dot prompt. I have used the source
to DBSCAN for over a year now in over 100 working custom programs to
scan and select everything from Customer Names to Inventory Receipts
for a stock item. Review the attached order form to see exactly what
you get, the cost and ordering information. In the mean time, enjoy
the use of DBSCAN without restrictions or obligations and pass it on
to your friends for their review.

                                                          Introduction

                                 Introduction

          Extended Library  is  an  extensive  library  of  C run-time
          routines that  allow easy  program implementation of many of
          today's advanced programming techniques.   Some  of Extended
          Library's  features  include  windows, pulldown menus, popup
          menus, mini-menus, menu bars, horizontal and vertical scroll
          bars, reading and writing directly to display memory without
          interference,  formatted  display  input  routines, advanced
          error  handling  functions,  and  a  wide  variety of cursor
          control routines.

          The Extended Library routines  are written  in both assembly
          language  and  C  and  can  be  used with both the Microsoft
          QuickC and C 5.0 compilers.   The Extended  Library supports
          the  small,   medium,  compact,  and  large  memory  models.
          Furthermore, both  emulation and  math coprocessor libraries
          are provided.

                                                                     1





                                                             Libraries

                                   Libraries

          Although the Extended Library  is  really  only  one  set of
          library routines,  C's support  of the various memory models
          and floating point emulation  (when necessary)  requires two
          separate  versions  of  the  library  for each memory model.
          Therefore, the Extended Library is provided in the following
          eight versions:

          Memory Model        Emulator            Coprocessor

          Small               SEXTLIBE.LIB        SEXTLIB7.LIB
          Medium              MEXTLIBE.LIB        MEXTLIB7.LIB
          Compact             CEXTLIBE.LIB        CEXTLIB7.LIB
          Large               LEXTLIBE.LIB        LEXTLIB7.LIB

          Only the  MEXTLIBE.LIB library  is provided on the shareware
          distribution disk.  Because MEXTLIBE.LIB is  a medium memory
          model  library,  its  routines  can  be used from within the
          QuickC environment by using them as part of  a quick library
          (see  Appendix  A  for  hints on producing a quick library).
          Registration is required to obtain the  other seven versions
          of the library.




























                                                                     2





                                                      Global Variables

                               Global Variables

          The Extended  Library defines  a number  of variables in the
          extlib.h file.   Through  proper use,  these variables allow
          you  to  streamline  the  Extended  Library  functions for a
          particular application.


          cursorstart, cursorend

          int cursorstart;
          int cursorend;

          The cursorstart  and  cursorend  variables  hold  the cursor
          starting line  and the cursor ending line respectively.  The
          cursor character can be  changed by  setting cursorstart and
          cursorend  to  appropriate  values  and calling the cursoron
          function.  Note that the same effect can  be accomplished by
          simply calling the setcursor function.


          _mbatt1, _mbatt2

          int _mbatt1;
          int _mbatt2;

          The    _mbatt1    and    _mbatt2   variables   control   the
          display_menu_bar    and    menu_bar    functions'    display
          attributes.   _mbatt1 is the normal attribute (initially set
          to 0x70).  _mbatt2 is the hotkey attribute (initially set to
          0x7b).   The initial values have been selected for effective
          displays on monochrome systems.    Therefore,  color monitor
          users may wish to change these values to take full advantage
          of their color system's capabilities.


          _mmatt1, _mmatt2

          int _mmatt1;
          int _mmatt2;

          The _mmatt1 and _mmatt2 variables control the display_error,
          error_handler, and  mini_menu functions' display attributes.
          _mmatt1 is the normal  attribute  (initially  set  to 0x70).
          _mmatt2  is  the  hotkey  attribute (initially set to 0x7b).
          The initial values have been selected for effective displays
          on monochrome  systems.   Therefore, color monitor users may
          wish to change these values to take full  advantage of their
          color system's capabilities.


                                                                     3





                                                      Global Variables


          nonibm

          int nonibm;

          The nonibm  variable is  used to  eliminate snow  on IBM CGA
          display adapters.   The  settext80  function  initially sets
          nonibm to  a value  of 0 if a CGA adapter is present or to a
          value of 1 if an MDA or EGA adapter is present.  If you have
          a nonIBM  CGA, you  may want  to set nonibm to a value of 1.
          This will speed up the Extended Library routines by allowing
          the  video  routines  to  read and write directly to display
          memory without waiting for the video retrace periods.


          _pdatt1, _pdatt2, _pdatt3

          int _pdatt1;
          int _pdatt2;
          int _pdatt3;

          The _pdatt1,  _pdatt2,  and  _pdatt3  variables  control the
          pulldown  and  pulldown_bar  functions'  display attributes.
          _pdatt1 is the normal  attribute  (initially  set  to 0x70).
          _pdatt2  is  the  hotkey  attribute (initially set to 0x7b).
          _pdatt3 is the highlight  bar  attribute  (initially  set to
          0x0c).   The initial values have been selected for effective
          displays on monochrome systems.    Therefore,  color monitor
          users may wish to change these values to take full advantage
          of their color system's capabilities.



          _puatt1, _puatt2, _puatt3

          int puatt1;
          int puatt2;
          int puatt3;

          The _puatt1,  _puatt2,  and  _puatt3  variables  control the
          popup function's  display attributes.  _puatt1 is the normal
          attribute (initially set to  0x70).   _puatt2 is  the hotkey
          attribute (initially set to 0x7b).  _puatt3 is the highlight
          bar attribute (initially set to 0x0c).   The  initial values
          have  been  selected  for  effective  displays on monochrome
          systems.  Therefore, color monitor users may wish  to change
          these values  to take full advantage of their color system's
          capabilities.

                                                        Standard Types

                                Standard Types

          The Extended  Library  defines  (in  extlib.h)  a  number of
          useful data types.


          boolean

          typedef int boolean;

          The boolean  data type  is used to define logical variables.
          To assist in the use of the boolean type, the  following two
          manifest constants have been defined in extlib.h:

               Constant                 Value
               TRUE                     1
               FALSE                    0


          MENU

          typedef struct {
               char string[31];
               int hotkey;
               int (*function)();
          } MENU;

          The MENU  structure is used to define menu selections in the
          display_menu_bar, menu_bar, mini_menu, popup,  pulldown, and
          pulldown_bar menu  routines.   The MENU structure is used as
          follows:

               Type                     Description
               string                   String    up     to    30
                                        characters in length that
                                        defines the  menu choice.
                                        By  setting  string  to a
                                        null string "", the popup
                                        and   pulldown  functions
                                        will display a horizontal
                                        line in the menu display.
               hotkey                   Position in string of the
                                        menu    choice's   hotkey
                                        character.
               (*function)()            Function  to  execute  if
                                        the   menu    choice   is
                                        selected.




                                                                     5





                                                        Standard Types

          MENU_HEAD

          typedef struct {
               char heading[21];
               int hotkey;
               int number;
               MENU *mptr;
          } MENU_HEAD;

          The  MENU_HEAD  structure  is  used  to define the number of
          menus for the  pulldown  and  pulldown_bar  functions.   The
          MENU_HEAD structure is used as follows:

               Type                     Description
               heading                  String     up    to    20
                                        characters in length that
                                        defines     the    menu's
                                        heading.
               hotkey                   Position  in  heading  of
                                        the    menu's    pulldown
                                        hotkey character.
               number                   Number of  choices in the
                                        pulldown menu.
               mptr                     Pointer  to  an  array of
                                        MENU    structures   that
                                        defines    the   pulldown
                                        menu.

          Description

          The close_window  routine closes  a previously opened window
          by restoring  the former  screen contents  and releasing any
          memory that was allocated during the opening of the window.


          Return Value

          close_window returns a NULL pointer of type WINDOW.

          This program  opens a text window at the coordinates (1, 20)
          and (15, 50), draws the window by clearing  it, and  draws a
          single  line  border  around  the  perimeter  of the window.
          After waiting for a key to be pressed, the program continues
          by closing the window.

          char *errmess;                Error message pointer.


          Description

          The display_error routine pop  ups a  window on  the screen,
          displays an  error message  (errmess), and  waits for either
          ENTER or  an O  to be  pressed.   Because display_error uses
          the  mini_menu  routine  to  pop up the window, the window's
          attributes can be changed  by making  appropriate changes to
          _mmatt1 and _mmatt2.


          Return Value

          No value is returned.

          Description

          The  error_handler  routine  is  an  INT 0x24 hardware error
          handler.  When passed by _harderr, error_handler will pop up
          on  the  screen  and  display  an appropriate error message.
          Additionally, error_handler will ask the operator  to select
          one  of   three  choices:   (Ignore  the  error,  Retry  the
          operation, or Abort  the  program).    Because error_handler
          uses the  mini_menu routine,  the window's attributes can be
          changed  by  making  appropriate  changes  to   _mmatt1  and
          _mmatt2.


          Return Value

          No value is returned.

          Description

          The inputstring  routine will  display or  display and input
          (as indicated by dspinpflg)  a left-justified  string with a
          field  length  of  length  at the screen position defined by
          (row, col).  During  input, HOME  will erase  the string and
          start the  input from  the beginning.  BACK SPACE will erase
          the last character entered.  The dspinpflg  parameter can be
          one  of   the  following   manifest  constants  (defined  in
          extlib.h):

               Constant                 Action
               _DISPLAY_ONLY            Only display the field.

          Description

          The mini_menu routine displays a menu by centering it at the
          coordinates  defined  by  (row,  col).  Any specified titles
          will be displayed above  the menu  choices.   Selection of a
          menu  item  is  accomplished  by  selecting  the appropriate
          hotkey (the letter indicated).  However, the choice with the
          double-lined border  can be  selected at anytime by pressing
          ENTER.  The double-lined border is moved by  pressing either
          the LEFT ARROW or the RIGHT ARROW keys.

          Description

          The open_window  routine opens  a window  at the coordinates
          defined by  (row1, col1)  and (row2,  col2).   The window is
          drawn, if the dflg so indicates, by clearing  the window and
          setting  the  window's  attributes  to watt.  Furthermore, a
          border will be drawn according to the bflg.  If  a border is
          drawn, its  attributes are  set to batt.  The dflg parameter
          can be one of the following  manifest constants  (defined in
          extlib.h):

               Constant                 Action
               _DRAW                    Draw the window.
               _NO_DRAW                 Leave     the    window's
                                        contents intact.

          The bflg parameter  can  be  on  of  the  following manifest
          constants (defined in extlib.h):

               Constant                 Action
               _NO_BORDER               The   window   is   drawn
                                        without a border.
               _SINGLE_LINE             The window  is drawn with
                                        a single-lined border.
               _DOUBLE_LINE             The window  is drawn with
                                        a double-lined border.


          Return Value

          open_window returns a pointer with the type WINDOW.

          Description

          The printfields  routine is used to display multiple fields.
          The number of fields is specified by number.  Each  field is
          defined by specifying it's position (row, col), length, type
          (typflg), and an appropriate pointer (inpptr) to the field's
          contents.   The typflg parameter can be one of the following
          manifest constants (defined in extlib.h):

               Constant                 Action
               _STRING                  Displays a string field.
               _NUMBER                  Displays a numeric field.
               _DOLLARS                 Displays a dollar field.

          Description

          The pulldown routine is used to  implement multiple pulldown
          menus.  The number of pulldown menus is defined by nummenus.
          Each of the pulldown  menus  is  defined  by  an appropriate
          MENU_HEAD structure.  This structure includes definitions of
          the menu's heading, hotkey, and a pointer to  an appropriate
          MENU structure.   At  the start  of the  pulldown routine, a
          menu bar is displayed on the specified row.   This  menu bar
          lists each  one of the menus' headings.  During the pulldown
          routine the following control keys are active:

               Key                      Action
               ALT + Heading Hotkey     Pulls down  the indicated
                                        menu.
               ESC                      Removes  the current menu
                                        from the screen.
               LEFT ARROW               Removes the  current menu
                                        from the screen and pulls
                                        down the next menu to the
                                        left.
               RIGHT ARROW              Removes  the current menu
                                        from the screen and pulls
                                        down the next menu to the
                                        right.
               Menu Item Hotkey         Executes  the appropriate
                                        menu item's function.
               ENTER                    Executes  the highlighted
                                        menu item's function.
               UP ARROW                 Moves  the  highlight bar
                                        up  to  the previous menu
                                        item.
               DOWN ARROW               Moves  the  highlight bar
                                        down to the previous menu
                                        item.

          Return Value

          If a menu item isn't selected, pulldown returns the value of

          Description

          The  save_initial_video  routine  initializes  the  Extended
          Library video  routines by  executing the settext80 routine,
          saving the cursor position  and type,  saving a  copy of the
          screen contents,  and clearing the screen.  When the program
          is finished running,  save_initial_video  will automatically
          restore the screen contents and restore the cursor.

                Appendix A - Using Extended Library With QuickC


          Constructing a Quick Library

          The first  step in  using Extended Library with QuickC is to
          construct  a  quick  library   with  the   Extended  Library
          routines.     The  following   command  will  construct  the
          necessary quick library:

               qlib /n extlib.qlb /l mextlibe.lib /s extlib.c

          The above command instructs the qlib to search  extlib.c for
          any C  run-time routines  that aren't  a part  of the QuickC
          core library.  Therefore,  the linker  will extract _harderr
          and  _hardresume  from  mlibce.lib.   These two routines are
          necessary to use error_handler in your programs.   Any other
          routines that  you wish extracted can easily be specified by
          adding their names to extlib.c.


          The QuickC Windowing Environment

          Because QuickC uses its  own  windowing  environment,  it is
          necessary to add a printf(" "); statement before calling any
          of the Extended Library video routines.  Failure  to add the
          printf(" "); statement will cause unpredictable results when
          the program is run from within the QuickC  environment.  The
          following is an example:

          #include <stdio.h>
          #include <extlib.h>

          main()
          {
              save_initial_video();
              setattrib(1, 1, 13, 40, 0x70);
              waitkey();
          }












                                                                    68





                                                            Appendix A

          Should Be:

          #include <stdio.h>
          #include <extlib.h>

          main()
          {
              printf(" ");
              save_initial_video();
              setattrib(1, 1, 13, 40, 0x70);
              waitkey();
          }

          By adding the printf(" "); statement to the program,  QuickC
          will release  control  of  the  video  display  over  to the
          program.    Thus,  proper  execution  will result.  Once the
          program has been fully  debugged and  will only  be run from
          outside  of   the  QuickC   environment,  the  printf("  ");
          statement can be safely removed from the program.

                           Appendix C - Registration

          Registration licenses  you to  use Extended Library 1.0, and
          all future 1.x updates.   Any  unregistered  use  other than
          trial use  to determine if Extended Library meets your needs
          is a violation of our license agreement and is forbidden.

          Single user registration is  available for  $20.00 per copy.
          Registered users  will be  sent the  most current version of
          Extended Library.  This includes all  eight versions  of the
          library and  the complete  source code  for the library.  If
          enough  people  register,  a   printed  manual   may  become
          available at  some future  date.   This manual, if produced,
          will also be provided to  registered  owners  at  no charge.
          Registration also entitles you to free telephone support and
          discounts on future versions of Extended Library.

          The Extended Library license authorizes the use of  one copy
          of Extended  Library on  one machine at a time.  If you have
          multiple computers, either standalone,  networked, or multi-
          user, you  need to register one copy of Extended library for
          each workstation on which it will be used.

Disk No: 1324
Program Title:  DBSCAN 1.00, EXTLIB
PC-SIG version: 1

DBSCAN is an easy-to-use browsing utility that allows you to view the
contents of dBase III files without having to enter the dBase program.
DBSCAN is a stand-alone program that you access from the DOS system
prompt.  It allows you to view the DBF files but not to change them.
However, you have considerably more control on the fields displayed and
where you want them displayed on the screen.  You can use it to scan
dBASE and compatible databases (with a .DBF extension).

EXTLIB is a library of over 50 C run-time video routines for the
advanced MS-DOS C programmer.

EXTLIB features windows, pop-up and pulldown menus, menu bars, scroll
bars, direct video memory I/O, and cursor control routines to be used
with Microsoft C or QuickC.  In addition to these video routines there
are formatted display input routines (dollars, for instance) and
advanced error handling functions.  The small, medium, compact, and
large memory models are all supported.  EXTLIB also comes with the
floating point emulator or 80x87 packages.

Usage:  dBASE III Plus Browse-Like Utility, C Programming.

Special Requirements:  Microsoft C or QuickC for EXTLIB.

How to Start:  Type GO (press enter).

Suggested Registration:  $40.00, plus $3.00 shipping for source code
that you can modify to suit your own needs; $20.00 for EXTLIB.
