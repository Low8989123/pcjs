## Information about "QMODEM SST 4 OF 5 (310,1022,1023,1484)"

    A fast and powerful telecommunications program for anyone using a
    modem. Expanded memory usage, windowing, Xmodem protocol and
    auto-redial are only some of the strengths of this package.
    
    The "quick-learn" mode option is perfect for novices and further
    training is available with the context-sensitive Help function.  Read
    and write ASCII files with the integrated text editor.  X,Y and IMODEM
    protocols are fully supported as are multi-tasking environments such as
    Topview, Desqview, Taskview and Windows.  The dialing directory can be
    sorted, printed, and searched.  Terminal emulations for VT100, ANSI, TTY
    and Televideo 925 ensure further flexibility.  LOG allows you to
    maintain usage records -- who called, time called, time online and a
    Date/Time stamp for each log entry.
