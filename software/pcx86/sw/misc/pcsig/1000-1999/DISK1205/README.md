## Information about "IDCSHELL/NARC AND ARCHIVE MENU"

    IDCSHELL and NARC takes you where no man has gone before -- the nether
    world of archived files. First, you are provided with an
    understanding of the world of packing, squeezing, crunching, and
    squashing. Second, you are given the tools to view, edit, delete,
    move, print, and make changes without unarchiving.
    
    The two programs operate in tandem -- IDCSHELL provides the
    environment and NARC, the key to archived files. NARC is a menu-driven
    de-archive facility that allows you to move easily from file to
    file. Operated from a mouse or keyboard, NARC is called by IDCSHELL, a
    DOS-like operating shell. IDCSHELL can also call your editor to allow
    you to alter files at will.
    
    The next time someone packs files to one-tenth of their original size,
    you can shrug your shoulders and treat the microfiles as if they were
    old-fashioned ASCII text. Documentation is extensive.
    
    ARCHIVE MENU is a utility for the archive program ARC.EXE (not on this
    disk) to make archiving files much easier for the novice.
    
    ARCHIVE MENU provides a menu where you may list the DOS directory, list
    the directory of an archive, and extract, add, delete, or update a file.
    All of this is done automatically, and you do not need to know the
    command line syntax in order to perform these operations, as you would
    if the program ARC.EXE were used by itself.
