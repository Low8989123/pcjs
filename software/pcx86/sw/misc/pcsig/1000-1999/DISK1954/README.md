## Information about "BOWLSTAT DISK 2 OF 2 (1953 ALSO)"

    Bowling statisticians relax, BOWLSTAT keeps track of up to 300 bowlers
    on as many as 99 teams.  Supports tenpin, candlepin, and 5-pin bowling
    games.  Generates nightly captain sheets, and yearly statistics for each
    bowler.
    
    Most "standard" league individual awards have been included along with
    an option for saving of average sheets to the disk drive for
    wordprocessor integration.  The program is completely "SMART MENU"
    driven so there is no need to learn a bunch of commands.
    
    Keeps track of the individual statistics -- name, pinfall, number of
    strings bolwed, average, high single, high triple, high no mark, 69's;
    and team statistics -- name, points won, points lost, total pinfall,
    team high pinfall, and percent of wins vs losses.

                              Menu Operation
                              ──────────────

        All menu  items available in  BowlStat are accessed  through "smart
 menus". To  choose an item, move  the red highlight bar  via the cursor or
 +/- keys of the numeric keypad to the desired choice and press the "Enter"
 key.

        If the menu  item is preceeded by a number,  then it may be selected
 by a pressing  the corresponding number. Note: no  "Enter" key is required
 to finish the selection.

        For example,  to select "5)  BOWLER - Delete"  from the Main  Menu,
 either  move the  highlight via  the cursor  or +/-  keys to  the line "5)
 BOWLER -  DELETE" and press  the "Enter" key  or press "5".  Either method
 selects the same menu item.


                                 Main Menu
                                 ─────────

        The  Main  Menu  has  two  modes  of  operation  - Setup or Normal.
 If a database exits for the name extered at the opening screen "League Name:"
 prompt then Normal mode is used. Otherwise, Setup mode is chosen.

 Setup
 ─────

 Setup mode resticts the Main Menu to one item:

 1) Setup

    This forces  a league database to  be created. To start  the definition
 process, press "Enter".


 Normal
 ──────

 Normal mode will be entered if either of these two conditions exits:

 1) A valid database name was entered at the opening screen "League Name:"
    prompt.

 2) A database has been successfully defined while in Setup mode.

 Either of these conditions will cause the following Main Menu items
 to be displayed:

    1) Defaults Editor - Allows various program settings to be changed.

    2) BOWLER - Scores - Allows input of bowler string scores.

    3) BOWLER - Edit   - Allows altering of the bowler database.

    4) BOWLER - Add    - Allows an addition to the bowler database.

    5) BOWLER - Delete - Allows the deletion of a bowler from the database.

    6) BOWLER - 69's   - Allows input of the number of "69" strings
                         scored by a bowler. (A Candlepin Award)

    7) TEAM - Points   - Allows input of the number of points won by a team
                         for a given series.

    8) TEAM - Edit     - Allows altering of the team database.

    9) Print Options   - Allows printing of various reports. (Average,
                         Captain, & Yearly Statistics Sheets)

    0) EXIT            - To quit BowlStat and return to DOS.

                               Function Keys
                               ─────────────

         BowlStat makes  use of function keys  F1-F4 and F9-10 for  the the
 following functions:

  F1  - Help system pop-up window.
  F2  - Valid Bowler Names pop-up window.
  F3  - Valid Team Names pop-up window.
  F4  - Database Statistics pop-up window.

  F9  - Printer pause.
  F10 - Printer continue.

        F1-F4 are available  at any time after reaching  then Main Menu and
 are disabled during  print operations while function keys  F9-F10 are only
 available only during a print operation.

 Note:  F1-F4 are  only available  for CGA  computer systems  and only  one
        function may be active at a given moment.

                                   ────

        This Main Menu option is used to exit BowlStat V1.4. and optionally
 save any changes to the Team and Bowler databases currently in memory.

        The Exit Menu option consists of five options which can be selected
 by moving the highlight via the +/-  or cursor arrow keys and pressing the
 "RETURN" or "ENTER" key.

                            ╚════════════════════╝

   The five options are:

   1) Main Menu        - Return to the Main Menu.

   2) Save & Resume    - Save the current Bowler/ Team databases and resume
                         BowlStat V1.4 from the beginning.

   3) Resume           - Resume  BowlStat V1.4  from the  beginning WITHOUT
                         first saving Bower/Team databases. This will cause
                         any changes  to the databases  currently in memory
                         to be lost.

   4) Save & Exit      - Save  the current  Bowler/Team databases and  exit
                         back to DOS.

   5) Exit             - Exit   back   to  DOS  WITHOUT  first  saving  the
                         Bowler/Team databases. This will cause any changes
                         to the databases currently in memory to be lost.

        Before BowlStat  V1.4 saves the current  Bowler/Team databases held
 in memory, the data that was originally on disk is saved in "backup" files
 for  recovery  purposes.  The  original  team  database, <filename>.LDA is
 renamed  to  <filename>.LOL  and  the  bowler  database, <filename>.BDA is
 renamed to  <filename>.BOL. Should recovery  of the old  data be required,
 the  DOS commands  DELETE and  RENAME can  be used  to change the filename
 extensions  back   to  .LDA  and   .BDA,  the  extensions   BowlStat  V1.4
 automatically assumes when loading database information.

 NOTES - Options 3 & 5 require  confirmation. Be aware the once back to DOS
         or  if BowlStat  V1.4 is  restarted, any  changes made  to team or
         bowler databases currently in memory are LOST and not recoverable.

        Move  the highlight  to the  "Team"  field  via the  +/- or  cursor
 up/down  arrow keys  and press  the  "RETURN"  or "ENTER"  key. key.  This
 selects team as the field in which  to search. Next, enter the name of the
 team that are to have bowlers deleted (for this example, "PINBUSTERS" will
 be  assumed). BowlStat  V1.4 will  search through  the bowler database and
 display any bowlers that "match" with the team name of "PINBUSTERS".

        Once a match has been  found the following confirmation prompt will
 appear: "MATCHED! Delete Data? (Y/N):". If  the data for this bowler is to
 be deleted,  press "Y" (yes)  and the "RETURN"  or "ENTER" keys.  The data
 will be deleted and BowlStat V1.4 will continue it's search for additional
 matches.

        When entering  search information, keep in  mind that BowlStat V1.4
 will match all characters that are entered. In the above example, an input
 of "PIN" would have matched bowlers on the teams "PINHEADS", "PINBOYS" and
 "PINNERS" - because  all start with "PIN". Therefore,  to limit the number
 of possible matches, enter as much information as possible.

 NOTE - Most prompts in BowlStat V1.4 are worded so that any menu item that
        alters a database (team or bowler) requires a "Y" (yes) response to
        a  confimation  prompt.  Therefore,  the  "RETURN"  or  "ENTER" key
        is considered as  a NO response and can  be used in place of  a "N"
        and "RETURN"  or "ENTER" keystroke  sequence. Also, to  utilize the
        numeric keypad, the  "+" and "-" keys can be  used answer "YES" (+)
        or "NO" (-) to confirmation prompts that require a "(Y/N)" reply.

        To exit  the search panel  back to the  last menu displayed,  press
        the  "ESC"   (escape)  key  anytime   prior  to  finishing   search
        information input with the "RETURN" or "ENTER" key.

        These  lane sheets  contain Bowler  Names, Averages,  Handicaps and
 places  to  record  strings  bowled   by  each  team  member.  Later  this
 information can be taken from the  Captain Sheet and entered into BowlStat
 V1.4.

 To generate a Captain Sheet, enter responses to the following:

 Team 1 Name:
 ────────────

         Enter a name  of a team currently in the  team database. This team
 will apprear at the top of Captain Sheet.


 Lane  Number:
 ────────────

         Enter the  lane number that  Team 1 is  to bowl on.  BowlStat V1.4
 assumes this to be the number of the  left lane on a pair of lanes. If the
 lane  number is  not known,  press  the  "RETURN" or  "ENTER" key  with no
 number.  BowlStat  V1.4  will  substitute  "______",  this allows the lane
 number to be manually entered at a  later date.

         If  Team  2  Name  is  entered,  BowlStat  V1.4 will automatically
 calulate the lane number based on the following:

        1) Team 1 lane number + 1
        2) Team 1 lane number "_____" - Team 2 lane number "_____"


 Team 2 Name:
 ────────────

        Enter the team  name of oposition to the  team entered above. Press
 "RETURN" or  "ENTER" with no  name if only  one team is  to appear on  the
 Captain Sheet.

 Round Averages? (Y/N):
 ──────────────────────

        Averages can  be actual or  rounded to the  nearest whole pin.  The
 default is  to have actual  averages printed, a  response of "N".  To have
 averages rounded to  the nearest pin, enter "Y" and  press the "RETURN" or
 "ENTER" key. For example:

                               175.25 = 175
                               175.65 = 176


 Sort by  Average? (Y/N):
 ────────────────────────

        The order of  the bowlers on the Captain Sheet  can be sorted based
 on the  bowlers averages or alphabetical.  The default is by  average from
 low to high. To print the bowler names alphabetically, press "N" and press
 the "RETURN" or "ENTER" key.

   The three output deices supported by BowlStat V1.4 are:

   1) PRINTER     - Send the output information to any printer connected to
                    LPT1:.

   2) DISK DRIVE - Send the output  information to the disk drive. Main use
                   is  to allow  loading of  a sheet  into a  wordprocessor
                   where it may be customized (BOLDING, UNDERLINING, ETC.).
                   Enter a filename to store  the sheet under (maximum of 8
                   characters). If  the name already  exists, BowlStat V1.4
                   will  ask if  this sheet  is to  be appended  to the one
                   already on  the disk drive  (see PRINT OPTIONS  for more
                   information on how to use sheet 'appending').

   3) SCREEN     - Send the  output information to the  screen. Main use is
                   for checking  sheets before outputing to  the printer or
                   disk  drive.  While  in  screen  output  mode, no status
                   messages  will be  displayed (SORTING,  PRINTING, ETC.).
                   status messages will be displayed in this mode.

 NOTES - Printing may be paused, in any output mode, by pressing the F9 and
         resumed by pressing the F10 function keys.

        The  Default Parameters  Menu is   used to  set various  options in
 BowlStat V1.4  (mostly print options).  The initial defaults  were created
 and  saved to  disk along  with the  Team and  Bowler databases which were
 defined  in SETUP.  Every time  a database  is loaded,  it's defaults  are
 loaded also.

        When  the "Print  Options" option   is chosen  from the  Main Menu,
 BowlStat V1.4  first sets the inital  values of the PRINT  OPTIONS MENU to
 the values currently defined in  Default Parameters Menu. Therefore, it is
 possible to "pre-define" the Print Options Menu.

        For example, if an average sheet  is not to contain the SIXTY NINES
 and  HIGH NO  MARK individual  awards, change  the Default Parameters Menu
 for each option to "0". BowlStat V1.4 will automatically copy the settings
 to  the  PRINT  OPTIONS  MENU.

        Left unchanged, BowlStat V1.4 will print a "standard" average sheet
 as determined  by the order  of the menu  selections in the  PRINT OPTIONS
 MENU. The number of names printed for each award will be determined by the
 values assigned to each option. This standard sheet consists of:

        o League Name
        o Averages
        o HIGH SERIES
        o HIGH SINGLES
        o HIGH NO MARKS
        o SIXTY NINES
        o Team Standings

 Print League Name (default "Y")
 ─────────────────

        A setting of "Y" will cause the current League Name to printed with
 "*"'s both above and below. Also, the current date (in MM-DD-YYYY format),
 will be printed in the upper right hand corner of the page. This option is
 internally set to "Y" for database dumps and cannot be changed.

 Round Averages (default "N")
 ──────────────

        Change this option to "Y" to  print averages rounded to the nearest
 10th of a pin. For example, 120.578 would be printed as 120.6, without the
 round option, it would be printed as 120.5


 Number of AVERAGES (default "*" = all)
 ──────────────────

        This option specifies  the maximun number of bowler  names to print
 when  printing by  AVERAGES. The  default  is  "*", all  bowlers. To  omit
 averages from the printout, enter a value of 0.

        BowlStat V1.4 divides the average sheet into two halves (a left and
 right). LADIES averages will be printed in the left half and MENS averages
 will appear  in the right  (ladies before gentlemen).  If the league  is a
 "mens  or  ladies  only"  league,  as  determined  by  BowlStat V1.4, then
 averages will be printed in the left column only.


   Enhanced AVERAGES (default "N")
   ─────────────────

        Normally,  the  average  award  consists  of  the  bowlers name and
 average. This may  be enhanced by changing this option  to "Y". Along with
 the bowlers name and average, the  current total pinfall and the number of
 strings bowled will also appear.

        To make room for the enhanced information, BowlStat V1.4 will print
 only the initial of the bowlers first name. With the option at default, as
 much  of the  first name  will be  printed, determined  by existing column
 limitations.

        NORMAL:     Stone, Kevin                172.8
        ENHANCED:   Stone, K.      3456   20    172.8


   Print SPARES (default "Y")
   ────────────

        To omit "Spare"  bowlers from ALL printouts, change  this option to
 "N". All sheets printed will contain only regular bowlers.


   Number of HIGH SERIES (default "3")
   ─────────────────────

        Enter the number of names to  print for the "HIGH SERIES" award. To
 omit this award from the prinout, enter a value of 0.


   Number of HIGH SINGLES (default "3")
   ──────────────────────

        Enter the number of names to print for the "HIGH SINGLE" individual
 award. To omit this award form the printout, enter a value of 0.


   Number of HI NO MARKS (default "3")
   ─────────────────────

        The HIGH NO MARK award is used in the Candlepin Bowling game. It is
 the  string score  of a  bowler who  has fail  to either  bowl a strike or
 spares and indicates how well a bowler has "pinned".

        Enter  the  number  of  names  to  print  for  the  "HIGH  NO MARK"
 individual award. To  omit this award form the printout,  enter a value of
 0.


   Number of SIXTY NINES (default "2")
   ─────────────────────

        The SIXTY NINES award is used  in the Candlepin Bolwing game. It is
 number of strings in which a bowler has scored a vaule of 69 in one of the
 frames bowled. For every one bowled, the bowler contributes a sum of money
 (.25) to  a pot and the  bowler with the highest  total at the end  of the
 season receives all of the money collected.

        Enter the number of names to print for the "69'S" individual award.
 To omit this award form the printout, enter a value of 0.


   Print TEAM STANDINGS (default "Y")
   ────────────────────

        This option turns on/off the  printing of team standings. Standings
 will appear  in the order  of points WON,  from highest to  lowest. If not
 required, change this option to "N".


   Enhanced TEAM STANDINGS (default = "N")
   ───────────────────────

        If Team Standings are to be printed, they can be enhanced with this
 option. Along with the normal output  of Team Name, Point Won, Points Lost
 and Total Points, BowlStat V1.4 will include Pinfall, High Pinfall and the
 percentage of wins vs losses.

 NORMAL:

                  TEAM NAME   PTS WON   PTS LOST   TOTAL
                  ---------   -------   --------   -----
                  Team 6          32         12      44


 ENHANCED:

  Team 6        1234        32         12      44     87.5          1343


   Eject PAGE When Done (deafult = "Y")
   ────────────────────

        This option is valid only if the avearage sheet is to be printed on
 a printer,  as selected  by the  OUTPUT MENU.  By changing  it to "N", the
 printer will NOT go  to the top of the next page  when the printing of the
 average sheet has  been completed. The option is  automatically set to "N"
 when the output device is either the SCREEN or DISK DRIVE.

        This  option also  allows average  sheets to  be customized  to any
 requirements.  By changing  the default  to "N",  an average  sheet may be
 "built" in any  order by overlaying average sheets  created with different
 print options. For example, to print Team Standings first then followed by
 bowler averages and individual awards:

        o Select sheet BY AVERAGE and output to PRINTER.

          1) Enter "Y" or "N" to Print League Name option.
          2) Enter 0 to the Number of AVERAGES option. (No Averages)
          3) Enter 0 to the Number of HIGH SERIES, Number of HIGH SINGLES,
             Number of HIGH NO MARKS and Number of SIXTY NINES.
          4) Enter "Y" to the Print TEAM STANDINGS option.
          5) Enter "N" to the Eject PAGE When Done option.

          Print the  average sheet by  exiting the Print  Options Menu with
 the ESC (escape) key.

         Since the  Eject PAGE When  Done option prevents  the printer from
 performing a form feed to the next sheet, anything now printed will appear
 after the Team Standings. To conclude this example:

          1) Enter "N" for the PRINT LEAGUE NAME option.
          2) Enter the required value to the Number of AVERAGES,
             Number of HIGH SERIES, Number of HIGH SINGLES,
             Number of HIGH NO MARKS and Number of SIXTY NINES options.
          3) Enter "N" to the Print TEAM STANDINGS option.

          Print the remainder  of the average sheet. The  result will be an
 average sheet in the following order:

     1) League Name.
     2) Team Standings.
     3) Averages.
     4) Individual Awards.

        By  varying the  "Y"/"N" and  number entries  to the  various print
 options,  BowlStat V1.4  can build  an average  sheet to any requirements.
 Once the desired  format has been obtained, the  individual options can be
 saved to disk as a set and loaded  back in to speed up the printing of the
 sheet. In the above example, the  two separate sets of print options could
 be saved  to disk under the  filenames of PART1 and  PART2. Then, to print
 the average sheet, the options can be loaded back into BowlStat V1.4.

        Once  the ESC  (escape) key  has  been  pressed to  exit the  Print
 Options Menu,  BowlStat V1.4 will  ask if the  print options currently  in
 effect should  be saved to disk.  If they are, enter  "Y" to the following
 confimation prompt: "Save Print Format? (Y/N):". Enter a filename (maximum
 length  of  8  characters)  to  store  the  print  options  under.

 NOTES -  Average sheet building is  also possible to the  DISK DRIVE. When
          prompted for  a name to save  the average sheet under,  enter the
          same name  as a previously  printed average sheet.  BowlStat V1.4
          will ask the following confirmation:  "SHEET EXISTS! OK to APPEND
          to it? (Y/N):". Enter "Y" and  press the "RETURN" or "ENTER" key.
          The  sheet, as  defined by   the current  print options,  will be
          appended to the file currently on the disk drive.

        To  start  using  BowlStat  V1.4,  you  must  first  define certain
 database information for the program. This information includes:

   o League Name.
   o Number of teams.
   o Number of bowlers per team.
   o Teams names/handicaps.
   o Bowler information.

        Fill  in  the  above  panel  to  define  the  league name and size.
 Although there  is a maximum  capacity of  891  bowlers (99 teams  X 9 per
 team),  only  the  actual  number  need  be  defined.  This  allows faster
 operations as  less information needs  to be processed.  Remember to leave
 enough  room for  league expansion  as  once  defined the  size cannot  be
 altered.

        The name of  the league may be a maximum  of 50 characters (2 lines
 by  25 characters  each). BowlStat  V1.4 treats  each line  in the "League
 Name" field as separate lines and  therefore, it is necessary to press the
 "RETURN" or "ENTER" key at the end  of the first line. The cursor will NOT
 automatically drop  down to the second  line after the 25th  character has
 been typed.

        Line two of the league name should  only be used if line one is not
 sufficient to hold  the entire length of the league  name. Should line one
 is not  completely filled, any information  on line two will  be joined to
 that of line one.

         For example:

         LINE 1 - "HALIFAX "     (note the space)
         LINE 2 - "GREEN DORY"

         This would yield a league name of "HALIFAX GREEN DORY"

        Once the  league name and  size has been  defined, the "LEAGUE/TEAM

 number of teams  defined, BowlStat V1.4 will ask for  a Team Name and Team
 Handicap. Handicaps may  be in the range of -99  to +99 pinsand team names
 are limited to a maximum size of 14 characters.

        BowlStat V1.4  initalizes the team  database before requesting  any
 information. Therefore,  if only a few  teams are required to  be defined,
 enter  the  known  information.  Once  entered,  press  the "ESC' key. The

        Once completed,  the "LEAGUE/TEAM INFORMATION"  will be replced  by
 the "BOWLER INFORMATION" panel. Depending on the number of bowlers defined,
 BowlStat V1.4  will ask for bowler  information consisting of the  first 5
 fields of the panel.

        Last/First  and Team  names are  limited to  a maximum  size of  14
 characters. Sex  requies the gender of  the bowler, either "M"  or "F" and
 "Spare" requires either a "Y" or "N".

        A counter in the message area at the bottom of the screen will keep
 track of the remaining bowlers still requiring definition.

 BowlStat  V1.4  initalizes  the  bowler  database  before  requesting  any
 information. Therefore, 'blank bowlers' can be added to the database which
 can be filled out  at a later date (for new additions  to your league). To
 create blank bowlers, follow the following steps:

     1) Add the number of blank entries (in team multiples) to the total
        number of teams.

     2) Enter all  known bowler  information, leaving  the blanks till the
        end.

     3) Press the "ESC" (escape) key. BowlStat V1.4 will leave SETUP and
        assign the remaining entries as blank.


 The "*" Character
 ─────────────────

        The "*" character has special meaning  in BowlStat V1.4 and is used
 to indicate that the field should be ignored. This allows flexability when
 handling transient or Spare bowlers. Uses for the "*" character are:

     1) Ignore pinfall.

        Pinfall for any bowler with a team  name of "*" will NOT be counted
        toward any  specific TEAMS TOTAL PINFALL,  since BowlStat V1.4 does
        not recognize "*" as a valid team name.

      2) Surpress printing.

        Any bowler with a "Team" name of "*" will not appear on any average
        sheet that has been printed "by TEAM" or any Captain Sheet.

        Any bowler with a "Sex" of "*" will not appear on any average sheet
        printed "by AVERAGE" or "by NAME (ALPHABETICALLY).

 Warning:  BowlStat V1.4  uses "*"  in the  "Last Name"  field to indicate a
           "Blank Record". Should the Last Name field be changed to "*", it
           is possible that the information currently in the record will be
           erased if a new bowler is added via the Main Menu option "BOWLER
           - Add".

                            ───────────────────

        To begin,  select the bowler to  enter string scores for  by moving
 the cursor with the +/- or cursor  arrow keys to the desired bowler's name
 and press the  "RETURN" or "ENTER" key. Next, enter  the string scores for
 the selected bowler in the message window  at the bottom of the screen. To
 indicate that the string should be considered for the "High No Mark" award
 (for Candle/5 Pin games), enter "HNM"  or "." immediately after the string
 score. For example, "98HNM" or "98.".

        As  the  string  scores  are  being  entered,  BowlStat  V1.4  will
 automatically  calculate  the  bowlers  total  series  and the teams total
 pinfall (GROSS and NET) for each individual string. Also, team points will
 be awarded based on the NET total.

        If a bowler is absent or has bowled an incomplete series, press the
 "RETURN" or  "ENTER" key when prompted  for a string score.  BowlStat V1.4
 will automatically enter the bowler's  current average along with "avg" to
 indicate that this is an average and not an actual string score. The score
 will not  be counted towards the  bowlers average but will  be used in the
 calulation of pinfall and the awarding of team points.

        Once all  the scores for  both teams have  been entered, press  the
 "ESC"  (escape) key.  BowlStat V1.4  will display  the confimation  prompt
 "(A)bort or (P)rocess").  If a mistake has been made  or the sheet has not
 been completely filled out, press the  "A" and "RETURN" or "ENTER" keys to
 return to the input mode. Otherwise, press "P" and the "RETURN" or "ENTER"
 keys  to  process  the  entered  string  scores.  As  the scores are being
 proceesed, BowlStat V1.4 will display  the associated bowler's name in the
 message area at the bottom of the screen.

                          ╚════════════════════╝

 1) by Search  Panel - Scores are entered for  INDIVIDUAL bowlers that have
                       been matched with the  search panel. Any team totals
                       (points  won/lost,  pinfall   and  awards)  must  be
                       handled seperately using Main Menu selection "TEAM -
                       Points".  This  selection   in  handy  for  updating
                       "Spare" bowlers whose totals  are not to be included
                       with a teams totals.

 2) by Captain Sheet - Bowler scores  for an entire team are entered at the
                       same  time.  BowlStat  will  automatically calculate
                       team  points won/lost,  pinfall totals  and any team
                       awards. This is the prefered  method of entry as the
                       screen will  act as a  check against the  scores and
                       totals that have been recorded at the bowling lanes.

                       After  this menu  item has  been selected,  BowlStat
                       will  ask for  two team  names. Once  the names have
                       been  entered,  BowlStat  will  display  the  bowler
                       line-up the appropriate teams.

                       See  the  help  file  for  Captain  Sheet  Input for
                       further  information  on  how  scores  are  actually

                            ──────────────────

        This Main Menu option allows individual string scores to be entered
 for bowlers selected via the "Bowler Search Panel". Once the string scores
 have  been entered,  BowlStat V1.4  will automatically  update the bowlers
 statistics,  check for  new individual  awards (High  Triple, High Single,
 High No Mark and 69's) and update the "Total Pinfall" field of the bowlers
 team.

        To start,  enter the appropriate information  into the search panel
 to match the desired bowler(s). After  finding a match, BowlStat V1.4 will
 display  the bowlers  statistics and  display the  prompt "MATCHED!  Enter
 Scores?  (Y/N):" at  the bottom  of the  screen. If  the bowler  is to  be
 updated, press  "Y" and the  "RETURN" or "ENTER"  key. BowlStat V1.4  will
 then  add three  fields to  the  "BOWLER  INFORMATION" panel  to hold  the
 individual string scores.

        Enter the  individual string scores, starting  in field "String 1".
 To indicate  that the string should  be considered for the  "High No Mark"
 award (for Candle/5  Pin games), enter "HNM" or  "." immediately after the
 string score  ( 98HNM or  98.). If a  certain string has  not been bowled,
 press the "RETURN" or "ENTER' key on the appropriate String field.

        Once the  last score has  been entered, BowlStat  V1.4 will display
 the sum of  the scores entered and ask for  confirmation that the total is
 correct.  If  it  is,  press  the  "Y"  and  the "RETURN" or "ENTER" keys.
 BowlStat  V1.4  will  process  the  scores  and  continue  it's search for
 additional matches.  If an error was  made entering the scores,  press the
 "N" and "RETURN"  or "ENTER" keys. BowlStat V1.4  will erase the currently
 displayed string  scores and start  the process over  from the "String  1"
 field.

 Example
 ───────

                              ║String 1  ║ 135           ║
                              ║String 2  ║ 95HNM         ║
                              ║String 3  ║               ║ No Score!
                              ╚══════════╩═══════════════╝

        In this example, BowlStat V1.4 will add 194 to John's "Pinfall" and
 increase  the total  of "#  STRINGS" by  two. If  95 is  greater than  his
 previous "Hi No  Mark", then the old value will  be replaced. Also, should
 135  be  greater  than  the  previous  "High  Single",  then it to will be
 replaced.  Same  holds  true  for  the  total  of  the string scores (High
 Triple). Also, the Pinbusters "Total Pinfall" will be increased by 194.

        To speed up entry from the  numeric keypad (on those keyboards that
 have a numeric keypad), the "+" and "-" keys can be used to answer Yes and
 No  to those  questions requiring  a "Y"  or "N"  reply. This replaces the
 normal  funtion of  the +/-  keys  (cursor  movement) while  in "BOWLER  -
 Scores".

 NOTES: If a bowler does not bowl  all three strings, press the "RETURN" or
        "ENTER" key when  prompted for a string score -  NOT "0". Zero is a
        valid  score  and  will  be  counted  towards the players Average/#
        Strings.

        To enter the Captain Sheet input mode, select the Team field of the
        search  panel but  do not  enter  a  name -  press the  "RETURN" or
        "ENTER" key. BowlStat  V1.4 will prompt for the  names of the teams
        that  appear on  the Captain  Sheet. Once  entered, screen  for the
        Captain Sheet input mode will appear.

 name and place the cursor at the  first position of the League Name field.
 Enter up to 50 characters for a new name (2 lines X 25 characters each).

        Each  line is  treated separately.  Therefore, it  is necessary  to
 press the "RETURN" or "ENTER" key at the end of the first line. The cursor

 edited (partial matches are OK).

         When matched,  the team's statistics will  be displayed along with

 fields for this team, press the "Y" and "RETURN" or "ENTER" keys. BowlStat
 V1.4 will then highlight the field "Team Name". Select a field for editing
 by moving the  highlight, via the +/- or cursor  arrow keys, and press the
 "RETURN" or  "ENTER" key. Once  a field has  been selected, BowlStat  V1.4
 will erase the current contents of the field and await for new information
 to be entered.

       After the  new information has  been entered, the  highlight will be

 BowlStat V1.4 will  request another team name to  be edited. Enter another
 team name or press the "ESC" (escape) key to return to the Main Menu.

        The original  field will NOT  be changed until  new information has
 been  entered and  the "RETURN"  or  "ENTER"  key pressed.  To retain  the
 original infomation, press  the "ESC" (escape) key at  any time before the
 "RETURN"  or "ENTER"  key. BowlStat   V1.4 will  exit, without  saving any
 changes to the team database, and will continue it's search for additional
 matches.

 NOTES - If  "Team Name" information is altered,  BowlStat V1.4 will search
         through the bowler  database and change any bowler  found with the
         old name to  the new name. This way, individual  edits of the team
         members are not necessary.

         The  "League Name"  MUST contain   a valid  name. If  selected for
         editing  and  no  name  is  entered,  BowlStat  will use "BowlStat
         Version" and and the current version number as the League Name.

        The panel  above shows the  statistics for the  team Pinbusters. To
 add points to  this teams total, enter the number  of points WON and press
 the "RETURN"  or "ENTER" key.  BowlStat V1.4 will  automatically calculate
 the number of points  LOST, based on a maximum of 8  points per series and
 update  the  teams  POINTS  LOST  statistic.  For  this  example,  if  the
 Pinbusters  had won  3 points,   BowlStat V1.4  would automatically  add 3
 points to the current "Total Points Won" total and 5 points to the current
 "Total Points Lost" total.

         Once the points have been entered,  Bowlstat V1.4 will move to the
 "Enter High Pinfall" field. Enter the  team's total pinfall for the series
 bowled. If the value enterd is greater than the current total, the current
 total will be  replaced. BowlStat V1.4 will then display  the next team to

        If no  values are to be  entered for either or  both of the fields,
 press the "RETURN"  or "ENTER" key without a  numeric value. BowlStat V1.4

 NOTES - The maximum of 8 points  is not user alterable. Please contact the

                               BOWLER - 69'S
                               ─────────────

        This  Main  Menu  option  allows  updating  of  the  "Sixty  Nines"
 individual  bowler award.  Although this  award may  not be  known in some
 types of bowling games, it is used in most every Candlepin league.

        The award  represents the number of  strings that a bowler  has had
 the  score of  "69" in  one  of  the frames  bowled. Normally,  the bowler
 contributes a sum  of money into a "pot" which  is given to the individual
 with the maximum number at the end of the season.

         Once selected,  BowlStat V1.4 will  display a blank  search panel.
 Fill the panel out to yeild the required bowlers. For example,

                     ╚═══════════════════════════════╝

         If the  matched bowler has 69's  to be entered, press  the "Y" and
 "RETURN" or  "ENTER" keys. BowlStat V1.4  will then ask for  the number of
 69's to be added to the bowler's current value in the database.

                          ╔════════════════════╗
                          ║ ENTER # OF 69'S: 3 ║
                          ╚════════════════════╝


         Enter a number from 0 to 9. and press the "RETURN" or "ENTER" key.
 BowlStat V1.4 will  add this to the current  total, 3, for a new  total of
 10. Once completed, BowlStat V1.4 will continue it's search for additional
 matches.

        Unlike  other bowler  database operations,  the number  of 69's  is
 entered at  the bottom of the  screen and not in  the "BOWLER INFORMATION"
 panel. This is because the number entered is added to the current contents
 rather than replacing it, as in other database operations.

 NOTE - The  value of 69's to be  entered is ADDED to the  current total of
        the matched bowler. It does NOT REPLACE it.!

        The maximum number of 69's to be added at one time is 9.
