## Information about "MORSOFT CALCULATOR"

    If you own a computer but still find yourself looking for a pocket
    calculator, look no further. Here's a full-function calculator for
    you.
    
    It may be used as an "adding machine" with the ability to sum up to
    1,000 values. Each value is stored in the computer memory "tape"
    which may be scrolled forward or back, changed, and printed. Both sub-
    and overall totals are retained and displayed on the screen, and the
    "tape" may contain multiple totals.
    
    Arithmetic and trigonometric functions are provided and calculation
    results may be added to, or subtracted from, the memory "tape."
    Values may be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided to or from
    memory as they are entered. Enter and retain values in either decimal
    or hexadecimal number base. (All functions are available in either.)
    Try that on your pocket calculator!

         INTRODUCTION
         ____________
 
         The MORSOFT CALCULATOR is a full function calculator designed
         to run on IBM PC and compatible computers.  It may be used as
         an "adding machine" providing the ability to sum up  to 1,000
         values, each stored in the computer's memory "tape" which may
         be scrolled forward or back, changed, and printed.  Also both
         sub  and  overall  totals  are  retained and displayed on the
         computer screen and the "tape" may contain multiple totals.
 
         Also calculations such  as multiply, divide and trigonometric
         functions  are  provided  and  the  results  may  be added or
         subtracted  to  the  memory  tape.    In  addition a "memory"
         constant  feature  is  built  in  and  values  may  be added,
         subtracted,  multiplied or divided to or from the constant as
         they are entered.
 
         And  values may be entered and retained in either decimal  or
         Hexadecimal.    In  either mode all functions (add, subtract,
         multiply, etc.) are available.
 
         A full list of the functions is as follows:
 
            - Add                              - Trigonometric Sine,
            - Subtract                           Cosine, Tangent and
            - Multiply                           Arctangent
            - Percent                          - Memory constant add,
            - Divide                               subtract, multiply,
            - Square Root                          divide by/into
            - Exponentiation                   - Sub-total
            - Decimal or Hexadecimal           - Overall total
              operations                       - 1,000 entry tape
            - Set decimal precision                retention, view,
            - Maximum integer positions 13,        change, and print
                maximum decimal postions 12,   - Current entry clear
                maximum combined 12            - Machine clear
 
         The minimum computer requirements to the run the program are:
 
            - IBM PC or compatible
            - 256k memory
            - DOS 2.0 or later
            - Monochrome or color monitor.  If a color monitor is used
              screen colors may be set as desired.
            - 1 floppy disk drive or a hard disk

         INSTALLATION AND STARTING
         _________________________
 
 
         HARD DISK SYSTEMS
 
             The  MORSOFT  CALCULATOR  is  comprised  of  the  program
             "MORCALC.EXE"  and  on  machines with a color monitor the
             parameter  file  "MORCALC.CLR".    To install the program
             simply  copy  the  program file to the directory of  your
             choice.   The color parameter file is created dynamically
             if the screen colors are changed.
 
             The  following  is an example of copying and running  the
             program from hard disk C: under directory MYDIR.
 
             -  Insert the diskette containing the program in drive A:
             -  At the DOS prompt type the following and press enter:
 
                  COPY A:\MORCALC.EXE C:\MYDIR
 
             -  To start the program  after the copy is complete enter
                the following  at the DOS  prompt pressing enter after
                each line:
 
                    C:
                    CD \MYDIR
                    MORCALC
 
 
         DISKETTE SYSTEMS
 
             There  are  no install procedures for machines without  a
             hard disk.  To start the program perform the following:
 
             - Insert the diskette containing the program in drive A:
               (insure it DOES NOT have a write protect tab on it)
 
             - At the DOS prompt type pressing enter after each line:
 
                    A:
                    CD \
                    MORCALC
 
             - If  using  a  color  monitor  and the screen colors are
               changed (see the  section  CHANGING COLORS later in the
               manual)  insure  that the program diskette is still  in
               drive A: .  This will  allow  the  color parameter file
               "MORCALC.CLR"  to be created and have it available  the
               next time the program is run.

         OPERATIONS
         __________
 
         NOTE:  IF YOU HAVE A COLOR DISPLAY BOARD IN YOUR MACHINE  AND
                ARE  USING  A  MONOCHROME  MONITOR  THE SCREEN WILL BE
                GARBLED AND UNREADABLE  WHEN  THE  PROGRAM STARTS.  IN
                THIS  CASE PRESS AND HOLD THE "Alt" KEY THEN PRESS AND
                RELEASE THE "F10" KEY THEN RELEASE THE "Alt" KEY. THIS
                WILL  PLACE  THE  PROGRAM  IN MONOCHROME MODE AND  THE
                COLOR  PARAMETER FILE "MORCALC.CLR" WILL BE CREATED SO
                THE  NEXT  TIME  THE  PROGRAM  STARTS  IT  WILL  AUTO-
                MATICALLY SWITCH TO MONOCHROME. IF RUNNING THE PROGRAM

            The  "TAPE WINDOW" displays the values in the memory  tape
            and  may  be  scrolled   using  the  up  and  down  cursor
            movement arrow keys.  The tape may be changed by  pressing
            the "F9" key, moving  the  value  to  be  modified under a
            highlighter bar which will be displayed and entering a new
            number.    Complete  details on this process are presented
            in the TAPE SCROLLING AND CHANGING section later  in  this
            manual.
 
            The  "CURRENT ENTRY WINDOW" shows the current number being
            entered.
 
            The  "SUB-TOTAL WINDOW"  shows  the   current   sub-total.
            Multiple sub-totals may be taken within a tape by pressing
            the "S" key.  The  amount  will  be  displayed in the tape
            window preceeded  by  the  caption "SUB" and the sub-total

                                        4 

            window will be reset to 0.
 
            The  "OVERALL TOTAL WINDOW" shows the current grand total.
            A grand total may be taken by pressing the "T" key.  First
            a  sub-total  will be taken then the overall total.    The
            amount  will  be  displayed in the tape window preceded by
            the caption  "TOT"  and the  total window will reset to 0.
            The tape window will clear when the next value is entered.
 
            Complete details on  the  sub  and overall total processes
            are  covered  in the TOTAL FUNCTIONS section later in this
            manual.
 
            The "MEMORY CONSTANT WINDOW" displays the value  stored in
            the  memory  constant.   This value may be used for adding
            subtracting,  multiplying, or dividng into or by the value
            entered  into the current entry window.  Complete  details
            on  this  process  are  covered  in  the  MEMORY  CONSTANT
            FUNCTIONS section later in this manual.
 
            The  "keys"  shown on the screen simulate those that would
            appear on a normal calculator machine and are reminders of
            the functions available.  For those keys containing  alpha
            characters, such as  "cLe"  for  clear entry and "sQr" for
            square root, press the keyboard key, upper or lower  case,
            of  the  capitalized  letter  on  the screen key.  Eg. for
            clear the current  entry press "L", square root press "Q",
            etc.  For the memory constant functions use the  "F1" thru
            "F7" keys.  To clear  the  machine  (program)  of all tape
            entries press the "F8" key.  To set the maximum  number of
            decimal  positions for the results of arithmetic functions
            such  as  multiply and divide press the "F10" key.  Detail
            information  on  the use of each key is presented  in  the
            appropriate sections later in this manual.
 
            To end  the program and return to DOS press the "Esc" key.
            If  using  a  color  monitor  and  you wish to change  the
            screen  colors  press  and  hold  the "Alt" key, press and
            release the "C" key then release the "Alt" key.
 
            The  following  is  a  detailed description of each of the
            program  functions  and  the  key  entry  sequences (which
            keyboard keys to press and in which order).  Note that the
            key sequence examples given may be followed by a string of
            periods.    This indicates a continuation or repetition of
            the sequence.

         ENTERING NUMBERS IN DECIMAL
 
            To  enter a value press the appropriate number keys on the
            keyboard  (0 thru 9)  or the period to indicate a decimal.
            As the characters  are  keyed  they  will  appear  in  the
            current  entry  window moving right to left.  The  maximum
            number of whole (non-decimal)  numbers that may be entered
            is 12, maximum number of decimal numbers 12, or the sum of
            both  whole and decimal is 12.  The maximum for the totals
            is  13  whole  (integer)  numbers,  or  3 integers and  12
            decimal positions.  If a value is entered that would cause
            the  totals  to  exceed  this  an  error  message  will be
            displayed and the entry will not be accepted.
 
            Example key sequences:  123
                                    12345.67890
                                    112233445566
                                    .123456789012
 
            To  clear the value in the current entry window press  the
            "L" key, upper or lower case.
 
            To  enter a negative  number  for  an  operation  such  as
            multiply or divide first press the "-" (hyphen) key, enter
            the  number then press  the operation  key  ( *, /, etc.).
            Negative  numbers  and  those  entered through subtraction
            will  show  on  the tape with the "-" sign to the right of
            the last digit.
 
            Note that  if the machine is in hexadecimal mode press the
            "M" key to switch to decimal entry.
 
            As  numbers  are  added and subtracted they will appear on
            the tape and the display will continually adjust  so  that
            the  number  of decimal positions shown will always be the
            maximum of any value  entered.    This provides for easier
            viewing  of the  tape  through constant decimal alignment.
            For operations other  than  add  and  subtract the decimal
            alignment  will  not  change  unless  the  result  of  the
            operation is added or subtracted to the tape.
 
 
         ENTERING NUMBERS IN HEXADECIMAL
 
            To  perform operations in hexadecimal mode press  the  "H"
            key.    The  caption  "HEX" will appear to the left in the
            current entry window  and  the  "keys"  "A"  thru "F" will
            appear  at  the  bottom  of  the  screen  indicating these
            values may be entered in addition to 0 thru 9. The maximum
            number  of  postions  that  may  be entered in the current
            entry window is 10.
 
            Example key sequences:  1A
                                    FF1C
                                    F9F2F3F5F7F
 

                                        6 

            All of the arithmetic functions (add, subtract,  multiply,
            divide,  etc.)  are available and the entries in the tape,
            total,  and  memory constant windows will appear in hex as
            will  the  tape entries if printed.  Note however  decimal
            positions may not be entered.
 
            If  values have already been entered in decimal and are in
            the tape, total and memory constant windows they  will  be
            redisplayed in hex.   Note that any decimal positions will
            be truncated (removed) from the display but will  still be
            retained  internally.    To  convert  back to decimal mode
            press the "M" key  and  all  values will be redisplayed in
            decimal  including  decimal  positions if any.  To  return
            to hex mode press the "H" key.
 
 
         MACHINE CLEAR
 
            To  clear  the  "machine", reset the tape and zero out all
            values  and  totals  press  the "F8" key.  A yes/no  (Y/N)
            prompt  will be displayed to insure the clear operation is
            to be performed.  If yes press the "Y" key (upper or lower
            case) otherwise press "N".
 
            Key sequence:  F8  <then>  Y  <if yes or>  N  <if no>
 
 
         ADDITION
 
            To  add  values  enter  the numbers required and press the
            " + " (plus) key.
 
            Keying sequence:  123 + 456 + 789 + .......
 
            As  the numbers are keyed they will appear in the  current
            entry window and when  the  "+"  key  is  pressed the tape
            window  will  scroll  up  one  line and the new entry will
            appear  as  the  last  value  in  the  window.  The number
            entered will be added to the amounts displayed in both the
            sub-total and total windows.
 
 
         SUBTRACTION
 
            To  subtract  values enter the numbers required and  press
            the " - " (minus or hyphen) key.
 
            Keying sequence:  123 - 456 - 789 - ........
 
            As the numbers are  keyed  they will appear in the current
            entry  window  and  when  the "-" key is pressed the  tape
            window  will  scroll  up  one  line and the new entry will
            appear as the last value in the window with a "-"  to  the
            right  of  the  last  digit.    The numer entered will  be
            subtracted from the amounts displayed in the sub-total and
            total windows.

                                        7 

 
 
         DECIMAL PRECISION
 
            The  default  and  automatic  maximum  number  of  decimal
            positions  that would  result  from  a  multiplication  or
            division  function  is 6, rounded up.  This however may be
            changed from zero to 12 by pressing the "F10" key.
 
            A  window  will  open  requesting  the number of positions
            desired.   Enter  the new  value and  press the enter key.
            In  all  cases  the  result  of  the computations  will be
            rounded  up  to the last decimal position.  Note that this
            function  does  not  affect  the number of positions  that
            may  be  entered in the current entry window or the number
            of  positions  retained  for  the addition and subtraction
            entries on the tape.  Also this  function is not available
            if the machine is in HEX mode.
 
 
         MULTIPLICATION
 
            To  multiply  two  values enter the first, press the " * "
            (asterisk)  key,  enter  the  second, then press the " = "
            (equal) key.
 
            Keying sequence:  13 * 3 =
 
            When  the  first  value is entered and the "*" key pressed
            the tape window will scroll up one line and the entry will
            appear as the last value with the caption "MU" to  the far
            left of the line. When the second value is entered and the
            "=" key is pressed  the  tape  window  will  scroll up two
            lines.   The second value will appear on the next  to  the
            last  line with the caption "MU*" to the far left  of  the
            line  and the result of the operation will appear  on  the
            last line of the window  with  the  caption  "MU="  to the
            left.    Also the result will appear in the current  entry
            window  and  may  be  used  for  further  functions  (add,
            subtract,  etc.).    The total windows are not affected by
            the multiply operation.
 
 
         PERCENT
 
            To  calculate  the  percentage of a value first enter  the
            percent amount (for 5% enter 5, for .34% enter .34), press
            the  "  %  " (percent) key, enter the percentage of value,
            then press the " = " key.
 
            Keying  sequence:    5  %  100  =    (for  5%  of 100)
                              12.3  %  200  =    (for  12.3%  of  200)
 
            When the percent value is entered  and the "%" key pressed
            the tape window will scroll up one line and the entry will
            appear  as the last  value with the caption "%" to the far

                                        8 

            left of the line. When the second value is entered and the
            "="  key  is  pressed  the tape window will scroll up  two
            lines.    The  second value will appear on the next to the
            last  line  with  the caption "%OF" to the far left of the
            line  and the result of the operation will appear  on  the
            last  line  of  the  window  with the caption "% =" to the
            left.    Also the result will appear in the current  entry
            window  and  may  be  used  for  further  functions  (add,
            subtract,  etc.).   The total windows are not affected  by
            this  operation.
 
 
         DIVISION
 
            To  divide  two values enter the first, press the  "  /  "
            (slash)  key,  enter  the  second,  then  press  the " = "
            (equal) key.
 
            Keying sequence:  12 / 3 =
 
            When the first value  is  entered  and the "/" key pressed
            the tape window will scroll up one line and the entry will
            appear  as the last value with the caption "DI" to the far
            left of the line. When the second value is entered and the
            "="  key  is  pressed  the tape window will scroll up  two
            lines.    The  second value will appear on the next to the
            last  line  with  the caption "DI/" to the far left of the
            line  and the result of the operation will appear  on  the
            last  line  of  the  window  with the caption "DI=" to the
            left.    Also the result will appear in the current  entry
            window  and  may  be  used  for  further  functions  (add,
            subtract,  etc.).   The total windows are not affected  by
            this operation.
 
 
         SQUARE ROOT
 
            To  find  the  square root of a number enter the value and
            press the " Q " key.
 
            Key sequence:  4  Q
 
            The  tape  window  will scroll up two lines and the  value
            entered will appear  on the next to the last line with the
            caption  "SQ"  to  the  far left and the square root  will
            appear  on  the  last  line  with the caption "SQ=" to the
            left.    The  square  root will also appear in the current
            entry  window  and  may be used for subsequent operations.
            The total windows are not affected by this function.
 
 
         EXPONENTIATION

            When  the  value is entered the tape window will scroll up
            two  lines  and the tangent will appear on the next to the
            last  line    with  the  caption  "AR"  to  the left.  The
            arctangent  value  will  appear  on the last line with the
            caption  "AR="  to the left and also in the current  entry
            window for subsequent operations.
 
 
         MEMORY CONSTANT FUNCTIONS
 
            The  following  are  the  various  operations  that may be
            performed using the memory constant function.
 
 
            MEMORY STORE
 
               To  store  a constant in memory that  may  be used  for
               subsequent  functions  enter  the  value then press the
               "F1" key.   The  number  will  appear  in  the "MEMORY"
               window.  The tape will not be affected.
 
               Key sequence:  123  F1
 
 
            MEMORY ADD
 
               To add a value  to  the memory constant and   have  the
               result  added  to  the  tape enter the value and  press
               "F2".   The two values (what was entered and the memory
               constant) will be summed and the result will appear in
               tape  window  and  added  to  the  sub-total  and total
               windows.
 
               Key sequence:  123  F2
 
 
            MEMORY SUBTRACT
 
               To subtract a value  from  the  memory constant and add
               the  result to the tape enter the value and press "F3".
               To subtract the memory constant from a value  enter the
               number and press "F4".  In either case the result  will
               appear in the tape  window and will be added to the sub
               and overall totals.
 

                                        11 

               Key sequence subtract from memory:   123  F3
 
               Key sequence subtract memory:  123  F4
 
 
            MEMORY MULTIPLY
 
               To multiply a value  by  the  memory constant enter the
               value  and press "F5".  The operation will perform  the
               same  as  the  multiply  function with what was entered
               appearing  first  on  the  tape  followed by the memory
               value  then  the result.  The result will appear in the
               entry  window  for  subsequent operations and will  not
               affect the sub and overall totals.
 
               Key sequence:  123  F5
 
 
            MEMORY DIVIDE
 
               To  divide  a value into the memory constant enter  the
               number  and press "F6".  The operation will perform the
               same as the divide  function  with  the memory constant
               first  on  the  tape followed by the value entered then
               the result.  The result will appear in the entry window
               and  may be used for subsequent operations and will not
               affect the sub and overall totals.
 
               Key sequence:  123  F6
 
               To  divide  the  memory constant into a value enter the
               number  and  press "F7".  The operation will perform in
               the  same  manner as the divide with the entered number
               appearing  first  on  the  tape  followed by the memory
               constant  then  the  result.  The result will appear in
               the entry window for subsequent operations and will not
               affect the sub and overall totals.
 
               Key sequence:  123  F7
 
 
         TOTAL FUNCTIONS
 
            To take a sub-total press the " S " key.  The tape  window
            will  scroll  up one line, the value in the sub-total will
            appear on the last line with the caption "SUB" to the left
            and the sub-total window will reset to 0.
 
            To take an overall  total  press  the " T " key.  A yes/no
            (Y/N)  prompt  will be displayed to insure the total is to
            be  performed.   If yes press the "Y" key otherwise  press
            "N" to continue entering values.
 
            If  a  "yes"  response was given a sub-total will be taken
            automatically  and  the tape will scroll with the value in
            the  total  window  appearing  on  the last line with  the

                                        12 

            caption  "TOT"  to  the  left.    The total window will be
            reset to 0.  At this point the tape may be scrolled  using
            the  up and down arrow keys and the values may be changed.
            However when normal  entry  of  values  resumes  the  tape
            window  will  clear  and the tape cannot be scrolled  back
            beyond  the first entry after the total was taken.  If the
            tape is printed however  all  values  entered  and  totals
            taken  since the last machine clear (or beginning  of  the
            program) will print.
 
 
         TAPE PRINT
 
            To print the contents  of  the memory tape press the " P "
            key.   All of the values on the tape will be printed along
            with    operation   captions  (eg.  MU,  MU*,  MU=,  etc.)
 
 
         TAPE SCROLLING AND CHANGING
 
            To scroll the values in the tape window press the  up  and
            down  cursor movement keys.  When the first entry has been
            reached if scrolling  up or the last if scrolling down the
            computer will beep.
 
            To  change  the  values on the tape press the "F9" key.  A
            highlighter  bar  will  appear  over the next to the  last
            entry.    Using the up and down arrow keys scroll the tape
            until  the entry to be changed is under the bar, enter the
            new value and press the "+" to add  the new number  or "-"
            to   subtract.   The old value will be removed from    the
            tape and subtracted from the appropriate sub-total and the
            overall total.  The new value will be inserted on the tape
            and added (or subtracted) to the appropriate sub-total and
            the  overall  total.   Only values entered thru the add or
            subtract functions may be modified.  Any values entered on
            the  tape  through  any  of the other processes (multiply,
            divide, etc.) cannot be changed.
 
            When all changes have  been  performed press the "Esc" key
            to resume normal processing.
 
         CHANGING COLORS
 
            If using a color monitor and you wish to change the screen
            colors  press  and  hold  the "Alt" key, press and release
            the "C" key, then release the "Alt" key.
 
            A  window  will open displaying 15 "boxes" (simulating the
            calculator keys),  each  a different color and each with a
            different letter "A" thru "O" inside.  Also an instruction
            line  will display requesting the color to be used for the
            outlines    of  the  keys  and  the  screen.    Press  the
            corresponding letter key (A thru O) for the color desired.
            Next the "boxes" will change to the selected color and the
            letters inside will change to the different color options.

            An  instruction line will display requesting the color for
            the values that will display inside the calculator "keys".
            Press the appropriate letter key and the screen will clear
            and the calculator redisplayed using the new colors.  Also
            the  new  colors will be written to the "MORCALC.CLR" file
            (retained on the current  disk,  under  the  current  sub-
            directory)  for the next time the program is executed.  If
            running  from  a  diskette insure the disk is in the  same
            drive  used  to  start the calculator and that it does not
            have a write protect tab on it.

         TAME YOUR HARD DISK and forget DOS with DIRECTMAINT  the full
         function   disk  directory  and   file   maintenance   system
         comprised of three programs:   DIRECTMAINT I, DIRECTMAINT II,
         and FILE PATCH.
 
         DIRECTMAINT  I  provides  a  directory/file  view of  a  disk
         showing  with a formatted display all the sub-directories and
         files   for  a  specific directory.  Using the display    and
         "point    and    shoot"   highlighted  bounce  bar  menus the
         directories  and  files  may  be  selected  for the following
         various processing functions.
 
         For directories:
 
             -  Copy  all  or  selected  files  from  one directory to
                another  on  the  same or to a different disk.    When
                copying  from  a  hard  disk  to  floppies a prompt is
                displayed  for  switching  diskettes  when  the target
                disk    fills.      File   contents  are  not  spanned
                between  diskettes  however,  each  disk  will contain
                files in their entirety.
 
             -  Move  all  or  selected  files  from one directory  to
                another on the same or to a different disk.    If  the
                source   and  target  disks  are  the  same  only  the
                directory entries  will  be  modified,  the files will
                will  not be affected.  If the disks are different the
                files  will  be physically copied to the target  drive
                and then erased from the source disk.
 
             -  Compare  all or selected files on one disk or  in  one
                directory to those  on or in another.  If two files do
                not  compare  equal the machine will stop and a window
                will  open showing a block of 30 characters from  each
                file where the mismatch occurred and the byte location
                of the characters in error.  Optionally the files  may
                be modified on a character by character basis.
 
             -  Erase all or selected files in a directory.
 
             -  Create a new directory.
 
             -  Erase a directory.
 
             -  Print  the names  of  the  sub-directories  and  files
                in  a  single  directory  or optionally all the  names
                within a complete  directory  tree  structure.    This
                also  provides  the  ability  to  print  the  names of
                all the directories and all the files on a disk.
 
             -  Find  the  path  for  any  file  anywhere  on  a disk.

                                        15 

                Optionally  when  a file is found its directory may be
                "opened" and displayed  on  the  screen.   Also if the
                file is a program (.COM or .EXE) or batch (.BAT)  file
                it may be passed to DOS for execution.
 
         For individual files:
 
             -  Copy  or  move  a  file  to  a  different  disk, to  a
                different  directory  on  the  same  disk,  or  to the
                same    directory    on  the  same  disk  but  with  a
                different name.
 
             -  Compare  the  contents    of   one  file  to  that  of
                another  displaying  where  the files are in error and
                providing the option to modify them.
 
             -  Erase a file.
 
             -  Display the contents of a file on the screen.
 
             -  Print the contents of a file.
 
             -  Change  the  name,  date,  time  or  attribute  of   a
                file.
 
             -  One or more files may be "marked" for subsequent group
                copy, move, compare or erase.
 
             -  Load  and  run  a  program  or batch file.  Optionally
                DIRECTMAINT I  may  be  restarted  automatically  when
                the    program    or  batch  file  ends.
 
             -  Load  and  run  FILE  PATCH  using the file for input.
 
             -  Two   seperate  selections  for  loading  and  running
                programs  of  your  choice  using a file that has been
                selected  through  DIRECTMAINT.
 
         Also    while  viewing  the  directories and files on a  disk
         DIRECTMAINT I provides:
 
             -  Ease  of  movement  within  disk  and  directory  tree
                structures.
 
             -  The  ability  to view  two disks or two directories on
                the same disk on the same screen at the same time.
 
             -  Directory names on the display screen may be sorted in
                ascending, descending or disk sequence.
 
             -  Files on the display screen may be sorted in ascending
                or descending sequence on name, extension, size, date,
                time,    date  and  time,  or  attribute  and  may  be
                resequenced  back  to  the order as they appear in the
                disk directory.
 

                                        16 

             -  An exit to DOS may be performed for executing commands
                or running other programs and  DIRECTMAINT I  returned
                to  at  the  same  point  where the exit was initiated
 
 
         DIRECTMAINT  II   is   similiar  to  DIRECTMAINT I except  it
         provides  a  full  view of ALL the files on one or more disks
         at one time.  The information  (name,  path, size, date, time
         and  attribute) for each of the files is read into memory and
         displayed using a formatted screen.  The information may then
         be    sorted  in  either  ascending  or  descending  sequence
         providing:
 
             -  If  in  name  sequence  which  files are duplicated in
                multiple  directories  or  on more than one disk.  The
                duplicates  will  automatically  be  flagged  on   the
                screen for you.
 
             -  If  in  name extension sequence what are all the files
                with  the  same  extension,  what  are all the program
                files (.COM or  .EXE),  what  are all the batch (.BAT)
                files, etc.
 
             -  If  in  path  sequence a complete view of the disk  by
                directory and sub-directory.
 
             -  If  in  size sequence which are the largest files (the
                ones using up the most disk space).
 
             -  If in date/time  sequence  which files were created or
                modified on a specific day.
 
             -  If  in attribute sequence which are the read  only  or
                hidden files and  which  files have been changed since
                the last disk backup.
 
         DIRECTMAINT II also provides the following functions:
 
             -  Print  the  information  an all of the files in memory
                or only those with duplicate names.
 
             -  Display  disk  statistics  on  total  space available,
                total  space  used,  total  number  of files and total
                number of directories.
 
             -  Exit to  DOS  and return to DIRECTMAINT II.
 
             -  All  of  the   file    processing    capabilities   of
                DIRECTMAINT I  (copy,  move,  compare,  erase,  etc.).
                With these functions  DIRECTMAINT II is invaluable  in
                helping  to  keep  your  disks  clean  of obsolete and
                duplicated  files,  saving  valuable  disk  space  and
                in  many  cases  may  help  avoid  having  to purchase
                additional hard disks.
 
         Both  DIRECTMAINT  I  and  DIRECTMAINT  II are designed to be

                                        17 

         "user  friendly" with all instructions for operator responses
         displayed  on the screen and all processes are selected using
         either  single  key  strokes  or  through  "point  and shoot"
         highlighted bounce bar menus.  Only when specific information
         such  as  a  file selection mask or a new  file date or  time
         are required does the  user  have to enter data.  No commands
         or  keywords are required to be memorized and after using the
         system  a  few  times  reference  to  the  manual  is  seldom
         necessary.
 
         Also  DIRECTMAINT I and DIRECTMAINT II are "linked"  together
         in   that  when  running DIRECTMAINT I by simply pressing the
         "F10"  key  it  will  terminate    and    automatically  call
         DIRECTMAINT  II.  When in DIRECTMAINT II press "F10"  and  it
         will  end  and start DIRECTMAINT  I.

         FILE PATCH is a utility program designed for use by  computer
         consultants,    technicians,  Information  Centers,  software
         developers and those  individuals that are responsible for or
         just wish to "tinker" with PC files. It provides the ability,
         at  the  byte  level,  for  on screen viewing, dumping to the
         printer,  modifying, extracting or creating any DOS  data  or
         program file up to 10 megabytes in length.
 
         When  displayed on the screen each character within a file is
         shown along with its corresponding ASCII or HEX value.    The
         screen  may  be  scrolled one line at a  time up or down, may
         be paged a screen at a time or repositioning may be performed
         at  any  point within the file.  Also the file may be scanned
         for a specific occurence of a string of values and  the  file
         will  be  automatically  repositioned  at the point where the
         values are found.
 
         If  a  file is dumped to the printer all or only portions  of
         the file contents may be printed and the values will be shown
         in either ASCII  or  HEX  and  optionally  the  corresponding
         characters may be displayed.
 
         The values in any file may be modified or new values appended
         to the end of the file in either character, ASCII or HEX. Any
         of  the  256 ASCII or HEX values may be used.
 
         A new file may be created  and  any  of  the 256 ASCII or HEX
         values may be entered in an append mode.
 
         In  addition  all or portions of a file may be extracted to a
         new file or appended to the end of an existing file.
         The basic machine and software requirements to use FILE PATCH
         are as follows:
 
           -  DOS 2.0 or later
           -  256k usable memory
           -  Monochrome or color monitor.
           -  Any disk or diskette configuration
 
         Prices:  FILE PATCH comes with the DIRECTMAINT hard disk
                  directory and file maintenance system at no
                  additional cost.  However it may be registered
                  individually for $14.95 per copy or a sharware
                  evaluation copy may be ordered for $4.00.

         Tired  of  having  to  remember  and continually reenter  DOS
         commands  or batch file names to start your jobs or programs?
         Wish  your  computer  was  better  organized.  Now there's PC
         SYSTEM  MANAGER,  the  full  function,  fully  self-contained
         master menuing system for your IBM PC or compatible.
 
         Select  your  programs  to  be  run  from  easy  to  read and
         descriptive  menus  and sub-menus customized for your  system
         with  no  practical  limit  to  the number of menu entries or
         number  of  sub-menu  levels  (system limit is 32,000 entries
         overall).  The system starts up automatically when  you power
         on  or  reboot  and  restarts  itself  when a selected job or
         program ends.  It is always there for your next selection and
         does not "terminate and  stay  resident"  tying  up memory or
         possibly damaging system registers.
 
         Wish  the  computer  would  display  reminders  such as which
         diskettes  to  insert  or  what  forms  to use on the printer
         before a program starts  so you don't have to look it up in a
         manual or find those scribbled notes you put somewhere?    PC
         SYSTEM MANAGER allows up to 255 lines of free form text to be
         displayed whenever a menu entry is selected.
 
         Use replaceable parameters  in  your  batch files?  PC SYSTEM
         MANAGER will prompt you for them when a job starts so they're
         not forgotten.
 
         Have  a computer that is used by more than one individual and
         need security?  PC SYSTEM MANAGER provides passwording at the
         menu, sub-menu and menu entry level.
 
         Ever need to run a job or program with slightly different DOS
         commands for a one time run?  PC SYSTEM MANAGER allows you to
         alter the normal commands for a job when it is selected  from
         a menu but without changing those stored in the master  file.
         This makes ad hoc and "just this time only" runs easy.
 
         Need to keep track of your computer usage?  PC SYSTEM MANAGER
         records  in  its  log  file  the  date and time a program was
         started and the date and time it ended and through the use of
         logon user ID's who ran  the  program.  Also multiple reports
         may  be printed showing both detailed and summary information
         on user and program run times.
 
         Need  to  automatically  start  jobs?  PC SYSTEM MANAGER  can
         automatically start up to 30 different jobs or programs based
         on  time  of day and the current date, the day of the week, a
         specific day of the month,  the first and third or second and
         last  day  of  the week of the month (eg. the first and third
         Monday  of  each  month),  every  other of a specific day  of
         the  week (eg. every other Friday), the last day of the month

                                        20 

         or  the  last  of  a  specific day of the month (eg. the last
         Wednesday of each month).
 
         PC  SYSTEM MANAGER is fully self-contained and has all of its
         own editors for entering, retaining and modifying all the DOS
         commands  to  run your programs, startup reminders, parameter
         prompts and passwords.    Also  all  of the files used by the
         system  are  retained in its own sub-directory and are  fully
         maintained by the system itself.
 
         PC SYSTEM MANAGER comes with its own installation program and
         can be up  and running  on your system in just a few minutes.
         No  special  expertise  is required to load or use the system
         and  with  its  "user friendly" prompts throughout you always
         know what to do next.  If you can run your computer  now  you
         can use PC SYSTEM MANAGER.
 
         The basic machine and software requirements to use  PC SYSTEM
         manager are as follows:
 
           -  DOS 2.0 or later
           -  Monochrome or color monitor.  If a color monitor is used
              selection of screen colors is provided.
           -  256k usable memory
           -  Hard disk.
 
         Prices:  Registered copy $19.95
                  Shareware evaluation copy $4.00.
