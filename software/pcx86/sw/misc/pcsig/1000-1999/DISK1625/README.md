## Information about "MAINTENANCE DATA BASE"

    MAINTENANCE DBS is ideal for the person in charge of maintenance for a
    large corporation or building.  It records what maintenance was done,
    who did it, and where it was done.  Then it keeps a running record of
    maintenance due:  where, when, and what is needed.  It tracks purchase
    orders by date, number, and the department to which the work is
    charged.  Basically, MAINTENANCE DBS covers most of the important
    paperwork a maintenance director faces.
    
    Simple to run, MAINTENANCE DBS allows you to set up your own fields and
    records if the suggested ones do not match your operation. It tracks up
    to 120 records per file.  Each file tracks records for a month-long
    period and contains up to 414 characters, or six lines of data, at 69
    characters per line.
