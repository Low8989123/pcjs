## Information about "PC-FOOD"

    PC-FOOD calculates and maintains the food or beverage cost of each item
    on a restaurant's menu automatically while any ingredient cost or
    portion cost changes. You can maintain a real profit when you know what
    it REALLY costs. PC-FOOD is used in small and large food service
    operations, including schools and hotels.
    
    Of course, PC-FOOD not only deals with creating menus but guides the
    user through the program with its own easy-to-use computer menus. After
    describing the way inventory ingredients are purchased and used, the
    user "builds" each batch recipe simply and quickly by choosing from the
    defined ingredients and batch recipes. A batch recipe can contain up to
    19 inventory ingredients in any quantity. Each menu item can contain up
    to 12 inventory ingredients and or batch recipes in any quantity. One
    such menu item might be the "noon special" that includes a sandwich,
    soup and a cookie. How do you price it and make a fair profit?
    
    PC-FOOD will maintain required selling prices for each menu item based
    on a desired gross profit percent and or dollar amount. Several reports
    can be printed, including required price changes. At the touch of a
    key, all uses of an ingredient or batch recipe can be displayed.
