## Information about "TEMESCAL"

    Bring that next software development project in on time, and under cost.
    TEMESCAL is the tool that can do it for you.  With TEMESCAL your project
    can be on time and on budget!
    
    TEMESCAL is a tool for planning and managing software development
    projects.  Software development projects are notorious for getting
    bogged down in unforeseen delays and costs.  The reason, all to often,
    is that they are planned by guesswork.  TEMESCAL brings you the
    experience of thousands of development projects.  There is a more
    orderly approach to planning a software project and it is based on the
    "software equation."  The "software equation" was developed after
    studying over 800 large development projects performed by many different
    companies and government agencies.  The "software equation" has been
    improved and refined to include data on today's popular languages, such
    as ADA, C, Pascal, etc., and 8, 16, and 32 bit computers.
    
    With TEMESCAL you can: compare a change in development time for a
    corresponding change in the number of man-months needed for a
    development project, evaluate the development time required in a
    software project when different languages are used, Calculate the
    efficiency of each and every programmer and monitor their productivity
    as the project progresses, and if you have a deadline to meet, you can
    calculate the number and efficiency level of the programmers required
    to meet it.
    
    The languages supported by TEMESCAL are ADA, Assembly, BASIC, C, COBOL,
    Forth, FORTRAN, Modula-2, and PL1.  If you plan or manage any software
    project, you need this program.
