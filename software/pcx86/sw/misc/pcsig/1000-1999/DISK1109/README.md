## Information about "CELL SYSTEMS"

    CELL SYSTEMS creates linear cellular automata that are often beautiful
    and also have mathematical significance. The patterns simulate the
    growth processes of simple biological entities. The program has a
    library of patterns already installed, with room for many more. This
    program lets you create new growth patterns of your own, save them,
    re-run them, and edit them. Your new cell can die, flourish, create a
    mess, or make a beautiful pattern that can be stored on disk. View the
    parameters for the sample cells and edit them if you want a slightly
    different pattern. You can create the patterns on either a medium- or
    high-resolution monitor and can print them. An installation program
    configures the program to fit your printer needs.
