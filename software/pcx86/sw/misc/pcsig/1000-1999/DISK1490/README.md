## Information about "VEGAS PRO"

    Video poker machines are the most popular "slot" machines in Las Vegas
    and account for almost forty percent of the billions of dollars that
    tourists spend in Nevada casinos.
    
    VEGAS PRO takes you on a quick, happy trip to a casino to play the
    popular machine "five card draw poker."  You bet and pull the handle and
    watch the cards line up.  You can hold or draw each of the cards.  Then
    you tell the machine to deal and get the good or bad news.  Each game
    can be played in seconds.
    
    Poker, to its afficionados, is not a card game, but a game of money
    management.  VEGAS PRO lets you set the payoffs yourself to practice for
    different casinos.  A draw tester allows you to try out different
    gambling strategies.  The game will play on almost any monitor and
    provides superb graphics on EGA/VGA.  The user can also control sound
    effects, speed of play, and other options.
