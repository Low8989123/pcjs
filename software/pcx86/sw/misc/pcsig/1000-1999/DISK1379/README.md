                           The Ultimate Vocabulary Database

                   VMS is a VOCABULARY DATABASE program that is designed
     to help teachers, parents and students to learn vocabulary and
     spelling words.  It may also be used to learn any related set of
     words or ideas.  For example, the file STATES on the VMS disk is a
     listing of the States of the United States with their associated
     Capitals, mottos, state flowers and state birds.  Similarly the
     program could also be used to learn any other related items,
     Presidents / years in office, foreign vocabulary words / English
     words, Metric  units of measure / English units, Dates in history /
     important events, famous sayings / their authors, etc.

                   VMS is composed of an EDITOR, two printer output
     modules, WORDSEARCH and TEST PRINTER, and three game modules,
     QUIZZER, FORTUNE and SPELL.  This program is being used and revised
     continually and more modules will be added in the near future.

                   VMS is distributed under the SHAREWARE concept.  This
     simply means that I have given you the right to use this software,
     evaluate it and share it with your friends.  All that I ask in
     return is that you register the  program with me by sending a check
     for $20.00 to:
                   David G. Bodnar
                   26 Ralston Place
                   Pittsburgh, PA 15216

                   In return I will send you the latest version of the
     program, a disk containing many more VMS word lists, a complete
     printed manual, and a list of other educational computer programs
     that I have written.  I will also act as a clearing house for other
     VMS word lists that you and other users of the program create.  In
     return for your disk of files and $2.00 to cover shipping and
     handling, I will send you one or more disks of files that I have
     received from others.  

                   Registering the program will also give you the
     opportunity to have impact on the growth of the program.  I will be
     happy to consider ideas for revisions to the program including new
     VMS modules that you feel would be useful to you and others. 
     Please be very specific in describing your ideas.  Include sketches
     of screens, samples of what menus would look like, etc.

                              _____EDITOR_____

     The VMS EDITOR is used to enter and modify word and definition
     lists.  The following is a description of each EDITOR MENU option.

      l/s/k LOAD/SAVE/KILL

          l - loads a word list from disk - select a list by number
          s - saves a word list to disk - notes may be left with the
              list -
              Press ENTER after entering notes.
              File names may be up to 8 characters in length - no
              extension is allowed
          k - kills (removes) a file from disk

      b  BEGIN NEW FILE
              Type each word - press ENTER when done.  See the notes
              that follow this section on using the SCREEN EDITOR.
              Type a definition and press ENTER.  Do not be concerned if
              a word in the definition is split at the end of one screen
              line.  DO NOT add spaces as you type a definition so that
              a word that would be split is forced to the next line. 
              The program will automatically correct for this when the
              definition is displayed or printed.
              Press W if you need to edit the word or D if you need to
              edit the definition.
              Once the word and definition are correct press N to enter
              the next word, P to edit the previous word or F1 to return
              to the main menu.

     **** using the SCREEN EDITOR
          Words and definitions are entered and edited using the
          program's screen editor.  It is similar to using a
          wordprocessor.  Type the word using the arrow keys to move
          around and make corrections.  Use the INSERT key to add spaces
          between words or letters.  Use the DELETE key to remove
          characters.  Use PAGE UP or PAGE DOWN to move one word to the
          LEFT or RIGHT.  Use HOME or END to move to the BEGINNING or
          END of a line.  Use CONTROL END to ERASE a line.
          Note that these commands are printed at the bottom of the
          screen as you enter words and definitions.

          DO NOT FORGET to save a word list once it has been created or
          modified.

                            ____WORD SEARCHER_____

          This program allows you to create and print a word search
     puzzle or an anagram printout.  The following is a description of
     each of the menu options that are new in this section of VMS.

      l  LOAD
          Allows you to load a file from disk.

      b  BUILD WORD SEARCH
          Once a file has been loaded press B and choose the number of
          words to be included in the word search puzzle.  If you choose
          less than the total number of words on the list you may remove
          the extra words manually or have the computer remove them for
          you.

          The horizontal and vertical dimensions are normally 30 X 30.
          Change this by pressing H or V to change the horizontal or
          vertical respectively.  Press ENTER when done.

          Type a number from 0 to 8 for the number of lines of heading.
          You will be typing the heading in the same SCREEN EDITOR that
          you used when entering words and definitions.  Note that you
          have several other options.  You may press CONTROL C to center
          a line, CONTROL R to move a line flush right or CONTROL L to
          move a line flush left.  You may also automatically enter a
          name line by pressing CONTROL N.

          If the computer has a difficult time placing all of the words,
          press S to start over with the same size puzzle and word list
          or Q to quit and return to the main menu.

          A graphic display will show the relative placement of words as
          the computer creates the word search.  If you wish to have a
          better balance of horizontal or diagonal placements you may
          press S to have the computer start over and recreate the word
          search.

          Note that the word search that is created is printed on the
          screen, not on the printer.  In order to print on the printer
          you must use the following command to change the device from
          screen to printer.


      d  DEVICE = SCREEN/PRINTER/DISK

          Press D  from the main menu to change the output device from
          screen to printer to disk file.  If printer is selected the
          word search puzzle will be printed on the printer.

          for a discussion of using DEVICE= DISK.

      f  FORMAT
          Please refer to the ADVANCED FEATURES section of the manual.


      a  ANAGRAMS
          Anagrams are created by scrambling the letters of a word.  For
          example, TPOCMERU is an anagram for COMPUTER.  This part of
          the program creates and prints anagrams for the word list that
          is loaded into the computer's memory.

                               _____QUIZZER_____

          This section of the program quizzes students on the words and
     their definitions.  It also includes a challenging CODE game.

      d  SET DIFFICULTY LEVEL (NOW 8 WORDS)
          The quiz may contain 4, 8, 12, or 16 words in the word list.
          The more words, the more difficult the quiz.
          Press D to change levels.

      t  TIME - NOW 20 SECONDS

      n  NORMAL/SCRAMBLED DEFINITIONS - NOW NORMAL
          Press N to change the definitions so that the words in the
          definition are in a random order.  Press N again to change it
          back to normal.
          Note that students should not choose the scrambled option
          until they become familiar with a list of vocabulary words.

      w  WORDS OR NUMBERS
          You may answer the QUIZZER questions by either typing a number
          for the correct word or by spelling out the correct word. 
          Press W to change the method of giving answers from WORDS to
          NUMBERS or from NUMBERS to WORDS.

      b  BEGIN QUIZ
          A definition will be chosen at random and between 4 and 16
          words will be displayed, depending on the difficulty level. 
          Press the Number or Letter to the left of the word that you
          think matches the definition.  If you have chosen WORDS rather
          than NUMBERS you must type, and correctly spell, the correct
          word.

      c  BEGIN CODE
          Code uses a simple substitution code to encode a randomly
          chosen word and definition.  For example, all Cs may be
          changed to Ls and all Es to Js.

          To decode the entry type the letter that is used in the code 
          and then the letter that you think it represents.  To change
          Ls to Cs, press L then C.  Press ENTER.  If you are correct
          the change will be made and the correct letters will be
          highlighted.  If you are incorrect points will be deducted
          from the score.  You will also lose a point whenever the time
          display in the upper left hand corner reaches 0.

                              _____FORTUNE_____

          Fortune is a challenging and fun way for students to review
     their vocabulary once they have become familiar with it.  It uses a
     "WHEEL OF FORTUNE" game format.

      p  PLAYERS = 1
          Press P to change the number of players.  Up to 4 students may
          compete at one time.

      b  BEGIN QUIZ
          Note that if you attempt to begin before entering names that
          the program will require you to enter names before beginning.

          The game screen consists of a list of 8 words, the current
          SCORE, and a timer that counts down and deducts 1 point for
          each time period that passes.  Each star displayed on the
          screen represents a letter in the definition that matches one
          of the 8 words.

          One of the player's names is highlighted and his score is
          displayed in parenthesis after the name.

          To begin press a letter.  If the letter is in the definition,
          all occurrences of the letter will be displayed.  If a
          consonant is chosen and found one point will be deducted.  A
          vowel costs 3 points and selecting a letter that is not found
          deducts 5 points from the score.

          Once you think you know which word matches the definition,
          press the number to the word's left.  If you are correct you
          will be awarded the points that you have left.

          Pressing ESC at any time will end the game and display the
          final score.

          The game is over when one player reaches 100 points or when
          all of the definitions have been displayed.

                               TUTORIAL SECTION

          This section of the manual is designed to walk a first time
     user through the first parts of the program.  Use it along with the
     REFERENCE SECTION to get the most out of the program.

     Starting VMS:
          Boot the computer and get the A> prompt on the screen.  Insert
     the VMS disk into the disk drive and type VMS.   Press ENTER and
     the program will read information from the disk and display the
     first menu.

          The menu allows you to choose one of the following programs:
     EDIT, WORD SEARCH, TEST PRINTER, QUIZZER, FORTUNE or SPELLER.  To
     choose a program press the first letter of its name.  We will start
     with the EDIT program so press E, the first letter of EDIT.

     Entering a new word list:
          When the edit program loads you will see the main edit menu. 
     Like the first menu you saw there is a list of options and again
     you will choose an option by pressing the first letter of its name. 
     Press B so that we can begin entering a new word list.

          You will see the word/definition entry screen appear.  It
     shows you that you are currently editing ENTRY 1 OF 1.  Type the
     first word, let's use COMPUTER.  You may type the word in all caps
     or in lower case.  It doesn't matter as long as you are consistent. 
     If you change your mind later the program can change the case of
     words and definitions for you.  If you make an error use the arrow
     keys to move to the error and type over it.  Notice the keys that
     are listed at the bottom of the screen.  If you need to delete a
     letter or space, press the DELETE key.  If you need to add a space
     between letters press INSERT.  

          Once the word has been typed to your satisfaction press ENTER. 
     Now type the definition for COMPUTER.  Use this:  A MACHINE THAT
     ALLOWS MAN TO EXPAND HIS CAPABILITIES BY ENABLING HIM TO WORK WITH
     AND MANIPULATE LARGE AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION.  When you come to the
     end of the first line the word WITH may be broken between the first
     and second lines.  Don't be concerned about it, just keep on typing
     as though there is only one long line.  The computer will
     automatically format definitions so that words will not be broken
     between lines when they are displayed or printed.

          Once the definition has been typed make any necessary
     corrections and press ENTER.  If you discover an error after
     pressing ENTER you may edit the word by pressing the W key or the
     definition by pressing D.  To enter the next word press N, for
     NEXT.  Type the second word, KEYBOARD.  Press ENTER when done and
     type a definition, use A DEVICE FOR ENTERING INFORMATION INTO THE
     COMPUTER.

          After you are done with the second word try entering the
     following words with your own definitions:  MONITOR, ENTER KEY,
     DISK, DISK DRIVE, MOUSE, PRINTER, ESCAPE KEY, FUNCTION KEY.

          After the last word and definition have been entered press the
     F1 key to return to the main menu.

          If you have typed all of the words listed above you will see
     WORDS= 10 displayed at the bottom of the screen.

     Saving a word list:
          Now we need to save the list of words on the disk.  Press S
     for SAVE.  You will be given an opportunity to add any notes to the
     list of words that you have just typed.  Type the following:  A
     SAMPLE LIST OF WORDS TYPED ON (TODAY'S DATE).  Again you may use
     the keys listed at the bottom of the screen to make corrections. 
     Press ENTER when you are done.

          Now you must give the list of words a name.  The name must be
     eight or less characters in length and should contain only letters
     and or numbers.  Type SAMPLE for the file name and press ENTER.

     Loading a word list:
          To load in a longer list press L for LOAD, from the main menu. 
     An alphabetized list of the files that are stored on the disk will
     be displayed.  One of them should have the name COMPUTER.  Type the
     number to its left and press ENTER.  The file will be loaded and
     you will be returned to the main menu.  WORDS= 26 should be
     displayed at the bottom of the screen and the list name, COMPUTER,
     should be displayed at the top of the screen.

     Editing a word list:
          To examine and then edit the words and definitions used in the
     program press E for EDIT from the main menu.  All of the words that
     have been loaded will be displayed on the screen.  Type 1, for word
     1, and press enter.  You will find yourself back on the screen that
     you used to enter words.  You should see the first word, its

     definition and ENTRY 1 OF 26.  You may now press W to edit the
     word, D to edit the definition or N to look at the next word.  

          Press N several times and  you will move forward through the
     list of words.  Press P and you will move backward to the previous
     word.  Notice that you will be given an opportunity to type word 27
     if you move to the end of the word list and continue to press N. 
     Press F1 to return to the main menu.

     Moving to another section of VMS:
          Press M from the main menu to move to the other programs that
     make up VMS.  Press T to move to the TEST section.  This program
     will allow us to print a list of the words that we loaded into VMS.

     Printing a word list:
          You should now see the main menu of the test part of VMS. 
     WORDS= 26 should still be displayed at the bottom of the screen and
     COMPUTER at the top.  If not, use L to load in the COMPUTER list of
     words.

          Press P, for PRINT WORD/DEFINITION LIST, from the main menu. 
     Press D in order to print a list of words and definitions and then
     press 1 to have the program skip one line between words.  When
     asked for then number of lines for the heading use 4.

          You may now type a four line heading for the word list.  Type
     COMPUTER WORD LIST on the first line.  Before pressing ENTER or the
     down arrow to move to line 2, press and hold the CONTROL key and
     press C.   The first line of the heading will move to the center of
     the screen.  Similarly you can move lines to the right or left with
     CONTROL R and CONTROL L.

          Move to the second line and type the date.  Press ENTER three
     more times to leave the other lines of the heading blank.   As soon
     as you enter the last line of the title you will see the word and
     definition list fly past on the screen.  This is because the output
     device is set for screen on the main menu.  When you return to the
     main menu notice that the third menu option says DEVICE = SCREEN. 
     Press D once and DEVICE = PRINTER will be displayed.  Repeat the
     above steps and the list will be printed on your printer rather
     than on the screen.

     Printing a test:
          To print a test made up of the COMPUTER word list, press T
     from the main menu.  You will be asked "HOW MANY OF THE 26 WORDS DO
     YOU WISH TO INCLUDE IN THE PRINTOUT?"  Type 15 and press ENTER.

                            (c) 1988 D. Bodnar


     Press C to allow the computer to select the words to be removed. 
     When the WORDS RETAINED are displayed you may press R to have the
     computer RESELECT another set of 15 words or you may press ENTER to
     continue creating the test.

          Again you will be given an opportunity to type a heading for
     the test.  Once the heading is done the test will be printed on the
     printer or screen, depending on which device you have selected.

     Printing a word search:
          From the main menu press M to move and press W to move to the
     word search section of VMS.

          Press B to begin building the word search.  Just as under the
     test printing section you must decide how many words to include. 
     Press ENTER to use all 26 words.  Next you will be given an
     opportunity to change the size of the rectangle that makes up the
     word search.  It is normally set at 30 X 30.  Press H five times
     and V ten times to change it to 35 X 40.  Press ENTER when you are
     done.

          After you have entered a heading the computer will begin
     creating the puzzle.  Since the rectangle we have chosen is very
     large and we are only using 26 words the computer will be done
     quickly.  If, however, we were using a smaller rectangle or more
     words it is possible to give the computer a difficult or impossible
     task.  For this reason you may press S to have the computer start
     over or Q to quit.

          If you have left DEVICE = SCREEN on the main menu the search
     will be printed on the screen otherwise it will print on the
     printer.  You may also print a key.
