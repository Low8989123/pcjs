                        LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT


KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS that I, (Name) of (address), city of (city),
county of (county), and state of (state), being of sound and disposing mind
and memory, do make, publish, and declare the following to be my Last Will
and Testament, hereby revoking all Wills made by me at any time heretofore.

FIRST: I direct my Executor, hereinafter named, to pay all my funeral
expenses, administration expenses of my estate, including inheritance and
succession taxes, state or federal, which may be occasioned by the passage
of or succession to any interest in my estate under the terms of this
instrument, and all my just debts, excepting mortgage notes secured by
mortgages upon real estate.

SECOND: All the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, both real and
personal, of whatsoever kind or character, and wheresoever situated, I
give, devise, and bequeath to (my beloved wife/husband); (name), to be
(his/hers) absolutely and forever.

THIRD: If (my beloved wife/husband) does not survive me, all the rest,
residue, and remainder of my estate, both real and personal, of whatsoever
kind or character, and wheresoever situated, I give, devise, and bequeath
to (my beloved daughter/son); (name), to be (his/hers) absolutely and
forever.

FOURTH: I hereby appoint (my beloved wife/husband), (name), as executor of
this, my Last Will and Testament.

FIFTH: If (my beloved wife/husband) does not survive me, I hereby appoint
(my beloved daughter/son), (name), as executor of my estate.  I direct that
no executor serving hereunder shall be required to post bond.

SIXTH: Upon my death, I demand that my body be cremated and that the
remaining ashes be given to (my beloved wife/husband), (name).  If, upon my
death, (my beloved wife/husband) does not survive me, (my beloved
daughter/son), (name), shall decide the disposition of the ashes of my
body.

SEVENTH: In the event that I become mentally or physically incapacitated
due to accident, terminal illness, or any unforseen circumstances, I claim
and demand the right to die a natural, dignified death.  Let be known in no
uncertain terms that I refuse to be kept alive by artificial means.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and seal at (city),
(state), this (day) day of (month), 19(year).

                              A LIVING WILL

                  A directive to withhold treatment and for
                  the administration of pain-killing drugs


To my family, my relatives, my physicians, my employers, and all others whom
it may concern:

I, (name), of (address), City of (city), County of (county), State of
(state), being of sound mind, willfully, and voluntarily make known my desire
that my life shall not be prolonged artificially under the circumstances set
forth below, do hereby declare:

1. If, at any time, I should have an incurable injury, disease, illness, or
condition certified to be terminal by two medical doctors who have examined
me, and where the application of life-sustaining procedures of any kind would
serve only to prolong artificially the moment of my death, and where a
medical doctor determines that my death is imminent, whether or not life-
sustaining procedures are utilized, I direct that such procedures be withheld
or withdrawn and that I be permitted to die naturally, and that I receive
whatever quantity of whatever drugs may be required to keep me free of pain
or distress even if the moment of death is hastened.

2. In the absence of my ability to give directions regarding the use of life-
sustaining procedures, I hereby appoint (name) of (address), City of (city),
County of (county), State of (state), as my attorney-in-fact/proxy for the
purpose of making decisions relating to my health care in my place; and it
is my intention that this appointment shall be honored by him/her, by my
family, relatives, friends, physicians, and lawyer as the final expression
of my legal right to refuse medical or surgical treatment; and I willfully
accept the consequences of such a decision.  I have duly executed a Durable
Power of Attorney for health care on this date.

**************************************************************************
Under California law, for such an appointment to be as fully effective as
the law will permit, it must be in the form included under the title "DURABLE
POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARE CONDITIONS."  Persons living in other
states and executing this "Living Will" also might wish to execute that same
Durable Power of Attorney form, since it might be honored by the courts of
any particular state.
**************************************************************************

3. In the absence of my ability to give further directions regarding my
treatment, including life-sustaining procedures, it is my willful intention
that this directive shall be honored by my family and physicians as the final
expression of my legal right to refuse or accept medical or surgical
treatment, and I fully and willfully accept the consequences of such refusal.

4. If I have been diagnosed as pregnant and that diagnosis is known to any
interested person, this directive shall have no force during the course of
my pregnancy.

**************************************************************************
Males should strike out this paragraph entirely.
**************************************************************************

5. I have been diagnosed, and notified at least 14 days ago, as being in a
terminal condition by (physician's name), M.D., of (address), City of (city),
State of (state).  It is my intention that if I have not filled in the
physician's name and address, it shall be presumed that I did not have a
terminal condition when I completed this directive.

**************************************************************************
If you are not a resident of California, strike out this paragraph entirely.
**************************************************************************

6.  I fully and completely understand the full importance of this directive
and am emotionally and mentally competent to make this directive.  No
participant in the making of this directive or on its being carried into
effect, whether it be a medical doctor, my spouse, a relative, friend, or any
other person shall be held responsible in any way, legally, professionally
or socially, for complying with my directions.

In Witness Whereof, I have executed this directive on the date entered below.

## NOTES.TXT

{% raw %}
```
          A checklist of some basic work to be accomplished
          by an Executor, Administrator, or Successor Trustee


BURIAL ARRANGEMENTS:

A major factor to be considered is that in this type of a
situation, great stress and intimidation play a large role; stress
by the gravity of the situation and intimidation possibly by a
mortuary environment.  Proper estate and burial planning by the
decedent can greatly ease what may otherwise be a very traumatic,
complex, and expensive ordeal.  Social security or veterans
benefits are sometimes involved in making burial arrangements.


FAMILY CONFERENCE:

If appropriate, schedule a family conference at which all
interested parties may be advised of the facts available and
exchange information and ideas about the handling of the estate. 
Discretion should be used as to how many meetings to hold, who
attends, what is discussed, and what is done.  Topics of discussion
should be determined in advance and adhered to.


COLLECTION AND PROTECTION OF PROPERTY:

Search the household, make an inventory of all personal property,
and arrange for storage and protection of personal property, if
appropriate.


COPIES OF DEATH CERTIFICATE:

Make numerous copies of the death certificate.  It will be needed
in many of the transactions in connection with the collection of
property and the management and/or distribution of the estate. 
Extra copies will be needed for social security, insurance claims,
bank transactions, and many other transactions.


COPY OF WILL, if any:

Make additional copies of the decedent's will, if any, for
beneficiaries, taxing authorities, and others who may need it.


SAFE DEPOSIT BOXES, if any:

List the contents of any safety deposit boxes in the decedent's
name.  Usually most state laws provide that certain persons, such
as tax authorities, be present when a box is opened and that an
inventory be made of all box contents.  If you have a box in joint
name of yourself and another person it may not be necessary for the

                       TO ANY PERSON EXECUTING
                     A DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY



THIS IS NOT A TRIVIAL MATTER.  This is an IMPORTANT LEGAL DOCUMENT.  It
creates a durable power of attorney for health care.

Before executing this document, you should know these important facts:

1. This document gives the person you designate as your attorney-in-fact the
power to make health care decisions for you, subject to any limitations or
statement of your demands that you include in this document.  The power to

in this document any types of treatment or placements that you do not desire.

2. The person you designate in this document has a duty to act consistently
with your demands as stated in this document or otherwise made known or, if
your demands are unknown, to act in your best interests.

3. Except as you other wise specify in this document, the power of the person
you designate to make health care decisions for you may include the power to
consent to your doctor not giving treatment or stopping treatment which would
keep you alive.

4. Unless you specify a shorter period in this document, this power will
exist for Seven Years from the date you execute this document and, if you
are unable to make health care decisions for yourself at the time when this
seven-year period ends, this power will continue to exist until the time when
you become able to make health care decisions for yourself.

5. Notwithstanding this document, you have the right to make medical and
other health care decisions for yourself so long as you can give informed
consent with respect to the particular decision.  In addition, no treatment
may be given to you over your objection, and health care necessary to keep
you alive may not be stopped if you object.

6. You have the right to revoke the designation of the person named in this

8. The person designated in this document to make health care decisions for
you has the right to examine your medical records and to consent to their
disclosure unless you limit this right in this document.

9. If there is anything in this document that you do not understand, you
should ask a lawyer to explain it to you.  This power of attorney will not
be valid for making health care decisions unless it is either (1) signed by
two qualified witnesses who are personally known to you and who are present
when you sign or acknowledge your signature or (2) acknowledged before a
notary public in California.

                      A DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY
                            FOR HEALTH CARE


To my family, relatives, my friends, my physicians, health care providers,
community care facilities, and any other person who may have an interest or
duty:

I, (name), of (address), City of (city), County of (county), State of

appoint (name of person), of (address), City of (city), County of (county),
State of (state), as my attorney-in-fact/proxy to make health care decisions
in my stead and behalf.  He/she is not a treating health care provider nor
an employee of such, nor is he/she an operator of a community health care
facility which is treating me, or an employee of such, nor is he/she
conservator of my person or estate; and I hereby request that he/she never
be appointed such a conservator.

In the event that (name) is unable or unwilling to serve at my attorney-in-
fact for the purpose of making health care decisions for me, I designate
(name of alternate) of (address), City of (city), County of (county), State
of (state), to serve as my attorney-in-fact.

At any time that I should for any reason be unable to make such decisions
for myself, I hereby authorize (name) my attorney-in-fact, to make any
decisions I otherwise could make involving consent, refusal of consent, or
withdrawal of consent to any care, treatment, service, or procedure to
maintain, diagnose, or treat me for any physical or mental condition
whatever, except for commitment to or placement in a mental health treatment
facility, convulsive treatment, psychosurgery, sterilization, or abortion.

This appointment shall have no legal force or effect after expiration of
seven years from the date of its execution.  It shall have no effect if I
revoke it by giving notice of such revocation either orally or in writing.

This document revokes any prior Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care.

and Wife as Grantors and Co-Trustees.  Upon their deaths property in the
trust goes to any other persons specified in the trust.
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

                   REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST AGREEMENT

This Revocable Living Trust Agreement is made this (day) day of (month),   
19(year), between (Name) and (Name), husband and wife, of (address), City of
(city), State of (State), herein referred to as Grantors, and (name) and
(name), of (address), City of (city), State of (state), herein referred to
as Co-Trustees.

Whereas, grantors are now the owners of the property described in Exhibit A
attached hereto and made a part hereof, and

Whereas, grantors desire to make provision for the care and management of
such property, and the collection of the income therefrom, and the
disposition of both such income and such property in the manner herein
provided:

Now, therefore, for the reasons set forth above, and in consideration of the
mutual covenants set forth herein, grantors and trustees agree as follows:

1. Transfer of Property: Grantors, in consideration of the acceptance by co-
trustees of the trust herein created, hereby convey, transfer, assign, and
deliver to co-trustees, their successors in trust and assigns, the property
described in Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part hereof, by this
reference, which property, together with all other property that may from
time to time be held by co-trustees hereunder, is herein referred to as Trust
Estate.  Grantors, and any other persons shall have the right at any time to
add property acceptable to trustees to this trust and such property, when
received and accepted by trustees, shall become part of the trust estate.

2. Disposition of Income and Principal: Trustees shall care for and manage
the trust estate and collect the income derived therefrom, and, after the
payment of all taxes and assessments thereon and all charges incident to the
management thereof, dispose of the net income therefrom and corpus thereof,
as follows:

During the lifetime of grantors the trustees may pay income of the trust
estate and such portions of the principal as the grantors from time to time
may direct to the grantors, or otherwise as they direct during their lives. 
After the death of both grantors the successor trustee shall distribute the
trust estate to the following beneficiary or beneficiaries who shall survive
both grantors:  (names and addresses) _____________________________

___________________________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________________________

The share of any beneficiary who shall be under the age of (age) years shall
not be paid to such beneficiary but shall instead be held in trust to apply
to his/her use all the income thereof, and also such amounts of the
principal, even to the extent of all, as the trustees deem necessary or
suitable for the support, welfare, and education of such beneficiary; and
when he/she attains the age of (age) years, to pay him/her the remaining
principal, if any.  If any beneficiary for whom a share is held in trust
should die before having received all the principal thereof, then upon
his/her death the remaining principal shall be paid to his/her then living
child or children, equally if more than one, and in default thereof, to the
then living descendants of the grantors, per stirpes.  No interest hereunder
shall be transferrable or assignable by any beneficiary, or be subject during
his or her life to the claims of his or her creditors.  Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the trusts hereunder shall terminate not
later than twenty-one (21) years after the death of the last beneficiary name
herein.

3. Revocation and Amendment: The grantors, or the survivor of them, may, by
signed instrument delivered to the trustees, revoke the trusts hereunder, in
whole or in part, or amend this Agreement from time to time in any manner.

4. Successor Trustees: In the event of the death or incapacity of both co-
trustees, we hereby nominate and appoint as successor trustee (name) and
(address).  In the event the successor trustee does not serve we appoint
whomever shall at the time be the first designated beneficiary hereunder. 
The trustees and their successors shall serve without bond.

5. Trustees' Acceptance: This trust has been accepted by trustees and will
be administered in the State of state and its validity, construction, and
all rights thereunder shall be governed by the laws of that state.

In Witness Whereof, grantors and trustees have executed this Agreement on
the date above written.

                      SOME GENERAL OBSERVATIONS


The legal process, because of its unbridled growth, has become a cancer which
threatens the vitality of our forms of capitalism and democracy.

                                 Lawrence Silberman, U.S. Attorney General

 ... the harsh truth is that ... we may well be on our way to a society
overrun by hordes of lawyers, hungry as locusts, and brigades of judges in
numbers never before contemplated.

                        - Chief Justice of the United States Warren Burger

The legal trade is nothing but a high class racket.

                                                   - Professor Fred Rodell

I do not wish to speak ill of any man behind his back, but the fact is that
he is an attorney.
                                                          - Samuel Johnson

People say law, but they mean wealth.
                                                     - Ralph Waldo Emerson

All sorts of substitute for wisdom are used by the world.  When the court
doesn't know, they use precedent.  The court that made the precedent guessed
at it.  Yesterday's guess, grown gray and wearing a big wig becomes today's
justice.
                                                         - Dr. Frank Crane

A lawyer is a learned gentleman who rescues your estate from your enemies
and keeps it for himself.
                                                           - Lord Brougham

It is the trade of lawyers to question everything, yield nothing, and to talk
by the hour.
                                                        - Thomas Jefferson

He saw a lawyer killing a viper on a dunghill hard by his own stable;
And the Devil smiled, for it put him in mind Of Cain and his brother Able.

                                                               - Coleridge

Lawyers are the only persons in whom ignorance of the law is not punished.

                                                          - Jeremy Bentham

The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.

                                              - Shakespeare, King Henry VI

The virtuous need but few laws; for it is not the law which determines their
actions, but their actions which determine the law.

                                                            - Theophrastus

Where you find the laws most numerous, there you will find also the greatest
injustice.

The more corrupt the state, the more numerous the laws.

"...ours is a sick profession marked by incompetence, lack of training,
misconduct and bad manners.  Ineptness, bungling, malpractice, and bad ethics
can be observed in court houses all over this country every day.  (...these
incompetents have) a seeming unawareness of the fundamental ethics of the
profession.

                               WHY A TRUST?

Why create a living trust?  Isn't that something that's only done by rich
people?  Can the average citizen create his/her own living trust without the
help of a lawyer?  Why not just pay a lawyer to write a simple will?

There are a number of reasons and answers to these simple questions.

First, you should know that you have EVERY LEGAL RIGHT to create your own
living trust by yourself, without the help of a lawyer.

In the second place, when you hire a lawyer to write a will, they don't do
it anyway.  Their Legal Secretary does the job and you end up paying an
exorbitant legal fee.

Further, these secretaries really won't do anything more than fill in some
blank spaces on a pre-designed word processing form and print it double-
spaced with numbered lines.  This type of printed output looks profession,
impressive, and expensive -- that's really what you are paying for.  They
follow the same process for divorces, annulments, legal separations,
bankruptcies, creditor plans, simple contracts, real estate deals, and so
on, ad nauseam.

Most of the work done by legal secretaries or paralegals is nothing more that
filling in the blanks.  What the majority of the legal profession doesn't
want you to know is that anyone, YES!, ANYONE!, can do what they do.

It is my honest opinion that the legal profession is in a sad state of
affairs.  Any document drawn up by one lawyer will be challenged by another
lawyer if he is paid to do so.  No matter how correct or exact it is, some
other lawyer will find fault with it if there is a fee to be made.  It is
the business of lawyers to make things so complicated that they cannot be
understood.  Lawyers are not paid to fix things or fight for justice, they
are paid to argue, confuse, obfuscate, and prolong.  They get paid for
keeping things from happening.  This is only one of the many reasons why
simple trials that should only take hours to decide normally take weeks,
months, and sometimes years.

That, in a nutshell, is the reason for this package of SHAREWARE SOFTWARE. 
You DON'T NEED a high priced (and perhaps incompetent) lawyer to do something
that you can do yourself.  Anyone with a computer and a word processor or
text editor can use these pre-designed trust forms to create their own Living
Revocable Trust.

                  REASONS FOR CREATING A LIVING TRUST

That brings us to the answers to the questions of why a person should form
a trust instead of writing a will.  The reasons are numerous and important. 

Before starting, you should have a firm understanding of what a will is and
what a trust is.  The differences between them are vast.

                              - WILLS -

A WILL is a legal instrument executed by any competent person according to
the prescribed statutes of the state.  Using this instrument the person
states their desired disposition of their property which will take effect on
and after their death.

The existence of a will automatically means that there will be lawyers,
judges, and the court system involved when a person dies.  Because wills must
be "probated", there will be legal fees, the court may interpret the will as
it sees fit, and the wishes of the deceased are not necessarily followed.

When a will goes to Probate Court, not only does it get bogged down in the
mire of the ineffective, inefficient, cumbersome, and expensive probate
system, it also becomes a matter of public record.  Additionally, it could
conceivably be challenged by a lawsuit.

                             - TRUSTS -

A TRUST is a legal relationship in which one person transfers property of a
second person for the benefit of a third person.  The person creating the
trust is the Grantor.  The person having legal title to the trust property
is the Trustee.  The person for whose benefit the trust is created is the
Beneficiary.  The nifty, magical part of this arrangement is that one person
can be a Grantor, Trustee, and Beneficiary all at the same time.

Using a trust, an individual can transfer property from their personal name
to themselves as a Trustee of a trust.  As the Trustee, they can hold the
property for themselves or for someone else.  Under the instructions of a
Revocable Living Trust, the Trustee (or Co-Trustees) can see to it that when
the Grantor dies all trust property is transferred to the beneficiary or
beneficiaries.  When the Grantor dies, the trust property automatically is
held by any Co-Trustee or Successor Trustee for the benefit of the
beneficiary.  All of this is accomplished WITHOUT any probate process or any
other type of court proceedings.  You don't need to be wealthy to take
advantage of this either.  If you only own your home or automobiles, you can
use a trust to make sure that when you die everything automatically transfers
to anyone you wish.

A Revocable Living Trust is the answer to almost all of the horrible problems
that can be encountered by Probate Court.  It can be entered easily at little
cost and it can be revoked by the stroke of a pen.

                        ADVANTAGES OF A TRUST

The most obvious advantages of a Revocable Living Trust are:

     o  Avoidance of probate and probate administration fees and expenses.
     o  Avoidance of excessive probate legal fees.
     o  Avoidance of unnecessary delays.
     o  Avoiding publicity concerning probate matters.
     o  Avoiding ancillary (secondary) administration.
     o  Avoiding statutory restrictions on bequests of property.
     o  Avoiding inheritance taxes.
     o  Avoiding will contests.
     o  Property management.
     o  Management uninterrupted by the incapacity of the grantor.
     o  Uninterrupted income and access to principal for family
        beneficiaries.
     o  Avoiding the emotional trauma, aggravation, and frustration
        of dealing with a complicated probate process and overpaid
        lawyers.

                        THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW

                 A Trust Takes Precedence Over a Will!

It is imperative that you carefully read and understand the following
sentence.  A TRUST TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER A WILL.  Even if you have a will
leaving specific property to a person and later create a trust transferring
the same property to a different person, the trust takes precedence and the
property will go to the person named in the trust.

                          Community Property

If community property is to be placed into a trust, it is important that both
spouses join in the creation of the trust as both grantors and co-trustees.

                              Exhibit A
                  (An Easy Way to Alter the Trust)

Property may be transferred using a trust by means of an "Exhibit A".  This
is a separate page attached to the trust, but referred to in the trust
agreement.  If you decide to change anything in the trust property at a later
time, you only need to change "Exhibit A".  You don't need to alter the trust
agreement.

All property transferred to the trust must be listed in Exhibit A.  You
should be aware of some special information concerning the property
transferred to the trust and the methods involved:

     o  Real estate can be transferred to a trust.
     o  Bank accounts and Saving & Loan accounts can be
        transferred to a trust.
     o  Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds can be transferred
        to a trust.
     o  Insurance policies can be transferred to a trust.
     o  Automobiles, motorcycles, trailers, motor homes,
        and similar types of vehicles can be transferred
        to a trust.

                              Real Property

Real property included in a trust should be recorded with the names of the
trustees of the trust.  Normally, this means filing a "Quit Claim" deed on
the property changing the name of the owners of the property.  This usually
is done at the County Recorder's Office.  The new deed should be similar to:
          John Doe and Jane Doe, as Trustees under Revocable
          Living Trust Agreement dated January 1, 1990

You should contact your County Recorder's Office for specific information. 
Quit claim deeds may be obtained at stationary stores or at local real estate
offices.

                              Bank Accounts

Bank accounts and Saving & Loan accounts should be changed using the same
type of trust language.  It is suggested that you contact your bank, saving
& loan, or other financial institution to find out how they prefer it to be
done.  Some institutions require a copy of the trust agreement on file. 
Different businesses have different methods.

                                Vehicles

Automobiles, motorcycles, and any other similar types of vehicles should be
registered using the same trust language.  It is a good idea to check with
local, county, and state offices regarding their specific requirements
regarding transfer of vehicles to a trust.

                           Choice of a Trustee

You cannot be TOO CAREFUL When choosing a trustee, co-trustee, or successor
trustee.  It is suggested that an adult family member be selected.  DO NOT
CONSIDER a lawyer, trust officer, bank, or trust company for a trustee.  This
defeats the entire purpose and objective of the Revocable Living Trust.  It
is IMPERATIVE that a trustee be chosen who will expressly avoid the needless
expenses, delays, and inconvenience of court appointments.

                   THE REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST FORMS

The next part of this text will deal with the design and use of the Revocable
Living Trust forms included in this package.

These forms are not complex nor mysterious.  Each of the paragraphs in the
trust are discussed here to demonstrate to you how easy it is to create your
own Revocable Living Trust.

                        Identification Clause

The first clause identifies the Grantor, Trustee, Co-Trustee, Successor
Trustee, and Beneficiary or Beneficiaries.  Also stated is where they live
and where the trust is created.

                            Whereas Clause

The "Whereas Clause" simply states the grantor's specific intent.  This is
an essential element in a trust.  It identifies the property and states the
purpose of the agreement and the use and disposition of the property.

                      Transfer of Property Clause

The transfer of property (conveyance of property in legalese) is the key to
avoiding probate.  Because the property is transferred to a trustee, the
grantor DOES NOT OWN IT as a part of his estate.  Upon transfer, it becomes
the property of the trust.

               Disposition of Income and Principal Clause

As an American citizen, you have a right to direct exactly what is to happen
with the property during your lifetime and even after death.  You can either
use it yourself or give it to someone else.  If given to a minor, it can be
held until they reach the age of adulthood.

                    Revocation and Amendment Clause

Because you are the grantor of the trust and you have made it a "revocable"
living trust, you have the right to completely cancel the trust or change it
in any way you want at any time you want.

                        Successor Trustee Clause

When creating a trust, it is imperative that you have a trustee, a co-
trustee, or a successor trustee.  This person will hold title to all trust
property after the death of the grantor.  This preludes the necessity for a
court appointment and potentially saves the trust a vast expenditure of time
and money.

                      Trustee's Acceptance Clause

Creating a trust agreement means exactly that; there must be an AGREEMENT
between parties.  The selected trustee, co-trustee, or successor trustee must
sign the document indicating that they truly agree to the terms and
conditions set forth in it.

                              Signatures

All grantors and all trustees must sign the agreement.  Make sure everyone
understands exactly what the agreement says and does and that they are
willing to abide by its instructions.  

                              Exhibit "A"

This page (or pages) is a separate part of the trust.  It will identify
exactly and specifically the property that is being transferred to the trust.

          IMPORTANT! -- Make sure you use the legal description
          of any real estate to avoid any doubts about transfer
          of title to the property.  This information can usually
          be found on the title deed to the property.  It will
          also be recorded with the County Recorder.

                            THE TRUST FORMS 

FORM ONE -- Trust1.txt -- may be used by a married couple.  Both husband and
wife are grantors appointing themselves as co-trustees to the trust.  They
have use of the property for life.  After both of them die, trust property
is transferred to whomever they select as beneficiary.

FORM TWO -- Trust2.txt -- may be used by any adult.  The individual is the
grantor appointing himself/herself as trustee.  The grantor has use of the
property for life.  After he/she dies, trust property is transferred to
whomever is selected as beneficiary.

FORM THREE -- Trust3.txt -- may be used by any adult.  The individual is the
grantor appointing himself/herself and a third party as co-trustees.  The
grantor has use of the property for life.  After he/she dies, trust property
is transferred to whomever is selected as beneficiary.

FORM FOUR -- Trust4.txt -- may be used by any adult.  The individual is the
grantor appointing a third party as trustee.  The grantor has use of the
property for life.  After he/she dies, trust property is transferred to
whomever is selected as beneficiary.

FORM FIVE -- Trust5.txt -- is used to revoke a Living Trust Agreement.  This
may be done by the grantor(s) at any time for any reason.

FORM SIX -- Trust6.txt -- is an IRREVOCABLE TRUST AGREEMENT.  This document
may be used by any adult to create a trust that CANNOT BE REVOKED OR CHANGED.

When this form is used, the transaction of the trust agreement is FINAL!  
In addition to having some tax advantages, it has most of the advantages of
the Revocable Living Trust.  This trust can be used for the purpose of gifts,
especially to minors.  Assets in this type of trust will avoid the probate
system, estate taxes in some circumstances, income taxes for the grantor, and
the trustee can retain management of the trust property for the beneficiaries
if necessary.

                            ADDITIONAL FORMS


ESTATE.TXT -- Estate summary sheet.  This document gathers pertinent
information concerning family members and financial status.  When completed
properly, it gives a good idea about the complete pecuniary value of an
estate.  Very often, the value of an estate is not realized until everything
in the trust is accumulated and totaled.  It is usually a surprise to people
to find out what their estate is actually worth.


NOTES.TXT -- Although this checklist is not an exhaustive, comprehensive
document that will remind you of everything that you will need to know and
do in the event of a death in your family, it provides a very good foundation
of information that you can build on depending on your individual needs.

LASTWILL.TXT -- This generic "Last Will and Testament" form may be modified
to indicate any special wishes of a person to be followed upon their death. 
Although a trust takes precedence over a will, this is a good way to bequeath
any special personal items to a loved one.  It also helps to preclude the
necessity for any probate process whatsoever, since all of the important and
valuable property has already been placed in a trust and the only things left
for disposition through a will usually are of small value.


PWRATTNY.TXT -- has nothing to do with trusts.

The "Durable Power of Attorney" form is provided for anyone interested in
precluding the possibility of being kept alive artificially or against their
will if they are suffering from a disease, illness, or debilitating brain
damage.

This form may be used to designate a trusted person to serve as "attorney-
in-fact" solely for the purpose of making medical decisions if the designator
becomes incapable of making those decisions.

This form should ONLY BE USED after the designator has given careful
consideration to the possibility that they might become incapacitated and
could be kept alive by artificial means.


LVNGWILL.TXT -- has nothing to do with trusts.

The "Living Will" is a special form similar in nature to the Durable Power
of Attorney.

It may be used by anyone interested in precluding the possibility of being
kept alive artificially or against their will if they are suffering from a
disease, illness, or debilitating brain damage.

                             +----------+
                             |  NOTICE  |
                             +----------+

          Although the LIVING WILL and DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY
          seem to be very similar, they are, indeed, different.

          Because of the sometimes convoluted, confused, and
          baffling way the American court system works it is
          a VERY GOOD IDEA to have both a Living Will AND a
          Durable Power of Attorney in effect concurrently.
