Disk Title: Revelation Tutorial 2 of 2 (also 1554)                      
PC-SIG Version: S1                                                      
                                                                        
Program Title: Revelation Tutorial                                      
Author Version: 1.0                                                     
Author Registration: $30.00                                             
Special Requirements: None.                                             
                                                                        
This is a scriptural tutorial for anyone interested in exploring the    
Book of Revelations.  The author, a minister, offers a fresh perspective
of this work to those who have studied the Bible and a measured overview
to those with little or no background in Revelations.                   
                                                                        
Two methods of teaching are used.  One set of exercises provides        
familiarity with, and tests for, details of the scriptural references   
covered in the 25 lessons or `projects'.  Multiple-choice, fill-the-    
blanks, and yes/no quizzes test for knowledge of such items as `How     
many...?', `Who...?' and `What...?'.  Details are referenced            
scripturally and at several points in the program, the current material 
is summarized.  At the end of the second disk, a comprehensive self-test
is provided.  The othe set of lessons explores the meanings behind the  
details.  Interpretive exercises are designed to aid insight to the     
references and symbols used throughout the book.                        
                                                                        
The author has used "The New International Version" of the Bible as the 
source document for the 2-disk tutorial.  Most of the lessons can be    
completed in an hour or less but some do run longer.  Provision has been
made to permit the user to leave the tutorial and reenter, at the same  
point, at a later time.
