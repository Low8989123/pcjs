## Information about "REMINDERS"

    Completely menu-driven, REMINDERS is a perpetual calendar, coupled with
    a tickler file for reminding you of important activities and dates.  All
    date reminders are organized on a month and day of date basis: enter a
    date for a birthday, anniversary, or accounting deadline once, and that
    date reminder is shown on the correct day of the month, year after year.
    
    Ten codes are used to group reminders under specific headings such as
    holiday, birthday, meeting, deadline, etc.  REMINDERS can be displayed
    or listed to the printer by date, code, date range, code and date range,
    or in summary form, and calendar format, for any one month.  REMINDERS
    is ideal for newsletters, clubs, groups, organizations, or use as a
    personal appointment/activity calendar.
