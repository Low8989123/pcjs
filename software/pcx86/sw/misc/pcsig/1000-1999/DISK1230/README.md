## Information about "JOB COST"

    JOB COST was made for the person who is responsible for monitoring and
    keeping costs under control on complex, expensive projects.
    
    With this system you can:
    
    ~ Set up multiple jobs each with its own unique set of cost centers
    ~ Establish budget controls for each cost center for labor, material,
    and other expenses
    
    ~ Edit and post transaction cost items to each cost center
    
    ~ Post estimates of percent completions for each budget item
    
    ~ Set up budgets for up to 99 unique change orders per job
    
    JOB COST then provides you with cost variances, projected profit/loss at
    the detail budget level, cost center level, and total job. As expenses
    are posted, the overall job status is updated keeping you informed of
    balance of funds available and projected profit/loss for the job's
    original estimate and change orders. You are provided concise reports
    for distribution to your client, foreman, and sub-contractors.
    
    At the end of the job, after all reporting has been performed, you can
    back up the completed job to a floppy disk for storage, delete the job
    from your active job database, and if necessary restore the job from
    backup for recording additional cost information after job was
    completed. New jobs can be set up from existing job formats, requiring
    only the entering of the new job's unique budget information.
    
    All functions are menu driven with on-screen help.
