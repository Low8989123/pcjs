## Information about "LOTTO-MAGIC"

    Track your state lottery and watch your computer calculate the next most
    likely winning numbers, generate random numbers or compute your lucky
    numbers based on astrological information.
    
    The astrological option uses today's date and your birthdate to compute
    your lucky numbers, according to the stars. This is not a random number
    generator and your numbers will change from day to day.
    
    Random picks are just that. Numbers generated at random. Many
    subroutines have been included to ensure a well-randomized output.
    
    The scientific calculations are compiled by analyzing existing data of
    past winners.  As each lottery occurs, enter that information into your
    lottery database.  LOTTO-MAGIC will work with any lottery using from two
    to six numbers and will track up to five different games
    simultaneously.
