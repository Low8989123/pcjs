## Information about "PC-CHART EGA VERSION (HGC & CGA ON 1436)"

    Bullish on the market?  Or bearish?  This program will help you decide!
    
    PC-CHART brings you a comprehensive set of technical analysis tools to
    help you decide when to buy and sell stocks and commodities.
    Mathematical algorithms help you determine what action to take.  The
    spreadsheet-like interface permits easy editing and manual updating of
    up to 400 price files.  For anyone who prefers automatic updating,
    PC-CHART lets you use HAV-INFO, a low-cost data vendor to get price
    updates via modem.
    
    The analysis section permits use of price/volume, relative strength,
    moving averages, parabolic system, logarithmic plot, point and figure,
    stochastics, weekly charts, monthly charts, on-balance volume, money
    flow and other parameters.  Menus and a 52-page user guide on disk help
    you get started.

                          Instructions

                 To install on hard disk system,

1.  Place System Disk in Drive A.

c:\>md chart
c:\>cd chart
c:\chart>copy a:*.*

2.  Place Data Disk in Drive A.

c:\chart>copy a:*.*

                To install on two floppy disks

1.  Format two 360K diskettes.

2.  Put system disk in drive A, type:

A>install

                   To print out stock charts

1.  Type <p> or <P> to get a hardcopy of the charts on the
    screen.

                      Communication Tips

FOR HAV-INFO & GEnie 

Since DOS does not accept a period as a valid character in
a filename, substitute a underscore in stock symbols.

For example:  Wall Street Journal lists Fst Interst A as:

              stock symbol = I.A
              substitute I_A

Dial/Data

When typing in commodity symbols add a two to the end. 

For example: The proper symbol for the September Standard & Poors
500 stock index future is SA0989. Add a two to the end to get SA09892.
The program will delete the two when it communicates with Dial/Data.

Other commodity futures and options have different conversion factors 
refer to Dial/Data documentation to get the the proper conversion
factor.

    SUMMARY OF GRAPHICS.COM REPLACEMENT ROUTINES (Revised 01-22-90)
                        by Gene Quong

To print stock or commodity charts to any printer that supports
graphics, such as a dot matrix printer, you should first try pressing
<p> or <P> when a particular stock in shown on the screen.  We
currently support Epson FX-80 compatible dot matrix printers.  The
specific model that we use to print stock charts is an Epson FX-80.
In the near future we intend to add support for additional printer.

The second avenue which you may pursue is the DOS external  command
file, GRAPHICS.COM which is on the DOS system diskette that came with
your computer.  If you type GRAPHICS at the DOS prompt before running
the chart program this will make a graphics routine resident in memory that
enables the Shift-PrintScreen key command to send graphics to the printer.
Ordinarily, the Shift-PrtSc combination will only print out ASCII
characters.  The GRAPHICS.COM program currently only supports CGA,
EGA, and VGA video cards.  IT DOES NOT SUPPORT HERCULES GRAPHICS
CARDS.

In case GRAPHICS.COM does not work for your particular monitor and
printer combination, we are including on this distribution diskette
some shareware and public domain programs.

Each of the enclosed P.D. programs makes itself resident in memory
so you should reboot your system with Ctrl-Alt-Del before loading
and trying a new program.  The programs enclosed are:

CITOH.COM           HERCTOSH.COM        MLPS.COM

EP2GEM.COM
"Modifies the vertical spacing on a Gemini printer to eliminate blank
lines when used with a graphics program designed to output to an Epson."
Makes highly elliptical chartwheels appear circular.  May also eliminate
double-spacing encountered on other program printouts sent to a Gemini
10 printer.

"Replacement for GRAPHICS.COM for the Epson FX-80 and FX-100 printers.
The program remains resident in memory to be activated with the
Shift-PrtSc keys."

GEM10GRF.COM
"The GRAPHICS.COM program has been edited to support the GEMINI-10
printers using the CGA interface.  The default GRAPHICS.COM supplied
with MS-DOS causes a venetian blind effect on copied images.  This
edit replaces the graphics header for proper printer setup on the

--------------------------------
GRAFTRAX.COM
This program works with Epson MX printers with the GRAFTRAX 80 option.
It is also supposed to work with older non-Epson-compatible Star printers.

"If you print the screen in GRAPHICS-mode, a LEFT SHIFT PrtSc will
print the screen LARGE--filling nearly an 8 1/2 x 11 page--and then
insert carriage returns to restore Top Of Form relative to where it
started.  If you do a RIGHT SHIFT PrtSc, the screen is printed about 5
1/4  x  2  3/4 inches. No TOF reset is made, and multiple screen prints
will be contiguous.

"In either graphics print mode, you can abort printing by hitting
the ESC key.  This can be used to suppress the carriage returns at the
end of the large screen print, for instance.  You cannot abort a screen
print in text mode, however, since it is your IBM ROM routine."

LASERJET.EXE
This utility will enable you to print the contents of your IBM PC or
PC/XT display screen to the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer.

The utility is designed to work with a CGA card.  An EGA card will
produce an elliptical chartwheel.

The following commands must be in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to help
insure proper execution of the print screen utility:

MODE COM1:9600,N,8,1,P
MODE LPT1:=COM1
LASERJET A

Reboot your computer to automatically execute the commands in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file and load the print screen utility into memory.

Replace the 'LASERJET A' command with 'THINKJET' to use the THINKJET.EXE
driver instead.  Both drivers work on the HP LaserJet with the difference
that THINKJET.EXE produces a larger chartwheel.

Although not required, several printing options are available with the
utility.  If you wish to use any of the following options, they must be
entered within five seconds after pressing the 'Shift' and 'PrtSc'keys.
Only one option from each group (orientation, print position and paper
ejection) may be selected.  The printing process will begin five seconds
after the last key is pressed.

Group           Key            Option
-----           ---            ------
Orientation     * P       Portrait (LaserJet only)
                  L       Landscape (LaserJet only)

Print Position  * T       Top half of page
                  M       Middle of page
                  B       Bottom half of page

Paper Ejection  * Y       Form feed at end of print
                  N       No form feed at end of print

         * indicates default value

OKIDMP.COM
"Run OKIDUMP once at boot time to install it and then whenever you hit
<R>ight Shift PrtSc you'll get a small graphics dump to your OKIDATA
printer. Hit <L>eft Shift PrtSc and you'll get a larger printout rotated
90 degrees. This routine is invisible to normal text screen dumps."
Known to work on an OKI 84 printer.



--------------------------------
OKIDUMP.COM
Simply run OKIDUMP as you would GRAPHICS.COM (see the DOS manual).
It acts just like GRAPHICS.COM for OKIDATA printers (without plug'n'play).

Author: unknown
--------------------------------

OKIPRTSC.COM
This program "replaces the GRAPHICS.COM program supplied as part of the
IBM PC-DOS operating system (an External DOS command).  It provides
both text and graphics capabilities for IBM PC owners who have a color
graphics adapter and an Okidata 84/92/93 printer (without the Plug-N-Play
option).

"In graphics mode, 320 x 200 medium resolution pictures are shown with
varying shades of gray to represent the colors on the screen. A 640 x
200 graphics image is shown simply in black & white, the same as it
appears on the screen.

"Additionally, in graphics mode, [OKIPRTSC] automatically places the
picture in the middle of the page (no need to move the tractors or roll
the platen to get the picture centered on the page)."
