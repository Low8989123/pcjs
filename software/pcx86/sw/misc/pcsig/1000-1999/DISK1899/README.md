## Information about "DFM"

    Here's a DOS shell that gives you more than filenames and key
    commands. You can now include an English description with a file and
    DFM will keep track of it for you, even if you copy the file or change
    its name. The added description is very useful for remembering what is
    really in a file, yet does not get in the way of quick command
    operation from the DFM shell.
    
    DFM provides easy-to-remember single keystroke activities for the most
    common file maintenance operations (editing, copying, renaming,
    printing, and deleting), as well as providing convenient features that
    cannot be found in many similar directory management tools.  No longer
    will you fight through hard-to-understand DOS manuals trying to find
    the syntax of a command -- just point to a file and your operation is
    only a single key away!
