## Information about "D-ACCESS"

    D-ACCESS provides access to all the functions available in the IBM DOS
    and BIOS, access to the I/O ports including the mouse and direct memory
    operations, all from FORTRAN.  No longer are you restricted to the
    functions provided by the FORTRAN compiler.  Use as high level or as low
    level a function as you need.
    
    D-ACCESS is a set of interface modules which you can call from within
    FORTRAN with the appropriate parameters.  In most cases these parameters
    are 8086/80286 register values.  The modules in turn call DOS, BIOS or
    the mouse driver, or perform direct I/O or memory operations.
    Applications where D-ACCESS will be extremely valuable include graphics
    programs, database programs, sound programs, mouse based user interface
    programs, communication programs, and printer oriented utilities.
    
    Since effective use of DOS, BIOS, I/O, mouse or direct memory requires
    some knowledge of the 8086 family of CPUs, the IBM PC microcomputer
    family architectures, PC-DOS (or MS-DOS), BIOS and the mouse driver
    MOUSE.SYS, this program includes a recommended reading list for the
    serious programmer.

                                  I.  INTRODUCTION

          D-ACCESS, provides access to all the functions available in the IBM
     DOS and BIOS, access to the I/O ports including the mouse and direct
     memory operations, all from FORTRAN.  The possibilities presented to the
     IBM PC FORTRAN programmer by D-ACCESS are limitless.  He is no longer
     restricted to the functions provided by the FORTRAN compiler.  He has the
     freedom to use as high level or as low level a function as he sees
     appropriate.  It is good programming practice, however, to use the highest
     level function available.  First choice is the FORTRAN compiler, second is
     DOS, third is BIOS and then come direct I/O and memory operations.  For
     portability, it makes sense to avoid direct access of I/O and memory.
     BIOS can help you do that in most cases, by providing a nice set of
     functions.

          D-ACCESS is a set of interface modules which you can call from within
     FORTRAN with the appropriate parameters.  In most cases these parameters
     are 8086/80286 register values.  The modules in turn call DOS, BIOS or the
     mouse driver, or perform direct I/O or memory operations.  Applications
     where D-Access will be extremely valuable include Graphics Programs
     (typically using BIOS), Data Base Programs (typically using DOS), Sound
     Programs (typically using I/O operations), Mouse Based User Interface
     Programs (typically using the mouse module), Communication Programs
     (typically using BIOS), Printer oriented utilities (typically using BIOS),
     etc.  The possibilities are endless.  Our Olympic Software DPLOT, for
     example, makes an extensive use of BIOS.

          Effective use of DOS, BIOS, I/O, mouse or direct memory in a FORTRAN
     program (or any type of program) requires, however, some knowledge of the
     8086 family of CPUs, the IBM PC microcomputer family architectures, PC-DOS
     (or MS-DOS), BIOS and the mouse driver MOUSE.SYS.  The books referenced in
     section III have been found to be excellent for the library of the serious
     programmer.  They are available in most general bookstores, computer
     specialty stores, or University bookstores.

          D-ACCESS consists of 24 interface modules in 6 groups:
               1.  FORTRAN-DOS Interface Modules
               2.  FORTRAN-BIOS Interface Modules
               3.  FORTRAN-I/O Interface Modules
               4.  FORTRAN-MOUSE Interface Module
               5.  FORTRAN-Memory Interface Modules
               6.  Miscellaneous Modules

     This document is organized in four parts.  Part I is the introduction,
     Part II is a description of the contents on this disk, Part III is a
     detailed description of the interface modules, and Part IV is the
     reference section.

          If you have a copy of D-ACCESS library and you are not registered,
     please register now, by sending $25.00 to our address, with your name and
     address.  Being registered brings benefits:  a) You become notified of
     changes, updates, tips, etc.  b) You can participate with your ideas for
     exciting future upgrades, applications, etc.













          Finally, we would like to note that your opinions count; we urge you
     to write to us with any concerns, problems, suggestions for the next
     update, etc.

                                 II.  DISK CONTENTS

          The files included on the D-ACCESS disk are as follows:

          1.  DACCESS.LIB:  A library containing the 24 interface modules used
     by Microsoft MSFOR (up to version 5.0) FORTRAN programs.
          2.  DACCESS.TXT:  This document
          3.  Source code for a number of FORTRAN programs, provided as

               Description of parameters:  Upon return ISEG, IOFF contain the
     address (Segment:Offset) of character variable CVAR.  ISEG should be
     INTEGER*4, others INTEGER*2.

               Example program:  RFAT.FOR

     (IOP=1), or IARG2.OR.IARG3 (IOP=2), or IARG2.XOR.IARG3 (IOP=3), or
     NOT(IARG2).  All parameters are INTEGER*2.

               Example program:  TSLOG.FOR, STIMER.FOR


          D.   RAN

               Module function:  Random Number Generator, functionally
     equivalent to that found in VAX/VMS minicomputers.

               Calling statement:  X=RAN(ISEED)












               Description of parameters:  X is a real number (0.0 to 1.0).
     ISEED is the seed, INTEGER*4.

               Example program:  TRAN.FOR


          E.   SDRAN

               Module function:  Used internally by RAN to update the seed

               Calling statement:  CALL SDRAN(ISEED)

               Description of parameters:  ISEED is the seed, INTEGER*4


          F.   RANDU

               Module function:  Random number generator (yes, it is
     functionally equivalent to the classic RANDU).

               Calling statement:  CALL RANDU(X,ISEED)

               Description of parameters:  X is a real number (0.0 to 1.0).
     ISEED is the seed, INTEGER*4.

               Example program:  TRANDU.FOR


          G.   SDRDU

               Module function:  Used internally by RANDU to update the seed

               Calling statement:  CALL SDRDU(ISEED)

               Description of parameters:  ISEED is the seed, INTEGER*4

Special Requirements: FORTRAN compiler.                                 
                                                                        
D-ACCESS provides access to all the functions available in the IBM DOS  
and BIOS, access to the I/O ports including the mouse and direct memory 
operations, all from FORTRAN.  No longer are you restricted to the      
functions provided by the FORTRAN compiler.  Use as high level or as low
level a function as you need.                                           
                                                                        
D-ACCESS is a set of interface modules which you can call from within   
FORTRAN with the appropriate parameters.  In most cases these parameters
are 8086/80286 register values.  The modules in turn call DOS, BIOS or  
the mouse driver, or perform direct I/O or memory operations.           
Applications where D-ACCESS will be extremely valuable include graphics 
programs, database programs, sound programs, mouse based user interface 
programs, communication programs, and printer oriented utilities.       
                                                                        
Since effective use of DOS, BIOS, I/O, mouse or direct memory requires  
some knowledge of the 8086 family of CPUs, the IBM PC microcomputer     
family architectures, PC-DOS (or MS-DOS), BIOS and the mouse driver     
MOUSE.SYS, this program includes a recommended reading list for the     
serious programmer.
