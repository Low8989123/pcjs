## Information about "CASINO SLOT MACHINES"

    Here are three slot machine simulations for the casino lover.  Besides a
    basic slot machine that matches dollar amounts three accross for your
    pay-off, there are also slot versions of keno and low-ball poker.  These
    games would be ideal for someone planning their own casino night.  While
    the ASCII graphics don't compare to the video slots you find in the
    casinos, the action is very much the same.  And if you play long enough
    you might find these slots are a little loose... but we all like a
    loose slot, don't we?

This disk consists of three Casino type Slot Machines.  The odds differ on each,
but are in general fairly liberal, as far as these things go. At any rate, your
Computer, being a friend to you and trying to make up for all the aggravation
it has inadvertently caused, doesn't expect to collect on the spot. It will
probably just wait for something to crash and then expect you to ante up.
 
SLOT.EXE is a three wheel machine with 94 dollar values (called Lucky Bucks)
         represented on each wheel. The break down for each wheel is as follows:
 
                         One dollar           = 30 Slots
                         Five dollar          = 20 Slots
                         Ten dollar           = 15 Slots
                         Twenty dollar        = 10 Slots
                         Fifty dollar         =  8  Slots
                         One hundred dollar   =  6 Slots
                         Five hundred dollar  =  4 Slots
                         One thousand dollar  =  1 Slot
 
         The object is to match the same dollar amounts on each wheel. The
         Pay Off is the total of the dollar amounts of the three wheels.
 
KENO.EXE is a keno slot machine where you select seven different numbers and
         the computer then randomly selects 21 numbers and tracks the number
         of "Hits" your selection produces and pays according to the posted
         ODDS.
 
LOW-BALL.EXE is a Casino Poker Slot Machine that plays Low Ball Poker. By
         selecting which card you wish to retain and which you want replaced,
         you try to get a hand that has a high card of ten or lower for the
         Pay Off.
 
If you find any of these games of interest to you, and worth keeping, a
registration fee of $ 10 would be appreciated. Remit to the following
address:
