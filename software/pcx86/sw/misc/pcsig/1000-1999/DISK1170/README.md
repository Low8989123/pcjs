## Information about "SAGEWORDS"

    SAGEWORDS is a sophisticated and powerful wordprocessor whose advanced
    features may take some time to learn.  However, for simple text entry,
    you are up and running as soon as you type SW.
    
    The main menu choices are file, window, text, block, goto, search,
    options, and SageWords.  Each of these has a pull-down submenu.  File,
    for instance, has open, close, save, write to, print, get info, and
    quit.  Many of the choices and options can be operated intuitively, and
    under the SageWords selection there is a help file which explains
    everything you may not be able to figure out yourself.  There are also
    extensive instructions in the SW.BIN file.
    
    This wordprocessor has a lot going for it.  It can be used with ease for
    light-weight wordprocessing, and, with a little more time spent
    learning the commands and features, it can perform feats matching high-
    end products.
