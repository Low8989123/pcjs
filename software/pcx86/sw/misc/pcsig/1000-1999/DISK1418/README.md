## Information about "SLIDE.PC"

    SLIDE.PC gives shutterbugs an efficient way to print caption information
    on labels to identify slides and photos, and at the same time store the
    information to disk for exporting to a database or spreadsheet.
    
    Besides the printed label information, the program lets you include tech
    notes and comments in the data file.  The data file format is compatible
    with Quattro, Lotus 1-2-3, dBase III, PC-File, and several other popular
    databases.  The data file can also be converted to ASCII text format to
    export into any wordprocessor.  You can then print a complete catalog of
    your photo collection.  Because each slide entry takes up one long line,
    you need to use a wide carriage printer in condensed font, or a standard
    dot matrix printer using a sideways-printing utility.
    
    The menu-driven program prints 7/16" by 1-7/8" pin-feed labels.  A
    thoughtful routine helps you line up the labels before you execute the
    print function.
