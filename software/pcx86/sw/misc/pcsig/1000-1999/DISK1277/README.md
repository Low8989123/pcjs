## Information about "PC MECHANIC"

    Whether you run a hotel or heavy equipment yard, PC MECHANIC will
    insure that preventive maintenance for your company is properly
    handled.
    
    This integrated preventive maintenance system outperforms many programs
    costing several thousand dollars, and will serve the needs of companies
    that process up to 200 work orders every day. It consists of five
    interactive modules: the inventory system, work order system, preventive
    maintenance system, equipment database, and employee database systems.
    The inventory system tracks vendors, helps prevent parts shrinkage, cuts
    down on overstocking and helps make sure you have what you need when you
    need it. The system remembers what you paid for parts and adds that
    amount to the cost files on each job and piece of equipment.
    
    The preventive maintenance system insures that vital maintenance is done
    in a timely manner and keeps track of who does the servicing. Work
    orders are printed along with schedules and work assignments. If
    someone abuses or neglects equipment, the program crunches the labor and
    parts numbers to generate costs for all to see.
    
    PC MECHANIC lets you print daily or weekly reports showing what work was
    performed by who. List outstanding work orders and review them with
    respective trade supervisors and foremen. You get aging reports telling
    you where you stand on completing your work backlog.
    
    The employee database system stores basic information on employees and
    makes sure that performance reviews are done on time. It can print
    employee lists, alphabetically, including the ID numbers which are
    posted as part of preventive maintenance reports. It also lists workers
    by seniority.
    
    The extensive use of lookup windows in the various database modules
    makes searching for specific data easy and greatly reduces keyboard

that preventive maintenance for your company is properly handled.       
                                                                        
This integrated preventive maintenance system outperforms many programs 
costing several thousand dollars, and will serve the needs of companies 
that process up to 200 work orders every day.  It consists of           
three interactive modules: the inventory system, work order system, and 
maintenance manager.                                                    
                                                                        
The inventory system tracks vendors, helps prevent parts shrinkage, cuts
down on overstocking and helps make sure you have what you need when you
need it.  The system remembers what you paid for parts and adds that    
amount to the cost files on each job and piece of equipment.            
                                                                        
The work order system insures that vital maintenance is done in a timely
manner and keeps track of who does the servicing.  Work orders are      
printed along with schedules and work assignments.  If someone abuses or
neglects equipment, the program crunches the labor and parts numbers to 
generate costs for all to see.                                          
                                                                        
PC MECHANIC lets you print daily or weekly reports showing what work was
performed by who.  List outstanding work orders and review them with    
respective trade supervisors and foremen.  You get aging reports telling
you where you stand on completing your work backlog.  Because the       
inventory system interacts with the work order system, you'll know when 
not to schedule work because needed parts are back ordered.             
                                                                        
The maintenance manager stores basic information on employees and makes 
sure that performance reviews are done on time.  It can print employee  
lists, alphabetically, including the ID numbers which are posted as part
of preventive maintenance reports.  It also lists workers by seniority.
