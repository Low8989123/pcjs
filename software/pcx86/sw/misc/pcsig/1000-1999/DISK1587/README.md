## Information about "VGACAD 1 OF 3 (ALSO 1588, 2122)"

    VGACAD is an all-purpose graphics editor, image processor and paint
    program to create, enhance, or colorize digitized images.
    
    VGACAD provides 21 brush shapes with 5 different brush modes, normal,
    spray, air#1, air#2, and eraser. There are 256 color fills, border
    tracing, and pattern/gradient fills. Three modes of zoom editing are
    also available. Air#1 (airbrush) adds a color mixture as you paint
    over your picture, just like a real air brush. Air#2 mixes colors in
    more gradually. Spray, when used with the Mask feature, has the
    effect of placing a stencil over the painted area. Colorize grey
    images in the same way old movies are reborn in color. Cut and Paste
    functions are also fully supported.
    
    VGACAD provides several ways of altering the size and orientation of an
    image. Rotate the entire screen 90x or continue to 180x to turn it
    upside-down. Create a mirror image, or an upside-down mirror image, of
    any defined area.
    
    VGACAD supports .BLD, .PLT, .GIF and .CLP file formats. Utilities are
    provided to convert pictures to VGA from CGA and EGA, and from VGA to
    EGA. Also available is a VGA print utility that prints any viewable
    color picture in 7 user-selected grey shades. Shrink large-sized
    pictures. Edit large .GIF files (up tp 32K x 32K x 256).
    
    VGACAD has been used by such institutions as Lawrence Livermore Labs,
    the University of Pittsburgh, Warner Brothers, and the New York Times.

grey images in the same way old movies are reborn in color.  Three modes
of zoom editing are available.  Cut and Paste functions are also fully
supported.

VGACAD provides several ways of altering the size and image orientation.
Portrait will rotate the entire screen 90 degrees. Horizontal will
create a mirrow image of any defined area.  180 degrees will make any
defined area upside-down.  Vertical will create an upside-down mirror
image.

Four different file types are supported by VGACAD.  .BLD, or BLoaDable,
pictures supported by BASIC.  .PLT, or PaLeTte, also in a bloadable
format.  .GIF, CompuServe's Graphic Interchange Format.  .CLP are CLiP
art files.

VGACAD also provides utilities to convert pictures from CGA to VGA, from
EGA to VGA, and from VGA to EGA.  A VGA print utility is available that
prints any viewable color picture in 7 user selected grey shades.  You
can also shrink large size pictures.
