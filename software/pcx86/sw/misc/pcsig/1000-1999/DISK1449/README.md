## Information about "EZK-QUIZZER (FORMERLY PC-QUIZZER)"

    Since 1800, who are the only two brothers who have served in the Senate
    at the same time?  What is a hematophagouse?  What was the first X-rated
    film to win the Best Picture Oscar award?  What building is on the back
    of the five dollar bill?  Who cares?  EZK-QUIZZER does!
    
    EZK-QUIZZER is a computer trivia game that uses various subjects to get
    its questions.  Before answering a question, you are asked what category
    tickles your fancy and then you must answer the question before time
    runs out.  The categories range from television to mathematics, sports
    to history, and a potluck category where you never know what type of
    question will pop up.  There are three rounds of questions and each
    round gets harder, so the points given when you answer a question
    correctly get higher also.  After the first round, you can start to wage
    your points against the computer so hopefully by the end of the third
    round you have enough points to be in the Hall of Fame.
    
    By the way, this program is so good I hear Alex Trebek has it on his
    computer at home.
