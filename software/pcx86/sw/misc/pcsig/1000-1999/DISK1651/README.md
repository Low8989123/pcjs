## Information about "TECHNOJOCK'S TURBO TOOLKIT (1652 ALSO)"

    TechnoJock's Turbo Toolkit (TTT) is a comprehensive set of procedures
    and functions for Turbo Pascal and Quick Pascal programmers.  The
    Toolkit is designed for professional programmers, as well as newcomers
    to the Pascal programming environment.
    
    The main focus of the Toolkit is to give programs a polished and
    professional appearance.  There are routines providing:  formatted
    screen output, windows, many menu routines including pop-up and pull-
    down, form input procedures, string formatting, a Sidekick Plus style
    directory lister, and much more.  These units are compact and very easy
    to manipulate and implement.  The manual is clear and instructive.  All
    source is included.
    
    The abbreviated manual is included on disk (over 100 pages).
