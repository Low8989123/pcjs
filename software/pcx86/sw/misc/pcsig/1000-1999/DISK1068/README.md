## Information about "MICRO-GENE"

    Want to find out who (or what) is swinging by one hairy arm from the
    branches of your family tree? MICRO-GENE is a thorough, comprehensive,
    well-documented software package to help you develop your family
    genealogical record. In addition to the data-recording capabilities, it
    has excellent printing capabilities so you can get hierarchical charts
    of your ancestors and other quality reports. Menu function selections
    simplify the use of the system and lets you concentrate on the family
    data rather than system functions.
    
    Note that MICRO-GENE is a sophisticated, reasonably complex package and
    the quality of results you get are related to the level of energy
    expended in learning the program and acquiring data.
