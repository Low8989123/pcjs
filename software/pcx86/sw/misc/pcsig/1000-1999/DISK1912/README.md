## Information about "TV/VOAPUK AND CRAZYDOS"

    VOLAPUK is a combination practical joke and look-busy program.  Start
    the mock debugger and your memory is seemingly reconfigured, your hard
    disk is diagnosed, and all errors are cleared from existence -- in
    reality the screen messages are the only things that are changing.
    
    TV simulates the late-night movie "War of the Ants" (that's where the
    screen "fuzzes out" after the national anthem).  Then, when you press a
    key, the loudspeaker is silenced and the random pattern turns into a
    beautiful person with the message "Dear User, I Love You."  In a few
    seconds the dreamgirl/dreamboy vanishes, the "War of the Ants"
    continues.  Another keystroke takes you back to DOS.  The programs are
    self-testing against viruses for security.
    
    A wisecrack response for every DOS command, for your own entertainment
    or a practical joke.  CRAZYDOS is a temporary "replacement" for DOS with
    some interesting responses to commands.  There are some alarming looking
    "error messages," but don't worry, there are no aliens, molasses, or
    problems reading drive Q:.  All "system crashes," "Chinese keyboards,"
    etc., are imaginary and temporary, and can be ended by a keypress in
    some cases, or ENTER in others.  To exit CRAZYDOS you must tell your
    computer "I love you."

       TV simulates the late-night movie "War of the Ants". When you
       press a key, the loudspeaker is silenced and the random pattern
       turns into a beautiful person with the message "Dear User, I
       Love You." In a few seconds the dreamgirl/dreamboy vanishes.
       The War of the Ants continues. Another keystroke takes you back
       to DOS.

       USAGE

       TV (Return) to put the program on your friend's computer when
       he or she leaves the computer.

       TV X (Return) to put TV on his or her computer from AUTOEXEC.BAT
       without the opening screen.

       TV consists of two different programs: TV1 is a female computer.
