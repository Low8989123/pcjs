## Information about "ALGEBRAX"

    Cringe no more when menaced by that ominous-looking algebra problem!
    You now have ALGEBRAX to help you overcome your fear of mathematics.
    Some of the enhanced features in this package which are hard to find in
    other tutorials are:
    
    ~ Random generation of all problems -- you will never have the same
    problem twice
    
    ~ There are five levels of difficulty for each lesson plan with
    five questions at each level
    
    ~ After each correct answer, you will be branched to a more difficult
    problem
    
    ~ There are no multiple choice problems (sorry, no guessing)
    
    ~ Alternate answers are accepted.  Most programs will allow one correct
    answer only, but ALGEBRAX knows there are different ways to
    write mathematical solutions
    
    ~ When a wrong answer is given, ALGEBRAX will take you through the
    problem step-by-step
    
    ~ All lesson results are saved by the program and can be reviewed on
    screen or printer
    
    Most important of all, ALGEBRAX was written by a math professor with
    over 25 years of experience.

No longer do you need to cringe when you see that ominous-looking
algebra problem!  You now have ALGEBRAX to help you overcome that fear
of mathematics.

Some of the enhanced features you will find in this package that will be
hard to find in other tutorials are:

- All problems are randomly generated, you will never have the same
  problem twice

- There are five levels of difficulty for each lesson plan and each
  level of difficulty gives five questions

- After each correct answer, you will be branched to a more difficult
  problem

- There are no multiple choice problems (sorry, no guessing)

- Alternate answers are accepted.  Most programs will allow one correct
  answer only, but ALGEBRAX knows that there are differents ways to
  write mathematical solutions

- When a wrong answer is given, ALGEBRAX will take you through the
  problem step-by-step

- All lesson results are kept by the program and can be reviewed on
  screen or printer

Most important of all, ALGEBRAX has been written by a math professor
that has over 25 years of experience, which assures you that he knows
what type of questions need to be answered.
