## Information about "VIDEO LIBRARIAN"

    VIDEO LIBRARIAN is a menu-driven database for VCR (VHS/BETA) users who
    want to catalog their video cassette libraries.  VLB records 18 fields
    of information about each movie selection, performs powerful
    cross-referenced searches, and prints reports to the screen, printer or
    disk.
    
    You can find any title, star, co-star, director or tape number in the
    datafile which can hold up to 64,000 selections -- about 1000 on a 360K
    floppy. The program also lets you create and print professional-looking
    cassette labels to identify your nameless black boxes and keep your
    collection neatly organized. A tutorial helps you get started.

This screen allows you to (1) select one of four report types, (2) specify one
of three output devices for the report, (3) decide whether to list all of
the movies or just some of the movies in your file, and (4) decide how you
want your report sorted.

   A.  Tape labels      Prints out titles, starting counter number and time of
                        movie on 3 1/2 by 15/16 inch or custom lables.  Four
                        titles may be printed on regular labels.

   D.  Custom Report    You design this report.  You select the fields
                        and the length of the fields you want included in
                        your report.

2.  List To:

   A.  Screen           The report will be listed on your monitor screen.  The
                        large report cannot be listed to the screen.


   B.  Printer          The report will be listed to your printer.  All reports
                        can be listed to your printer.

   C.  Text File        If you select this item, you will be prompted for a
                        file name to store the listing on a disk file.  All
                        reports  can be listed to a text file.

3.  List:

   A.  All Movies      All movies in your library file will be listed to the
                       output device previously selected.

   B.  Some Movies     Only those movies that meet the selection criteria you
                       specify later on the MOVIE SELECTOR screen (Page 10)
                       will be listed to the output device selected.

4.  Sort By:

   A.  Title           Report will be listed sorted alphabetically by title.

   B.  Star            Report will be listed sorted alphabetically by the
                       star's last names.

   C.  Co-Star         Report will be listed sorted alphabetically by the
                       co-star's last names.

   D.  Director        Report will be listed sorted alphabetically by the
                       director's last names.

   E.  Tape #          Reported will be listed sorted alpha-numerically by
                       tape number.
*** Notes ***

1.  If you select (A) Tape labels for report type, you can only
    select (E) Tape # for sort by.

2.  The Large Report cannot be listed to the screen.

3.  Your selection for Sort By may be overridden if you have selected (B)
    List Some Movies.  If you selected List Some Movies, you will go to
    the MOVIE SELECTOR screen after completing the current screen.  If one
    of the fields you list to search on is a key field (ie  title, star, co-
    star, director or tape#), the first key field you list will become the
    default Sort By selection.  By doing this, the search of the library
    file is rapidly speeded up.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The MOVIE SELECTOR screen is displayed if you choose just to display some
movies from the SELECT REPORT TYPE LISTING screen or if you choose to create
a Sub-File from the UTILITY screen.  The purpose of this screen is to allow
you to selectively choose the movies you want included in your report or
Sub-File.  Selections of the movies that you require from the library file
are made through entries in four fields.

1.  Field        Enter the field name on which you wish to restrict output.
                 In addition to the 15 field names displayed on the screen,
                 you may use three additional field names, STARF for the
                 star's first name, COSTARF for the co-stars first name,
                 and DIRECF for the director's first name.  Using the field
                 names STAR, COSTAR and DIRECTOR are for their last names.

2.  Comparator  Requires entry of one of the comparators listed in the
                screen window.

3.  LogOp       Requires entry of one of the logical operators (and -- or).
                The word END is type in this field if the column is not
                filled, to end data entry on the screen.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Value       Enter a constant against which you want the comparison made.

** Examples **

LogOp     Field        Comparator       Value
___________________________________________________________________________
          YEAR         GE               1985
AND       RATING       EQ               PG
AND       TIME         LE               100
END
   This example would select those movies in your library file that were made
on or after 1985, that were rated PG and had a running time of 100 min or less.

          STAR         EQ               EASTWOOD
OR        STAR         EQ               REYNOLDS
AND       CATEGORY     EQ               A
   This example would select those movies in your library file that starred
either Eastwood, or Reynolds that were in the Action category.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This screen allows you to select the fields you want included in your report.
You select the fields to include, the width you want the field to occupy and
select whether to truncate or wrap a field if the actual field width exceeds
the width you selected.  The screen displays five fields, three of which re-
quire you to make entries.  Two of the fields display information only and
cannot be edited.

Print Field       Enter the field you want printed in this field.

Field Width       Display only field, shows the width the field occupies in
                  the library file.

Print Width       Enter the width in characters, you want the field to occupy.
                  The minimum is six.

Wrap (Y/N)        Yes - if the field width of the field to be printed is
                  greater than the print width you selected, then the remain-
                  ing characters will be printed on the next line -- if No
                  the remaining characters will be truncated.
                  See Example on the next page.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The MOVIE SELECTOR screen is displayed if you choose to just display some
movies from the SELECT REPORT TYPE LISTING screen or if you choose to create
a Sub-File from the UTILITY screen.  The purpose of this screen is to allow
you to selectively choose the movies you want included in your report or
Sub-File.  Selections of the movies that you require from the library file
are made through entries in four fields.

1.  Field        Enter the field name on which you wish to restrict output.
                 In addition to the 15 field names displayed on the screen,
                 you may use three additional field names, STARF for the
                 star's first name, COSTARF for the co-stars first name,
                 and DIRECF for the director's first name.  Using the field
                 names STAR, COSTAR and DIRECTOR is for their last names.

2.  Comparator  Requires entry of one of the comparators listed in the
                screen window.

3.  LogOp       Requires entry of one of the logical operators (and -- or).
                The word END is type in this field if the column is not
                filled, to end data entry on the screen.

4.  Value       Enter a constant against which you want the comparison made.

** Examples **

LogOp     Field        Comparator       Value

AND       TIME         LE               100
END
   This example would select those movies in your library file that were made
in or after 1985, that were rated PG and had a running time of 100 min or less.

          STAR         EQ               EASTWOOD
OR        STAR         EQ               REYNOLDS
AND       CATEGORY     EQ               A
   This example would select those movies in your library file that starred
either Eastwood, or Reynolds that were in the Action category.

                        large report can not be listed to the screen.

                       output device previously selected.

                       specify later on the MOVIE SELECTOR screen will be
                       listed to the output device selected.

4.  Sort By:

   A.  Title           Report will be listed sorted alphabetically by title.

                       star's last names.

                       tape number.
*** Notes ***

1.  If you select (A) Tape labels for report type, you will only be allowed to
    select  (E) Tape # for sort by.

2.  The Large Report cannot be listed to the screen.

3.  Your selection for Sort By may be overridden if you have selected (B)
    List Some Movies.  If you selected List Some Movies, you will go to
    the MOVIE SELECTOR screen after completing the current screen.  If one
    of the fields you list to search on is a key field (ie  title, star, co-
    star, director or tape#), the first key field you list will become the
    default Sort By selection.  By doing this, the search of the library
    file is rapidly speeded up.

                  INSTALLING VIDEO LIBRARIAN 

If your system consists of an IBM PC/XT/AT PS/2 or compatible
computer with a color card installed and an Epson MX printer or
Epson code compatible printer, then you will not need to run the
Installation program VLBINST.COM.

If your system differs from the default system listed above, then
you will need to run VLBINST.COM.  To run VLBINST.COM, you must be
at the operating system prompt level, A> for a floppy system and
C> for a hard disk system.

With the VIDEO LIBRARIAN disk in drive A: for a floppy base systems
and in the VIDEO LIBRARIAN directory for hard disk systems, type
the following command to invoke the installation program:



VLBINST (press RETURN)


A menu will display the following three installation options:

          1.  Install Non IBM PC Keyboard
          2.  Install Printer Escape Codes
          3.  Install VDU, Colors & Date Type


KEYBOARD INSTALLATION

THIS MODULE SHOULD ONLY BE USED IF YOUR KEYBOARD IS NOT IBM
COMPATIBLE.  IF YOU HAVE AN IBM PC/XT/AT TYPE KEYBOARD, DO NOT USE
THIS MODULE AS VIDEO LIBRARIAN COMES PRE-INSTALLED FOR IBM AND IBM
COMPATIBLE COMPUTERS.

This module allows the editing keys such as the cursor arrow keys
and some function keys to be re-assigned.  The defaults are:


Arrow keys for cursor movement
    F1 -  Abort edit and ignore any changes
    F5 -  Clear current field
    F9 -  Edit done


Note, if a new key code is assigned to any of the above, the
default keycode will still remain active for the function also.

The install module will show the current keycode in brackets.
Press the new key to be defined or press the RETURN key to accept
the current keycode.
#13
PRINTER INSTALLATION

The printer control codes for NORMAL PRINT and COMPRESSED PRINT
are defined in this module.  Your printer must be able to print
in COMPRESSED PRINT to print tape labels and some reports.

The printer control strings may be entered as ASCII characters
and/or decimal codes preceded by a # character and delimited by
a ; character eg:


          PRINTER CONTROL STRING           YOU MAY TYPE

             ESC $ 1 6 M                   #27;$16M  or
                                           #27,36,49,54,77;
             CTRL Q                        #15;
             ESC Q                         #27;Q



Refer to your printer manual, usually in a section called Printer
Installation Codes, or Escape Sequences, to determine the control
strings which are required to install your printer.

The printer installation module will write a file to your disk or
diskette called PRTCODES.DEF.


MONITOR TYPE AND COLOR SELECTION

The COLORS FOR PROMPTS, and INPUT FIELDS may be selected in this
module, however we suggest you accept the default codes initial-
ly.   You may experiment with different color combinations at a
later stage.

When the SYSTEM BUILDER COLOR/ATTRIBUTE & DATE INSTALLATION screen
is displayed:

If you have a color monitor just select the background, intensity
and foreground colors.

NOTE:  Many computers such as an AT&T or COMPAQ and many
compatible may not display colors on the screen but come with a
color card installed.  They should be installed as color
computers.  They will display both foreground and background
colors in different intensity shadings.

If you keep getting the Video Type Mismatch Error when you run
VIDEO LIBRARIAN and you have installed your computer as a MONO,
go back and install as a color computer.
#13
The monochrome video board recognizes a subrange of video codes.
They are:
                      WLN - Reverse Video
                      NHW - High Intensity Video
                      NLW - Low Intensity Video
                      NHB - High Intensity Video
                      NLB - Low Intensity Video

Suggested combinations will be displayed on the installation
screen.

*WARNING* Do not select NLN or NHN.  If you do, your cursor will
disappear.

After you entered your video codes, you will be prompted to se-
lect your video adapter type.  Enter M for monochrome or C for
color.

                      THE MAIN SCREEN


After the Title Screen is displayed VIDEO LIBRARIAN will display
the Main Screen.  The Main Screen contains 18 data entry fields
to store information about your video movies,  see Figure 4-1
below:  ** Figure 4-1 not shown in this shareware manual**.

Looking at the data entry screen figure 4.1, you will see that the
screen consists of a Status Line (top line on screen) the data
entry fields, and the Command Line (bottom line on the screen).

When the Status Line displays Command Mode as shown in figure 4.1,
you may use any of the commands displayed on the Command Line by
pressing the highlighted letter of the command.  When you enter
one of the following commands: Add, or Edit then the Status Line
will display:

Edit mode: OVERTYPE/INSERT.  F1:ABORT, F5:Clr Eol, F9:Edit Done,
INS: Ins On/Off



The Edit Mode definitions will be explained in a later section.


TOP SECTION

The top section of the data entry screen displays several
informational fields.  Two fields, Size and Used show the record
size of the file and the number of movie records used.  Before you
add movie titles to the file, both will show 0 and as you add a
movie title each is increased by one.  However, when you delete
a movie title, Size remains the same and Used decreases by one.
For example you have added 20 movie titles to your file, Size and
Used will both show 20.  If you delete 2 titles, then Size will
still show 20 and Used will show 18.  When you add titles again
to the file, VIDEO LIBRARIAN will use the space allocated for the
deleted titles before increasing the file size.

File shows the current file that VIDEO LIBRARIAN is working with.
When you first start up VIDEO LIBRARIAN, the file will always be
VIDEO.  You can switch to,  or create a new file by using the
Chfile function on the command line.  This function will be
explained in a later section.  The DOS date and time are also
displayed in the top section of the data entry screen.  The date
and time can be changed by the Utility function which is explained
later.

The FIND Function is extremely fast and efficient.  It can find a
screen of matches almost instantenously.  However it is limited
to searches on one field at a time, and the field must be one of
the five key fields.  If you need to search on multiple fields,
then use the Srch Function or the Report Function.

                       THE SEARCH FUNCTION

The search function allows you to search your data file using
multiple fields.  The function uses two screens to complete the
task, the Movie Selector Screen and the Main screen.  To enter the
search Function, select Srch from the command line on the Main
screen.  The following prompt will be displayed:

   Sort By: Title, Star, Costar, TapeNo, Director: F1 = Abort

Selecting one of the above Key fields will determine the sort
order for the movies that meet your selection criteria.  After you
have made your selection, the Movie Selector Screen is displayed.

When you first enter the Movie Selector Screen, the cursor will
be in the first field waiting input.  If you want to abort this
screen or need help, press F1 and the following prompt will be
displayed:

                   Edit, Continue, Quit, Help

Selecting Edit will place the cursor back in the input screen to
start or edit any data previously input.  After entering your
search criteria, Continue will start the search process.  Quit
will return you to the Main Screen.  Help will display the help
files for the Movie Selector Screen.

MOVIE SELECTOR FIELDS
There are four fields on the screen used to set up the search
criteria;  Field, Comparator, Value and LogOp.

Field      Enter the name for one of the 18 Video Librarian fields
           in this field. Fourteen of the field names are listed
           in the top window of the Movie Selector Screen.  Four
           additional field names that may be used are listed in
           the note on the previous page.  This field holds the
           name of the field that you want searched.

Value      Enter a value in this field to make a comparison.  If
           you entered STAR for the field you wanted searched,
           then you would enter a star's lastname in this field
           for the value.

Comparator This field specifies how you want to compare the value
           entered in the Value field.  There are seven
           comparators that can be entered in this field.   See
           second window on the Movie Selector Screen.
           RESTRICTION- CT can't be used with the following
           fields: YEAR, STOP, START and TIME.  These fields are
           stored as numbers and CT only operates on string values.

LogOp      Two logical operators can be used in this field, AND and
           OR.  The string END entered in this field signifies
           completion of data entry on the Movie Selector Screen.
           The operators allow you  multiple search criteria.
           For the AND comparison to be true, the comparison before
           and after the AND operator must be true for selection
           of the movie record.  The OR comparison will be true if
           any of the comparisons connected by OR are true.  If the
           AND operator is proceeded by one or more OR comparators,
           and if any of the OR comparisons are true, then the
           before condition for the AND operator is true.

NOTE:  You can use all seven input fields in the LogOp field for
the comparators AND, OR ie.; END is not required to signify
completion of data input if all the LogOp fields are used.

SEARCH EXAMPLES

Listed below and on the next page are several examples to
demonstrate setting up selection criteria.


Example 1
      +----------+------------+--------------+------------+
      |  LogOp   |   Field    |  Comparator  |  Value     |
      +----------+------------+--------------+------------+
      |          |   Star     |   EQ         |  EASTWOOD  |
      |  OR      |   STAR     |   EQ         |  REYNOLDS  |
      |  OR      |   Star     |   EQ         |  FORD      |
      |  AND     |   CATEGORY |   NE         |  A         |
      |  END     |            |              |            |
      +----------+------------+--------------+------------+

This example would select all movies in the data file that starred
EASTWOOD or REYNOLDS or FORD and was not and Action movie.


Example 2
      +----------+------------+--------------+------------+
      |  LogOp   |   Field    |  Comparator  |  Value     |
      +----------+------------+--------------+------------+
      |          |   STAR     |   EQ         |  FONDA     |
      |  AND     |   STARF    |   EQ         |  JANE      |
      |  END     |            |              |            |
      +----------+------------+--------------+------------+

This example would select all movies from the data file that
starred Jane Fonda. If the STARF field with a value of JANE was
not used and only the STAR field (FONDA) was used, then all movies
starring Jane, Peter, Henry and any other Fonda would be selected.


Example 3
      +----------+------------+--------------+------------+
      |  LogOp   |   Field    |  Comparator  |  Value     |
      +----------+------------+--------------+------------+
      |          |   STAR     |   EQ         |  PRYOR     |
      |  OR      |   COSTAR   |   EQ         |  PRYOR     |
      |  OR      |   CAST     |   CT         |  PRYOR     |
      |  END     |            |              |            |
      +-----------------------+--------------+------------+

This example would select all movies from the data file that had
PRYOR as a star, co-star or as a cast member.

      |  AND     |   YEAR     |   GE         |  1960      |
      |  AND     |   YEAR     |   LT         |  1970      |
      |  END     |            |              |            |
      +----------+------------+--------------+------------+
This example would select all movies that contained LOVE any where
in the title and was made between 1960 and 1969.


Example 5
      +----------+------------+--------------+------------+
      |  LogOp   |   Field    |  Comparator  |  Value     |
      +----------+------------+--------------+------------+
      |          |   RATING   |   EQ         |  R         |
      |  OR      |   RATING   |   EQ         |  PG13      |
      |  AND     |   YEAR     |   GE         |  1986      |
      |  AND     |   TIME     |   LT         |  105       |
      |  AND     |   CATEGORY |   NE         |  C         |
      |  AND     |   COMPANY  |   EQ         |  CF        |
      |  END     |            |              |            |
      +----------+------------+--------------+------------+
This example would select all movies from the data file that met
the following criteria:  was rated R or PG13 and was made in 1986
or later, and with a running time of 104 minutes or less, and was
not a comedy and was released by CBS/FOX.

Video Librarian can perform some very powerful searches.  After
completing the Movie Selector Screen and pressing Continue, the
search begins.


SEARCH SCREEN

When the search process begins the search screen which is almost
identical to the Main Screen is displayed:


              ************  SEARCHING  ************


The prompt SEARCHING will flash while Video Librarian is searching
the data file for matches.   When a match is found, the movie is
displayed on the screen along with the Search Screen Menu seen
below:

                     Next,  Edit,  Continue
#13
Next will start the search process again to find the next movie
that meets the search criteria.

Edit functions the same as the Edit function on the Main Screen.
Any changes made are incorporated into the data file.

Quit stops the search process and returns you to the Main Screen.

When the search process is complete, a message is displayed.

Search Complete -- Movies Read = 650  Matches = 10 PRESS ANY KEY



Miscellaneous Search Notes

1.      When first entering the Search procedure, you are prompted
        for the sort field, ie. Title, Star, Costar, Director or
        TapeNo.  In some cases the movies are not displayed in the
        sort order selected.  Video Librarian overrides your
        selection if you use a different Index Key Field name as
        the first name in the FIELD input field on the Movie
        Selector Screen.  Video Librarian uses the first Index Key
        Field name on the Movie Selector Screen to determine the
        sort order.

2.      If you just want to search on a single field and that
        field is one of the five Index Key Fields, then the FIND
        procedure may be more convenient to use.

3.      The selection criteria you set up using the Movie Selector
        Screen are case insensitive.  All characters are
        automatically displayed in uppercase on the screen.  All
        fields in your data records are converted to uppercase
        before a comparison is made.

               top window of the screen, there are three additional
               fields that may be used.  They are STARF,COSTARF and
               DIRECF which are for the star's, costar's and direc-
               tor's first names.  The fields Star, Costar, and
               Director will print last names only.  Enter END to
               signal completion of screen input.

Field Width    This is a display only field.  When a field name is
               entered in the print field, the number of characters
               the field occupies is displayed.

Print Width    This fields allows you to specify the width in
               characters that you want the field to occupy on a
               line.  This number is added to the Line Width dis-

               the Print Width and you want all of the field
               information printed.  The extra characters will be
               wrapped to the next line.  The field information
               can occupy up to three lines if Wrap is used.

               If you select NO(N) and the Field Width is greater
               than the Print Width, the extra characters will be
               deleted.

               Selecting either YES or NO when the Field Width is
               less than or equal to Print width has no effect on

PRINTING TAPE LABELS

Printing Tape Labels is a simple process with Video Librarian.  If
you want to print labels for all tapes, simply select Tape Labels
from the Report Type Screen and All Movies from the List Menu.

If you don't want to print labels for all your tapes, select Some
Movies from the List Menu.  You will then enter the Movie Selector
Screen.  The only field used by this screen when printing Tape
Labels is TAPENO.  For example if you had tapes numbered from 0001
to 0132 and you wanted to print labels for the first 20 you would
make the following entries on the Movie Selector Screen.

   +--------+-------------+----------------+------------------+
   | LogOp  |    Field    |   Comparator   |     Value        |

MERGE FILES
This utility allows you to merge two files previously created into
one file.  When selected, you are prompted to enter the name of the
Input File.  The file cannot be the currently selected file.  The
movies from the Input File are added to the current file.

If the Input File selected cannot be found you will receive an
error message and given the chance to select another Input File.

If the Input File selected is found you are asked if you want
to open the file. If you answer Yes, the merge procedure will
start. This is indicated by Merge In Progress flashing at the top
of the Utility Screen.  If you answer No to the open file question
you will be returned to the Utility Menu for additional input.

If the operation is completed successfully, you will be notified
of the success and the number of movies added to the current file.

If doing the merge process you run out of disk space, the oper-
ation will halt.  You are notified of the out of disk space con-
dition, and the number of movies added to the current file.  The
file is fully functional, eventhough all movies were not added.

CREATE SUB-FILE
This utility allows you to create fully functional sub-files of any
file created by Video Librarian.  For example, if your main movie
file contain movies in the categories, comedy, action and drama.
By use of this procedure you could create a file that just con-
tained comedy movies.

When this item is selected,  you will be prompted to input the name
of the Output File.  If the name of the Output File already exits,
you will be given a chance to choose a new file name or continuing.
If you elect to continue, the contents of the file will be erased
and the new data added to the file.

If the name selected for the Output File does not exits, you will
be asked if you want to create the file.  If you answer No, you
will be returned to the Utility Screen Menu. If you answer yes the
program will create the required files and continue.

After selection of the Output File name, you will be enter the
Movie Selector Screen.  On this screen you will set up the selec-
tion criteria for the movies to be included in the Output File.

notified and told the number of movies transferred.  The file
is fully functional although all movies were not transferred.

                        VIDEOFIX PROGRAM
** NOTE **  The utility program VIDEOFIX.EXE is no longer pro-
vided on this shareware disks due to space limitations.  Reg-
istered users will be provided this utility.
PURPOSE
A utility program is provided on your disk, called VIDEOFIX.EXE.
The purpose of this program is to re-index your Video Librarian
files if they should become damaged and to permanently remove
deleted records from the file.


CAUSE OF DAMAGE

Your index files can become damaged by severe power spikes or loss
of power to the computer while operating Video Librarian.  Your
index files have been damaged if you noticed that your star,
costar, title, director or tapeno fields are not in listed in the
proper alphabetical or numerical order.

Damaged index files are a very rare occurrence, in over two years
of extensive use of Video Librarian we have never experienced dam-
aged index files except where induced on purpose to test this
utility program.

We highly recommend that you regularly back up your Video Librarian
data files. If you have a recent back up disk, the quickest method
to repair damaged index files is to copy the files from your back
up disk to the main disk.  This is assuming that you have not
copied
the damaged files to your back up disk.


USING VIDEOFIX

If you find it necessary to use this program to repair damaged
index files perform the following:

1.  If you have been using Video Librarian, exit from the program
    and re-boot your computer.

2.  Make a backup copy of your damaged files.

3.  At the place where you normally type VLB to load Video
    Librarian.
    a. Type SBMIO.COM
    b. after the program has loaded and the DOS prompt returns
                     Type VIDEOFIX

The program will load and the following prompt will appear:

                  ReIndex or Delete Module R/D
 #13
ReIndex Module

Select R for re-index, the delete module will be discussed later.
You will then be prompted to input the drive and filename of the
file you wish to repair.  Enter the drive and filename without any
extensions.

The program will start processing the damaged files.  The message
Busy Repairing Files will flash on the screen.  When the process
is complete you will be returned to the DOS prompt.


Delete Module

When Video Librarian deletes a movie form the file, the movie is
not physically removed from the disk file, it is flagged as
deleted.  To permanently remove the records from the disk file run
VideoFix as directed previously.  Select D at the first prompt.

To remove the deleted records from your file, this utility creates
a temporary data file.  You will be prompted for the disk drive to
store the temporary data file.  If there is not enough room to
store the temporary file you will be prompted again for a disk
drive.  You can then select an alternate drive with a formatted
disk or PRESS F1 to abort.  When the program completes processing
all movies you will be returned to the DOS prompt.

This utility also repairs damaged files.  However if you only need
to repair damaged files, use the Re-Index Module.  The Re-Index
module performs about three times faster than this module.

                         CUSTOMER SUPPORT
                                                                
TurboSystemsCo has a strong commitment to customer service 
and product support to registered users of Video Librarian.
For non-registered users, we will provide assistance in get-
ting the program up and running on your system if problems
are encountered.  That is the only assistance that will be
provided to non-registerd users.

The author of Video Librarian and President of TurboSystemsCo
(Lemuel D. Turner) is a member of the Association of Shareware
Professionals (ASP).   Since this program is authored by a
 member of ASP, registered users have an additional avenue to
resolve any shareware related problems that may develop with
ASP members, the ASP Ombudsman.


ASSOCIATION OF SHAREWARE PROFESSIONALS OMBUDSMAN

Lemuel D. Turner is a member of the Association of Shareware
Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure the that the 
shareware principle works for you.  If you are unable to re-
solve a shareware-related problem with an ASP member by con-
tacting that member directly, ASP may be able to help.  The
ASP Ombudsman can help you resolve a dispute or problem with
an ASP member, but does not provide technical support for
members' products.  Please write the ASP Ombudsman at P.O.
Box 5786, Bellevue, Wa. 98006 or send a Compuserve message
via easyplex to ASP Ombudsman 70007,3536.
