## Information about "PC-MAIL  3 OF 3  (ALSO 868, 869)"

    PC-MAIL is a menu-driven mailing list and address management program
    which will print mailing labels, keep track of addresses and allow you
    to delete the older ones.
    
    PC-MAIL's sort function alone makes it worth the money.  With this, you
    can sort on any field in a matter of seconds.  All menu routines
    provide
    a listing of the options available to the user, making the program easy
    to use.  Each program function opens with an introductory screen,
    explaining the functions provided.  Just follow the instructions on the
    screen and it will explain what to do next.
    
    The type and size of labels are user-specified.  Widths can run from
    2-1/2" to 5" and height ranges from 1" to 2-1/2."
    
    PC-MAIL is not just another mailing list program, but a
    fully-functional
    package which will greatly assist you in your home or business.
