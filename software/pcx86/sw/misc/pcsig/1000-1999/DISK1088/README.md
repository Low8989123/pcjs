## Information about "BOOK REPORT/1001 TOPICS FOR COMPOSITION"

    Arrange your thoughts and create the structure of your book report with
    this organizer.
    
    BOOK REPORT asks several general questions to help you get started
    writing your book report.  Questions concern the basic library
    information, the setting, the main character and supporting characters,
    the main scene, and your own feelings about and reactions to the book.
    The advantage is it organizes the basic information into simple
    categories that can be incorporated easily into your final report.  Once
    finished, print or save the information in an ASCII text file.
    File Descriptions:
    
    ------------  THE BOOK REPORT PROGRAM.
    AUTOEXEC BAT  Batch file for start-up.
    BOOK     COM  Main program.
    POINT    INV  Data overlay file.
    RANDDOT  COM  Utility program.
    READ     ME   Documentation for BOOK REPORT.
    
    1001 TOPICS FOR COMPOSITION is an educational aid to help you choose a
    topic for writing English compositions and essays.  The program has
    1,358 topics and 21 different categories to choose from.
    
    Categories include personal reminiscences and reactions, familiar essay
    topics, sports, national and international news, science, the arts and
    entertainment, philosophy, education, specific literary topics, and
    more.
    
    Besides having several different subject areas there are categories for
    different writing styles, such as comparison and contrast, persuasion,
    argumentative, exposition, and description.  The program first presents
    a list of main categories and, once you indicate your general line of
    interest, several suggested topics are listed on the screen.
