## Information about "PULLED FROM LIBRARY"

    Personalize your Microsoft Windows environment with your own menus and
    submenus, arrange or stack open windows, close windows, iconize them,
    and hide windows by making them invisible.  If that's not enough, you
    can browse files in your Windows environment and print out whatever you
    want.
    
    This well-documented trio of microapplications makes Windows do it your
    way.  With COMMAND POST, you easily add any number of menu and submenu
    items to the main MS-DOS Windows executive menu bar.  Execution is only
    a mouse click away.  COMMAND POST does a lot more than make it easy for
    you to start programs.  It helps you get your work done faster and safer
    by reducing tedious manual steps.  A single menu item can gather
    filenames and other information into listboxes for the user to choose
    from, perform arithmetic, parse strings, move and resize windows, read
    and write WIN.INI variables, read DOS environment variables, copy, move
    and delete files and much more.
    
    While BROWSER cannot alter or edit files, you can display them in ASCII
    format.  Or you can make a hex dump.  A hide and seek feature lets users
    control the shown (displayable) and hidden lines of text.
    
    APPLETS lets you put your windows where you want them.  You can easily
    copy, rename, move and delete files with APPLETS.

          Wilson WindowWare
          3377 59th SW
          Seattle WA  98116
          (206) 937-9335

                                                         May 18, 1989

          A new product distribution disk is now available from Wilson
          WindowWare.  The disk contains three shareware Windows
          applications from Wilson WindowWare.  These applications are
          designed to run under Microsoft Windows, version 2.03 or newer.

          The applications are:

            COMMAND POST  6.2
                              A menuing / file management shell that
                              allows personalization of the MS-DOS
                              Executive window.

            BROWSER       3.2
                              A file browsing utility.  Browser quickly
                              displays files, prints sections, or copies 
                              selected text to the Windows clipboard.

            APPLETS       1.1
                              A dozen or so tiny applications for
                              Windows.  They are designed to be used
                              with Command Post or other Window shells.



         Command Post allows users to easily add menu and submenu items
         to the MS-DOS Executive window, provides file management
         capability, a directory tree, screen blanker, window locator,
         window arranger, and more.  Command Post menu extensions are
         defined in an easy to edit text file, and automatically loaded
         into Command Post at startup.  The menus allow the user to
         specify a directory to switch to, and an application to start
         whenever the corresponding menu item is selected.  Command Post
         also provides a two-window file management feature, allowing
         the user to copy or move files from one window to the other.

         Browser is a Windows application designed to allow users to
         view files in a variety of formats, including ANSI, ASCII,
         7 and 8 bit bytes, and as a hex dump.  Features include printing
         and clipboard update.  Browser sports a powerful Hide&Seek
         information lookup capability, which allows various views of
         the information in a text file to be rapidly generated.

         Applets are a collection of tiny applications for the Windows.
         They are primarily designed to operate with Windows menuing
         programs, such as Command Post, which allow you to initiate
         a series of applications from a single menu selection.
         These applications include:

            FILE   Applets
                copy, move, rename, delete
            WINDOW Applets
                arrange, place, hide, show, zoom, iconize
            OTHER  Applets
                say, beep, saybeep


```
