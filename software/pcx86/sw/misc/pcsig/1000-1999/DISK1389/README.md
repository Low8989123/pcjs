## Information about "FALL THRU"

    You and up to two other players stand only half a chance of making it
    home alive in this text adventure, called FALLTHRU!
    
    You don't know how you got to this strange place, but you quickly
    discover that Faland is very large, comprising millions of square miles
    (all visitable) of farms, rangeland, forests, deserts, mountains, etc.
    Much of it is inhabited by dangerous wild animals, renegades,
    warriors, and demons.
    
    You and your fellow players must find your way through the trackless
    wilderness, while quickly learning to recognize friend and foe, earning
    a living, and defending yourself by fist and weapon.  And along the way
    you must gather information and solve various riddles and puzzles by
    talking to shop keepers, strangers, warriors, inn keepers, etc., and by
    exploring the many settlements, dark and treacherous caverns,
    catacombs, mines, castles and ruins scattered throughout this vast
    territory.
    
    FALLTHRU recognizes several hundred words by which you can set your
    course, pick up objects, buy and sell things, fight, hunt, shoot, and
    speak to the odd characters you and your companions will meet as you try
    to go home!  Age level: 12 to adult.

    Attn: Brian Tuck:

    I  have  updated  my  game  program,  FALLTHRU  (Disk  X6897), and have
    included  the  rewrite on the enclosed diskette.  The primary change is
    the addition of an upgraded user interface which makes it easy to print
    and browse, on screen, the instruction manual.  The files  FALLTHRU.EXE
    and  FALLTHRU.OVR  have  also been changed to incorporate a 'fix' for a
    bug found in the material handling procedures and  the  version  number
    changed to v 1.01 to reflect these changes.  The enclosed disk contains
    the following files:

    FALLTHRU   TXT   - This memo.
    README      FT   - The instruction manual.
    VIEWDOC    EXE   - Browse program for viewing ASCII files.
    PRNDOC     EXE   - Print program to print ASCII files.
    FALLTHRU   EXE   - Main program file.
    FALLTHRU   OVR   - Overlay file required by the main program.
    VPET       EXE   - Menu program from which program files may be run.
    GO         BAT   - Batch file permitting GO command to call VPET.EXE.

    I hope these changes will not cause any inconvenience.

                                             Sincerely,
                                             Paul H. Deal
