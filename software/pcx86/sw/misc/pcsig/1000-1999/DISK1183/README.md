## Information about "MTOOL & CONVERT"

    MTOOL is an easy-to-use mathematical tool used to define and
    analyze functions of a single variable.  The speed, power, and ease of
    use make it ideal for science, engineering, and math students.
    
    This program can evaluate a function for a range of points or for a
    single point of the independent variable.  It can numerically evaluate
    derivatives and integrals.  It can find solutions for the function, and
    it can plot the function using CGA, EGA, VGA, or Hercules Graphics.
    
    CONVERT is a conversion calculator that accepts arguments from the
    command line and shows a list of equivalent quantities of different
    units (English vs. Metric).  This program is very useful because it
    converts a variety of units concerning distance, area, volume, time,
    rate, heat, energy, and force.

       Convert is a unit conversion utility for MS-DOS computers. The
  usage directions for Convert are very simple.  At the DOS prompt type
  "convert" followed by a quantity and a unit.  Convert reads the
  argument list and types a list of unit conversions.  Here's a sample:
  
          C>convert 10 mi
  
          10 mi =   5.2800000000E+04 feet
                =   1.7600000000E+04 yards
                =   8.68976 nautical miles
                =   1.6093440000E+04 meters
                =   16.09344 kilometers
  
       Convert works best on hard disk systems.  Make sure that
  Convert.exe is in a directory on your path and you will be able to
  use it from anyplace in your system.  Since the Turbo Pascal 4.0
  source code for Convert comes with the program, you can customize
  your version to support any conversions you wish.
  
       Most of the rest of this document is a table of units supported
  by Convert with input strings that Convert recognizes and output
  units for that input.  The last two pages concern legalities and the
  requested contribution.

Program Title:  MTOOL and CONVERT
PC-SIG version 1

MTOOL is an easy-to-use mathematic function interpreter that will 
analyze functions of a single variable defined by the user.  This 
program can evaluate a function for a range of points or for a single 
point of the independant variable.  It can also evaluate the derivative 
of the function for any value of the independent variable.  The 
function can be numerically integrated.  This program can also find 
solutions for the function over a range of values for the independant 
variable.  MTOOL can plot the function using a 640x200 resolution 
screen. 

CONVERT is a unit-conversion utility that accepts arguments from the
command line and shows a list of equivalent quantities of different
units.  This program is very useful as it will convert a variety of
units concerning distance, area, volume, time, rate, heat, energy and
force.

Usage:  Unit Conversion/Function Analysis.

Special Requirements:  A 640 x 200 high resolution screen is required to
plot the function.

How to Start:  Type GO (press enter).

Suggested Registration:  $5.00 for CONVERT and $20.00 for MTOOL.

                                   INTRODUCTION
                                   ------------
  
  
           Mtool is a function interpreter.  The "M" in Mtool stands for
      "Math."  The program can handle virtually any well-behaved
      mathematical function of a single variable.  It is designed to be easy
      to use, prompting the user at every step for whatever information it
      needs.  Once you have defined a function, Mtool gives you the
      following capabilities:
  
           1)  Evaluate the function for any value of the independent
               variable.
  
           2)  Evaluate the function over a range of values of the
               independent variable.
  
           3)  Numerically integrate the function.
  
           4)  Evaluate the derivative of the function for a given
               value of the independent variable.
  
           5)  Find solutions of the function over some range of
               the independent variable.
  
           6)  Plot the function.
  
  
           Mtool is written in Turbo Pascal, and all of its operations are
      carried out completely in memory.  Mtool requires a minimum of 256k
      of memory.  Since Mtool uses dynamic data structures, it can access
      as much memory as is available.  Testing shows, however, that even
      very complicated functions rarely require more than about 50k of
      memory.  The plotting capability requires graphics capability.  Since
      Mtool is written in Turbo Pascal, version 4.0, it supports all common
      PCompatible graphics standards - CGA, EGA, VGA, and Hercules.

                                      HISTORY
                                      -------
  
           Mtool fills a need that I first perceived several years ago when
      I was a student in engineering school.  Often when I was reading some
      text or other, I came across a complicated mathematical function or
      formula.  Normally the author of the text would make some statements
      about the formula regarding its behavior or certain of its
      properties.  Usually at this point I thought that seeing a plot of
      the function would make things much clearer.  Most of the time I had
      three alternatives - look in vain in the text for a plot; plot it
      myself by hand, a job only a masochist could enjoy; or forget about
      it.  Naturally, alternative three was my usual choice.
  
           Eventually, I became the owner of a Compaq Deskpro and a copy of
      the Turbo Pascal compiler.  I started writing a program that would
      plot any function that I could type in.  My purpose, at first, was
      only to learn Turbo Pascal.  Then I started adding some other things,
      like integration and derivatives.  The idea gradually grew that Mtool
      might make a good shareware program, and so here it is.
  
           The full power of Mtool is demonstrated later in this document
      with the inclusion of script that you can use to generate some very
      complicated results.  The program is powerful enough that I wish I
      would have had it when I was in engineering school, for it certainly
      adds a fourth and most attractive alternative to the list above.

                                    USING MTOOL
                                    -----------
  
  
           Using Mtool is easy.  It is merely a matter of answering prompts
      the program issues, and of making menu choices.  First, the program
      leads you through a series of steps which define your function.
      Options such as the ability to define characters representing
      constants and subfunctions add to the complexity of function that you
      can define.
  
           After your function is defined, Mtool presents you with its main
      menu.  Depending on your choice Mtool further prompts you for any
      information it needs.  Finally, after Mtool has completed your choice
      of operations, it allows you the options of continuing to use the
      same function, of defining a new function, of editing your function,
      or of leaving the program.
  
           The next several sections of this document give a detailed
      description of how to use Mtool, including many examples.

                                      EDITING
                                      -------
  
  
           Mtool includes some simple editing tools as part of its user
      interface.  It shows, in reverse video, the length of string that can
      be entered in reply to a prompt.  For example, the main function
      definition can hold as many as 73 characters, so the main function
      prompt is followed by a reverse video bar 73 spaces long.  Another
      example is the independent variable definition which allows only one
      character and so is followed by one reverse video space.
  
           Mtool supports five editing keys.  The keys and their functions
      are:
  
           Left arrow - moves cursor to left.
           Right arrow - moves cursor to right as far as end of string.
           Backspace - deletes a character and moves cursor to left.
           End - moves cursor to end of string.
           Home - deletes entire string.
  
      A character is replaced by placing the cursor directly on it and
      typing the desired character - that is, the editor works in
      overstrike mode.  Insert mode is not supported at this time.
  
           Suppose that you had entered the string
  
                cos98*x) + cos(7*x)
  
      and wished to replace the "9" with a "(".  Assuming that the cursor
      is at the end of the string, hold down the left arrow key until the
      cursor is on the "9", press "(", then press "End" to return the
      cursor to the end of the string.  One note of caution - if you press
      the return key the string will be truncated at the cursor position.
      Any characters to the right of the cursor will be lost, so pressing
      the end key before the return key is important.
  
           These simple editing keys apply at all Mtool prompts.

                                ENTERING A FUNCTION
                                -------------------
  
  
           Mtool starts with a message from the author.  After this
      advertisement, Mtool issues its first prompt:
  
                Independent variable:
  
           Any lower case letter except for the first four are legal
      responses to this prompt.  The letters "a" through "d" are reserved
      for use as subfunctions, which will be described below.  If you try
      to enter an answer that the program does not allow, it will issue a
      warning, beep, and prompt again:
  
                Independent variable:
  
                Invalid choice - try again.
  
          This will continue until Mtool gets an answer it likes, namely,
      any lower case letter from "e" to "z".
  
           Defining an independent variable does not mean that the other
      letters from "e" to "z" are off limits.  You can use any of them
      anywhere in your function, and Mtool will consider them to be
      constants and query you for their values - more on this later.
  
           Next, Mtool asks for subfunctions.  A subfunction is best
      described with an example.  Suppose that
  
                f(x) = a + b
  
             where  a = cos(8*x) and b = cos(9*x).
  
      Then a and b are subfunctions.  Mtool allows you to define as many as
      four subfunctions, each of which may contain as many as fifty
      characters.  Any operation that can be performed on a variable can be
      performed on a subfunction, so in the example above we could have
      f(x) = a*b, or f(x) = a/b, or f(x) = a^b, etc.
  
            The program asks how many subfunctions you wish to define.  The
      appearance of the second screen depends on your answer to this
      prompt.  The number of subfunction lines which appear is the same as
      your answer.  An example of the first two screens with four
      subfunction definitions and a main function definition appears on the
      next page.

                                      INITIALIZATION
  
  
      Independent variable: x
  
      How many subfunctions(min 0; max 4): 4
  
                                      ENTER FUNCTION
  
  
      f(x) =
  
        where a =
              b =
              c =
              d =
  
  
  
  
              a = cos(3*x)
              b = cos(5*x)
              c = cos(7*x)
              d = cos(9*x)
  
      f(x) = a + b + c + d
  
  
           Before the program accepts a subfunction definition, it makes a
      first pass at parsing the expression.  In this pass it is looking for
      errors or constructions that it cannot deal with.  Examples are
      unbalanced parentheses or back-to-back operators.  If the program
      detects any errors, it will issue a warning message and prompt again
      for the same subfunction.  It will not allow you to enter a string of
      more than fifty characters as a subfunction.
  
           The next prompt after the subfunctions have been defined is the
      main function prompt.  This string may be as long as 73 characters.
      Once again, the program will make a first pass at the string looking
      for errors or bad constructions.  It will also make sure that you
      have not attempted to use an undefined subfunction character.  If it
      finds any problems, it will issue a message and prompt again for the
      function definition.
  
           Besides variables and constants, Mtool recognizes several
      operators and many standard mathematical functions.  A complete list,
      with examples, follows on the next page.

           Mathematical Functions
           ----------------------
  
                Absolute value                    abs(x)
                Exponential                       exp(x)
                Cosine                            cos(x)
                Sine                              sin(x)
                Tangent                           tan(x)
                Inverse cosine                    acos(x)
                Inverse sine                      asin(x)
                Inverse tangent                   atan(x)
                Factorial                         fac(x)
                Hyperbolic sine                   sinh(x)
                Hyperbolic cosine                 cosh(x)
                Hyperbolic tangent                tanh(x)
                Inverse hyperbolic sine           asinh(x)
                Inverse hyperbolic cosine         acosh(x)
                Inverse hyperbolic tangent        atanh(x)
                Logarithm, base 10                log(x)
                Natural logarithm                 ln(x)
  
           The x in each math function represents the argument of the
      function.  It must be enclosed within parentheses.  This argument can
      be any legal Mtool expression.  The arguments for trigonometric
      functions and the values of inverse trigonometric fuctions are
      assumed to be in radians.  If you wish to use degrees, then include a
      factor to convert from degrees to radians.  This can be done by using
      two constants, setting one equal to pi and the other equal to 180.
      An example of how to do this is shown in the Main Menu section below.
  
           Some examples follow.  These examples show all the Mtool prompts
      and all the necessary replies to define functions.
  
           Example 1 - Fifth degree polynomial
  
                Independent variable: x
  
                How many subfunctions(min 0; max 4): 0
  
                Function definition:
  
                f(x) = x^5 + 4*x^4 - 7*x^3 + 10*x^2 + 2*x - 12
  



                                        8

                Function definition:
  
                f(x) = cos(m*x) + cos(n*x)
  
                (Later Mtool will ask for values for m and n.)
  
           Example 3 - Function with one subfunction
  
                Independent variable: x
  
                How many subfunctions(min 0; max 4): 1
  
                Subfunction definition:
  
                a = 3*x^3 + 2*x^2
  
                Function definition:
  
                f(x) = cos(a)
  
           Example 4 - Function with four subfunctions
  
                Independent variable: t
  
                How many subfunctions(min 0; max 4): 4
  
                Subfunction definitions:
  
                a = cos(t) + cos(3*t)
                b = cos(5*t) + cos(7*t)
                c = cos(9*t) + cos(11*t)
                d = cos(13*t) + cos(15*t)
  
                Function definition:
  
                f(t) = a + b + c + d
  
  
  
  









                                        9










                                     MAIN MENU
                                     ---------
  
  
               After the function has been defined, Mtool will echo the
      function definition and list the main menu.  If the function were the
      one in Example 4 above, then Mtool would put this on the screen:
  
  
                f(t) = a + b + c + d
  
                  where a = cos(t) + cos(3*t)
                        b = cos(5*t) + cos(7*t)
                        c = cos(9*t) + cos(11*t)
                        d = cos(13*t) + cos(15*t)
  
  
                1) Evaluate at a single point.
                2) Evaluate over a range of points.
                3) Integrate.
                4) Both 2 and 3.
                5) Derivative.
                6) Solve.
                7) Graph.
                Enter choice:
  
           Mtool expects you to answer with a number from 1 to 7 depending
      on what you want it to do.  After you make your choice Mtool will ask
      you for any other information it needs.  This information, and thus
      Mtool's prompts, vary depending on your choice.  The next several
      sections will describe these prompts and possible responses.
  
  
  





















                                        10










  
                            EVALUATION AT A SINGLE POINT
                            ----------------------------
  
  
           The first choice in the menu causes Mtool to evaluate the
      function for a single value of the independent variable.  This means,
      of course, that Mtool must query you for the value you wish to use.
      Mtool will also query you for the values of any constants that may
      have been included in your function.  An example that includes
      constants is shown below.
  
  
                f(x) = cos(m*x) + cos(n*x)
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
                What is the value of x:     0.2000
                What is the value of n:     9.0000
  
                m = 8.0000
                n = 9.0000
  
  
  
  
  
                Evaluating function
  
                f( 0.2000 ) =  -2.5640161698E-01

           Note that the arguments of the cosine terms in this function
      have the unit radians.  Also note that the spacing that appears on
      the screen is accurately represented in this example.  The prompt
      asking for the value of m was issued but is not shown here because it
      was overwritten by the prompt for n.

                         ---------------------------------
  
           The second menu selection causes Mtool to evaluate the function
      over a range of points.  How this works should be clear from the
      example below.  Screen formats are not reproduced in this example.

           Several things should be noted here.  First, the total range of
      values of the independent variable is defined by the responses to the
      lower and upper limit prompts.  Second, the number of points at which
      the function is evaluated is always one greater than the number of
      subdivisions.  Third, the independent variable increment is the total
      range divided by the number of subdivisions.
  
           This example also shows how conversion from radians to degrees
      works.  The evaluated values are the cosines of angles from zero to
      ten degrees at one degree intervals.

                                    -----------
  
  
  
           Mtool uses Simpson's Rule to numerically integrate.  Simpson's
      Rule requires that the interval of integration be divided into an
      even number of subintervals.  The greater the number of subintervals,
      the more accurate the answer.  Here's an example of how this works in
      Mtool.  All Mtool output is present, but screen formats are not
      reproduced.

                Number of subdivisions(even for integration): 20

           The antiderivative of this function is 2*x^3, and this evaluated
      over the interval zero to five gives 250.0, which agrees exactly with
      Mtool's result.

                                    ----------
  
  
  
           This selection evaluates the derivative of the function for some
      particular value of the independent variable.  It uses the standard
      definition of the derivative as a limit.  This definition can be
      found in any elementary calculus text.  Only one prompt is necessary
      after the menu choice, the value of the independent variable.  The
      following example shows how it works.
  
                f(x) = 6*x^2
  
  
  
                1) Evaluate at a single point.

           Mtool's result is returned as fprime.  Of course, the derivative
      of 6*x^2 is 12*x, and for x = 2, 12*x = 24.  Mtool's result is close
      to this, but not exactly correct.  This is an unavoidable byproduct
      of the differing natures of computation and mathematics, but the
      accuracy of derivatives in Mtool will rarely if ever be less than
      four places.

      in which eleven roots are found.

           The criterion used by Mtool is that, if the absolute value of
      f(x) is less than 1.0e-8, then x qualifies as a root.  Two cautions
      are necessary.  First, for some functions such as very high-order
      polynomials, Mtool may not have great enough precision to find a
      small enough value of f(x).  In these cases Mtool will write its best
      estimate along with the value of f(x) so that you can judge whether
      it is indeed a root.  Second, it may rarely occur that Mtool might
      miss a root.  This may occur when two roots are so close together
      with respect to the size of the range being searched that Mtool sees
      only one of them.  Reducing the size of the range will allow Mtool to
      see both.  Coordinating Mtool's solution finding and graphics
      capabilities will help you deal with these possibilities.

           Probably the most useful of Mtool's functions is its ability to
      quickly generate plots of functions.  Certainly this is the one that
      I find most useful - indeed, it was just to have this that I wrote
      the program in the first place.  Once again, getting Mtool to do its
      thing is very simple.  Two examples are shown below - one for
      automatic scaling and one for user-defined scaling.

                1) Evaluate at a single point.

                Automatic y-axis scaling(Y/N): n
                Minimum y-axis value: -2
                Maximum y-axis value: 2
  

                                        17










  
  
           The one thing missing in each of these examples is, of course,
      the plot.  But this is simple for you to remedy - just run Mtool,
      type in the values shown, and you'll have the plots in about a minute
      or so for each.
  
           The autoscaling works by finding the maximum and minimum values
      the function takes over the range of the plot, and setting the y-axis
      accordingly.  The user-defined option allows you to set the scale of
      the y-axis so that you can compare different curves.
  
           Mtool supports all common graphics standards - CGA, EGA, VGA,
      and Hercules.  It automatically detects what graphics board you have
      in your computer and adjusts itself.  This capability is one of the
      many features added in version 4.0 of Turbo Pascal and - free
      advertising for Borland International - a good reason to upgrade if
      you haven't already.
  
           Finally, if you have a graphics printer you can get printouts of
      your plots.  Before running Mtool run the program Graphics included
      with PC/MS-DOS.  This enables the computer to do a dump of a graphics
      screen to the printer.  When you have a plot that you wish to print,
      just push the PrintScreen key.

                                    DIFFICULTIES
                                    ------------
  
  
           In the introduction I mentioned that Mtool can handle virtually
      any well-behaved function of a single variable.  A definition of what
      constitutes a well-behaved function for Mtool is difficult, although
      certainly any function that fits the calculus definition of a
      continous function would qualify as well-behaved.
  
           Functions that are not continuous can cause problems.  Generally
      speaking, there are three ways that a function can fail to be
      continuous.  All three can potentially cause problems for Mtool,
      especially in the graphics area.
  
           First, it may happen that a function does not exist at some
      point.  An example would be a rational function at a point where its
      denominator becomes zero.  If Mtool attempts to evaluate the function
      at this point, it will issue an error message.  However, it may occur
      that you ask for a plot of this function over a range that includes
      such a point but because of the choice of endpoints and number of
      subdivisions, Mtool does not attempt to evaluate the function at that
      point.  A plot will appear, but the fact that the function does not
      exist at some point will not be apparent from the plot.  You would
      only become aware of this discontinuity if Mtool tried to evaluate
      the function at this point and issued a division by zero error
      message.
  
           Second, consider the function
  
                f(x) = sin(x)/x , x <> 0
                f(x) = 0, x = 0
  
      Discontinuous functions of this nature cannot be defined in Mtool.
      Only one of the two parts, say the first, could be defined.  Then
      f(x) = sin(x)/x becomes a type one function.
  
           Third, and most troublesome to Mtool, are functions that are not
      defined at some point, but do have limits that vary depending on the
      direction of approach to the point.  An example of this type of
      function is tan(x).  As x approaches pi/2 from below, tan(x) goes to
      infinity.  As x approaches pi/2 from above, tan(x) goes to negative
      infinity.  If you plot tan(x) from x = 1 to x = 2, you will see a
      nearly vertical line near x = pi/2 because Mtool connects the points
      on either side of pi/2.
  
           The upshot of all this is, if you are dealing with
      non-continuous functions, be careful, and if you get plots that seem
      strange, check your function to see if it is one of these types.

                                      LOOPING
                                      -------
  
  
  
           After any main menu operation has been completed, Mtool offers
      you the chance to use the same function again without reentering the
      subfunction and function definitions.  The menu that it presents
      looks like this:
  
  
                f(t) = a + b + c + d
  
                  where a = cos(t) + cos(3*t)
                        b = cos(5*t) + cos(7*t)
                        c = cos(9*t) + cos(11*t)
                        d = cos(13*t) + cos(15*t)
  
  
                 S)ame function
                 N)ew function
                 E)dit function
                 Q)uit
                 Enter choice:
  
           Mtool displays your current function definition and its simple
      menu.  The choices are obvious.
  
           If you do choose to reuse the same function and if the function
      contains constants, then Mtool will ask if you wish to change their
      values.  The prompts look like this:
  
                Value of m same(  8.0000000000E+00)..(Y/N): y
                Value of n same(  9.0000000000E+00)..(Y/N): y
  
           Mtool shows the current value of the constant and asks if you
      wish to leave it unchanged.  If you answer no for any constant, then
      at the normal position following the main menu, Mtool will ask you
      for the new value.  Immediately after you have answered these
      constant prompts, Mtool goes into the main menu.

                                    APPLICATIONS
                                    ------------
  
  
           This section includes two rather complicated applications to
      give you a taste of the types of things you can do with Mtool.  Both
      applications relate directly to the earlier History section because
      they are both specific cases where I had wished that I had a tool
      like Mtool.
  
      Taylor Series
      -------------
  
           A Taylor Series can be found for any function f that has
      derivatives of all orders at some point a.  If we let T(x) be the
      Taylor Series then
  
           T(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + f''(a)(x-a)^2/2! + ... +
                   fk(a)(x-a)^k/k! + ....
  
      where fk denotes the kth derivative of f.  The special case of the
      Taylor Series about the point a = 0 is called the Maclaurin series.
      These series are discussed at length in introductory calculus texts.
  
           One application of these series is to approximate certain
      functions.  For example, the Maclaurin series for f(x) = e^x is given
      by
  
               1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/3! + x^4/4! + ....
  
      Given sufficient terms, this series converges to e^x for all x.  My
      questions were, how many terms are necessary, and how closely does
      some number of terms, say 4 or 5 or 10, approach e^x, and over what
      range of values of x does this approximation hold.  If you are
      familiar with Taylor and Maclaurin series, then you know that there
      exists a formula for the remainder which gives the maximum error for
      the series, but this will not give you the same feel for the accuracy
      of the series approximation as a plot.  For a plot of the error of a
      twelve term Maclaurin series approximation to e^x, type the function
      on the next page into Mtool.
  
  












                                        21










  
                f(x) = a + b + c + d - exp(x)
  
                  where a = 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/fac(3)
                        b = x^4/fac(4) + x^5/fac(5) + x^6/fac(6)
                        c = x^7/fac(7) + x^8/fac(8) + x^9/fac(9)
                        d = x^10/fac(10) + x^11/fac(11)
  
  
  
                1) Evaluate at a single point.
                2) Evaluate over a range of points.
                3) Integrate.
                4) Both 2 and 3.
                5) Derivative.
                6) Solve.
                7) Graph.
                Enter choice: 7
  
                Lower limit of x:    -2.0000
                Upper limit of x:     2.0000
                Number of subdivisions(even for integration):  200
                Automatic y-axis scaling(Y/N): y
  
           In about the same amount of time that it takes you to enter this
      function you'll have a plot showing how closely this series matches
      e^x over the given range of x.  Using the "same" response to the loop
      menu, you will be able to play with different ranges of x and with
      different numbers of points to plot.  If you're like me, you will
      quickly get a much better feel for the accuracy of this approximation
      than you would ever get from a formula or two.

      Fourier Series
      --------------
  
  
           The second application comes from one of my engineering courses.
      According to Fourier analysis, a square wave can be approximated by
      the series
  
       f(t) = 1/2 + (2/pi)cos(t) - (2/3*pi)cos(3t) + (2/5*pi)cos(5t) - ....
  
      The greater the number of terms the nearer the series approaches a
      square wave.  Usually in a text there will one and only one graph
      that shows this.  It would be nice to play around with this and see
      how close series of different lengths actually do come to a square
      wave.  With Mtool this is possible.  The following script shows how
      to get a plot of the series when it has nine terms:
  
  
  
                f(t) = a + b + c + d
                  where a = 1/2 + 2*cos(t)/p - 2*cos(3*t)/(3*p)
                        b = 2*cos(5*t)/(5*p) - 2*cos(7*t)/(7*p)
                        c = 2*cos(9*t)/(9*p) - 2*cos(11*t)/(11*p)
                        d = 2*cos(13*t)/(13*p) - 2*cos(15*t)/(15*p)
  
  
  
                1) Evaluate at a single point.
                2) Evaluate over a range of points.
                3) Integrate.
                4) Both 2 and 3.
                5) Derivative.
                6) Solve.
                7) Graph.
                Enter choice: 7
  
                What is the value of p: 3.141592654
  
                Lower limit of t:      0.0000
                Upper limit of t:     10.0000
                Number of subdivisions(even for integration):  200
                Automatic y-axis scaling(Y/N): y
  
  
           Once again, after a wait of about a minute or so, you'll be able
      to see just how close this series approximates a square wave.  If you
      want you can zoom in on any part of the curve simply by choosing
      "same" on the loop menu and resetting the range over which to plot.
