## Information about "PC-ZIPPER"

    Why not speed up your computer?  PC-ZIPPER is software that will do
    exactly that without sacrificing performance.  The speed of a PC, XT, AT
    or even a 386 (and their clones) is rather arbitrarily determined by the
    manufacturer.  In actuality, if all the memory in your computer is sound
    there is no reason why you can't be running a little faster.  And who
    doesn't want to run a little faster?
    
    Ziptest is the first of two programs that come with PC-ZIPPER.  This
    utility calls procedures, executes a routine, times it, and then
    records the results.  Upon completion, Ziptest checks to find which
    procedure resulted in an increase in processor speed.  The results
    create a curve, where the optimum system performance is at the "crest"
    of the curve.  Zip, the main program, then can be set to maximize the
    speed of your computer.
    
    If you didn't understand all that, then just believe it works.
    PC-ZIPPER increased the speed of this reviewer's AT by nearly one full
    MHz according to Landmarks Speed test (note that no speed testing
    software is included with PC-ZIPPER).  You don't have to understand it
    to use it -- it's easy to install and control even for the beginner.
    PC-ZIPPER will check for weak or faulty memory, it can be turned off
    without rebooting, and it can be used to slow your computer
    slightly.  And, best of all, it uses NO memory.

          PC-ZIPPER is a utility that will speed up your system.  It
          works on a PC, a PC-XT, a PC-AT, a 386 and their clones.
          It is fully compatible with all software; DOS version is not
          important; and PC-ZIPPER is not memory resident.

          This version is User Supported and registration is expected
          if you decide to use the program.   A modest fee of $9.95 is
          required for registration.   Upon registration, you will
          receive a registered copy of the current version of PC-ZIPPER.
          A no-nonsense site license is also available for a modest fee.

          For registration, please write to:   LAWRENCE SOFTWARE

          ZipTest is a utility for use with PC-Zipper to determine the
          optimum speed for your system.  The utility calls each procedure,
          executes a routine, times it, and then records the results.  Upon
          completion, ZipTest checks to find which procedure resulted in a
          negligible increase in processor speed.

          Optimum system performance results at the "crest" of the curve. 
          See the following graph example:


            |
            |
            |                                            *
          B |                       _|_ *
          E |                   *    |
          N |
          C |            *
          H |
          M |        *
          A |
          R |
          K |     *
            |
            |   *
            -------------------------|---------------------
                A B .....            K                   W


          In this example, ZipTest would recommend command line parameter
          "K" for use with PC-Zipper.

          Use of a higher parameter will not significantly increase your
          system speed and might cause errors if you have weak or defective
          memory chips.  If the use of ZipTest results in a system error
          before reaching completion, you probably have at least one
          defective memory chip.  Make note of the maximum speed reached and
          use PC-Zipper with a command line parameter several levels lower.

          PC-Zipper and ZipTest are copyrighted programs of Lawrence
          Software.  They are distributed as User Supported Software and
          registration is requested if you find the program useful.  For a
          registered copy of PC-Zipper (including ZipTest) send $9.95 to
          Lawrence Software.

          Thank you for your support !

          Best regards,



          Jim Lawrence
