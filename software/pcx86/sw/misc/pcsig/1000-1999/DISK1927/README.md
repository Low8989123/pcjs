## Information about "BRAINSTORM! 1 OF 2 (2305 ALSO)"

    BRAINSTORM is a new approach to group problem solving.  It facilitates
    network group discussions by allowing users to respond to any number of
    organized "topics" instead of to individual people.
    
    Most E-Mail packages allow user A to send a message to user B, and
    perhaps send a carbon copy to users C, D, and E.  While this type of
    message management is ideal for individual communication, it falls
    short when the goal is to gather feedback from a group while keeping
    everyone abreast of the project status.
    
    BRAINSTORM is "topic" structured, not "user" structured. Messages
    and replies don't even include a reference to the addressee. The focal
    point of a BRAINSTORM message is the "topic." Any user can go to any
    topic and read what others have written there. BRAINSTORM keeps track
    of what a user has already read and what's still unread.
    
    BRAINSTORM is not a replacement to your existing E-Mail package.  It is
    a supplemental program to structure communication between your network
    users.  Network-compatible with Novell 2.0a and above, Banyan Vines 2.x
    or above, or any network which supports DOS 3.x file
    and record-locking, or the Share command.

Most E-Mail packages which come with a network allow user "A" to send a

and "E."  While this type of message management is ideal for individual 
communication, it falls short when the goal is to gather feedback from a

BRAINSTORM is not "user" structured, but rather "topic" structured.     
Messages and replies do not even include a reference to whom the message
is addressed.  The focal point of a BRAINSTORM message is the "topic."  
Any user can then go to a topic and read what others have written       
there.  BRAINSTORM keeps track of what a user has already read,         
and what's new to read.
