## Information about "ELECTRONIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS"

    ELECTRONIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (EIS) is an electronic bulletin board and
    more. You get more than a way for people to call and put up
    messages and read those posted by others. EIS is a complete
    information retrieval system. It is an invaluable electronic mail and
    communication tool for small businesses and BBS operators with a
    complete security system to prevent intrusion.
    
    EIS offers compatibility with many of the utilities and games written
    for a slew of other BBS systems. EIS offers support for the PCRelay BBS
    networking software, and offers support for a multi-node system.
    Supported file transfer protocols include Xmodem, Xmodem-CRC, Xmodem-1K,
    True Ymodem Batch, and Zmodem CRC-32 with MobyTurbo and Crash Recovery.
    EIS operates at baud rates from 300 to 38,400 bps on any com port that
    you have available. The ANSI Message editor will allow your user to do
    full-screen message entry and editing. EIS can run up to 10,000 nodes
    on a local area network.
    
    EIS will manage an unlimited number of message bases and file areas and
    can hold about two billion messages in each message base. EIS is 100%
    compatible with the MegaMail Off-line reader, and with the PCRelay BBS
    networking system. EIS will run doors designed to run with about 30
    different BBS systems.
    
    Installation is a breeze, there is no complicated copying or editing
    necessary to get a fully-functional system on-line. Installation
    involves putting the disk in the A: drive and typing INSTALL. Before
    you know it, you will be logging into your own BBS.
    
    EIS is perfect for your small business, too. There is a secure E-Mail
    system and support for general message bases. You can display catalogs
    and take orders. You can keep secure and public file directories of
    files for your customers and staff to download. Your customers will
    love having BBS support, and your staff will love to be able to call in
    and grab that file they forgot at the office or send secure E-Mail.
    
    If you want, you can emulate a traditional BBS. Or you can configure
    your system to be unique from every other information system on the
    market today and to match your own specific needs. If you are looking
    into BBS or information retrieval systems for any reason, EIS is exactly
    what you are looking for.

Program Description
-------------------

      EIS is a remote information management system.  Like a Bulletin Board
System, people can call the system running EIS with their modems from their
computer.  Once they connect to the EIS System, they are able to retrieve
information in the form of text files, downloads, and electronic mail.  The
way that the information is stored and presented is designed by the Sysop,
who runs the EIS system.  Using the powerfull "E" Language, the sysop can
make their EIS system do exactly what they want.

      Because of this flexability, EIS can be used for a variety of purposes
from a traditional BBS system, a catalog and order entry system, an information
database, or a communications center for a busy organization.  You can even
run your own mini-Compuserve!

      EIS Supports many file transfer protocols including Xmodem, Xmodem-CRC,
Xmodem-1K, True Ymodem Batch, and Zmodem CRC-32 with MobyTurbo and Crash
Recovery.  EIS operates at baud rates from 300 to 38,400 bps on any comm
port that you have available.  The ANSI Message editor will allow your
user to do full-screen message entry and editing.  EIS can be run up to
ten thousand nodes on a local area network.

      EIS will manage an unlimited number of message bases and file areas.
EIS can hold about two billion messages in each message base.  EIS is 100%
compatible with the MegaMail Off-line reader, and with the PCRelay BBS
Networking system.  EIS will run doors designed to run with about thirty
different BBS systems.


Unique Features of EIS
----------------------

      Not only is EIS a full-featured BBS system, but it is unique from
any other BBS system in one respect.  You can make EIS do and look like
whatever you want.  You decide how you want your BBS organized, what
the menus look like, and what functions are available from any menu.  You
can define your own new user questionaire.  Basically everything can be
changed to suit the needs of the sysop.

      Because of this unbelieveable configurability, you can set up your
system exactly the way you want it.  EIS can be a private email system,
a public BBS system, a catalog and order entry system, an on-line testing
system, a private BBS, or anything else that requires remote interaction
over a modem.  Because of the power of EIS along with the configurability
you can even set up a system that could rival CompuServe.  Anything is
possible with EIS.


Improvements From v2.0
----------------------

      EIS is a complete rewrite of EIS.  It is now written in efficient
Turbo C.  EIS is now even more configurable, and is much more powerful.
A new ANSI Editor has been added, and support for additional file transfer
protocols have been added.
