## Information about "LOTTO BUSTER"

    If your dream has always been to strike it rich in the Lottery,
    maybe FreeBooter's LOTTO BUSTER can help you reach that goal.  An
    easy-to-use database program allows you to store your local
    Lotto drawings so you can track which numbers are hot and which
    numbers are not!  With a little bit of research -- the program works
    best when you can investigate at least the last 100 Lotto drawings --
    you may be able to turn the odds into your favor by examining the
    patterns in your Lotto series.
    
    An easy-to-follow setup menu configures the program to your particular
    system before you can begin -- after that it's up to you to enter the
    correct Lotto information.  Color screens (if available on your system)
    and pull down menus also add to the usability of this program.
    Different "types" of information can be viewed -- frequently picked
    numbers, less frequent numbers, and the "hot" sheet which selects the
    hottest numbers based upon the last twenty weeks of history.  You can
    also pick your own numbers to wheel.  Remember, without history, this
    program is valueless!

       This is a brief description to acquaint you with the operation of
       the LOTTO BUSTER program.  We have designed the program to be as
       easy as possible without the need for help screens.  This manual
       will aid you to more fully understand the program's functions.


       DISK FILES AND THEIR USAGE

       The LOTTO BUSTER program is written in QUICK BASIC and is
       complied into a EXE program.  The source code is not available
       for this program.

       LOTTO.EXE      Introduction program
       LOTTO5.EXE     Main LOTTO BUSTER program
       CONVERT.EXE    Older data file conversion program
       LOTOSCAN.EXE   Ticket scanning module
       REGISTER.EXE   Registration module
       BRUN45.EXE     Runtime module for program
       RANDOMNO.DAT   Wheeling matrix data file


       Lotto Buster Anomalies:

       Some VGA monitors will not work in the VGA mode with the new
       LOTTO BUSTER.  If this should occur with your VGA monitor, use
       the software supplied with your monitor to change the mode to
       EGA.  Once this has been accomplished, LOTTO BUSTER will run
       just fine.

       DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY
       Congratulations!  You now possess one of the best tools on the market
       for unlocking the riches that await those who play the state lotteries.
       By using the systems that are on this disk, you can improve your
       chances of winning by 550%.  Keep in mind, though, there is no sure
       way to win the lotto.  The only thing you can do is improve your odds
       by using a wheeling system.

       Any lottery betting program relies on a certain amount of "luck,"
       and the more advanced programs, like the LOTTO BUSTER, attempt to
       unlock the biases that are built into the lottery number selection
       system.

       You may feel that your lottery is totally unbiased, but I assure you,
       it is not!  ANY mechanical selection process involves biases that
       show up in the long run.  These biases can be played on to your ad-
       vantage and profit.

       There is no such thing as "hot" numbers or "hot" combinations.  The
       only winning advantage is the biases that cannot be taken out.  Sure,
       they can be mitigated, but not taken out entirely.

       Here in Oregon we use ping pong balls that are dropped into an air
       blowing hopper.  These balls are then thoroughly mixed in the hopper
       and pop up one at a time as the six ball vents are opened.  What
       could be more arbitrary?  Well, consider the following

         1. Are all the balls exactly the same weight?  Don't you think
            there will be some infinitesimal difference?

         2. How about the paint on the balls?  Wouldn't you think that
            the number 40 would weigh more than the number 1, and shouldn't
            the number 1 come up faster into the ball vent then the 40 ball?

         3. But, if there are more numbers on the ball causing additional
            surface irregularities, wouldn't the added friction of the air-
            stream on the ball irregularities cause the number 40  ball to
            rise faster than the number 1 ball?


       There are two ways that anyone can play the lottery:  dumb luck,
       which only occurs by chance; and, although still luck,  smart luck
       using a system.  With a system you can get the odds to push with you
       and significantly increase your chances of winning.









                                       3



       Everyone plays the lottery every day!

       EVERYDAY! You bet!  Every day you select which traffic lane is going
       to move faster or which grocery checker will get you through first.
       When you do this you are playing a form of lottery.

       How do you select the best grocery line?  With information. Right?
       You look at the line and look at the number of units in each grocery
       cart, and, if you happen to know the clerks in that particular store,
       you know which ones are slow and which aren't.  You then select the
       least items in the shortest line with the fastest checker.

       What about getting stuck in a traffic tie-up on the freeway?  Blind
       luck. Right?  You don't know what has caused the delay.  You also
       don't know which lane is moving faster because you can't see ahead.
       But what if you had information?  What if a traffic helicopter is
       overhead and you are tuned to the correct station and the announcer
       says that there's a traffic accident on the inside lane of the west
       bound freeway at a certain location?  You'd know enough to move the
       the outside lane for a faster route through the tie-up.

       It's no different with the LOTTO BUSTER.  It's going to supply you
       with information to improve your odds for winning.

       Historically, lotteries have been around since mankind crawled out
       of the caves.  The casting of lots is talked about in several places
       in the Bible.  Even the separation of the promised land was done by
       lots.

       China is credited with being the ancestral home of such gambling
       games as Bingo, Keno and the Lottery.  The lottery as we know it
       today goes back to the Middle Ages in Italy.  From there it spread
       to the rest of Europe.

       The American settlers brought it to this country in the early 1600s.
       Proceeds from the state and local lotteries were used to finance the
       construction of roads, bridges, schools, and to support the poor.

       The lotteries were an integral part of the American culture until
       they became corrupted.  Near the end of the nineteenth century the
       lotteries were banned until the early sixties when they were restarted
       in New Hampshire.

       The LOTTO BUSTER is designed to work with any lottery up to 100
       numbers and a pick five, six, or pick seven combination.

       There are several other variations such as the daily numbers of
       pick-4, pick-3, and the instant scratch games, but the predictability
       of these games is minimal and the reward so small that it isn't worth
       the trouble to use any system on these methods.

       The real action is in the lottery games that are worth millions of
       dollars.  The pick-5 to pick 7 game is what it's all about.



                                       4

                   UN-ARCHIVING THE LOTTO BUSTER PROGRAM


       Version 5.0 is quite large due to the pull down menus and "windowing"
       effects used in the program.  It will be necessary to un-archive
       the programs onto a separate disk.


       FLOPPY DISK USERS: Simply place the current disk in drive A and
       a newly formatted disk in drive B and  type the command UNARC B:
       Don't forget the colon.  The disk will un-archive to the B drive.
       There is only enough room on the floppy  to hold 1 lottery.  If
       you are using more than one lottery you'll need to make another
       copy.  The program can include more than on lottery but you'll need
       a hard disk for that.

       HARD DISK USERS: Place the Lotto Buster disk in drive A and enter
       UNARC C:  You may also use D:, E:, or F:.  The un-archiving pro-
       ceedure will automatically make a new directory LOTTO and un-
       archive the program for you.

       After un-archiving the LOTTO BUSTER diskette, make a backup copy.
       Follow the instructions in your DOS manual for this procedure.



       NOTE TO 5 1/4" FLOPPY DISK USERS ONLY.

       Since the disk is completely full, there is only room for one
       lottery on the disk.  You'll have to DELETE LOTTO AMERICA
       before you can place another lottery on the disk.

       That file can be deleted from within the program by going to
       the file delete mode.

       IF YOU ARE CONVERTING FROM A EARLIER ISSUE OF LOTTO BUSTER IT
       WILL BE NECESSARY TO COPY THE UN-ARCHIVED DISK ONTO ANOTHER DISK.
       When this is done place the copied disk in drive B and the previous
       issue of LOTTO BUSTER in drive A.

       Go to the B prompt and enter the following:
       DEL AMERICA.LOT
       DEL REGISTER.EXE
       COPY A:LOTTO.DAT

       This will place the old lottery on your newly copied disk.
       REMOVE THE OLD LOTTERY DISK AND INSERT THE ORIGINAL UN-ARCHIVED
       DISK IN DRIVE A

       Start the program and go directly to the conversion menu.  Follow
       through with the conversion and exit the program.

       Then enter the following:
       COPY A:REGISTER.EXE

       This will restore your regisration module onto the disk.


                                       5




       Select the drive, and the directory if applicable, that the LOTTO
       BUSTER is on and type LOTTO. If you have a mouse be sure that you
       have activates it by using the MOUSE command.

       The introductory screen will come up. Press any key to advance to
       the FreeBooter screen.  To pass the FreeBooter screen, press any key.

       The program advances to the next module and a menu bar will appear.
       This bar can be activated by using your mouse or pressing the F1 key.

       On the lower right is the status window displaying the selected
       lottery, the strategy, and the wheel size.  When the program first
       comes up there should be NONE displayed on all catagories.


       The menu bar breaks down as follows:

       FILES Selection


       LOAD:

       Selecting the LOAD function switches screens and brings up the
       data file selection window that displays all the data files
       ending in .LOT.  The program is shipped with LOTTO AMERICA. If
       you have a hard disk, you'll be able to store twelve data files
       with the program.  Move the selection bar using either the
       arrow keys or the mouse.  When you reach the selection you
       desire, press the enter key or the left mouse button.  The data
       file will then load and switch back to the main menu.  You'll
       notice that the lottery data file name in the system status box
       has now changed from NONE to the file name that you have selected.


       ADD:

       To add a files you'll need to know the following information:

        1. How many numbers are selected by the lottery when the winning
           numbers are drawn.  This can range from 5 to 11 depending upon
           which lottery you are playing.

        2. How many number do you select when you purchase a lottery
           ticket.

        3. What is the highest number in the lottery.

        4. Enter a one to eight letter file name for the lottery.

       When you press ADD, another screen will come up asking if you wish
       to proceed or return to the main menu.  This selection can be
       changed by pressing the TAB key.  Pressing the ENTER key while the
       selection is in the PROCEED mode, moves you to the next screen to
       answer the above questions.  Have the answers ahead of time.  After
       entering these answers, you'll be asked if the data is okay.  Answer-
       ing Y will return you to the main menu.  If you wish to work with the
       newly created data file go to the FILES option and LOAD the lottery
       data file. When you enter the lottery history data enter the OLDEST
       data first.  Do not go back further than 104 draws. Entering more
       is a waste of time.  The program is designed to handle only 104
       draws, and when it reaches its max, it just puts the newest one
       in at the top and drops the oldest one out at the bottom.

       DELETE:

       Selecting the DELETE function, will switch you to the delete file mode.
       All the files ending in .LOT will be displayed.  Select the file
       for deletion by using either the up or down arrow or the mouse.

       To delete the file, press the TAB key to the OK selection and press
       ENTER, or move the mouse to the OK selection and press the left mouse
       button.

       To CANCEL this operation, be sure CANCEL is selected and hit the
       ENTER key or the left mouse button.

       Deleting a file erases that files from the database.


       EDIT:

       Selecting the EDIT mode,  switches screens to the edit function.

       The screen comes up with the latest data presented first.  This
       can be moved by using the up and down arrow keys, or moving the
       indicator tab on the right hand side of the screen with the mouse.
       The buttons listed below do the following tasks:

       PgDn - Next Page
       PgUp - Previous Page
       Up/Down Arrows change selection
       Enter - Select highlighted date
       Esc - Leave Editing Mode

       Pressing the ENTER or the left mouse button, puts you into the
       data editor.  You may return to the data line selection screen
       by pressing the Esc key.

       You may at this time delete the current line, add a line directly
       below the current selection, or edit the current line.  The selection
       of actions can be done by using the TAB key.

       Editing the current line relists the data entry screen for that
       line and you can input corrected data at this time.  You'll be
       given the opportunity to verify if the entry is correct.  If it
       is incorrect, use the TAB to move to the REDO selection and press
       ENTER.  Otherwise insure that the selection is on ACCEPT and
       press the left mouse button or the ENTER key.







                                       8




       TICKET:

       ENTER:

       This selection allows you to enter history from the latest lottery
       ticket draws.  You may enter a single draw or several at one time
       if you wish.

       The screen will change and prompt you for the date.  Entry should
       be uniform in nature.  We strongly suggest the following type of
       data entry.

               June 10, 1990 should be entered as 06/10/90
               August 1, 1990 should be entered as 08/01/90

       Its best that the single digit entries be proceeded by a zero.

       Upon entering all the digits for the lottery, you'll be given the
       opportunity to ACCEPT, REDO, or CANCEL.  This can be selected with
       the TAB key or the mouse.  Pressing either the ENTER key or the
       left hand mouse button completes the processes.

       You'll then be asked if you wish to enter another selection.  Again,
       the TAB button or the mouse will change your selection from NO to
       YES.  Pressing either the ENTER or the left hand mouse button comp-
       letes the selection. If you selected NO, you'll be returned to the
       main menu.  YES puts you back into the data entry mode again to
       repeat the entry process.


       TICKET SCANNING:

       This selection will switch you to the lottery scanning mode.

       You'll be given the opportunity to PROCEED or RETURN to the
       main menu.  Again, the TAB key or the mouse will change your
       selection, and the ENTER key or the left hand mouse button will
       activate it.

       You'll be prompted for the drawing date and the ticket numbers
       to enter.  Again, double digit entry is preferred.  Single digit
       dates and single digit drawing numbers should be proceeded by a
       zero.

       You'll be given the opportunity to ACCEPT, CANCEL or REDO.  Cancel
       will return you to the main menu.

       You can then search the following combinations:
        A.LOWEST `HIT' NUMBERS
        B.HIGHEST `HIT' NUMBERS
        C.LATEST `HOT' NUMBERS
        D.SEARCH ALL STRATEGIES
        E.RETURN TO MENU


                                       9






       Selecting A through D will then prompt the following:
        A. 12 NUMBERS
        B. 14 NUMBERS
        C. 16 NUMBERS
        D. 18 NUMBERS
        E. SELECT ALL


       After a few seconds, you may then select the number of hits for
       which to search 3, 4, 5, or 6.  Selecting 3 will also show all
       the other hits as well.  4 will show 4, 5, 6.

       If you have a hit, the beep will sound and display the number of
       hits on the screen.  You will then be given the opportunity to
       display them on the screen or print the results to the printer.

       Again, use the TAB or the mouse to change the SCREEN PRINTER sel-
       ection, and the ENTER key or the left hand mouse button to activate
       the selection.

       When completed, you'll be returned to the first Lottery Scan screen.
       You can run a different search at this time or select option F to
       return to the main menu.  Before going back, you'll be given the
       opportunity to save the entry that you have just put in.  If you
       do save this entry, it will alter the future ticket selections, in
       that, it adds this entry to the database.


       PRINT

       Before you can print anything to the screen, it is necessary to select
       the strategy and wheel size.  If you have not done that before you
       enter the printing modes, the program will automatically switch you to
       those program modes. (See instructions for these operating functions)

       TICKET DRAWING

       The program brings up the Ticket Group Selection Menu.  From here,
       you may select tickets from ten different groups of twenty tickets.
       All groups will use the same numbers that were selected by the
       combined strategy and wheel selection function.

       Once selected, the program will prompt for screen or printer.  Use
       the TAB key or the mouse to change selections. Then press either the
       return or the left mouse button.

       You may repeat the same procedure for different groups to obtain
       additional ticket printings.





                                       10




       DRAWING HISTORY:

       This selection changes the screen to present the lottery drawing
       history.  This selection is similar to the edit function except
       that no changes can be made.  When first entering the history
       module, you'll be given the choice of printer or screen.  This
       selection can be changed by pressing the TAB key and pressing
       ENTER, or moving the selection with the mouse and pressing the
       left button.  The viewing port can be changed by pressing the
       up or down arrow or moving the tab on the right hand side of the
       screen with the mouse.  To return to the main menu, press the
       ENTER key or press the left hand mouse button while the mouse
       indicator is in the text area.

       NUMBER POPULARITY:

       The number popularity display is exactly the same as the drawing
       history.  The popularity will change depending upon the stra-
       tegy that has been selected.  If LOW is selected, then the numbers
       with the lowest incidence of "hitting" will be at the top of the
       list.  If HIGH is selected, then the numbers with the highest
       incidence of "hits" will be at the top.  If HOT is selected, those
       numbers that "hit" most in the last ten draws will be at the top.
       With the HOT selection,  you will see quite a number of zeros
       present at the bottom of the list, since these numbers were not
       selected at all within the last ten draws.


       STRATEGY

       Selection A - This selection has been included for those who
       feel that because a particular number is low in its incidence
       of "hitting," the probability for it to "hit" is now very high.
       This selection counts the number of hits that occurred in the last
       five draws and gives that number one count for each hit.  After
       the fifth draw the program gives each number the value of (1/log(X-2).
       X in the expression is the drawing number history (1 to 104).  As
       you can see, as the history goes farther back, the effect of the
       weighing becomes less and less.  The numbers then sorted with the
       lowest incidence number first and the highest incidence number
       last.

       Selection B - This selection reverses the Selection A mode.
       The weighting is exactly the same and the totals add up to exactly
       the same as they did in selection A.  The difference is, they are
       sorted with the highest value first down to the lowest value.

       Both Selection A and Selection B look at the entire lottery drawing
       history that is available.






                                       11



       Selection C - This selection, the "hot list," is calculated diff-
       erently and seems to be the best method for selecting the lottery
       numbers.

       It looks at the last 10 history drawings.  A number gets one
       point for each time it has hit in the last five drawings.  If
       it has hit in the last five drawings, it gets additional points
       for each time that it hits in the next five drawings.

       If you print the Lotto Popularity Chart, you can see that the
       incidence of hit spread between Selection B and Selection C
       becomes significantly greater.  When this document was written
       during June, 1990, the Lotto America history showed that the number
       one had hit five times, 16 and 51 had hit three times, and 29
       numbers had not hit at all!

       This strategy will print the numbers from the highest hit to
       the lowest in that order.

       WHEEL SIZE

       Once the strategy is selected, the size of the selection "wheel"
       needs to be determined.

       The "wheel" is actually a complex mathematical formula that is
       stored within the program and governs the selection placement
       of the lottery numbers on the ticket printout.   These data values
       will place the numbers in a designated order that will render the
       greatest possible return for the smallest investment.  The wheel
       size has nothing at all to do with the number of thickets that are
       selected. It only deals with the quantity of numbers that are
       allowed into the selection matrix.

       Examples of wheel size selection and expected results: (this
       assumes you are making a 42 ticket purchase and using the pick
       six combination)

       12 system - Selects twelve numbers from the strategy selection.
       If all numbers drawn by the state lottery are in the selections
       that were drawn by the computer, you are assured of a second place.
       But, there could be four second places.  If only four numbers
       match, you can expect at least one third place.

       14 system - Selects fourteen numbers from the strategy profile.
       If five of the numbers match, you can be assured of a third place
       prize.

       16 system -  Selects sixteen numbers from the strategy profile.
       If six of the numbers match, you can be assured of winning at
       least one third prize.

       18 system -  Selects eighteen numbers from the strategy profile.
       If six of the numbers match, you will win at least one third place.



                                       12





       The following are rules that you should consider when determining
       the wheel size.

       RULE #1  -  As the wheel size increases, the possibility of getting
                   a first or second prize decreases.

       RULE #2  -  As the wheel size increases, the probability of winning
                   a third place also increases, providing, all numbers that
                   were drawn in the lottery are in the selection.

       RULE #3  -  As the wheel size decreases, the probability of winning
                   a first place increases, providing, all numbers that were
                   drawn in the lottery are in the wheel selection.

       CONVERSION:

       This module will convert the previous version of LOTTO.DAT
       to the new format used by LOTTO BUSTER.

       Floppy disk system: 5 1/4"

       Since the disk is completely full, there is only room for one
       lottery on the disk.  You'll have to DELETE LOTTO AMERICA
       before you can place another lottery on the disk.

       That file can be deleted from within the program by going to
       the file delete mode.

       IF YOU ARE CONVERTING FROM A EARLIER ISSUE OF LOTTO BUSTER IT
       WILL BE NECESSARY TO COPY THE UN-ARCHIVED DISK ONTO ANOTHER DISK.
       When this is done place the copied disk in drive B and the previous
       issue of LOTTO BUSTER in drive A.

       Go to the B prompt and enter the following:
       DEL AMERICA.LOT
       COPY A:LOTTO.DAT

       This will place the old lottery on your newly copied disk.
       REMOVE THE OLD LOTTERY DISK AND INSERT THE ORIGINAL UN-ARCHIVED
       DISK IN DRIVE A

       Start the program and go directly to the conversion menu.  Follow
       through with the conversion and exit the program.



       Floppy disk system: 3 1/2"

       There is plenty of room on the 3 1/2" disk for multiple lottery
       files.  Just copy the program LOTTO.DAT onto the new disk and
       start the program.


       Hard disk systems:

       Make a directory for the new LOTTO BUSTER and copy the whole
       disk onto the new directory.  Then copy the LOTTO.DAT file from
       the old LOTTO BUSTER program onto the new LOTTO BUSTER directory
       and start the program.





                                       14


       All systems:

       Once the program is started, go into the conversion mode.  The
       program will ask the name of the new file.  For example, if you
       were running the New York lottery, you may wish to name it
       NEWYORK.  This will change the name of the LOTTO.DAT file to
       NEWYORK.LOT.  Depending on the version of the file that you are
       converting, the program may ask you for the number of numbers drawn
       by the lottery, the number of numbers that you select for a ticket,
       and the highest number of the lottery.  When all the necessary
       questions are answered, you will return to the main menu.  From
       there, you can go into the FILE LOAD mode and load that data file.


       If you win on the lottery, we would like to hear from you and share
       in the spirit of your win.  We are keeping records of success stories
       like yours.  We don't need your name - only what you won, and what
       state lottery you were playing.  You can call us on 1-800-366-4012.

       Remember, only thing that keeps our user supported software going are
       the donations (registrations) that FreeBooter(tm) Software receives for
       its continuing work in updating the LOTTO BUSTER to a better and better
       product.

       The program is copyrighted by FreeBooter Software.  There
       is only one thing that we request from the registered end user.

       Do not give out a copy of a registered disk.

       If you help us out in this respect, then the registration will
       continue  to come in and the product will continue to be improved.

Program Description:

Lotto Buster is one of the best tools on the market for unlocking
the riches that await those who play the state lotteries. By using
the systems that are on this disk, you can improve your chances of
winning by 550%.  Keep in mind, though, there is no sure way to win
the lotto.  The only thing you can do is improve your odds by using
a system. Any lottery betting program relies on a certain amount of
"luck,"  and the more advanced programs, like the LOTTO BUSTER,
attempt to unlock the biases that are built into the lottery number
selection system.

Please don't forget the authors if you decide these programs are useful
to you.  The small charge they ask for their work is only appropriate
compensation.
