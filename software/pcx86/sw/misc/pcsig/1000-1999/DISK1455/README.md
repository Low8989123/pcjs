## Information about "MICRO EMACS 2 OF 2 (ALSO 1431)"

    MICRO-EMACS is the baby brother of the powerful mainframe wordprocessor
    EMACS.  Experienced EMACS users will enjoy the convenience of using the
    same editor that they use on mainframes.  This PC version has all the
    functions of its bigger relative, with some PC niceties like 43-line
    EGA mode.
    
    MICRO-EMACS has several facilities that go beyond simple editing tasks
    like insertion and deletion.  These include multiple buffers and files,
    virtually unlimited file size, on-line help, file encryption, wild card
    search/replace, and many modes of operation on files, such as read-only
    viewing, C-mode for programmers working on source code, or wrap-mode for
    documents.  The system is extremely flexible due to an extensive
    built-in macro command language which lets the experienced user create
    or re-map any command.  The complete C source code to the program is
    also provided.
    
    EMACS is a two disk set, the second disk is #1455.
