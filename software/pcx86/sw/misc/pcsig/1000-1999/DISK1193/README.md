## Information about "ACCOUNTING 101"

    ACCOUNTING 101 is an easy-to-use, menu-driven accounting program
    designed for the average home user or small business owner. With this
    program you can do basic accounting operations such as recording
    deposits, making journal entries, recording accounts payable, and
    closing your accounts at the end of each month and year. ACCOUNTING 101
    automatically lists your income and expense totals for the year-to-date
    and the current month. This program allows you to change the accounting
    numbers and categories to suit your own financial situation.
    
    ACCOUNTING 101 can print a variety of reports: a deposit journal, an
    accounting journal, a check journal, a trial balance, a balance sheet,
    your account numbers, an account activity report, and an income
    statement.
