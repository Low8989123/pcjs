## Information about "CHARGE ACCOUNT MANAGER"

    CHARGE ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT provides an easy and enjoyable way to manage
    all of your charge account records. This program allows you to
    determine your charged expenses by category and provides valuable
    accounting reports. Menus guide you through entering and maintaining
    charge account transactions. Each transaction can consist of charges,
    payments, or interest.
    
    CHARGE ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT provides many valuable reports. Reports can
    be generated for one category, charges, payments, interest, or all
    categories for a particular date or a range of dates. Full editing
    functions are supported for all transaction fields. The program is
    menu-driven, fully documented, and provides an on-line help facility.
    CHARGE ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT can support a maximum of 3000 transactions if
    the transaction data is kept on a separate disk, 2000 transactions if
    the program and the transaction data are on the same disk.
