## Information about "HP LASERJET SOFT FONTS & UTILITIES"

    SOFT FONTS AND UTILITIES is a boon to laser printer owners.  Imagine a
    great font downloader, handy utilities, and a wealth of incredibly
    useful soft fonts -- all in one package!
    
    For headlines, you get 21 point Broadway font with a Ventura width table
    and matching EGA screen font.  To complicate things, try a set of 24
    point symbols such as copyrights, bullets and circled numbers.
    
    Next, drop down to 10 or 12 point typefaces.  You get proportionally
    spaced Roman Times in bold, italic and medium.  Likewise, you get
    proportionally spaced Helvetica fonts in bold, italic and medium.  If
    that's not enough, try Garamond in medium, bold and italic.  For
    headlines try the 18 point Helvetica and Roman fonts.
    
    An elegant Century Legal is buttressed by an extended character set with
    a number of useful symbols.  It includes printer drivers for MS Word and
    WordPerfect.  The proportionally spaced Script soft font and the Greek
    font will give your documents variety.  Programmers can document
    routines with the font filled with keyboard characters.
    
    The download program is as elegant as the typefaces.  You can use it to
    download any HP compatible font.  If you prefer, it will assign an ID
    number of your choice and designate primary or secondary and permanent
    or temporary status for a font.  The utility can download directly from
    archived files.
    
    Print a sample sheet of any particular font -- a handy utility if you've
    come across a disk full of fonts.  Another utility will print out the
    sort of technical information on typefaces graphic artists delight in.
    A final program gives you information on LaserJet and DeskJet font
    formats.

                    VENDOR.DOC file for TSR Download

The copying restrictions listed in this file apply to any individual, organ-
ization, user group, or business that charges ANY fee for the distribution of 
the Shareware program TSR Download produced by Elfring Soft Fonts. TSR Down-
load along with its associated files and documentation is NOT in the public 
domain. All programs and data files are Copyright 1988, 1989, 1990 by Elfring 
Soft Fonts. All rights are reserved. Distribution restriction rights are
claimed under that copyright and are outlined below.

  * No organization may sell the Shareware version of TSR Download without
  prior written permission from Elfring Soft Fonts, the copyright holder. ASP
  approved vendors may start distribution without prior approval, but must
  still notify us in writing that they are distributing our product. To apply
  for such permission send a written request to:

  Elfring Soft Fonts
  P.O. Box 61
  Wasco, IL 60183
  USA

  * No organization may bundle the shareware version of TSR Download with any
  other hardware or software product without the prior written permission of
  Elfring Soft Fonts.

  * Vendor standards expected of distributors are summarized in this file. 
  Under no condition will permission to distribute be given to any organ-
  ization who does not agree to follow the standards. The vendor standards 
  are based on those established for vendor associate members of the Assoc-
  iation of Shareware Professionals. ASP vendor members will be granted 
  permission to distribute TSR Download; if you are already a member of ASP, 
  please mention it in your request for distribution.

  * TSR Download, when listed in vendors' catalogs, advertisements, brochures,
  mailers, etc. must be named "TSR Download" and not some other pseudonym like 
  "Downloader", "font manager", or just "Download".  Use of any other name 
  than "TSR Download" will constitute cause for revocation of distribution 
  rights.

  * The TSR Download program and files may not be sold as part of some other
  more inclusive package without the express permission of Elfring Soft Fonts.

  * TSR Download must not be distributed with other Shareware or public domain
  programs on the same disk.  However, TSR Download may be included in librar-
  ies sold on CD-ROM disks.

  * Under no conditions will TSR Download be "rented" or leased to others.

  * Any distribution of TSR Download over bulletin boards and/or national tel-
  ecommunication services will be limited to distributing a single archived 
  file containing the contents of the entire distribution disk.

The shareware registration fee for TSR Download is $45.00. All payments must
be made in U.S. Funds. Shipping and Handling is an additional $4.00 for 
domestic customers, $5.50 for Canada & Mexico, and $8.00 for all other cus-
tomers. Payment may be with VISA or MASTERCARD, postal money order, and 
checks, in which the amount must be expressed in U.S. Funds and drawn on a 
U.S. Bank.

==============================================================================

The following is a summary of ASP vendor standards. This summary is just that, 
a summary, and is not to be taken as a statement of the entire set of ASP 
standards.

Advertising:

All vendor advertisements and brochures must state that "Shareware programs 
require separate payment to authors if found useful."  This statement must 
immediately follow the price or be tied to the price via an asterisk.

Catalogs:

Vendors will attempt to educate users on the nature of Shareware. The 
following points must be covered in any catalog of disks:

  * The fee paid to the vendor is a copying and distribution charge and
  does not cover the cost of the program itself.

  * If the user finds a Shareware program to be of use, he/she is expected 
  to send the registration fee to the author.

  * Registration entitles the user to various rights and benefits (depending
  on the author). These range from the legal right to continue using the 
  software, to printed documentation and/or higher levels of service.

Distribution:

  * Vendors will respect the copyright and all distribution restrictions made 
  by individual authors, usually found in the file VENDOR.DOC [this file] on 
  the disk.

  * Vendors will provide a written notice covering the three concepts above 
  with all Shareware programs shipped. If disks are prepackaged, the notice 
  must be on a visible part of the package.

  * Vendors will not change or delete ANY files supplied with the program 
  unless authorized by the author. Small additions designed to assist the 
  user may be added if the author does not specifically prohibit such action.

  * Vendors agree to stop distributing a program, including earlier versions, 
  if requested by the author.

Again, the above is a SUMMARY of the ASP vendor standards. In order to dis-
tribute TSR Download you must agree to abide by these standards whether you 
are an ASP member or not. If you are interested in becoming an ASP-approved 
vendor, please contact:

   Association of Shareware Professionals
   Vendor Certification Committee
   P.O. Box 5786
   Bellevue, WA 98006

We strongly recommend that you consider becoming an ASP approved vendor if you 
have not already done so. The ASP vendor member program reduces the workload 
for both authors and vendors alike, and helps give customers confidence that 
reasonable standards are met in the distribution of Shareware products.

## VENTURA.DOC

{% raw %}
```
                          USING ESF FONTS WITH VENTURA

All LaserJet fonts on this disk are compatible with Ventura Publisher. To
use these fonts in Ventura they must first be converted into Ventura format.
To convert these fonts you need your Ventura Disk #11.

Step 1) Build new VFM files. (Ventura Font Metric width tables) Find the 
Ventura program HPLTOVFM.EXE. Run this program for each soft font found in
this set.

HPLTOVFM SM180PRN.USP /F=SYMBOLS /N=37 /P=18 /W=N

Where /F= is the typeface name which MUST start with a capitol letter
      /N= is the typeface number (look these up in you Ventura manual)
      /P= is the point size of the font
      /W= weight of the font, N=normal, I=italic, B=bold, T=bold italic

Step 2) Make an ASCII text file that lists the name of each VFM file created 
in step 1. (Must end in ".LST".) One file name per line. The file names must
be listed in point size order smallest to largest, with styles listed in:
normal, italic, bold, bold italic order.

Step 3) Use the Ventura VFMTOWID.EXE program and the LST file from step 2
plus the VFM files to create a width table.

VFMTOWID ESFSHARE.LST /N=CORDATA

Where ESFSHARE.LST is the list file created in step 2,
      /N= the device switch for your printer (look up Operations - Set Printer
          Info menu in Ventura. The portion before the comma is all that 
          matters.

Step 4) Convert the HP format fonts to Ventura B30 format using the Ventura
utility HPLTOFNT.

HPLTOFNT TR120RPN.USP /F=Roman /N=5 /P=12 /W=N

Step 5) Merge the width tables and clean up. Run Ventura and select Options -
Add Remove Fonts - Merge Width Table. Then go back and delete the ".USP" fonts
since they are not used by Ventura.


```

## WINDOWS.DOC

{% raw %}
```
                      USING ESF SOFT FONTS WITH WINDOWS

Step 1) You must build "PFM" files for Windows before you can actually
install the soft fonts. Both Windows and PageMaker come with a utility
called PCLPFM.EXE that creates these "PFM" files. Run the program:

PCLPFM SM180RPN.USP SM180RPN.PFM Symbols D

where: SM180RPN.USP is a font file name
       SM180RPN.PFM is the name to be used for the PFM file
       Symbols is the typeface name
       D= W for Swiss screen font
          R for Roman screen font
          M for Modern screen font
          S for Script screen font
          D for decorative screen font

Step 2) Use the APPNDWIN.INI file produced from step 1 above to modify
you Windows WIN.INI file. This tells Windows what soft fonts you want
installed.
