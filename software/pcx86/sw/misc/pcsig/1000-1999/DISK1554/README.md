## Information about "REVELATION TUTORIAL"

    This is a scriptural tutorial for anyone interested in exploring the
    Book of Revelations. The author, a minister, offers a fresh perspective
    on this work for those who have studied the Bible and a measured
    overview for those with little or no background in Revelations.
    
    Two methods of teaching are used. One type of questions provides
    familiarity with, and tests for, details of the scriptural references
    covered in the eight lessons. Multiple-choice, fill-the-blanks, and
    yes/no quizzes test for knowledge of such items as: how many, who, or
    what? Details are referenced scripturally, and at several points in the
    program the current material is summarized. At the end of the disk, a
    comprehensive self-test is provided. The other type of question
    explores the meanings behind the details. Interpretive exercises are
    designed to aid insight into the references and symbols used throughout
    the book.
    
    The author has used "The New International Version" of the Bible as the
    source document for the tutorial. Most of the lessons can be completed
    in an hour or less but some do run longer. Provision has been made to
    permit the user to leave the tutorial and reenter at the same point at
    a later time.
