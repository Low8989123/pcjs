## Information about "MORAFF'S REVENGE"

    Science fiction author Steve Moraff brings one of the most complex and
    beguiling dungeons and dragons games to shareware.  Though called a
    beginners game, few will find it easy.  With 70 levels, batallions of
    monsters and no clear cut rules, this adventure resembles life itself.
    This game has no single, simple object.  Not even survival qualifies.
    Generally, the game involves equipping, fighting, exploring and healing.
    
    New characters begin their odyssey with only a knife and no money.  The
    characters must kill monsters, some of which are virtually indomitable,
    and find treasures to get money, weapons and cures.  Even character
    improvement is a key to scoring in this game.  The most exciting goal is
    to find the fountain of youth on the 70th level.  A more typical
    expedition would call on a character to enter the dungeon and kill
    monsters and discover treasure.  Then, the character returns and cashes
    in treasure at the bank, and sleeps at an inn to gain "spell points" and
    gain greater power.  The character can then buy weapons with his extra
    money and reenter the dungeon to tackle even more powerful monsters.
    
    Though this program uses simple ASCII graphics to represent the
    characters and rooms, the game's mapping system still adds to the
    excitement.  The right side of the screen offers a three dimensional
    view of all four directions.  Monsters become visible far down the
    corridor.
