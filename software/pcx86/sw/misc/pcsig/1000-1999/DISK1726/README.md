## Information about "PHONE"

    PHONE is a simple, easy-to-use telephone dialing program that delivers
    as much, or more than, it promises.  The author says he tried to
    make his program fast, simple, versatile, easy-to-use, fun, useful, and
    colorful.  And he did!  PHONE makes phone calling fun.  The
    program is easy and straightforward to use, and the screen is well
    organized and attractive.
    
    PHONE will hold 19 separate databases with 21 phone numbers per
    database.  It is usable from a floppy or hard disk.  It was intended to
    avoid "ram wars" by being non-resident, but you can use the PHONE from
    DOS without actually entering the program.
