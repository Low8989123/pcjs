## Information about "BROTHER'S KEEPER 2 OF 2 (1504)"

    BROTHER'S KEEPER helps you keep track of all your brothers, sisters,
    aunts, uncles, and other relatives going back generations!
    
    In the hobby of genealogy, you never know just who or what you'll find
    once you start tracing your family tree!  BROTHER'S KEEPER allows you
    to gather and organize the tidbits of ancestral history you uncover and
    will print the information in a variety of helpful ways. Included are:
    ancestor charts, family group sheets, alphabetical name lists,
    descendant trees, birthday lists, custom reports, and ahnentafel
    charts. (This is a chart which lists ancestors of a person, with
    standard code numbers that show relationships, such as parent,
    grandparent, etc., instead of using lines to graphically indicate the
    relationships.)
    
    Two disk drives, or a hard drive, are recommended, but the program will
    work with one disk drive.  You can record over 1000 names on a 360K
    disk, or 15,000 with a hard drive.  For each person entered, you may
    include date of birth, date of death, and three other significant dates
    of your choosing. In addition, you may store place of birth, place of
    death, and three other places of important events.  You also may enter
    two additional fields, which you define.  Each person can have up to
    seven message lines of additional data, or a text file of unlimited size
    containing additional data that is linked to his record.
    
    Up to eight marriages may be recorded for each of your more fickle
    forebears.  Each record can hold a marriage date, a place of marriage,
    one additional date and place, and can store up to 24 children -- very
    useful if you are related to the Waltons!
    
    The GEDCOM file transfer standard is used so that data can be shared
    with other genealogists and amateur family tree-ers who use different
    programs.  This is one of the most intriguing aspects of genealogy --
    the joining together of your research and family tree with others. You
    suddenly gain both entire blocks of ancestral data, as well as potential
    busloads of distant relatives you never knew you were related to coming
    to visit you!
    
    A wide variety of printers are supported, including laser.
