## Information about "OSMOSIS SOLITAIRE AND BINGO"

    OSMOSIS SOLITAIRE takes the popular parlor game of solitaire
    and adds many new and interesting twists.  Starting with a standard
    deck of 52 playing cards, the program creates 4 stock piles (3
    cards down and 1 card up) and a base card which will be the key
    for starting the game.  The rest of the cards are stored in the
    "waste pile."  Each subsequent row can only be started by a
    matching base card of another suit.  The object is to build upon
    each base card the other twelve cards of its own suit.  Except for your
    starting stock row, you cannot play a card unless it can be
    found in the preceding row.  To add to the fun, the 4 stock piles must
    also be used in play.  The final outcome:  hopefully, all cards will be
    played!
    
    A great pastime for all who enjoy card games of any sort.
    Immediately accessible and easily understandable, OSMOSIS SOLITAIRE
    will soon be a popular game for your gaming library.  Don't pass
    up this wonderful package created by Raymond M. Buti.
    
    Being the BINGO caller can be a thankless job, so let the computer do
    it!  BINGO will print as many different bingo cards as are needed for
    your game, then pick and record the numbers for you.
    
    The program picks numbers between 1 and 75, one number at a time, giving
    the number plus its line letter designation, as in a regular bingo game.
    The program keeps track of the called numbers on a "tote board," to be
    available for comparison with the numbers on the winning card.

OSMOSIS SOLITAIRE takes the popular parlor game of solitaire and        
adds many new and interesting twists.  Starting with a standard         
deck of 52 playing cards, the program creates 4 stock piles (3          
cards down and 1 card up) and a 1 base card which will be the key       
for starting the game.  The rest of the cards are stored in the         
"waste pile."  Each subsequent row can only be started by a             
matching base card of another suit.  The object is to build upon        
each base card the other twelve cards of its own suit.  Accept for      
your starting stock row - you cannot play a card unless it can be       
found in the preceding row.  Too add to the fun, the 4 stock piles      
must also be used in play, the final outcome, hopefully, all cards      
will be played!                                                         
                                                                        
Although this may sound complicated, it isn't.  The program sets        
up easily on any IBM or compatible.  The function keys are used to      
select card colors, sound toggle, speed of dealing, save game           
feature, advance and standard scoring options and much more.            
OSMOSIS SOLITAIRE can be installed on your hard disk with no            
trouble at all - just use the OSSTART command and choose this           
function from the menu.  Graphics are pleasant and enjoyable - if       
you are having difficulty reading the cards, try changing the color     
scheme.  Play is also simple - the 1 - 4 number keys control the        
stock piles, while D, R and W allow you to deal, re-deal and draw       
a card from the waste pile.  And, if you want, use your mouse -         
OSMOSIS SOLITAIRE is also mouse compatible!

                       PROGRAMS REQUIRED TO RUN OSMOSIS

       The only file required to play Osmosis Solitaire is OSMOSIS.EXE.
       This  file  should be on your play disk or  directory.  Use  the 
       "Copy"  command found in your DOS manual for making a copy  from 
       one disk to another.


                                OSMOSIS RULES

       The  game  of  Osmosis Solitaire, sometimes  known  as  Treasure 
       Trove, is played with a standard deck of fifty-two cards.  After 
       the  shuffle, deal sixteen cards face down in packets  of  four. 
       These  four packets are placed to the left side of  the  playing 
       area in a single column.  This will be called your stock  cards.  
       The  top  card of each packet is then turned face  up.   Deal  a 
       seventeenth card face up opposite the top packet of four  cards.  
       That card will be your base card.  The other three cards of  the 
       same  rank will be placed directly below the first base card  as 
       they become available for play.

       The  object  is to build upon each base card  the  other  twelve 
       cards of its own suit.  These cards do not have to be played  in 
       any  necessary  sequence  with the exception  of  the  following 
       rules:

       1  - Any card of the same suit matching the first base card  may 
       be played as soon as it becomes available.

       2  - Any card of the same suit matching any of the  other  bases 
       may  only be played if there is a card of the same rank  in  the 
       row immediately above it.



                                    - 1 -








       Cards  available  for play are the top cards of the  four  stock 
       packets.    As   each  top card is played, the card   below   is 
       turned face up.  If there aren't any moves, deal three cards off 
       the  deck, face up, and place them to the side of  your  playing 
       area.   This cards become your waste pile.  The top card of  the 
       waste  pile may be use for play.  As each card is  removed  from 
       the  waste  pile, the next exposed card  becomes  available  for 
       play.

       The  deck  may be redealt until you either win or  the  game  is 
       blocked  from further play.  When redealing, the waste  pile  is 
       picked  up and turned face down without disturbing the  sequence 
       of  the  cards.  Play continues by dealing three cards  off  the 
       deck as before.  In the event you don't have three cards to deal 
       off the deck, then the remaining cards are dealt off.


                               STARTING OSMOSIS

       From  your  DOS  prompt, type OSMOSIS  and  press  ENTER.   Your 
       monitor  will display the opening screen.  After a few  seconds, 
       or until you hit a key, the main playing screen will appear.  


                             MAIN PLAYING SCREEN

       The  left  two-thirds of the screen is the  playing  area.   The 
       right  portion  of  the screen displays  your  options,  current 
       score, highest score achieved, current game being played and the 
       total games that have been played.

       The lower bottom right will display the deck of cards.  This  is 
       where the cards are shuffled and the waste and remainder of  the 
       deck will be located.

       The  bottom  middle  of  the  screen  will  display  a  message, 
       "STANDARD Scoring".  To score this game, each card placed in the 
       base  rows  are awarded 75 points.  A total of 3900  points  are 
       possible with the deck of fifty-two cards.  The reason each card 
       was  given a value of 75 points is so the scores would be  close 
       to the scores that could be achieved while playing the "ADVANCED 
       Scoring".  (See SETUP MENU).

                                 MAIN OPTIONS

       While  in this screen and before playing a game of Osmosis,  you 
       have the following options available:

       F1/ENTER  - By pressing either Function 1 or the ENTER key,  you 
       will start dealing out a hand of Osmosis.

       F3        - Pressing Function 3 will take you to the setup  menu 
       and allow you to change some of the features of Osmosis.

       F5        - Pressing Function 5 will  allow  you to  change  the

       chance  to  play  your hand a little differently  than  you  did 
       before.  NOTE:  When a hand is replayed, your game counters  are 
       turned  off.   You will not be able to save your  replayed  game

                                  SETUP MENU

       The Setup Menu is reached by pressing F3 from the Main  Options.  
       A new screen will appear displaying the following options:

               1     Display Shuffling               On
               2     Sound                           On

               9     Scoring Method            STANDARD

       These are the default settings that come with Osmosis Solitaire.  
       Options  1 through 9 may be changed while in the  Setup  Screen.  
       These options are always saved when you quit and return to  DOS.  
       In  order for this to happen, you must be logged onto the  drive 
       or directory where Osmosis.Exe resides.


                                SETUP OPTIONS

       1 - You have the option to display the shuffling of the cards or 
       you may wish to play a faster game by not viewing the shuffling.  
       This may be changed with this option.

       2 - Use this key to turn your sound either On of Off.

       3  - If you want to save your high scores to disk, be sure  this 
       option is On.

       4 - The cards are displaying while they are being dealt to their 
       respective positions.  If you would rather not see this, you may 
       set this option to Off.



                                    - 4 -








       5 - While going from one screen  to  another, the  screens  will 
       slide open.  If this causes snow or you would rather not see  it 
       happen, you may turn it off with this option.

       6 - Use this option if you are experiencing snow.

       7 - When this option is set to On, you will be shown the  unused 
       portion of each of the stock piles and of the deck.  The maximum 
       amount  of  cards shown from the unused portion of the  deck  is 
       limited to 16 cards.  All unused stock cards will be shown.

       8 - If option 4 above is On, your cards will be dealt and  moved 
       around the table at the default speed setting of 20.  This means 
       nothing  until  you actually see the cards in  motion.   If  you 
       press  this  option  8, you will be able  to  change  the  speed 
       setting for the card movement speed.  The bottom of your  screen 
       will display the following options:

                    LEFT/RIGHT Arrows      ENTER      F10

       Use your LEFT/RIGHT Arrow keys to decrease or increase the speed 
       setting.   The smaller the number, the faster the speed.   Press 
       the  ENTER key if you want to see the effect  the speed  setting 
       has  on  the card movement.  When you are   satisfied  with  the 
       setting, press the Function 10 key when your done.

       9 - As mentioned earlier, your default scoring method is set  at 
       Standard.   The Standard scoring is actually a value of 1  point 
       for  each  card  you have placed on the  bases.   The  value  is 
       multiplied by 75 so the Standard scoring method will be close to 
       the Advanced method.

       The  Advanced method of scoring has been made available to  make 
       this  solitaire   game  a little more exciting  when  trying  to 
       achieve   a  high score on a win.  Winning the game  of  Osmosis 
       will  give   you  a  total  of 52  cards.   Using  the  Standard 
       scoring,  this  would amount to a total of 3900 maximum  points, 
       regardless  of how many redeals you had.  The  Advanced  scoring 
       method, scores your cards when  placed on the bases depending on 
       how many times  you  have dealt a card from the deck.  The score 
       for  each  card  placed on a base row  is  first  determined  by 
       multiplying  the base row  number (1  to  4) by the  number  80.  
       This number of 80  will  decrement down as you place a card on a 
       base  row and each time you deal  a set of three cards from  the 
       deck.   Your card number position  (1 to  13), will also  affect 
       the  amount of points you will  receive when  placing  a   card.  
       Each  base row (1  to  4),  card  number position  (1  to   13), 
       and  decisions  will all  be  a  factor   in  determining   your 
       score.  While in the Advanced scoring  method, your screen  will 
       show  the  current  point  values  of  each   possible   playing  
       position.   This  will be  displayed  right  below  the  playing  
       area.    As you make your plays and moves,  the   current  point 
       values will be updated and displayed. 




                                    - 5 -








       The  Advanced scoring method also awards bonus points  if  cards 
       placed  in a base row match the card in the base row  above  it.  
       While  playing  the game, you may press ALT-B from  the  Playing 
       options menu to display a chart showing the Bonus values and how 
       they are awarded.


                             CHANGING CARD COLORS

       Pressing the Function 5 key from the Main Options will bring you 
       to  a screen which  will  allow you to change the  card  colors.   
       The  top portion  or  your screen will display a row of   cards,  
       face  down.    Below  that row will be another  row,  face   up.   
       The lower portion of your screen will display the following:

                    Card Back                       Card Face
       
           F1  Border Foreground Color     F4  Border Foreground Color
           F2  Border Background Color     F5  Border Background Color
           F3  Pattern Color               F6  Face Color

                         ALT-D  Restore Default Colors

           Pressing  the Function keys, F1 through F6 will  change  the 
           two  card  rows to the available colors  allowed  with  each 
           function key pressed.  Pressing ALT-D will restore the  card 
           colors to their default colors.  When you are satisfied with 
           the  color  changes,  press the ENTER key and  you  will  be 
           returned to the Setup Screen.  These changes are saved  when 
           you  quit playing Osmosis.  Be sure Osmosis.Exe  resides  in 
           the  drive  or directory from where you  first  started  the 
           game.


                                USING A MOUSE

       The  mouse  is used during game play only.  In order  to  use  a 
       mouse,  you must have a Microsoft or compatible mouse.  Be  sure 
       you  have  your mouse driver loaded in memory prior  to  playing 
       Osmosis.

       Moving the mouse up and down will function like the up and  down 
       arrows.   Pressing the RIGHT Button will deal off the deck.   In 
       the  event  the  deck is empty, the RIGHT  Button  will  redeal.  
       Pressing  the LEFT Button will add another pointer in the  stock 
       piles.   Move  the pointer up and down to the card you  want  to 
       play  and press the LEFT Button again.  This will move the  card 
       to the row previously marked with a pointer.  To play the  waste 
       card, press the LEFT Button twice.

       When  pressing the mouse buttons, you should quickly  press  and 
       release.  If you hold the buttons, Osmosis goes into a state  of 
       confusion.   During this confused state, all the ATM's  at  your 
       favorite  bank start pouring out money.  If this  happens,  your 
       registration fee is $100.


                                    - 6 -








       Pressing  the  RIGHT Button twice will function like  the  ALT-M 
       key, bringing up the mouse help screen.


                                 HIGH SCORES

       This  screen is viewed by pressing the Function 8 key from   the 
       Main Options.  If you have option 3 in the Setup Menu set to On, 
       you  will be able to view the top fifteen players.   The  screen 
       will  display the players name, score, game number and date  the 
       score was recorded.  Your score will be displayed followed by  a 
       two  digit number.  This number will represent the  total  cards 
       that were used when that score was achieved.  On  the right side 
       of  the  players name will be  either a "-S"  or  "-A".    These  
       symbols stand for  Standard scoring  and  Advanced scoring.


                           GRAND MASTERS OF OSMOSIS

       This  screen  is viewed by pressing ALT-M from the  high  scores 
       screen.   In order to view this screen, Osmosis must be able  to 
       locate  the file "OSCHAMP.HIS" on your play disk  or  directory.  


                             CLEARING HIGH SCORES

       While viewing the high scores, you will have an option available 
       to  clear the high scores.  Press ALT-C to clear  these  scores.  
       This will delete your Osmosis.His file from your disk.  You will 
       also  be asked if you want to clear the game  statistics.   This 
       consists of the game counters and high games.

                       PROGRAMS REQUIRED TO RUN OSMOSIS

       The only file required to play Osmosis Solitaire is OSMOSIS.EXE.
       This  file  should be on your play disk or  directory.  Use  the 
       "Copy"  command found in your DOS manual for making a copy  from 
       one disk to another.


                                OSMOSIS RULES

       The  game  of  Osmosis Solitaire, sometimes  known  as  Treasure 
       Trove, is played with a standard deck of fifty-two cards.  After 
       the  shuffle, deal sixteen cards face down in packets  of  four. 
       These  four packets are placed to the left side of  the  playing 
       area in a single column.  This will be called your stock  cards.  
       The  top  card of each packet is then turned face  up.   Deal  a 
       seventeenth card face up opposite the top packet of four  cards.  
       That card will be your base card.  The other three cards of  the 
       same  rank will be placed directly below the first base card  as 
       they become available for play.

       The  object  is to build upon each base card  the  other  twelve 
       cards of its own suit.  These cards do not have to be played  in 
       any  necessary  sequence  with the exception  of  the  following 
       rules:

       1  - Any card of the same suit matching the first base card  may 
       be played as soon as it becomes available.

       2  - Any card of the same suit matching any of the  other  bases 
       may  only be played if there is a card of the same rank  in  the 
       row immediately above it.



                                    - 1 -








       Cards  available  for play are the top cards of the  four  stock 
       packets.    As   each  top card is played, the card   below   is 
       turned face up.  If there aren't any moves, deal three cards off 
       the  deck, face up, and place them to the side of  your  playing 
       area.   This cards become your waste pile.  The top card of  the 
       waste  pile may be use for play.  As each card is  removed  from 
       the  waste  pile, the next exposed card  becomes  available  for 
       play.

       The  deck  may be redealt until you either win or  the  game  is 
       blocked  from further play.  When redealing, the waste  pile  is 
       picked  up and turned face down without disturbing the  sequence 
       of  the  cards.  Play continues by dealing three cards  off  the 
       deck as before.  In the event you don't have three cards to deal 
       off the deck, then the remaining cards are dealt off.


                               STARTING OSMOSIS

       From  your  DOS  prompt, type OSMOSIS  and  press  ENTER.   Your 
       monitor  will display the opening screen.  After a few  seconds, 
       or until you hit a key, the main playing screen will appear.  


                             MAIN PLAYING SCREEN

       The  left  two-thirds of the screen is the  playing  area.   The 
       right  portion  of  the screen displays  your  options,  current 
       score, highest score achieved, current game being played and the 
       total games that have been played.

       The lower bottom right will display the deck of cards.  This  is 
       where the cards are shuffled and the waste and remainder of  the 
       deck will be located.

       The  bottom  middle  of  the  screen  will  display  a  message, 
       "STANDARD Scoring".  To score this game, each card placed in the 
       base  rows  are awarded 75 points.  A total of 3900  points  are 
       possible with the deck of fifty-two cards.  The reason each card 
       was  given a value of 75 points is so the scores would be  close 
       to the scores that could be achieved while playing the "ADVANCED 
       Scoring".  (See SETUP MENU).

                                 MAIN OPTIONS

       While  in this screen and before playing a game of Osmosis,  you 
       have the following options available:

       F1/ENTER  - By pressing either Function 1 or the ENTER key,  you 
       will start dealing out a hand of Osmosis.

       F3        - Pressing Function 3 will take you to the setup  menu 
       and allow you to change some of the features of Osmosis.

       playing this game, press Function 10.

       To start the game, press either the F1 or ENTER key.  The  cards 
       will  be shuffled and dealt into their respective stock  packets 
       of  four  cards  each  with the top  card  being  exposed.   The 
       seventeenth  card  will  be placed opposite  the  topmost  stock 
       packed face up as your first base card.  When you start to  play 
       a game, the Main Options will change to Play Options.


                                 REPLAY GAME

       Once  you have played at least one game, you may wish to  replay 
       your last game again.  Instead of pressing F1 or ENTER to deal a 
       new  hand, press ALT-D and the cards will be dealt in  the  same 
       order  they  were  in the previous game.  You will  now  have  a 
       chance  to  play  your hand a little differently  than  you  did 
       before.  NOTE:  When a hand is replayed, your game counters  are 
       turned  off.   You will not be able to save your  replayed  game 
       scores.   Once  you press F1 or ENTER for a new game,  all  game 
       counters will be turned back on.

               9     Scoring Method            STANDARD

       These are the default settings that come with Osmosis Solitaire.  
       Options  1 through 9 may be changed while in the  Setup  Screen.  
       These options are always saved when you quit and return to  DOS.  
       In  order for this to happen, you must be logged onto the  drive 
       or directory where Osmosis.Exe resides.


                                SETUP OPTIONS

       1 - You have the option to display the shuffling of the cards or 
       you may wish to play a faster game by not viewing the shuffling.  
       This may be changed with this option.

       2 - Use this key to turn your sound either On of Off.

       3  - If you want to save your high scores to disk, be sure  this 
       option is On.

       4 - The cards are displaying while they are being dealt to their 
       respective positions.  If you would rather not see this, you may 
       set this option to Off.



                                    - 4 -








       5 - While going from one screen  to  another, the  screens  will 
       slide open.  If this causes snow or you would rather not see  it 
       happen, you may turn it off with this option.

       6 - Use this option if you are experiencing snow.

       7 - When this option is set to On, you will be shown the  unused 
       portion of each of the stock piles and of the deck.  The maximum 
       amount  of  cards shown from the unused portion of the  deck  is 
       limited to 16 cards.  All unused stock cards will be shown.

       8 - If option 4 above is On, your cards will be dealt and  moved 
       around the table at the default speed setting of 20.  This means 
       nothing  until  you actually see the cards in  motion.   If  you 
       press  this  option  8, you will be able  to  change  the  speed 
       setting for the card movement speed.  The bottom of your  screen 
       will display the following options:

                    LEFT/RIGHT Arrows      ENTER      F10

       Use your LEFT/RIGHT Arrow keys to decrease or increase the speed 
       setting.   The smaller the number, the faster the speed.   Press 
       the  ENTER key if you want to see the effect  the speed  setting 
       has  on  the card movement.  When you are   satisfied  with  the 
       setting, press the Function 10 key when your done.

       9 - As mentioned earlier, your default scoring method is set  at 
       Standard.   The Standard scoring is actually a value of 1  point 
       for  each  card  you have placed on the  bases.   The  value  is 
       multiplied by 75 so the Standard scoring method will be close to 
       the Advanced method.

       The  Advanced method of scoring has been made available to  make 
       this  solitaire   game  a little more exciting  when  trying  to 
       achieve   a  high score on a win.  Winning the game  of  Osmosis 
       will  give   you  a  total  of 52  cards.   Using  the  Standard 
       scoring,  this  would amount to a total of 3900 maximum  points, 
       regardless  of how many redeals you had.  The  Advanced  scoring 
       method, scores your cards when  placed on the bases depending on 
       how many times  you  have dealt a card from the deck.  The score 
       for  each  card  placed on a base row  is  first  determined  by 
       multiplying  the base row  number (1  to  4) by the  number  80.  
       This number of 80  will  decrement down as you place a card on a 
       base  row and each time you deal  a set of three cards from  the 
       deck.   Your card number position  (1 to  13), will also  affect 
       the  amount of points you will  receive when  placing  a   card.  
       Each  base row (1  to  4),  card  number position  (1  to   13), 
       and  decisions  will all  be  a  factor   in  determining   your 
       score.  While in the Advanced scoring  method, your screen  will 
       show  the  current  point  values  of  each   possible   playing  
       position.   This  will be  displayed  right  below  the  playing  
       area.    As you make your plays and moves,  the   current  point 
       values will be updated and displayed. 




                                    - 5 -








       The  Advanced scoring method also awards bonus points  if  cards 
       placed  in a base row match the card in the base row  above  it.  
       While  playing  the game, you may press ALT-B from  the  Playing 
       options menu to display a chart showing the Bonus values and how 
       they are awarded.


                             CHANGING CARD COLORS

       Pressing the Function 5 key from the Main Options will bring you 
       to  a screen which  will  allow you to change the  card  colors.   
       The  top portion  or  your screen will display a row of   cards,  
       face  down.    Below  that row will be another  row,  face   up.   
       The lower portion of your screen will display the following:

                    Card Back                       Card Face
       
           F1  Border Foreground Color     F4  Border Foreground Color
           F2  Border Background Color     F5  Border Background Color
           F3  Pattern Color               F6  Face Color

                         ALT-D  Restore Default Colors

           Pressing  the Function keys, F1 through F6 will  change  the 
           two  card  rows to the available colors  allowed  with  each 
           function key pressed.  Pressing ALT-D will restore the  card 
           colors to their default colors.  When you are satisfied with 
           the  color  changes,  press the ENTER key and  you  will  be 
           returned to the Setup Screen.  These changes are saved  when 
           you  quit playing Osmosis.  Be sure Osmosis.Exe  resides  in 
           the  drive  or directory from where you  first  started  the 
           game.


                                USING A MOUSE

       The  mouse  is used during game play only.  In order  to  use  a 
       mouse,  you must have a Microsoft or compatible mouse.  Be  sure 
       you  have  your mouse driver loaded in memory prior  to  playing 
       Osmosis.

       Moving the mouse up and down will function like the up and  down 
       arrows.   Pressing the RIGHT Button will deal off the deck.   In 
       the  event  the  deck is empty, the RIGHT  Button  will  redeal.  
       Pressing  the LEFT Button will add another pointer in the  stock 
       piles.   Move  the pointer up and down to the card you  want  to 
       play  and press the LEFT Button again.  This will move the  card 
       to the row previously marked with a pointer.  To play the  waste 
       card, press the LEFT Button twice.

       When  pressing the mouse buttons, you should quickly  press  and 
       release.  If you hold the buttons, Osmosis goes into a state  of 
       confusion.   During this confused state, all the ATM's  at  your 
       favorite  bank start pouring out money.  If this  happens,  your 
       registration fee is $100.

       Pressing  the  RIGHT Button twice will function like  the  ALT-M 
       key, bringing up the mouse help screen.


                                 HIGH SCORES

       This  screen is viewed by pressing the Function 8 key from   the 
       Main Options.  If you have option 3 in the Setup Menu set to On, 
       you  will be able to view the top fifteen players.   The  screen 
       will  display the players name, score, game number and date  the 
       score was recorded.  Your score will be displayed followed by  a 
       two  digit number.  This number will represent the  total  cards 
       that were used when that score was achieved.  On  the right side 
       of  the  players name will be  either a "-S"  or  "-A".    These  
       symbols stand for  Standard scoring  and  Advanced scoring.


                           GRAND MASTERS OF OSMOSIS

       This  screen  is viewed by pressing ALT-M from the  high  scores 
       screen.   In order to view this screen, Osmosis must be able  to 
       locate  the file "OSCHAMP.HIS" on your play disk  or  directory.  


                             CLEARING HIGH SCORES

       While viewing the high scores, you will have an option available 
       to  clear the high scores.  Press ALT-C to clear  these  scores.  
       This will delete your Osmosis.His file from your disk.  You will 
       also  be asked if you want to clear the game  statistics.   This 
       consists of the game counters and high games.


                              SHAREWARE VERSION

       The ShareWare version of Osmosis Solitaire does not support  the 
       saving of high scores to disk, the saving of the setup  options, 
       or the game counters.  We have left a few options available  for 
       registered users.  These minor restrictions will not effect  the 
       game  in anyway.  After you have played Osmosis Solitaire for  a 
       reasonable  time,  we ask for your support by  sending  in  your 
       registration.    Registered  users  will  receive   the   latest 
       Registered  Version with full saving features, the latest  Grand 
       Masters file, and  the  latest ShareWare Version.
