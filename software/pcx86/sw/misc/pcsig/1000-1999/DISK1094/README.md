## Information about "SBW 1 OF 2 (ALSO 1095)"

    SYSTEM FOR BUSINESS AND THE WORKPLACE (SBW) is a multifaceted
    integrated system that meets many common business needs. The system has
    five different functions and a separate module for each: customer
    information system, human resource (personnel) management, accounting,
    inventory, and production system. It also has an extensive
    documentation manual covering all five modules. The system is written
    in dBase III+ and you will need dBase III+ to run it. Also included is
    the DBase source code.
    
    The customer file lets you maintain a complete customer database
    including purchase information and demographics about the customer. You
    can even print mailing labels or generate form letters. With the human
    resources management portion of the system you can maintain detailed
    personnel records on your employees. Previous employment history,
    personnel reports, and payroll are all supported. The accounting system
    is also designed for the small business. It handles both accounts
    payable and receivable. It maintains your chart of accounts and
    posts all expenses and income. Inventory management is for either
    manufactured goods or raw materials.

Program Title: System for Business & the Workplace (SBW)  (Disk 1 of 2)
PC-SIG Version: V1.1

SYSTEM for BUSINESS & the WORKPLACE (SBW) is a multifaceted integrated
system that meets many common business needs.  The system has five
different functions and a separate module for each: customer information
system, human resource (personnel) management, accounting, inventory,
and production system.  It also has an extensive documentation manual
covering all five modules.  The system is written in dBase III+ and you
will need dBase III+ to run it.

The Customer File allows you to maintain a complete customer database
including purchase information and demographics about the customer.  You
can even print mailing labels or generate form letters.  With the Human
Resources Management portion of the system you can maintain detailed
personnel records on your employees.  Previous employment history,
personnel reports and payroll are all supported.  The accounting system
is also designed for the small business.  It handles both accounts
payable and receivable.  It will maintain your chart of accounts and
post all expenses and income.  Inventory Management is for either
manufactured goods or raw materials.

Usage:  Business/Educational Database.

Special Requirements:  A printer, and dBase III+.
