    with WORD-PART Dictionary.  The database of this system boasts 500 word
    parts and 2,000 related words with concise definitions.

     1. Introduction

           WORD-PART DICTIONARY is a program to enhance your
        word  power.   It has a data base of 500  word parts
        and 2000 related words with concise definitions. You
        can get access to the desired parts or words  with a
        few key strokes. The selected list of word parts are
        related to  about 70% of the tough words  in a typi-
        cal SAT, ACT, CBAT, or GRE verbal test.  The  system
        is menu-driven and has on line instructions. This is
        the first system that  employs  scientific method to
        collect the most frequently  used word parts.  It is
        one of the most  effective  systems  to improve your
        word power. (Note: Another powerful system available
        is PC DICTIONARY-10, which is described in DIC.DOC.)

     2.  Features:

         *  Comprehensive Data Base: The WORD-PART DICTIONARY
            has over 500 most frequently used word  parts and
            2000 related words with concise definitions.  The
            definitions of word parts  are compiled from four
            most respected sources.

         *  Menu Driven:  The  WORD PART DICTIONARY is  fully
            menu driven. All you need to do is "load and go".
            It enables you to  get access  to  part/word with
            a few keystrokes.

         *  A Necessary Tool to Prepare SAT, ACT,  CBAT,  GRE,
            and  any  Civil  Placement  Test:  The  system  is
            designed  specifically for these purposes.  Learn-
            ing words thru  word parts  allows  you to study a
            group of words at a time, instead of one at a time.
            It can also help you understand and remember words.

         *  Average Response Time: 0.4 second.

         *  Memory Requirement: 55 KB. ( Not memory-resident.)

         *  Hardware Requirements:  One  floppy disk drive  or
            one hard disk drive.
