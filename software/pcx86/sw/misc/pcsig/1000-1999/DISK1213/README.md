	 PC BARTENDER
	 Version 2.00
	 SHAREWARE



	 PC Bartender was written in 1986 and has since been forgotten 
	 in our files.	When it was re-discovered the documentation 
	 files were missing.  The following provides a quick summary 
	 of PC Bartender's capabilities.  If you should decide to 
	 become a registered user you will receive a copy of the 
	 printed manual (we still have several hundred).

	 To become a registered user send $25 to:


	 HomeCraft
	 P.O. Box 974
	 Tualatin,  OR	97062


	     PC Bartender is fairly simple to use.  Prompts are 
	 provided on each screen to indicate the available choices.









     When the first (Main) menu appears you have four choices.	Push 
     F4 to search for a drink recipe, F5 for the inventory section and 
     F6 for definitions.  We'll discuss each of these.


     Push F4 brings up another menu with four choices.	You can search 
     the recipe files for all drinks (F4); for just cocktails (drinks 
     that contain alcohol); just mocktails (no alcohol); or you can 
     add a drink to the recipe file.

























     If you push F4, F5 or F6 the next menu allows you to select how 
     you want to search for the drink - by name, ingredient, type or 
     based on your inventory.  If you do a search based on the 
     inventory only those drinks that can be made with *just* the 
     ingredients in your inventory will be identified.

     If you search for a name (i.e. Brandy Alexander, Flying 
     Grasshoppper, Gin Buck, etc.) or ingredient (gin, scotch, 
     tequila, etc.) any recipe whose name or ingredient list contains 
     what you enter will be identified as a match.  For example, if 
     you search by name and just enter the letter F to search for, 
     over 30 drinks will be identified ranging from a Fog Cutter to a 
     Southern Freeze.


     When you search for drinks by type a list of types will appear at 
     the bottom of the screen.	Just enter the number that corresponds 
     to the type of drink you want to find.


     When a search is started that drinks that are identified as 
     matching the search criteria will be listed on the screen.      
     To see a recipe push the return key and an arrow will appear on 
     the screen in the upper left.  Use the cursor keys to move this 
     arrow to the drink you want then push enter again.  The drink 
     recipe will appear.

     With the recipe on the screen there are several things you can 
     do.  Pushing the letter "E" allows you to make changes in the 
     recipe.  When you push "E" a second menu line will appear.  Use 
     the up/down cursor keys to move the arrow to the line you want to 
     edit then push the letter "E" again.  You can then enter the 
     corrected information.

     The last line on the screen that the arrow will move to is call 
     "Search for file" and there may be a number after this.  This 
     number is used to link this recipe to another.  The file number 
     for this recipe is shown in the upper right corner.  When you 
     push "M" or "C" to convert to a Mocktail or Cocktail the software 
     displays the recipe stored as the search for file.

     Getting back to the menu line at the bottom of a recipe.  Pushing 
     "D" removes the recipe from that data file.  You can get a 
     printed copy of the recipe by pushing "P."  A second menu can be 
     viewed by pushing "O" for other.






















     On the second menu are prompts that allow you to convert the 
     recipe to metric (or back to english units), and adjust the size 
     of the recipe.

     There may also be a prompt for Cocktail or Mocktail (it only 
     appears when needed).  Pushing "C" or "M" will display the recipe 
     stored in the file number identified as the search for file.  
     This is used to link files together that have mocktail versions 
     of the cocktail.  It allows PC Bartender to convert between the 
     non-alcohol version of a drink and the version with alcohol in 
     it.



     Going back to the Main Menu.  The second item is your bar 
     inventory.  Push F5 to use this function.

     The bar inventory is 3 pages (60 lines) long.  Push the letter 
     "A" to advance through the pages or the letter "P" to print the 
     entire list.

     To make additions or changes to the inventory push the letter 
     "E".  You can then use the cursor keys to move around on the page 
     that is being displayed.  Just type in the new information and 
     push F2 to save it.



     The last item on the Main Menu is the list of Definitions and 
     Substitutes.  Push F6 to use this function.  A list will appear 
     on the screen.  Use the cursor keys to position the arrow next to 
     the item you want information about then push ENTER.




































 the item you want information about then push ENTER

HOME FINANCIAL SOFTWARE


Home Money Manager II - Checkbook and budgeting software designed specifically
			for the home user.  In addition to being able to
			provide the normal features that most home accounting
			has, HMM-II has several unique features.  For example,
			in addition to split entries, you can also split
			your checking accounts; each portion of a split entry
			can have its own memo; there are four editors that
			allow you to make changes at any time; and HMM-II
			automatically adjusts itself for use with any micro-
			computer printer (including laser printers set for
			66 lines per page).

			HMM-II prints checks, tracks up to 12 checking accounts
			on a floppy disk (plus 12 credit accounts), can handle
			ATM and telephone transactions, provides over 950
			expense catagories, and allows tracking of tax
			deductible expenses.


Home Loan (The Financial Calculator) - Home Loan not only calculates the
			monthly payment for nearly any type loan, it
			provides tables showing the effects of various loan
			options at a glance.  Calculation of amortization
			tables, the value of an annuity, present value, and
			future value are also provided.  In addition, Home
			Loan has special sections to help plan for your
			retirement, calculate the value of your IRA, plan
			for your children's college expenses and to do
			equity calculations for your home.


Home Insurance (Home Inventory and Insurance Planning) - provides a way for
			you to keep track of what you own, where it is
			located, what it cost, and any identifying marks.
			Home Insurance uses the same user interface as the
			collectors series and thus each item in your
			inventory can be cataloged using any of 22 
			characteristics (serial #, model #, color, etc.)

			Home Insurance also provides several other features
			to help with your insurance planning.  A life
			insurance estimator will take your current financial
			status and your future plans, and calculate the
			amount of life insurance you need.  An insurance
			records file provides a convient place to store
			vital information about your insurance policies.


Personal Asset Manager (tm) - Combines all three of the above into a single
			integrated system.
