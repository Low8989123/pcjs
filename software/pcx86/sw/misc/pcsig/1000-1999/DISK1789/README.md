## Information about "CRIBBAGE BY T"

    A hand of Cribbage is fun, indeed, when played with the scoundrel (aka
    your computer).  As you play, he comments on your play, the state of the
    game and the score needed to win.
    
    Clear graphics add to the effect of natural play, while you concentrate
    on your strategy.  The main menu will direct you to information about
    the rules, how to score and other material.  If you get stuck or can't
    decide which play to make, use the hints function.  Five hints per game
    can help if you need it.
