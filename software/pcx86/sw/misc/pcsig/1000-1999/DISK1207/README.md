## Information about "PROCHALLENGE BASEBALL"

    PROCHALLENGE BASEBALL is a one- or two-player strategy game of computer
    baseball that has a variety of player options for every pitch of the
    game.
    
    In this version the game simulates the 1987 World Series game between
    St. Louis and Minnesota, but in the registered version of the program
    you may choose between 26 Major League baseball teams.  PROCHALLENGE
    BASEBALL is set up for you to be the manager giving signals to the
    players.  The pitching team has the option to change its defensive
    formation, pick off a runner, and decide what pitches to throw.  When a
    pitch is thrown, you can specify where the ball should be placed over
    the plate.  The options for the team at bat include the choice to swing
    at the ball, bunt, steal a base, lead off a runner, hit and run, run and
    hit, and call the pitch.
    
    PROCHALLENGE BASEBALL does everything to simulate the actual game, even
    to the point of using the statistics for each player of the team.
    Baseball fans will be pleased that the program allows them to play based
    upon the skill and strategy of the real game of baseball.  PROCHALLENGE
    BASEBALL has graphic screens for the entire field with its players and
    the view from the pitcher's mound, not to mention the many colorful game
    menus to aid in game play.  At any time you may let the computer make
    the signal, so that one player may play against the computer or even the
    computer against itself.
