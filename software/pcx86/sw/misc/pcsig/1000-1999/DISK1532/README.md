## Information about "TEXTBOOK INVENTORY CONTROL SYSTEM"

    TEXTBOOK INVENTORY CONTROL SYSTEM is designed to keep track of books
    issued to students, but it can be easily adapted for use by businesses
    that check out reference materials to employees, or in your own library
    to help you recall who borrowed that favorite book of yours!
    Completely
    menu-driven and extremely easy to use, the program allows you to update
    existing book records, record books returned, print all book inventory
    records, or print the records for books not yet returned.
    
    The database record format for each textbook consists of: file name,
    book title, author's name, book cost-new, book code, book
    condition,
    student name, student identification number, date book issued, and date
    book returned.  A sample of a book checkout form is included for
    hardcopy input.  In all, an excellent method for handling small library
    inventory tracking!
