## Information about "FASTBUCKS 2 OF 2 (ALSO 855)"

    FASTBUCKS is a completely menu-driven home-finance program that is easy
    to understand and operate.
    
    FASTBUCKS supports up to 25 accounts each in checking, savings, charge
    accounts, and 25 cash sheets. With each account you can update, list,
    reconcile, balance, or edit a record. List an account by month, year,
    or expense category. The program offers a graphic illustration of your
    expenses for a certain year, and shows your overall average
    expenditures.
    
    Account listings can be displayed or printed. When listing a checking
    account and overall balance, the program will immediately show you if a
    check has bounced by displaying its line in inverse print. Each line
    gives the date, description, whether or not it is a credit or debit, and
    total balance to date.
    
    Use the recursive budget model to create a workable family budget.
    Calculate total income, for both the pay period and the year, and
    compute your "disposable" income. Allot transactions to your various
    expense categories or to your savings account.
    
    There is a financial calculation section to calculate item
    depreciation, investments and loan information, plus a complete loan
    amortization generator.
    
    Change initialization parameters for display type, printer, drive, data
    file path, and expense categories as desired. FASTBUCKS presently
    supports 141 printers and a user configuration, if your printer is not
    presently supported.

System Requirements:
                     Memory : 196K Free user RAM
                     Storage: a minimum of 2 360K floppy drives
                              although a Hard disk is strongly recommended.

                     Monitor: MDA,CGA,EGA,PGA and just about anything else
                              I've forgotten.

                     CPU    : 100% compatible IBM XT/AT or 386

                     DOS    : DOS version 2.0 of higher.

                    CONFIG.SYS FILE MUST CONTAIN THE STATEMENTS

                    FILES=20
                    BUFFERS=20

                    THIS FILE MUST BE ON YOUR SYSTEM "BOOT" DISK WHEN
                    YOUR COMPUTER IS BOOTED UP.

                    OTHERWISE FastBucks will refuse to run.

    Note: A utility program  FBFILES.EXE has  been provided  on this  disk to
create a CONFIG.SYS file  on your  DOS boot  disk if  you don't  have one,and
modify your files= statement if it has less than 20 files allocated.  If more
than 20 files have been allocated to your system FBFILES will not change your
Files= Statememt.   If no files  statement exists, one will  be added to your
CONFIG.SYS file.

To use FBFILES.EXE:

Place the Sample data/Documantation diskette into drive a:
Type:  a:Fbfiles <return>

Re-Boot your system with your new Config.sys file.


Now proceed with the program installation process.

------------------------ 
First time Installation:
------------------------

     Format  Two floppy diskettes
     Label the first diskette "FastBucks Program".
     Label the second diskette FastBucks Data.

     Insert the Program/Install diskette into Drive A:
     Type a: <return>
     Type Install <return>

     Carefully follow the prompts the install program gives you.

     If you don't want the sample data installed onto your system
     answer "N" when the install program asks you about them.
     It will then skip copying your data files to drive B: and
     initialize it for "zero" accounts.

Note:
     It takes the install program a fairly long time to copy the sample
     data files to drive b:. As long as "both" disk drives are flashing
     don't be concerned. The program is "not" hung up. Just relax and get
     a cup of coffee.

************************************************************

     Format two Floppy diskettes.
     
    If you have been  using FastBucks  on a  single drive  system you  are no
longer allowed to do so: The program has grown so large that there is no room
left on the diskette for data files.

    For the same reason the FastBucks program disk CANNOT be formatted as a
"Bootable"  system disk.  There  just isn't enough room on the disk for the 
operating system and FastBucks program.

     
     Copy The following files from your old FastBucks 3.18 program disk
to one of the blank diskettes.
    
    Fb.dta
    FB.Com
    Fbconf.dat

    The easiest way to do this is to place your old program disk into drive
a: and the blank diskette into drive b:

Type Copy a:fbconf.dat  b: <return>
Type Copy a:fb.com b: <return>
Type Copy a:fb.dta b: <return>


remove the diskette in drive a: and place it in a safe place: You won't be
needing it again.

remove the diskette in drive b: and label it "FastBucks Program".

Label the second Blank diskette "FastBucks Data".         

it is not necessary to copy anything to this diskette:

   Install the Program/Install diskette into drive a:
   Type a: <return>
   Type Install <return>

    Carefully read and follow the prompts that Install gives you.It will read
your  program diskette and decide whether it needs to convert your data files
to  the New FastBucks 4.0 data structure.   it will then prompt you to insert
your  original data diskette into drive a:  and the blank diskette into drive
b: the  converted data files will be placed  onto drive b: and the "original"
data files will remain untouched.

---------------------------
First Time Installation:
---------------------------
Insert the Program/Install diskette into drive A:

Type a: <return>

    Carefully follow the prompts that the install program gives you.  Install
will create a  directory <drive>:\Fbucks if  you respond with  the same drive
designation for <drive> for your data files a subdirectory will be created as
<drive>:\FBucks\FBdata all  of  your  data  files  will  be  placed  in  this
subdirectory.

    If  you don't want the sample data  installed onto your system answer "N"
when the install program asks you about them.  It will then skip copying your
data files to your data directory and initialize it for "zero" accounts.

    If you have been storing your data on a Floppy drive:

    Format a fresh diskette and label it FastBucks Data.

    Your  Program files for FastBucks 3.10-3.18  "MUST" reside in a directory
named <drive>:\Fbucks.

    If you have  been saving  your data  on your  "hard disk"  your data files
"MUST" reside in a directory <drive>:\Fbucks\Data.

    Install looks  for your program files and  data files in these respective
directories.

    If your program files are not in the directory <drive>:\Fbucks place them
there before proceeding.

    If you  have been saving your  FastBucks data on your  hard disk and your
data  files are  not in  the <drive>:\Fbucks\Data  directory then  place them
there before proceeding.

    Insert the program/install diskette into drive a:
 
    Type a: <return> 
    Type Install <return>
           
    Carefully follow the prompts that the install program gives you.

    Install will  place  the  converted  data files  into  a  directory  named
<drive>:\Fbucks\fbdata.   If you have been using  a floppy disk for your data
storage the converted  data will  be placed  on the  "Blank" floppy  that you
prepared earlier.  In any case your original data will remain untouched.

NOTE:

If you get a "TOO MANY FILES OPEN ERROR" when running FastBucks edit your 
CONFIG.sys file to read:

Files=20
Buffers=20

                    INTRODUCTION  
  
  
This FastBucks program provides you with a powerful,  
easy way to track your expenses in relation to your  
income, without taking up much of your time.  You can  
use it for budgeting, financial planning, and  
organizing your financial records.  You can organize  
and keep up with financial records that range from  
simply knowing how much spending cash is available for  
you, to evaluating your total expenditures for an  
entire year.  
  
FastBucks is a home finance package that is designed  
to be FAST and USER FRIENDLY.  It does this by using  
clear "plain language" MENUS for your operation with a  
minimum of typing on your part.  Its menus and  
messages are easy to understand, and they guide you at  
every step.  If you want, you can change any  
information that you've entered at any time.  
  
Even though you will see immediate benefits in using  
FastBucks, you can gain increasing benefits as the  
months go by.  After a year or so of using FastBucks,  
you can gain an even greater appreciation of its  
capabilities and speed because of its fast access to  
all the data files.  You can continue to load it up  
with lots of information on checking, savings, charge,  
and cash accounts and it will still give you amazingly  
fast access to all your information.  
  
                     Page 1-3  
  
                HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS  
  
You will need the following equipment to operate the  
FastBucks program:   
  
1. An IBM PC, PC/XT, PC/AT, or any compatible system  
   having at least 196K of Random Access Memory (RAM).  
  
2. PC-DOS or MS-DOS Disk Operating System (DOS)  
   version 2.0 or greater.   
  
3. Two floppy disk drives, or one floppy disk drive  
   with a hard disk.  
  
4. A monochrome or color monitor (CGA, EGA, VGA,  
   etc.).  Just about any monitor is OK.  
  
5. An 80 column printer (for printing reports) with  
   either a standard parallel or serial interface.  In  
   order to print FastBucks graphs, your printer must  
   be capable of printing the IBM Extended Character  
   Set.  FastBucks uses the Extended Character Set to  
   produce graphs on your screen.  It does not use the  
   graphics mode of your display adapter to do so.   
   This allows FastBucks to display graphs on your  
   screen even if your display adapter does not have  
   graphics capabilities.  (Some printers capable of  
   printing graphics require you to select "dip"  
   switches for graphic printing.  Consult your  
   printer's manual.)  
  
  
In addition to the FastBucks program disk, you will  
need at least one blank formatted disk to be used as  
your data disk.  Also I recommend that you provide  
another blank formatted disk to be used to make back-  
up copies of your data disk.

                      FEATURES  
  
o FastBucks is solely user-supported.  It is not copy  
  protected.  You are encouraged to copy FastBucks,   
  give copies of the disk program to friends, or  
  distribute it, as long as there is no payment for  
  the program except to Software Expressions.   
  
  This way you are able to try out the program for a  
  while to determine if it is useful.  If you find  
  FastBucks useful, then you are expected to regis-  
  ter the program with Software Expressions.  A bound,  
  printed manual with a registered serial numbered  
  diskette will be sent to you.  
  
  For an additional registration fee the registrant  
  will receive FREE updates of FastBucks programs for  
  a period of one year from the date of registration.   
  
  All shipping and handling costs will be paid by  
  Software Expressions.   
  
  A rebate will be sent to the registered user for  
  each subsequent registration from copies of his or  
  her serial numbered distribution disk within one  
  year of the registration date.   
  
  Refer to the registration form included on the  
  distribution diskette for the registration, updates,  
  and rebate amounts.

                     PREPARATION  
  
Installation ---------------------------------------  
             
Before you can use FastBucks, you need to install it  
so it will work properly on your computer.  
  
The built-in program "Install" does this for you.  It  
will ask you questions about your system.  It needs to  
know what kind of components it will have to work  
with: your monitor, your printer, the disk drives you  
will use.  It will suggest some built-in expense  
categories for both personal and business accounts,  
and allow you to change them to suit your  
requirements.  (Even though you have to do this for  
the first time installation, you can change any part  
of it at any time later.)  
  
When you receive your FastBucks distribution diskette,  
it contains the installation file.  When you command  
"install", the program asks you to configure FastBucks  
to your system.  
  
  
Test Drive ------------------------------------------  
             
The FastBucks distribution diskette contains some  
"sample" data files that you can use to see how it  
works and how it looks.  Once you have completed the  
installation, you can give FastBucks a "test-drive"  
before you have entered any of your own data.  Refer   
to "Test Drive - Try It Out", on the pages following   
the installation procedure.

                     PREPARATION  
  
Using a Two Floppy Drive System ---------------------  
                                  
If you are going to use a two disk drive system, you  
will need to format two floppy diskettes with the DOS  
format.  Label one of them "FastBucks" and the other  
one "FastBucks Data".   
  
    NOTE!  Do NOT make the formatted diskettes as  
    "bootable" diskettes containing the DOS system  
    boot-up files.  There will not be enough room  
    left on a 360K byte diskette for all of the  
    necessary program files to run FastBucks  
  
  
                     Page 2-4  
  
                     PREPARATION  
  
  
Using a Hard Disk Drive System ----------------------  
                                 
If you are going to use a hard disk drive system, you  
will only need formatted diskettes for making back-up  
copies of your account data as you use FastBucks.    
  
However, if you wish, you can run FastBucks from your  
hard disk, but save your account data to a floppy  
diskette instead of the hard disk.  Since a floppy  
diskette spins slower than a hard disk, the program  
will appear to run slower when accessing information  
from the floppy diskette than it would from the hard  
disk.    
  
If you are going to run FastBucks from your hard disk,  
and save your data on a floppy diskette, then have a  
diskette formatted with the DOS format labeled  
"FastBucks Data".

                    INSTALLATION  
  
The Install Program ---------------------------------  
                      
The built-in "Install" program on the FastBucks  
distribution disk will automatically copy the program  
files to your working disk.  It will do this for you  
automatically.  
  
- It will copy the program files from the original  
  program disk in Drive A, to your working diskette or  
  your hard disk.  If you are using a hard disk it  
  will create the required directories and sub-  
  directories.  
  
- It will copy some "example" data files if you  
  request them.  If you have been using an earlier  
  version of FastBucks it will convert your old data  
  files to the new FastBucks data format.  
  
    NOTE!  If you have been using an earlier  
    version of FastBucks on your hard disk,  your  
    program files MUST reside in a directory named  
    "C:\FBUCKS" for the install program to be able  
    to find them and be able to convert your old  
    data files to the new FastBucks format.   
    Otherwise it will decide this is a "new"  
    installation, and will only copy the program  
    and example data files over to your hard disk.  
  
Installation Procedure ------------------------------  
                         
1. Insert the FastBucks Program Disk in Drive A.    
  
2. Enter "A" and press RETURN.  
  
3. Enter "INSTALL" and press RETURN.  
     
4. You will be prompted with directions on the screen.   
   Follow the directions to install FastBucks on your  
   system.

                       INSTALLATION  
  
Your Monitor Type -----------------------------------  
                    
If the install program detects a monitor graphics  
board it will ask you if you have a color monitor on  
your system:  
  
        "A color board has been detected !!   
         do you have a color monitor?      "  
  
- Enter "Y" (for Yes) if you DO have a color monitor.   
  It will configure FastBucks for color monitor  
  operation.  This configuration remains in effect  
  each time you start FastBucks.  If you want to  
  change this configuration at a later time, refer to  
  the section on "Commands".  
  
- Enter "N" (for No) if you have a monochrome monitor.   
  This will re-map all color information to "black and  
  white" on a monochrome monitor.

                    INSTALLATION  
  
Previous Versions of FastBucks ----------------------  
                                 
After the monitor type is configured, the install  
program will display this notice:  
  
          "**  WARNING  **  WARNING  **  
  
           If you have previously  been  
           using  earlier  versions  of  
           FastBucks,  you  should have  
           made  a backup  of your data  
           and program files...          
  
           Do you want to proceed (Y/N)?"  
  
  
- Enter "N" (for No) (or any other key) if you have  
  NOT made back-up copies.  The installation program  
  will abort so you can make back-up copies of your  
  existing files.  You can then start the Install  
  program again to configure FastBucks to your system.  
  
  
- Enter "Y" (for Yes) if you HAVE already made back-up  
  copies, and want to continue with configuring  
  FastBucks to your system.

Drive For Program -----------------------------------  
                    
If you answered "Y" to continue the installation, the  
program will proceed to ask you what drive you want to  
run the FastBucks program on:  
  
         "Enter the drive you want to  
          run FastBucks program files

              Enter your choice A:    "  
  
  
Enter the letter of the drive you want to run  
FastBucks on.    
  
- If you select a drive letter that is a hard disk,  
  the install program will automatically create a  
  directory on your hard disk named "\FBUCKS".  
  
- If you select a drive letter that is a floppy drive,  
  the install program will not create a directory  
  since only the program files will be placed on that  
  diskette.

Drive For Data --------------------------------------  
                 
The install program will proceed to ask you what drive  
you want to keep your FastBucks data files on:  
  
         "Enter the drive you want to

Enter the letter of the drive you want to save your   
FastBucks data files on.    
  
- If you select a drive letter that is a hard disk,  
  the install program will automatically create a sub-  
  directory (to your program directory on your hard  
  disk) named "\FBUCKS\FBDATA" to store your data  
  files in.  
  
- If you select a drive letter that is a floppy drive,  
  the install program will not create a sub-directory  
  since only the data files will be placed on that  
  diskette.  
  
  
The install program will then ask you if your  
selections are correct.  
  
- Enter "N" (for No) if you want to change any of the  
  entries for drive selection.  After you change them  
  it will ask you again if they are correct.    
  
- Enter "Y (for Yes) if the selections are correct.   
  The install program will proceed with the  
  installation process.

Converting Earlier Versions of FastBucks ------------  
                                           
If the install program determines that you already  
have an earlier version of FastBucks installed on your  
system, it will display:  
  
          "FastBucks is already installed  
           on selected drive.  
  
           The original FastBucks program  
           set-up and data files will be  
           preserved  
  
           Hit any key to continue.       "  
  
- Earlier versions on a hard disk:  
  If your existing FastBucks files are on a hard disk,  
  the installation program will look for a directory  
  named "\FBUCKS".  If it finds the existing file to  
  start FastBucks in that directory it will determine  
  the version you have been using.  If it is an  
  earlier version than this one you are installing, it  
  will convert your old program files and your old  
  data files.  The new program files will reside in  
  the directory "\FBUCKS" and the converted data files  
  will be places in the sub-directory  
  "\FBUCKS\FBDATA".    
  
- Earlier versions on a two floppy drive system:  
  If your existing FastBucks files are on a diskette  
  in drive A, the installation program will look for   
  the existing file to start FastBucks to determine  
  the version you have been using.  If it is an  
  earlier version than this one you are installing, it  
  will convert your old program files and your old  
  data files.  The new program files will reside in  
  the diskette in drive A, and the converted data  
  files will be places on a diskette in drive B.

First Installation of FastBucks ---------------------  
                                  
- First Installation on a Hard Disk:  
  If the installation program determines that this is  
  a "new" installation, it will copy the FastBucks  
  program files to a directory named "\FBUCKS" and the  
  sub-directory "\FBUCKS\FBDATA" will be reserved for  
  your data files as they are accumulated.  
  
  
- First Installation on a Two Floppy Drive System:  
  If the installation program determines that this is  
  a "new" installation, it will copy the FastBucks  
  program files to drive A at this time.  Drive B will  
  be reserved for your data files as they are  
  accumulated.  
  
  
During a first-time installation, the install program  
will ask you if you want to copy the example data  
files contained on the distribution diskette.  You can  
use these example data files to see how FastBucks  
operates.  You can make a "Test Drive" using these  
files or just play around with them to see how the  
program works.  When you wish, you can erase these  
example data files from your disk to make more room  
for your own data files as you use FastBucks.  
  
- Enter "Y (for Yes) if you DO want to copy the  
  example data files.  When they are copied to your  
  disk, the program will proceed with the  
  installation.  
  
- Enter "N" (for No) if you do NOT want to copy the  
  example data files to your disk.  The installation  
  program will proceed with the installation.

Printer set-Up --------------------------------------  
                 
The install program will proceed to display a list of  
printer types.    
  
You can navigate the cursor to the selection of your  
printer description by using the cursor arrow keys and  
the PgUp and PgDn keys.  
  
Select the appropriate printer type by moving the  
highlighted cursor bar to it and press RETURN.  
  
- If you do not have a printer at this time, you can  
  select "No Printer on System" from the last page of  
  the printer selection list.  
  
  This selection will prevent the program from giving  
  an error message if you accidentally try to use a  
  "print-only" type of report without a printer  
  connected to your system.  
  
- If you are using 14 inch wide paper on your printer,  
  you can select "No printer set-up required".  
  
- If you cannot find your printer type in the printer  
  listing, you may use the "User Installed" definition  
  by entering "U".    
  
  The install program will ask you for the appropriate  
  decimal codes for normal 80 column operation, and  
  132 column operation, along with the name of your  
  printer.

Expense Categories Set-Up ---------------------------  
                            
The install program will proceed to the expense  
category set-up.    
  
It will display a list of suggested expense categories  
for use with a personal account.  If you have  
previously been using an earlier version of FastBucks,  
the install program will display your existing expense  
categories at this time.  It will ask you:  
  
   "Do you want to change any expense categories?"  
  
- Enter "Y" (for Yes) if you DO want to change any of  
  the expense category descriptions.  
  
  A highlighted cursor will appear over the first  
  expense category.  Use the Up or Down arrow keys to  
  move the highlighted cursor onto an expense category  
  you want to change.  Press the "Del" key to erase  
  the existing description.  Then type in your new  
  description and press RETURN.  Press "F10" when you  
  have the expense category descriptions the way you  
  want them.    
  
- Enter "N" (for No) if all the expense category  
  descriptions are acceptable to you.  
  
The install program will then display a list of  
suggested expense categories for use with a business  
account.  Use the same procedure as you did for  
personal expense category descriptions.    
  
If you do not have need of either the personal or  
business categories, you can ignore it by entering "N"  
to accept them as displayed.  
  
The install program is completed.  It will  
automatically load and run FastBucks.  If you want to  
try a "test drive" refer to the following pages.

TEST DRIVE - TRY IT OUT! ----------------------------  
                           
Once you have completed the set-up of FastBucks to  
your system, you can give it a test drive to see what  
it looks like.  You can use the sample data files that  
came with the distribution diskette until you have  
generated some of your own.  When you are through  
using the sample data files, you can erase them from  
your disk if you want.  
  
In just a few minutes, you will have a good sense of  
the power and usefulness of the program.  
  
Remember, to start FastBucks you must be in the  
directory that the FastBucks program files are  
located.   
  
o Two floppy drive systems must have the FastBucks  
  program files on the disk in drive "A".   
  
o Hard disk systems will have the FastBucks program  
  files on the sub-directory C:\FBUCKS.

This section provides an overview of the special  
purpose commands that can be used in conjunction with  
the menus of FastBucks.     
  
The function keys are used for most of the commands.   
Depending upon which screen of menus you have  
displayed, the same function keys will provide  
different options corresponding to your location in  
the program.  So, when you have the Main Menu screen  
displayed, the function keys do different things than  
when you have the Account Manager menu screen  
displayed.  
  
There are some other commands that do not use the  
function keys, and we'll describe those here, too.

You can display an entry or check for review.  The  
data will be displayed in the form of a check:  
  
- If the entry does not have a note attached, and is  
  not split for expense categories, only the check  
  format with its tax deductible status will be  
  displayed.  
  
- If the entry has a note of comments attached to it,  
  the note will be displayed below the check display.  
  
- If the entry has its expense categories split, the  
  split tabulation will be displayed below the check  
  display.  
  
- If the entry has a note attached to it and has its  
  expense categories split, both the note and the  
  split will be displayed below the check display.

  or attach a note of comments to any entry.  You can  
  also purge your account of all entries you have  
  voided.

  You can display a tabulation of the current status  
  of your account.

                  1 -- UPDATE ACCOUNT  
   
Here is the procedure to update your account:

     3--Savings Account         
     4--Cash Account

   you have only one account name in the files, the    
   program will skip this step.)    
   
3. Select: 1--Update Account.  
   
4. Select which part (of the selected account) you  
   want to update by placing the cursor on the type of  
   transaction you want to enter:   
  
              1--Check                                   
              2--Deposit                                 
              3--Withdrawal                              
              4--Auto Teller

              6--Interest Pmt  
  
  You have these options available for update  
   entries:  
  
  - You can split expense categories for the same  
     Check, Withdrawal, or Auto Teller entry.  
  
  - You can attach a note of comments to each  
     transaction you enter.

  Split Expense Categories  
  To split expense categories for the same check:  
  - Press "F2" when the cursor is on the "Enter  
     expense category" entry.  The procedure is on the  
     following pages.  
  
  Attach a Note of Comments  
  To attach a note of comments to an entry:  
  - When the update selection list is displayed,  
    press "Alt-N" (or F5) to switch "Notes" ON.   
    ("Alt-N" toggles "Notes" ON and OFF, and "F5"  
    switches them ON and "F6" switches them OFF.)  
  
  
  "Check" is used to enter information about checks  
   you have written to the account.  
  
  "Deposit" is used to enter deposits you have made  
   to the account.   
  
  "Withdrawal" is used to enter withdrawals you have  
   made against the account.  
  
  "Auto Teller" is used to enter withdrawals against  
   the account you have made with an Automatic Teller  
   machine.

   you have incurred against the account.

              1 -- UPDATE ACCOUNT - CHECK  
  
Reminder!:  
If you want to attach a note of comments to any of  
these transactions, this is the time to do it, before  
you select one to update.  Press "Alt-N" to activate  
the note option.  The status line at the bottom of the  
screen will display "Notes" to indicate the option is  
active.   
  
By the way, just because you activate the notes option  
does not mean you are forced to use it.  When the  
program asks you if you want to attach notes, you can  
answer "N" for No if you decide you don't want to  
attach a note at that time.  (You can also attach  
notes to existing entries by using the "Edit Account"  
option available from the "Account Maintenance" menu.)  
  
  
When you select "1--Check" it will display a  
tabulation for entering information about a check you  
have written:  
  
  "Enter check number                 :  XXXX  
   Enter date check written           :

              1 -- UPDATE ACCOUNT - CHECK  
  
- "Enter check number"  
   FastBucks remembers the last check number you  
   entered, and automatically displays the next check  
   number at the cursor for your convenience.  If that  
   is the number you want to enter, just press the  
   RETURN key.  If you wish to enter a later check  
   number, just press the "Del" key to erase the  
   displayed number.  Then enter the number you wish  
   and press RETURN.   
  
  
- "Enter date check written"  
   The current date will be automatically displayed.   
   If you want to enter a previous date, just press  
   the "Del" key to erase the displayed date.  Then  
   enter the date of your check and press RETURN.  
  
   You can also over-type just the day or month or  
   year.  The "Tab" key will move the cursor from the  
   "day" field to the first letter in the "month"  
   field.  "Tab" once more moves the cursor to the  
   last digit in the "year" field.  "Shift-Tab" does  
   the reverse.  
  

- "Enter payee of check"
   Enter to whom the check is written.
   
     
- "Enter amount of check"  
   This is the TOTAL amount of the check.  (You can  
   split amounts of the total when you enter the  
   expense category in the next step.)

   the amount of the check.    
  
      NOTE: You can split expense categories for  
      the same check by pressing "F2" at this  
      point.  Refer to "Splitting Expense  
      Categories" on the following pages for the  
      procedure.

   IS, and press RETURN.  
  
  Then, it will display all your entries and ask:  
  
       "Is the above correct (Y/N)?"  
  
   NOTE:  If your entry for "date check written" is  
   out of chronological sequence, the program will  
   flash a notice at this point.  This is to alert you  
   before the program re-sorts the entries.   
  
   Enter "N" for No if you want to change any of the  
   entries.  Use the cursor keys to move to any entry  
   you want to change.   
  
   Enter "Y" for Yes if you want to save the entries  
   as entered.

              1 -- UPDATE ACCOUNT - CHECK  
  
  -  If you did NOT toggle "Notes" to be "ON" at the  
     "Update Account" selection menu, the program will  
     save the entries and place you back on the update  
     selection list.  
  
  -  If you DID toggle "Notes" to be "ON", it will ask  
     you:  
            "Any Comments or Notes (Y/N)?"  
  
    -  Enter "N" for No if you do NOT want to attach a  
       note of comments to this entry.  The program  
       will save the entries and place you back on the  
       update selection list.  
  
    -  Enter "Y" for Yes if you DO want to attach a  
       note of comment to this entry.  A note window  
       opens in the display.  Type your comments about  
       the entry in the window.  If you change your  
       mind, you can press the "Esc" key and back out  
       of the note window without saving it or  
       attaching it.  Otherwise, move the cursor to a  
       blank line and press "F10" to save and attach  
       the note to the entry.  
  
       
       (Illustration in registered manual)

       indicated for that entry in the "Edit Account" 
       display by a symbol made of a column of three dashes.

- Splitting Expense Categories  
  
     When you are ready to enter the expense category,  
     you can enter more than one expense category for  
     the same check:  
  
    -  Press "F2" to display the "Split Expense  
       Category" window:  

  
  
       (Illustration in registered manual)

     Press RETURN.  
  
  -  Enter the amount for the expense category.  Press  
     RETURN to move to the Tax Deductible column.  
  
  -  Enter "N" if the category is NOT tax deductible.   
     Enter "Y" if the category IS tax deductible.    
  
  -  You can enter other expense categories with their  
     amounts.  The amounts do not have to add up to  
     the total of the check.  However, the amounts can  
     not add up to more than the total of the check.   
     If you enter an amount that does, the program  
     will beep and erase the amount for your  
     correction.

- If you select "List Total File" it will NOT ask you  
  for any date.  
  
  When you select "List Total File", EVERY ENTRY in  
  the entire selected account will be displayed, a  
  screen-full at a time.  It will begin  with the  
  first entry you put in and continue to the last.    
  
  When you have accumulated a few years of entries,  
  this can grow to be a very long listing.   
  
  
  
EVERY ENTRY for a specified date will be displayed.    
  
The entries displayed in GREEN are those that are  
outstanding.  (Reverse video on monochrome monitors.)   
  
The entries displayed in RED REVERSE VIDEO are those  
that are overdrawn. (An asterisk "*" in the first  
column in monochrome.)  
  
If you did NOT toggle "Notes" to be "ON" at the  
"Account Listings" selection menu, the listings will  
not include note comments in the display.  
  
If you DID toggle "Notes" to be "ON" at the "Account  
Listings" selection menu, then each entry with a note  
attached will display the note's contents on a line  
below the entry.  The note will be displayed in yellow  
on color monitors (low intensity on monochrome).

cleared the bank):   
  
1. Select: B--List Outstanding.  
  
   The screen will display a listing of ONLY your  
   outstanding entries.  
  
   Since the entries are only those that are  
   outstanding, they will all be displayed in GREEN.

be displayed in the list.  An asterisk "*" will  
precede the amount to indicate it is a "partial"  
amount.  
  
NOTE!:  When a Tax Deductible entry has been split,  
ONLY that portion of the "split" that is tax  
deductible will be displayed in the list.  An asterisk

Printer ready!  
  
1. Be sure your printer is loaded with paper, and  
   switched "ON".  
  
  
   NOTE!:  If your printer is switched "OFF", or is  
   "Off-Line", the program will beep you and display:  
  
  
"Error                          Printer #1 Not On-Line  
 Correct the problem then press ENTER or "Esc" to Quit  
  
 -  Press "Esc" if you do NOT want to print your  
    report at this time.  You will be returned to the  
    Main Menu.  
  
 -  If you switch your printer "ON", or "On-Line",  
    then press ENTER (RETURN) and your report will be  
    printed.

Entering Dates  
  
   The date contained within brackets is the current  
   date for convenience.  If you want the current  
   date, just press the RETURN key without the need to  
   enter anything.  
  
   Enter other dates in the same format as the current  
   date displayed.  If you enter the date in the wrong  
   format, it will beep to let you know you have  
   entered it incorrectly.  
  
   You can also over-type just the characters you want  
   to be different.  Use the arrow keys to move the  
   cursor to the first character or number you want to  
   change, then just type them in.

Each account file will be displayed in sequence as it  
is being rebuilt.   
  
The length of time this takes depends on the size of  
your account files and how many there are, and the  
operating speed of your computer.   
  
For example, a PC/XT or compatible computer operating  
with a clock speed of 4.77 MHz will usually be able to  
rebuild these data files as follows:   
  
- Small account data files can take just a few    
  seconds to be rebuilt.   
  
- Large account data files can take a minute or so  
  to be rebuilt.   
  
- Many large account data files can take a few    
  minutes to be rebuilt.   
  
  
  Faster operating computers should take less time to  
  rebuild your account data files.   
  
  
After all the account files have been rebuilt, the  
screen will return to the "Utilities" menu.

Income  
------  
3. Select "1--Change Income".  The program will ask  
   for information about income for the budget period:  
  
  
  
    "Income for the period:  
  
         Enter number of incomes for family     "  
                                              
  
  
   If you enter "1" for the number of incomes, the  
   program will present just one tabulation for you to  
   enter the income amount and paycheck deductions.  
  
  
   If you enter MORE than "1" for the number of  
   incomes (up to a maximum of "3"), the program will  
   present a tabulation for each income in sequence  
   for you to enter income amounts and paycheck  
   deductions.

4. Enter your income amount.  Also, be sure to enter  
   income from other sources if you have any.  
  
  
  
  
  
       (Illustration in registered manual)  
 
  
  
  
  
Deductions  
----------  
5. After you have entered income, then enter each    
   paycheck deduction amount.  
  
   You can move the cursor over any entry without  
   entering an amount.  The entry will then be entered  
   automatically as "0.00".

                  CREATE NEW BUDGET  
  
Deductions  
  
   When you have entered the last of the paycheck  
   deductions, press "F10".  The program will ask:  
  
            "Is the above correct (Y/N)? "  
  
   Enter "N" (for No) if it is NOT correct.  You can  
   then scroll through the entries again, and change  
   any one just by entering the new amount.  When you  
   are satisfied that all the entries are correct,  
   press "F10" again.  The program will ask again:  
  
            "Is the above correct (Y/N)? "  
  
   Enter "Y" (For Yes) if the entries ARE correct.  
  
   - If you had entered more than "1" income, the  
     program will now ask for income information for  
     the next paycheck earner.  Repeat the procedure  
     for entering income and deductions for "Income  
     number 2".  Repeat this for each income earner.  
  
6. When you have completed entering income and de-  
   ductions for the last income earner, the program  
   will then ask for entries of your fixed expenses  
   for the budget period.

Fixed Expenses  
--------------  
  Enter each Fixed Expense for the budget period.  
  
  Just like the previous entries, you can move the  
  cursor over any entry without entering an amount.   
  The entry will be entered automatically as "0.00".  
  
  
  
  
  
  
       (Illustration in registered manual)

   Enter "N" (for No) if it is NOT correct.  You can  
   then scroll through the entries again, and change  
   any one just by entering the new amount.  When you  
   are satisfied that all the entries are correct,  
   press "F10" again.  The program will ask again:

Disposable Income Review  
------------------------  
7. The program compares your paycheck deductions and    
   your fixed expenses against your total income.  
  
   - If your deductions and fixed expenses are GREATER   
     than your total income, the program will beep and   
     display a notice that you cannot continue:  
  
       "Your fixed expenses exceed your income !  
        The budget process is unable to continue."  
  
     Review your deductions and fixed expenses to see  
     if there are any errors.  If not, see if you are  
     able to reduce your deductions.  You must change  
     your outgo of money so that it is less than your  
     total income.  If you can, you can start over  
     again to create a new budget.  
  
  
  
   - If your deductions and fixed expenses are LESS  
     than your total income, the program will display  
     a "Disposable Income Summary" table:  
  
  
  
  
       (Illustration in registered manual)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
   After reviewing your disposable income, press any  
   key to advance to the next display for forecasting  
   your variable expenses.

                   CREATE NEW BUDGET  
  
Variable Expenses  
-----------------  
8. Now, the program displays a table of "Variable  
   Expense Initialization".  (These are the expense  
   Categories you established  during "Getting  
   Started".)  
  
  
  
  
       (Illustration in registered manual)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
   The idea here is for you to be able to experiment  
   with your forecast of variable expenses.  The nice  
   thing is that you don't have to be agonizingly  
   accurate at this stage of the forecast.  Once you  
   have entered estimated amounts, the program com-  
   putes each of your initial entries proportionally  
   against the amount of disposable income and re-  
   displays them.  
  
   You will be able to experiment with any one or all  
   of these entries as many times as you wish.  As  
   long as you do not "freeze" an entry, you can  
   continue to make changes to it.  
  
   You can enter "0.00" for any entry by moving past  
   it.  However, we don't recommend this at this early  
   stage because "0.00" will automatically "freeze"  
   the entry at "0.00".  Unless you know you will  
   never use a particular category, it would be better  
   to enter some small amount temporarily to see how  
   the program proportions it.  You can change the  
   amount at a later time using "Update Old Budget".

                   CREATE NEW BUDGET  
  
Variable Expenses  
-----------------  
   After you have entered the last expense category,  
   press "F10".  The program asks you:  
  
           "Is the above correct (Y/N)? "  
  
   - Enter "N" (for No) to be able to scroll through  
     each of the entries again.  You can change any  
     entry while the cursor is on it.  Press "C" (for  
     Change).  Enter the new amount this way for each  
     expense category you want to change.  
  
   - Enter "Y" (for Yes) and the program will compute  
     all the expense amounts proportionally and re-  
     display the results.  
  
  
   As long as you do not "freeze" an entry, you can  
   continue to make changes to it.  When any entry is  
   satisfactory, then you should "freeze" it.  Entries  
   that are "frozen" will erase the dollar amount and  
   display only the category description in red (or  
   blank-out the description on a monochrome monitor).  
  
  
   When you press "F" to Freeze an entry, the program  
   will ask:  
                "Are you sure (Y/N)? "  
  
  
   - Enter "N" (for No) to refrain from freezing the  
     entry now.

-----------------  
                         NOTE!  
        You can freeze all the entries (or any  
        remaining unfrozen entries) all at once by  
        pressing "F10".  The program will ask you:  
  
          "Are you sure you want to Freeze  
           all remaining accounts?"  
  
        - Enter "N" (for No) to refrain from freezing  
          all the entries now.  
  
        - Enter "Y" (for Yes) to "freeze" ALL the  
          entries from further changes.  The program  
          will display:  
  
         "All remaining accounts have been frozen"  
  
  
   When you have "frozen" all the entries indi-  
   vidually, press "F10".  The program will display:

Variable Expenses  
-----------------  
   The object of this is to have all the variable  
   expense categories "frozen" before the budget is  
   established.  Once frozen, you cannot change these  
   category entries at this time.  (However, you can  
   change them later, after completing and exiting  
   this "Create New Budget".  Then you can select  
   "Update Old Budget" and make changes.)  
  
Bar Graph  
---------  
   When all the entries are frozen, the program will  
   display a convenient BAR GRAPH of all the expense  
   categories:  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
       (Illustration in registered manual)  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
   A pointer is positioned under the first category  
   bar.  That category's name and amount are also  
   displayed at the bottom of the graph.  
  
  
  
                      Page 7-16  
  
                  CREATE NEW BUDGET  
  
Bar Graph  
---------  
   You can move the pointer with the left or right  
   cursor keys (or the spacebar or backspace key).    
   As you position the pointer under each bar, its  
   corresponding name and amount displays at the  
   bottom of the graph.  
  
   Each bar length is in proportion to the percentage  
   of your total income.  
  
   If your printer can print graphics, you can make a  
   print of the bar graph at this time.  Press the  
   Shift and PrtSc keys to make a "screen print".   
   (You will be able to make a tabulated budget  
   printout later in this procedure.)  
  
   NOTE!:  Some printers must have their internal  
   switches set to enable graphics to be printed.   
   Refer to your printer's manual for the procedure.  
  
9. Press "Esc" to exit the bar graph.  
  
Save Budget to Disk  
-------------------  
10. The program asks:  
       "Enter Year For The Budget [1988]     "  
  
    The year contained within brackets is the current  
    year for convenience.  If you want the current  
    year, just press the RETURN key without the need to  
    enter anything.  
  
    Enter other years as four numbers "XXXX".  If you  
    enter less than four numbers, it will beep to let  
    you know you have entered the year incorrectly.  
  
    When you press RETURN, all your budget entries will  
    be saved to disk.

    The name you enter will be the "family name"  
    printed on the heading of the budget.  
  
    Be sure your printer is loaded with paper and  
    switched "ON".  If it is switched "OFF", or is  
    "Off-Line", the program will beep you and display:

               License is   granted  to   user to   use  the FastBucks
          program for  a period not to  exceed ninety  days from  date
          of installation  on their  computer  system  for  evaluation
          purposes. If  the user  continues  to  use  the    FastBucks
          program he  or she  is expected to pay a registration fee of
          $47.75 US funds to Software Expressions.
               
               This software   may   be  freely  copied as  long as no

           FastBucks is not a "Public Domain" or "Free" program. It is
     marketed using  the "ShareWare"  (user    supported)  concept  of
     program   distribution to avoid the high cost of advertising. You
     have the chance to try FastBucks and decide whether it suits your
     needs. If  you use FastBucks you are expected to "Buy  it".  This
     is the  ultimate "money  back guarantee".  If you  don't use  the
     program simply discard it or pass it on to a friend.
     
          For   a small  registration fee of $47.75 you will receive a
     bound 167  page user  manual, a serialized  distribution diskette
     of the  latest   FastBucks release,  A software Key to enable the
     function keys so you can turn off the exit shareware screen , and
     toggle the program  introduction  on or off as  you desire, along
     with telephone  support for  the program  for one  year following
     date   of  registration  and  my  "Sincere Thanks" for purchasing
     FastBucks.
     
           For an  additional registration Fee of $17.25 the user will
     receive "Free" Fastbucks program updates for a period of one year
     from the  date   of registration. All shipping and handling costs
     will be paid for by Software Expressions.
     
           A rebate  of $5.00  will be sent to the registered user for
     each  subsequent   registration    from  his  or  her  serialized
     distribution diskette or copies made from the serialized diskette
     for one year following date of registration.
     
     *** WARNING ****
     
     If you  have been  using earlier  versions of FastBucks, for your
     own peace of  mind and mine.
     
          BEFORE YOU RUN INSTALL MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR DATA FILES
                                     
     Things do  go wrong  when they  are most inconvenient and I would
     hate to  have you  re-key in your account  data if something went
     off into the weeds.
     
                                                                        4


     Some "Basic" operation information:
     
         Hit  "Esc" to back out of one level Menu  to a higher level
     Menu.  Or Hit "Esc" from the "Main Menu" this will exit the
     program.
     
           "Esc" is  generally (  But not always ) the "Get  me out of
     Here Key"  or "Just  kidding" key,  so if you seem to be stuck in
     the graphics  mode or  other FastBucks  function hit "Esc". NEVER
     HIT CTRL-ALT-DEL  OR TURN POWER OFF. This can damage some of your
     data files, or lose some or all of your data.
     
           Hit Ctrl+E  to jump  to the  main menu from any lower level
     menu. This also works from the account listing section.
     
         Most commands  are intuitive and  don't need much
     explanation except for the following:
     
     During an expense category input prompt:
     
     1. Hitting the F1 key will Pop-Up a listing of all expense
        categories.

     2. If you are at a expense category prompt during either update
        or edit modes:
     
         a.) Hitting the F1 key will Pop-Up a listing of all expense
             categories.
         b.) Hitting the F2 key will put you in the split account
             mode.
     
     From the "Account Manager Menu" or "First" update screen:
     
     1. Hitting  Alt+N will toggle the note entry-output mode.A Prompt
     on line  25 will  show "Notes" when this toggle is on. If "Notes"
     are toggled  "On"   the update  procedure will  accept notes  for
     each entry,and  the account  listing will   list  any  notes  you
     have   entered   on   the line  below the transaction entry. Also
     hitting the  F5 key  will turn notes "On" hitting the F6 key will
     turn "Notes" off.
     
          I  would strongly recommend a "limited" use of this feature.
     Each note eats up 69  bytes of  your disk space. Each entry  uses
     38. Since   it  is possible to  enter approximately 270,000 notes
     per account  It would  not take  very long  before your note file
     started to eat up substantial amounts of your disk space.


                                                                        5


     
     2. Hitting Ctrl + P will toggle the  printer. A prompt on line 25
     will indicate   the  listing device.  If the prompt indicates CON
     then the  listing will  go to  the   CRT. If the prompt indicates
     PRN then  the listing  will be  directed to  the   printer.  Also
     hitting   F2 will   turn  the PRN  flag "on"  and hitting  the F3
     function turn on the "CON" flag.
     
     3. Hitting  F4 will  select the  "Search" mode.   you  may get an
     individual listing  of a  account transaction  or check  while in
     this mode.
     
     4. Hitting F1 will Pop-Up a window reminding you what the
     function keys do should you forget
     
          You   may "Edit"  a   transaction amount during  the account
     reconciliation process.   simply  hit  the Left arrow  key.  Type
     in the  New    amount  then  hit  return.  The    program    will
     automatically   re-balance  your  account  before continuing with
     the reconciliation process.
     
     5. If you  hit "F1"  while  in the  First FastBucks screen a menu
     will  Pop-Up that  will allow you to redefine your CRT type, Data
     file path,expense categories,register FastBucks etc.

        If you are a "registered" FastBucks customer you will also be
     able to  turn off  the Shareware exit screen from this menu. and
