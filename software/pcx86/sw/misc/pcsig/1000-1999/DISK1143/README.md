                         PC-QUIZZER NEWS
                     Last Updated: 01-Jun-90
                     ***********************

                 SIGN LANGUAGE QUIZ NOW AVAILABLE

20-May-88: Data Assist is pleased to announce that we have
released our first courseware package for PC-QUIZZER. Sign
Language Quiz (SLQ) is a set of lessons designed to assist in the
teaching of American Sign Language. 

The package costs $59.00 and contains the complete alphabet plus
the numbers 1-10. There are three versions available: 

  SLQ-C with 640 x 200 graphics: CGA and EGA (PC) systems.
  SLQ-V with 640 x 480 graphics: VGA and MCGA (PS-2) systems.
  SLQ-H with 720 x 348 graphics: Hercules compatible systems.

PS-2 owners should order SLQ-V since the graphics contain twice
as much detail as SLQ-C. Please specify 5.25" or 3.5" disks when
ordering. 

Note: The sample SLQ files on this disk are examples of the graphics
used in the SLQ package. The complete SLQ package contains several
additional QIZ files and pictures.


                    PC-QUIZZER+ NOW AVAILABLE 

01-Jun-90: Over the last three years we have received many excellent
comments, suggestions and request concerning PC-QUIZZER. Many of
the requests are centered around various ways that the product
could be improved to make it more suitable for use in a classroom
or training environment. 

Many of our customers have indicated that they are willing to pay
extra for some of the additional features that they desire.  In
addition, many of our teachers and instructors have indicated
that they would like a "classroom license" whereby they could
distribute PC-QUIZZER lessons and quizzes without the expense and
paperwork of obtaining an Educational Site License. 

Since Data Assist strives to give our customer what they want, we
are pleased to announce our PC-QUIZZER+ package. 

PC-QUIZZER+ is an enhanced version of PC-QUIZZER that allows up
to 300 questions per lesson plus record keeping.  This product is
intended for advanced users and teachers using PC-QUIZZER is a
classroom or corporate training environment. 

PC-QUIZZER+ has the ability to save the students name or student
number, question responses and the final quiz scores.  This
information may later be displayed by the instructor.  By far
this has been the most requested feature from teachers and
corporate trainers. 

PC-QUIZZER+ also provides additional graphics modes used to
display graphics on a Hercules, CGA, EGA, MCGA and VGA device.
Included with the package are the ARGUS and VIEW programs. ARGUS
enables you to capture graphics from other programs and use them
in your PC-QUIZZER lessons. VIEW enables you to view PCX files
from DOS and tells you the PC-QUIZZER command needed to show the
picture.

Instructors are permitted to distribute (but not sell) the
QUIZZER.EXE program with any lesson that they develop. 

PC-QUIZZER+ is available for $129 plus $3 shipping.


                   SCANNING SERVICE AVAILABLE!

01-Jun-90: Interested in using graphics in your PC-QUIZZER
lessons and quizzes?  Data Assist now offers a service where we
can convert pictures, photographs, diagrams and other artwork
into screens useable with PC-QUIZZER.  We are also able to
convert images from VCR tapes as well! These screens may also be
used with Desktop Publishing, Business Presentation, and other
Computer Based Instruction packages. For more information, please
contact Data Assist.


                   TECHNICAL BBS NOW AVAILABLE!

01-Jun-90: We now also have a BBS system available for registered
PC-QUIZZER and PC-QUIZZER+ users. The BBS has a 300 / 1200 / 2400
baud modem and is available 24 hours a day. You may use the BBS
to ask technical questions, or to upload .QIZ files for others to
see.

We also use the BBS as part of our Scanning Service. If you are in
a hurry, you can Express mail your art-work to us. We will then
scan the pictures and load them on the BBS for you to download. In
most cases, the PCX files are ready to be downloaded in a day or
two.

                    PC-QUIZZER EDITOR NOW AVAILABLE!

01-Jun-90: Due to many requests from our customers, we now offer
an editor (QIZEDIT) for PC-QUIZZER. QIZEDIT is a simple to use,
specially designed editor, for creating and editing QIZ files.
The editor is menu driven with full onscreen help for all edit 
operations as well as complete help on all PC-QUIZZER commands.

Since QIZEDIT is very large, we were not able to fit it on the
Shareware disk. However, you will receive QIZEDIT when you
purchase either the PC-QUIZZER or PC-QUIZZER+ package.

Note: QIZEDIT is not included with the $29 registration.

                                INTRODUCTION

PC-QUIZZER is a Computer Based Testing (CBT) and training package designed
for easy use while retaining many of the features found in expensive CAI
packages. The product permits the user to create lessons without the
requirement to learn a complex CAI programming language. The lesson is
presented to the student using windows which contain options, questions,
the answer prompt, and help. In addition, PC-Quizzer permits the use of
color text, color graphics, sound effects, and music. A speech synthesizer
may also be used to produce speech. 

Throughout this document we will refer to "the student" and "the author".
The student is the person who is taking the quiz or lesson. The author is
the person who is writing the lesson. From the PC-Quizzer options menu the
student is able to select features such as Immediate question retry, Repeat
missed questions, Almost correct answer, Select questions based on keywords
and others. 

PC-Quizzer lessons are text files which contain questions and commands
which control the presentation of the questions. The questions used in a
PC-Quizzer lesson may be true/false, fill in the blank, multiple choice, or
K-type multiple-choice. 

The questions on the quiz may be given sequentially or be randomly chosen
by the computer. Questions that are missed are flagged for later retry, or
they may be asked again immediately until the correct answer is given. 

Each question may contain multiple correct answers and incorrect answers.
Various levels of help and other information may be included and displayed
when the student needs help or has entered a right or wrong answer. 

Quiz files may be created using QIZEDIT or any standard ASCII text editor
or word processor. Once created, the entire quiz file may be loaded into
PC-Quizzer or certain questions may be selected based on a list of
keywords. Graphics images for use with PC-Quizzer may be created with any
graphics program, painting package or an application program that supports
PCX files.  The ARGUS utility may be used to capture graphics screens from
other application programs. 

Another PC-Quizzer option permits answers that are "almost correct." This
feature allows minor misspelled words to be accepted if the response is
"similar" to the correct answer. For example: The response "Georg
Washington" may be considered correct as the answer to "Who was the first
President of the United States?" 

PC-Quizzer can be used for instruction in almost any subject including
foreign languages, history, science, math, vocabulary and word definitions.
It may also be used to ask trivia questions at your next party for hours of
fun. PC-Quizzer is an excellent educational tool and a must for everyone
involved with learning or teaching. 

                                AVAILABILITY

PC-Quizzer is available for the IBM PC and most compatibles. PC-Quizzer
requires only one disk drive and either a Monochrome, CGA, EGA, MCGA or VGA
graphics adapter. The system should have at least 384K of RAM memory. 
Additional memory is required for graphics.  Color Graphics is only
supported on graphics adapters compatible with those made by IBM.


                                PC-QUIZZER 

                              GETTING STARTED

Lesson files, or quiz files, may be created using QIZEDIT or any standard
text editor. If a word processor is used be sure that the non-document or
ASCII mode is used.  A complete description of QIZEDIT is available in
another section of this document. 

Questions are organized into question entries. Each entry contains the text
of the question, one or more correct answers, any anticipated incorrect
answers and optional text to be displayed for various conditions. As you
will soon discover, there are many other PC-Quizzer commands that may be
used in a question entry. 


                           OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

PC-Quizzer is executed by typing QUIZ from the DOS ">" prompt. PC-Quizzer
will begin by displaying the title screen. Press the ESC key to proceed to
the main menu. 

The main menu contains several options which are used to load files and set
parameters which control the way PC-Quizzer operates. Simply press the key
corresponding to the appropriate menu option. 

The following section describes in greater detail the main menu options and
how they are used. 


                          PC-QUIZZER MENU OPTIONS

                          A - ALLOW APPROX. MATCH

This option may be used to enable or disable PC-Quizzer from allowing minor
misspelled answers from being accepted as correct.

If this parameter is set to NO, the student must enter the answer exactly
as specified in the QUIZ file. Only an exact match will be accepted.
PC-Quizzer will always accept answers in either upper or lower case. 

When this parameter is set to YES, PC-Quizzer will determine if the answer
entered by the student is "almost" like one of the correct answers given in
the question entry. This feature may be used when the student should not be
penalized for a minor misspelling of the answer. 

                               B - BEGIN QUIZ

This option is used to begin a quiz. Before you can begin a quiz you must
load one into the computer by using either Option L or Option K. After the
quiz has completed you may repeat the quiz again by selecting Option B a
second time without the need to reload the quiz file. Also see Option M. 


                         C - DISPLAY CORRECT ANSWER

This option is used to control if the correct answer is displayed  whenever
the student enters an incorrect answer. 

If this parameter is set to NO, the correct answer will not be displayed.
If this parameter is set to YES, the correct answer will be shown to the
student. You may choose to set this option to YES while the student is
studying the subject matter or is taking a practice quiz. 

Note:  Should the question contain multiple correct answers, only the first
correct answer will be displayed. Also see $ANSWER under the Commands
section. 

                              E - EXIT PROGRAM

This option will cause PC-Quizzer to exit back to MS-DOS. 


                           H - DISPLAY HELP LINES

This option controls whether PC-Quizzer displays HELP lines during the
quiz.

If this parameter is set to YES, the student may request help by entering a
question mark while at the answer prompt. PC-Quizzer will display a window
containing any HELP lines given in the question entry. If this parameter is
set to NO, then the help text will not be displayed. 
 
If no help is available for a question and the student asks for help, an
error message will be displayed in the error window. This parameter should
be set to YES during drill and practice sessions. Also see $HELP under the
commands section.

                            I - IMMEDIATE RETRY

This option is used to control whether the student will be given a second
(or third) chance to correctly answer a question. 

If the Immediate Retry option is set to YES, the student is given three
attempts to supply a correct answer to a question. If the Immediate Retry
option is set to NO, the student will be given only one try to enter the
correct answer. If the student enters an incorrect answer, the question
will be graded as wrong. 

The student may retry the missed question at a later time by choosing
option M on the main menu. Also see Option M. 


                              K - KEYWORD LOAD

This option performs the same function as Option L except that the student
may specify a list of keywords. The keywords are used to select questions
from the quiz file. 

After the student has specified the quiz filename, PC-Quizzer will display
a keyword window. The keywords are entered into this window, and the arrow
keys may be used to move around the inside of the window. When all the
keywords have been entered the END key is used to terminate the list. The
keywords may be entered in either upper or lower case.

When searching the quiz file, PC-Quizzer will select only those questions
which contain one or more of the keywords specified within the text of the
question.  All keywords for a question must be indicated using the $KEY
command.  Also see Option L and $KEY under the commands section.

Example:  Use Option K to load the STATES demo file and specify the name of
your state and the name of each of your adjacent states. 

                                L - LOAD ALL

This option is used to Load All questions from a quiz file. All of the
questions will be loaded and selected. After the quiz file has been loaded,
select Option B to begin the quiz. Also see Option K.

                             M - REPEAT MISSED

After completing a quiz, Option M may be used to repeat any questions that
were missed. Option M may be repeated over and over again until no more
questions are missed. The "Wrong:" field on the main menu indicates the
number of questions which will be selected if Option M is specified.

                              R - RANDOM MODE

This option tells PC-Quizzer to randomize the questions before they are
asked. This is a very useful study technique. Random mode is the opposite
of Sequential Mode. Also see Option S. 

                            S - SEQUENTIAL MODE

This option is the opposite of random mode. If sequential mode is
specified, PC-Quizzer will present the questions in the same order as they
appear in the quiz file. This is the default mode. Also see Option R.

                              V - VOICE OUTPUT

If your computer has a VOTRAX Type'n Talk, Personal Speech System, or ECHO
synthesizer, you may select option V to enable speech output. PC-Quizzer
will "speak" the questions and other messages to the student.

Note: PC-Quizzer requires an initialization file to define the synthesizer
communications port. Registered users should contact Data Assist for an
Applications Note which describes how to set up the port before using a
speech device. Registered users with a speech synthesizer other than those
previously listed should contact Data Assist for support.


                                  COMMANDS

The question entry starts with a $QUESTION command and ends with a $EOQ
command. Each line of text between these two commands is part of the
question entry. Each question entry must also have at least one $ANSWER
command.

Example:

$QUESTION
What is 1+1? 
$ANSWER 2
$EOQ

Each PC-Quizzer command begins with a dollar sign which must start in
column one. The command name may be abbreviated to three characters, but no
less! 


$ACCEPT 
 
Syntax:  $ACCEPT prompt-string 
 
The $ACCEPT command is used to prompt the student for an answer. 
 
In text mode, the student is prompted in the response window at the bottom
of the screen. 
 
In graphics mode, the student is prompted at the current graphics cursor
location. You may use the $LOCATE command to position the graphics cursor
at the desired screen location before using the $ACCEPT command. 
 
Note:  A question may use only one $ACCEPT command. 
 
Examples: 
 
$QUE 
$TITLE Accept in Text Mode 
What State has a capital of Montgomery? 
$ACCEPT And the answer is? 
$ANS ALABAMA 
$EOQ 

$QUE 
$TITLE Accept in Graphics Mode 
$PCX 0 USA.PCX 
$PAINT 197 133 2 
$LOCATE 16 80 
$DISPLAY Name this state... 
$LOCATE 192 8 
$ACCEPT Name? 
$ANS ALABAMA 
$EOQ 
 
See also:  $LOCATE and $ASK 


$ANSWER

Syntax:  $ANSWER answer-string 

The $ANSWER command tells PC-Quizzer what the correct answer to a question
is. A question may contain multiple correct answers, but each correct
answer must be specified on a different $ANSWER command. 


After the $ANSWER statement you may have additional lines of text. These
lines will be displayed in the question window if the "answer-string" 
matches the answer given by the student. If your question has multiple
correct answers, you may have different responses for each of the possible
correct answers.

Example:

$QUESTION
What is 1+1? 
$ANSWER 2
$EOQ


$ASK

Syntax:  $ASK prompt-string 

The purpose of the $ASK command is to prompt the student for an answer
while a graphics image is displayed. If the $ASK command is not used,
PC-Quizzer will return to the text screen and prompt the student for an
answer. If $ASK is used while a text screen is currently displayed, it will
be ignored. See demo file USA.QIZ. 


$CGA

Syntax:  $CGA mode picture-file-name 

The $CGA command is used to display a BSAVE color graphic image. The mode
parameter specifies the video mode needed to display the graphic image.
Currently only modes 4, 5 (medium resolution) and 6 (high resolution) are
supported.

Picture-file-name is the name of a disk file which contains the graphic
image. The complete file path name must be given. The graphic image must be
stored in BSAVE format. Also see the $PCOLOR command. 

Note:  Data Assist recommends the use of the $PCX command rather than the
$CGA command.  The $CGA command may become obsolete in a future version of
PC-Quizzer.


$CHOICE

Syntax:  $CHOICE style

The $CHOICE command is used to display a menu of answers. The student
selects an answer by using the arrow keys on the keypad. The style
parameter is used to indicate the type of answer that is expected. The
valid style parameters are:

     K - when a K-type answer is needed.
     T - when a True/False answer is needed. 
     C - when a single Character answer is needed.
     N - when a Numeric answer is needed.
     X - when an eXact answer is needed.

The lines following the $CHOICE command are used as the items on the menu.
The menu is presented to the student using a scroll-bar window. When style
K or T is specified, PC-Quizzer generates the menu automatically.  The
answer for the question (specified with the $ANSWER command) must contain
the correct number of characters:

     K - 1 character: A, B, C, D or E.
     T - 1 character: T or F.
     C - 1 character: Must match the first character of the answer.
     N - 1 to 70 characters in length. Must exactly match the answer.
     X - 1 to 70 characters in length. Must exactly match the answer.


Example:

$QUE
In what month was George Washington born?
$CHOICE C
A. January
B. February
C. March
D. April
E. May
$ANS B
$EOQ


Note:   Sample file CHOICE.QIZ provides additional examples showing the use
of the $CHOICE command. 


$DISPLAY 
 
Syntax:  $DISPLAY text-string 
 
The $DISPLAY command is used to display text strings on a graphics screen.
The $DISPLAY command is ignored if used within a text window. 
 
The text-string is displayed at the current graphics cursor location.  You
may use the $LOCATE command to position the graphics cursor at the desired
location before using the $DISPLAY command. 
 

Example: 
 
$QUE 
$TITLE Display in Graphics Mode 
$PCX 0 SKULL.PCX 
$LOCATE 8 16 
$DISPLAY Which bone is the Temporal Bone? 
$LOCATE 192 16 
$ACCEPT Number -> 
$ANS 7 
$EOQ 
 
See also:  $LOCATE and $ACCEPT 


$EOQ

Syntax:  $EOQ 

This command marks the End Of the Question (EOQ). It must be the last
statement in the question entry. Its purpose is to mark the end of the
question and all the additional commands and text lines which are part of
the question entry. 

Example:

$QUESTION
What is 1+1? 
$ANSWER 2
$EOQ  


$GCOLOR

Syntax:  $GCOLOR f-color b-color

The $GCOLOR command defines the foreground and background colors for use
with the $DISPLAY and $ACCEPT graphics text commands.  The $GCOLOR
statement must come before the first $DISPLAY or $ACCEPT statement within
the question entry.

The values of f-color and b-color depend on the current graphics video mode
and color palette used.


$HELP

Syntax:  $HELP 

The $HELP command marks the beginning of a HELP block. The lines following
the $HELP statement (until the next command) will be displayed if the
student enters a "?" at the Answer prompt. If menu option H is set to OFF
then PC-Quizzer will not provide the student with any help. 

The HELP text is displayed in the HELP window. 


Example:

$QUE
Who was the first president of the U.S.?
$HELP 
This person, who is often called the founder of our country, and also
appears on the $1 bill.
$ANS George Washington
$EOQ 


$KEY

Syntax:  $KEY keyword-1 keyword-2 ... 

The $KEY command gives the author the ability to specify keywords in a
question entry. The keyword(s) specified on the $KEY statement are used by
the Keyword Load Option (K) to select questions based on keywords. 


$KTYPE

Syntax:  $KTYPE code 

PC-Quizzer provides a facility to accept K-type questions. The K-type
question format is often used on professional examinations.

A K-type question contains 4 items of which 1 or more are true. The answer
is either A, B, C, D, or E and is formed using these fixed rules: 

     The answer is A if items 1, 2 and 3 are true. 
     The answer is B if items 1 and 3 are true. 
     The answer is C if items 2 and 4 are true. 
     The answer is D if only item 4 is true. 
     The answer is E if items 1, 2, 3 and 4 are true. 


Example:

$QUE 
Which of the following Presidents were in office before 1850?

     1. George Washington 
     2. Ronald Reagan 
     3. Andrew Jackson 
     4. Abraham Lincoln

$ANS B 
$! B means that 1 and 3 are true.
$KTYPE 1 
George Washington's term began in 1789.
$KTYPE 2 
Ronald Reagan's term began in 1981.
$KTYPE 3 
Andrew Jackson's term began in 1829.
$KTYPE 4 
Abraham Lincoln's term began in 1861.
$EOQ 

The correct answer in this example is B, which means that (1) George
Washington and (3) Andrew Jackson were both in office before 1850 and the
others were not. 


Should the student incorrectly answer this question, PC-Quizzer will use
the text following the corresponding $KTYPE statement to display why the
specified answer was wrong.

Note:   In order for PC-Quizzer to properly ask a K-type question, the
above format must be used. For more insight into using K-type questions
load the file KTYPE.QIZ from the distribution disk.  K-type questions may
not be used in conjunction with Graphic Screens.


$LOCATE

Syntax:  $LOCATE x-loc y-loc

The $LOCATE command is used to position the graphics pointer at a desired
screen location.  The x-loc and y-loc parameters specify the starting x and
y location to place the graphics pointer.

Generally, the $LOCATE command is used in conjunction with $DISPLAY and
$ACCEPT when displaying text on a graphics screen.  The $LOCATE command is
ignored if the video screen is in a text (character) mode.

Note:  The graphics pointer is not visible on the screen.  The pointer
simply points to a pixel location on the graphics screen.


$NOISE 
 
Syntax:  $NOISE sound repeat delay 
 
The $NOISE command is used produce sound effects within your PC-Quizzer
questions. The sound parameter is a single letter code from the list below. 
It selects which sound to use. The repeat parameter specifies the number of
times to repeat the sound effect. The delay parameter specified the number
of milliseconds to wait before the sound is repeated. 

 
    Sound       Effect 
     
      A       Bat screech 
      B       Birdcall 
      C       Clock Ticking 
      D       Door Buzzer 
      E       Explosion 
      F       Flying Saucer 
      G       Generator Starting 
      H       Phaser Sound 
      M       Machinery 
      N       Phone Ringing 
      O       Phone Busy 
      P       Photon Torpedo Fire 
      R       Rescue Siren 
      S       Spigot Dripping 
      T       Train Passing 
      W       Whooping Siren 
      X       Computer Thinking 
      Y       Conveyor Moving 
      Z       Crickets Chirping 
 

By using different values for repeat and delay you can produce different
sound effects. Most of the effects will sound good if you use a repeat
value of 4 or 5. To achieve a variety of sound effects, you will need to
experiment using different values for repeat and delay. 
 
Note:   Some of the sound effects have a built in delay.  If you specify a
delay parameter other than one, you may not be able to distinguish the
difference. 


Example: 
 
$QUE 
$TITLE Noise Demo 
In the Disney movie "Bambi", is Bambi a Boy or a Girl? 
$CHOICE X 
Boy 
Girl 
$ANS Boy 
$RIGHT 
$! Make a Phaser sound 
$NOISE H 5 1 
Good Answer. 
$WRONG 
$! Make a Whooping Siren sound 
$NOISE W 5 1 
No, Bambi is a Boy. 
$EOQ 
 
See also:  $SET NOISE  

 
$NOT

Syntax:  $NOT incorrect-answer-string 

The $NOT command is similar to the $ANSWER command except that it specifies
an incorrect answer. The text block following the $NOT statement will be
displayed in the question window if the student enters an incorrect answer
which matches the incorrect-answer-string. A question entry may contain
multiple $NOT commands.


Example:

$QUE
Who is the current president of the U.S.?
$NOT Dan Quayle
No, Mr. Quayle is the Vice President.
$NOT Ronald Reagan
No. Mr. Reagan was our last President.
$ANS George Bush
$EOQ

 
$PAGE 
 
Syntax:  $PAGE 
 
The $PAGE command will cause PC-Quizzer to display "Press Enter for the
next page..." in the answer window. The lesson will pause until the student
presses the Enter key or the Return key. This command may be used to divide
up a large question into screens that fit inside of the question window. 

The $PAGE command is similar to the $PRESS command. However, the $PAGE
command will cause the question window to be cleared before the next page
of text is displayed. 


Example: 
 
$QUE 
The capital of Alabama is Montgomery. 
Juneau is the capital of Alaska. 
Phoenix is the capital of Arizona and also its largest city. 
The capital of Arkansas is Little Rock. 
$PAGE 
The capital of Alaska is... 
$CHOICE X 
Little Rock 
Phoenix 
Columbus 
Juneau 
$ANS Juneau 
$EOQ 



$PAINT

Syntax:  $PAINT x-loc y-loc color-code 

The $PAINT command is used to paint an area of the screen. The x-loc and
y-loc specify the starting x and y location of the area to paint.
PC-Quizzer will paint the area using the color-code specified. The area to
be painted must be outlined with a color different from the present color
of the area. See demo file USA.QIZ. 

Note:   $PAINT should NOT be used to paint complex areas of the screen.
Doing so may cause the stack to overflow and the PC to lock up!!!


$PCOLOR

Syntax:  $PCOLOR palette-number 

Before using the $CGA command you should set the desired pallet-number by
using the $PCOLOR command. The palette-number may be either 0 or 1 on a
Color Graphics Adapter. 


$PCX

Syntax:  $PCX mode pcx-file 

The $PCX command is used to display a graphics file stored in PCX format.
The mode parameter represents the graphics mode needed to display the
picture. The mode also defines the Horizontal and Vertical dimensions of
the picture as well as the number of colors: (HORIZONTAL x VERTICAL x
COLOR):


     0 - CGA (320 x 200 x 4) 
     1 - CGA (640 x 200 x 2) 
     2 - EGA (320 x 200 x 16)
     3 - EGA (640 x 200 x 16)
     4 - EGA (640 x 350 x 2)
     5 - EGA (640 x 350 x 16)
     6 - VGA (640 x 480 x 2) [also used on MCGA]
     7 - VGA (640 x 480 x 16)
     8 - VGA (320 x 200 x 256) [also used on MCGA]
     9 - Hercules (720 x 384 x 2)


Example:

$PCX 8 BUNNY.QIZ

This command will display a picture of a bunny using 256 colors on a VGA or
MCGA graphics system. 

Notes:  Only modes 0, 1, 6, 8 and 9 are supported in PC-Quizzer. All the
video modes listed earlier are supported in PC-Quizzer+. 

Although many software products are capable of creating PCX files, Data
Assist can only guarantee compatibility with the PCX files created using
ARGUS. Please refer to the Graphics Application Notes for additional
information on creating PCX files. 
 
ARGUS is a graphics screen capture program that supports all the above PCX
display modes. Additional information on ARGUS may be found under the
Graphics Utilities section of this document. Data Assist also provides a
color scanning service for customers who wish to display photographic
images in their PC-Quizzer lessons. 
BSAVE files are still supported in order to maintain compatibility with
previous versions of PC-Quizzer. Data Assist recommends that customers
switch to using PCX files. 



$PLAY

Syntax:  $PLAY music-string 

The $PLAY command is used to play music. The music string contains an
expression which describes the music to be played. The music string uses a
format similar to the PLAY statement in BASIC. See demo file MUSIC.QIZ.


     A-G: plays this note in the current octave. 
     On:  sets n as the current octave. (0..6) 
     Nn:  plays note n. (0..84) 
     Ln:  set the length of the following notes. (1..64) 
     Pn:  set the length of a rest. (1..64) 
     Tn:  sets the number of quarter notes in a minute (32..255) 
     >n:  plays note n in the next higher octave. 
     <n:  plays note n in the next lower octave. 
     ML:  play complete period of Ln value. 
     MN:  play 7/8 time of Ln value. 
     MS:  play 3/4 time of Ln value. 

Example:

$QUE 
Name this tune... 
$PLAY T120L4MNO4C8C8DCFE2C8C8DCGF2C8C8O5CO4A 
$PLAY FED2T90B-8B-8AFGF2 
$ANS HAPPY BIRTHDAY 
That was an easy one. 
$EOQ 


$PRESS

Syntax:  $PRESS 

The $PRESS command will cause PC-Quizzer to display "Press Enter to
continue" in the answer window. The lesson will pause until the student
presses the Enter key or the Return key. This command may be used to divide
up a large question into paragraphs that fit inside of the question window.


Another use for the $PRESS command is just prior to the use of a $CGA or
$PCX command. This allows the student an opportunity to read a question
before being presented with a graphic image.

See also:  $PAGE


$QUESTION

Syntax:  $QUESTION [name] 

This command marks the beginning of a question. The question may optionally
contain a name from 1 to 8 characters in length. Although you do not need
to name a question, if a name is used, it should be unique.

Following the $QUESTION command is the body of the question. This text is
displayed in the question window when PC-Quizzer asks the student this
question. 

Additional PC-Quizzer commands may be included within the question body. 
For example, $PLAY, $NOISE, $TEXT, $PRESS, etc.

The $ANSWER command is used to indicate the end of the question text.

Example:

$QUESTION
What is 1+1? 
$ANSWER 2
$EOQ


$RANGE

Syntax:  $RANGE low-value high-value

The $RANGE command provides an easy way to specify a numeric answer range.
The two parameters indicate the low-value and the high-value of the correct
answer.

After the $RANGE statement you may have additional lines of text. These
lines are displayed if the student's answer falls within the specified
range. A question entry may contain multiple $RANGE commands.


Example:

$QUE
What is the square root of 2?
$RANGE 1.4140 1.4143
$ANS 1.41421
$EOQ

Note:  Every question must have at least one $ANSWER command, even if the
question contains a $RANGE command.


$RIGHT

Syntax:  $RIGHT 

The $RIGHT command begins a block of text which is displayed whenever the
student enters any answer that is correct. This command is typically used
when the question contains multiple correct answers. 


Example:

$QUE 
What is the capital of Michigan?
$ANS Lansing
$RIGHT 
Many people believe that Detroit is the capital because it is the 
largest city in Michigan and also the best known.
$EOQ
 
See also:  $WRONG


$SET

Syntax:  $SET option value

To accommodate the setting of various program options, PC-Quizzer provides
the $SET command. All $SET commands must appear in the lesson file before
the first $QUESTION command. 

Some of the $SET commands correspond directly to the menu options of PC-
Quizzer. Other $SET commands are used to control options only available
with PC-Quizzer+.


Allow Approximate Answer (Menu Option A):

     $SET APPROXIMATE ON
     $SET APPROXIMATE OFF

Display Correct Answer (Menu Option C):

     $SET CORRECT ON
     $SET CORRECT OFF

To set the limit for the number of question retries: (PC-Quizzer+ ONLY)

     $SET RETRY 1
     $SET RETRY 2
     $SET RETRY 3

Note:  You must use "$SET IMMEDIATE ON" in conjunction with the "$SET
RETRY" command.  Some $SET commands are ignored by PC-Quizzer. They are
only valid  in a PC-Quizzer+ lesson.


$SLEEP

Syntax:  $SLEEP seconds 

The $SLEEP command causes PC-Quizzer to sleep for the specified number of
seconds. If any key is pressed while PC-Quizzer is sleeping, the program
will continue.


$TALK

Syntax:  $TALK speech-string

This command will output the speech-string on a speech synthesizer.

Note:   In order for your computer to talk, you must have either a VOTRAX,
ECHO, or DECTALK speech synthesizer.


$TATTRIB

Syntax:  $TATTRIB index f-attrib b-attrib 

The $TATTRIB command provides an alternate, shorthand method to specify
foreground and background colors. This command performs the same function
as $TCOLOR. However, numeric attribute (color) codes are used rather than
the symbolic codes used by $TCOLOR. $TATTRIB also provides the ability to
specify attributes for use with Monochrome monitors and color display
adapters which use non-standard color attributes. See demo file MONO.QIZ.


$TCOLOR

Syntax:  $TCOLOR index f-color b-color [BLINK] 

The $TCOLOR command defines a foreground color and background color for use
with the $TEXT command. The index may range from 1 to 10. You may
optionally use the modifier BLINK to select a blinking color. The $TCOLOR
statement must come before the first $TEXT statement within the question
entry. 

Up to ten different color groups may be defined and used per $TEXT command.
Once the colors are defined by $TCOLOR, they may be used by multiple $TEXT
commands within the same question entry. See demo file TCOLOR.QIZ.

The color codes which may be specified for f-color and b-color are: Black,
Blue, Green, Cyan, Red, Magenta, Brown, White, Grey, LBlue, LGreen, LCyan,
LRed, LMagenta, Yellow and LWhite. 

Example:

$QUE 
$TCOLOR 1 BLACK WHITE
$TCOLOR 2 WHITE BLACK BLINK
$TCOLOR 3 RED BLACK
$TEXT This is {Reversed}. This is {Blinking}. This is {RED}. 
And this is a normal line of text... 
$TEXT What does {1+1} equal? 
$ANS 2 
$EOQ 


$TEXT

Syntax:  $TEXT text-string 

The $TEXT command displays the text-string in the question window. If the
text string contains sub-strings enclosed inside of {} characters, these
sub-strings will be colored using the color codes specified by the $TCOLOR
or $TATTRIB commands. Each group of sub-strings may be colored differently.
Up to ten sub-strings may occur within one text-string. 

See also:  $TCOLOR and $TATTRIB


$TITLE 
 
Syntax:  $TITLE title-string 
 
The $TITLE command is used to give a "name" to a question.  This name is
currently only used by the QIZEDIT program to build a table of question
titles. This feature makes it easy for you to locate and edit a question. 
 
The $TITLE command is ignored by the PC-Quizzer program. 

Example: 
 
$QUE 
$TITLE The Happy Birthday Song 
Name this tune... 
$PLAY T120L4MNO4C8C8DCFE2C8C8DCGF2C8C8O5CO4A 
$PLAY FED2T90B-8B-8AFGF2 
$ANS HAPPY BIRTHDAY 
I thought you would know this one!!! 
$ANS BIRTHDAY 
Close. 
$EOQ 


$WRONG

Syntax:  $WRONG 

The $WRONG command is similar to the $RIGHT command except that the block
of text is displayed only if the student enters a wrong answer. 

Example:

$QUE 
What is the capital of Michigan?
$ANS Lansing
$WRONG
Sorry!  Even though it might not be as well known as Detroit, Lansing is
still in fact the capital of Michigan.
$EOQ

                         GRAPHICS APPLICATION NOTES

This section provides tips on converting images from other products to a
format compatible with PC-Quizzer.

                            CONVERTING GIF FILES

GIF is Compuserve's Graphics Interchange Format. There are several hundred
high quality, color pictures available in the Compuserve Picture Forum.
Many of these pictures are also available on various BBS systems and
through many Shareware vendors.

Use any GIF display program to display the picture. Then use ARGUS to
convert the picture into a PCX file.  

                PC PAINTBRUSH, PAINTBRUSH+, PC PAINTBRUSH IV

The PCX files created by these ZSoft products are compatible with PC-
Quizzer. Some video modes are not currently supported but will be in future
versions of PC-Quizzer.

                               PC PAINT PLUS

Create a picture using PC Paint Plus. Use the Tools Option: Show Screen to
view the picture. Capture the picture using ARGUS.

                               PICTOR / GRASP

Pictor is the paint program that comes with GRASP from Paul Mace Software.
The CGA and EGA mode PCX files created by Pictor are compatible with PC-
Quizzer. However, Pictor does not create compatible 256 color PCX files. 
To create a 256 color PCX file, first use Pictor and create a .PIC file.
Exit Pictor and use SHOWPIC to display the picture. Use ARGUS to convert
the picture into a useable PCX file.

                                  SPLASH!

Create a picture using Splash! Save the picture as a .SS file. Use the
SHOWSS program to display the picture and capture it using ARGUS. 

                                  COLORIX

Create a picture using ColoRIX. Save the picture as a .SCI file. Use the
RIXLATE program to display the picture and capture it using ARGUS.


                              DELUXE PAINT II

For EGA pictures: Create a picture using Deluxe Paint II. Save the picture
as a .LBM file. Use the CONVERT utility to convert the .LBM file to a .PCX
file. 

Example:  convert -d puzzle.lbm -p3 puzzle.pcx

This procedure does not work for 256 color VGA pictures.


                                DR. HALO III

You may use ARGUS to capture a picture directly from the VGA Paint screen. 
Hint:  If you press Alt-Ctrl-G just after pressing the left mouse button,
the mouse cursor will be invisible in the captured image.

                                PC-KEY-DRAW

ARGUS.

                 LOGITECH PAINTSHOW-PLUS / SCANMAN SCANNER

Scan an image using the Logitech ScanMan Scanner. Use the Logitech PS-Plus
paint program to display the image and capture using ARGUS. Do not use the
TIF2PCX conversion utility provided by Logitech. This utility will not
create a PC-Quizzer compatible PCX file.

                               COMPUTER EYES

VU.COM to grab a video image. Store the image in .VI format. Exit VU.COM,
then use SHOW to display the .VI file. Capture the image using ARGUS. 

                            OTHER PAINT PROGRAMS

Most paint programs have an option that enables you to view a picture
without showing all the icons and tools. Use this capability to display a
picture and capture using ARGUS. ARGUS will save the image as a PC-Quizzer
compatible PCX file.


                           COLOR SCANNING SERVICE

Data Assist provides a complete color scanning service where we can convert
your pictures, photographs, diagrams and other artwork into PC-Quizzer
graphics screens.

We can also scan images to be used with most painting, drawing, animation,
presentation and desktop publishing packages.

For additional information, please contact Data Assist, Inc.


                           ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

PC-Quizzer may be used on a Monochrome Monitor or a Color Graphics Monitor.
The program defines 6 windows which are used for all screen displays. They
are numbered as follows: 

     1 - Main Menu Window 
     2 - Question & File Load Window 
     3 - Answer Window 
     4 - Help & Keyword Load Window 
     5 - Error Window 
     6 - Grade Window 

On a Monochrome system each window uses the same two colors. On a color
system PC-Quizzer uses default colors that should be visible on any
monitor. If your monitor (monochrome or color) is unable to display the
default colors, you may find it desirable to change these colors. This may
be done by typing the command COLOR from the MS-DOS prompt before you start
PC-Quizzer. 

Example:

     C> COLOR
     C> QUIZ

                                    ---

PC-Quizzer uses direct memory I/O to the video screen. While this technique
is very fast, it is also prone to not work correctly on some
not-so-compatible computers. Please contact Data Assist if you are having
any problems using PC-Quizzer on your video system. 

                                    ---

PC-Quizzer permits all responses to be entered in upper or lower case. This
includes menu options as well as keywords and question answers.

                                    ---
 
When entering True/False questions into the quiz file, the author should
enter "$ANSWER T" or "$ANSWER F" as the correct answer. This will enable
the student to enter "T", "F", "TRUE" or "FALSE" as their answer. 


                                RESTRICTIONS

For PC-Quizzer a maximum of 100 questions may be entered into a question
file. PC-Quizzer+ allows up to 300 questions per file. Depending on the
size of the questions and amount of memory in your computer, it is possible
to exceed memory before all of the questions have been loaded. 

Note:  The Shareware version of PC-Quizzer is limited to 500 lines of text
per QIZ file. 
                                    ---

The length of each quiz text line should not exceed 100 characters.  The
QIZEDIT program requires that each text line be 78 characters or less.


                                SAMPLE FILES

Several sample quiz files have been included on the distribution diskette.
These files are intended to show examples of the format used to build your
own lesson files. We suggest that you experiment with these files to help
you better understand how to use PC-Quizzer. 


                                  REQUESTS

Data Assist has designed PC-Quizzer to be both flexible and easy to use.
Like any software package there are numerous improvements and additions
which could be made. We have received several requests and invite you to
submit written requests at any time.
 
Registered users are asked to "vote" for the requests that they would like
to see implemented. To vote, simply mail us a letter indicating which
requests from the list below you would like to see implemented. Those items
which get the most votes will get the most attention in future releases. Be
sure to include your own requests or comments if you have any.


REQ001: Add EGA graphics support. (Available in PC-Quizzer+)

REQ002: Add an $INCLUDE command to include files.

REQ003: Save scores on disk with student names. Also a list of which
questions they missed would be nice. (Available in PC-Quizzer+).

REQ004: Allow colors to be used in help messages. 

REQ005: Would like to save a quiz in the middle and resume at a later time.


REQ006: Need to have multiple part questions, i.e., here is some text, and
these five questions are about this text. The GMAT has questions like this.

REQ007: Would like to be able to change menu options like A,C,H,R,S and I
in the middle of the quiz. 

REQ008: Would like to "preview" a quiz, i.e., have the computer ask the
questions and show me the answer. Then I can practice typing in the
answers. Later on I will take the quiz and enter the answers the normal
way. Many times I just want to learn how to spell the answers and this
would sure help. 

REQ009: Provide an option to scan a quiz and mark the questions to be
selected. It would be nice if the selected questions could be written back
to disk as another quiz.  (This feature is available with QIZEDIT).

REQ010: Sometimes I find typo errors in my questions. I'd like to be able
to call up an editor while in PC-Quizzer and fix it. An integrated Editor
would be perfect!

REQ011: For very large questions, I'd like to be able to scroll back and
forth in the window. Need this capability on the HELP window too.

REQ012: I would like to say "Skip question M if I got question N right." Or
"Skip question M if I got question N wrong..." 

REQ013: Need to have numeric answer ranges. (Now available).

REQ014: The ability to load selected questions from multiple quiz files
using keywords. The ability to load all questions from multiple files. 


                              ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

PC-Quizzer was written in Turbo C from Borland International. About 10% of
the code is assembler.  We have found the Turbo C compiler to be very fast
and highly recommend it.

A special thanks to our customers (and even some non-customers) who have
provided us with numerous ideas, suggestions and requests. 


                               ERROR MESSAGES

Can't open the quiz file. Please try again -- The quiz file specified does
not exist or the filename was entered incorrectly. 

Duplicate question -- The question you are trying to append already exists
in the edit file.

File already exists, overwrite? -- You are changing the file name to an
already existing file.  The contents of these files may be different, so be
careful if you reply "Y".

File contains too many questions -- The file you are trying to load
contains too many questions for QIZEDIT.

File has been updated, save? -- You are about to exit QIZEDIT, but have not
saved the current edit file which you have changed.

File not found -- The specified file can not be found in the current
directory.

Graphics card is not compatible with this PCX file -- The file that you
specified appears to be a valid graphics file. However, your graphics
adapter is unable to display the image. Generally this error occurs when
you attempt to view a Hercules file on a non-Hercules device, or a VGA file
on a non-VGA device. 

Illegal CGA mode -- Only CGA modes 4, 5 and 6 are supported in this version
of PC-QUIZZER. See section on $CGA command. 

Illegal command or parameter -- A command was read from the quiz file which
is either an unknown command or is a legal command which contains an
illegal parameter. Correct the statement and try again. 

Invalid file name -- You have specified a file name that contains invalid
characters.  A file name can contain the characters A-Z, 0-9, $, #, or @. 

Invalid PCX file: xxxxx -- The file that you specified does not appear to
be a valid PCX graphics file. Does the file have a .PCX extension? Was the
file created by ARGUS? 

Maximum of 100 questions loaded -- A maximum of 100 questions were loaded
from the quiz file. PC-Quizzer will only use the first 100 questions on the
quiz. PC-Quizzer+ permits a maximum of 300 questions per quiz file.

quiz, you must load a quiz file using either option K (Keyword Load) or
option L (Load All). 

No question in CUT buffer -- You are trying to PASTE a question when the
CUT buffer is empty.  You must CUT a question before you can PASTE it.

No questions were missed -- An attempt has been made to use option M when
there are no questions marked as being missed. See discussion of option M. 


Not enough memory -- PC-Quizzer was unable to allocate enough memory to
work correctly. For most quiz files, 384K of memory should be sufficient. 

Open failure for file: xxxxx -- VIEW was not able to open the file that you
specified. Please supply a correct path and file name. 

Question entry is missing an answer -- A question does not contain an
$ANSWER statement. PC-Quizzer will skip this question.

Question already in CUT buffer -- You are trying to CUT a question, when a
question has previously been CUT and not pasted.  You must PASTE the
current question in the CUT buffer before you can CUT another.

Quiz file is empty. Please try another file -- The file you are trying to
load into PC-Quizzer does not contain any questions. Are you sure that you
specified the correct name of a quiz file? 

This file is not compatible with PC-QUIZZER -- The file that you specified
appears to be a valid PCX file, but was saved in such a way that it is
incompatible with PC-Quizzer.

This question does not have an answer. Skipping on -- PC-Quizzer is trying
to ask you a question which does not have an answer. Edit the quiz file and
be sure that each question entry has at least one $ANSWER command with the
correct answer specified. See also $ANSWER. 

Too many lines read -- The quiz file you are loading is too big for the
version of PC-Quizzer that you have. Make the QIZ file smaller and try
again. Contact Data Assist if you require a larger version of PC-Quizzer.

Too many questions -- You have reached the limit on the number of questions
in the edit file.  You can not execute any functions which add additional
questions (See section on limits).

Unable to display PCX screen -- While executing a $PCX command, PC-Quizzer
was unable to display the picture. Make sure that the picture file exists
on your disk. This error can also occur if PC-Quizzer attempts to display a
picture and you do not have the appropriate graphics hardware.

Unable to load picture -- While executing a $CGA command, PC-Quizzer was
unable to locate the file which contains the graphic image. Make sure that
the picture file exists in the path you specified on the command.

Unable to open VOICE port -- PC-Quizzer could not open the port which
drives the speech unit. Make sure that the port is configured into your
system. 

VOICE port is unknown to PC-Quizzer -- Prior to using the speech device
with PC-Quizzer you must create an initialize file which sets up the port.
