## Information about "MENU CONSTRUCTION SET 1 OF 2 (2119 ALSO)"

    This isn't merely another menu program, rather it is software that lets
    you construct customized and detailed menus.  With MCS, you can create
    extremely clean menus, with no unnecessary distractions on the screen.
    The menus are not memory resident, and therefore use no additional
    memory.
    
    Create attractive colorful menus with shadowing effects.  Your menu
    choice can run a batch file, display an informational screen you
    create, or display another menu.  MCS allows up to 100 items per
    menu and there's no limit on the number of menus in a given menu set.
    
    The edit/construct mode uses "1-2-3 like" commands to walk you through
    the process of creating your own menu design.  There are no
    documentation manuals with this program -- that's how easy it is to
    use!  Ideal for the system consultant or computer pro who needs to
    create a user friendly environment for computer neophytes.  Full
    mouse and LAN support is provided.

                                                                          -2-
  COMMAND DESCRIPTIONS for the MCS editor
  
  
  TOP LEVEL COMMANDS
  
  To execute any command in MCS, you must first press the slash (/) key.
  Then use the arrow keys to highlight your selection and press Enter, or
  just press the first letter of your selection as a shortcut.  For example,
  press the slash key (/) and then the letter A to execute the Add command.
  
  Add (/A):     Add a new item to the currently displayed menu.
  Edit (/E):    Make changes to the currently selected item.
  Menu (/M):    Make changes to settings related to the currently displayed
                menu only.
  Global (/G):  Make changes to settings related to all of the menus in the
                current menu set.
  Set (/S):     Menu set operations such as load, create, copy, or delete
                menu sets.
  Run (/R):     Run the current menu set.
  Xport (/X):   Export the current menu set to a diskette that can be
                installed to other PCs.
  Info (/I):    Information about The Menu Construction Set
  Quit (/Q):    Leave The Menu Construction Set (all changes are
                automatically saved).
  
  
  USING THE ADD COMMAND (/A)
  
  The Add command allows you to add a BatchFileItem (type /AB), a
  SubmenuItem (/AS), or an InfoScreenItem (/AI) to the currently displayed
  menu.  A BatchFileItem is an item which, when picked by the end user,
  executes a batch file.  A SubmenuItem is an item which, when picked by the
  end user, displays another menu.  An InfoScreenItem is an item which, when
  picked by the end user, displays one or more screenfuls of text.
  
  A BatchFileItem is composed of the following:
  - menu item name:  name which appears on the menu
  - help message:  optional message which appears on the bottom of the menu
    when the item is highlighted
  - password:  optional case-sensitive password for the item
  - argument prompt:  optional text which will be displayed upon selection
    of the item.  The end user will be able to supply arguments to the
    batch file
  - batch file:  the commands which are executed
  
  A SubmenuItem is composed of the following:
  - menu item name, help message, and password which operate the same as in
    a BatchFileItem
  
  An InfoScreenItem is composed of the following:
  - menu item name, help message, and password which operate the same as in
    a BatchFileItem
  - information screen which is displayed when the user selects this item.
    There is no limit on the length of the message, the user can use the
    PgUp/PgDn keys
  
  
  

                                                                          -3-
  USING THE EDIT COMMAND (/E)
  
  The Edit command allows you to edit previously defined menu items.  To use
  the Edit command, first select the item in the menu that you would like to
  change, and then press /E for Edit.
  
  
  USING THE MENU COMMAND (/M)
  
  The Menu command allows you to change settings that affect an entire menu.
  When you select the Menu command, a second layer of commands is displayed.
  
  Title (/MT):     The title of a menu is the line of text that appears at
                   the top of a menu.
  
  Colors (/MC):    Change the colors of the currently displayed menu only.
  
  Move (/MM):      Move the currently selected item to a different position.
  
  Item type (/MI): Change the currently selected item to a different item
                   type.  (BatchFileItem, SubmenuItem, or InfoScreenItem).
  
  Delete (/MD):    Delete the currently selected item.
  
  
  USING THE GLOBAL COMMAND (/G)
  
  The Global command allows you to make changes to settings related to all
  of the menus in the current menu set.
  
  Colors (/GC):     Change the colors of those portions of the screen
                    outside of individual menus.
  
  Date (/GD):       Display the date in the upper left hand corner or not.
  
  Time (/GT):       Display the time in the upper right hand corner or not.
  
  User help (/GU):  Define text that appears on the bottom line of the
                    screen.  For example, "Menus developed by ABC Company".
  
  Shadowing (/GS):  Use the shadowing effect on color monitors or not.
  
  Inactivity (/GI): Screen saver option.  Enter period of inactivity before
                    the screen saver is activated.  Enter 0 to disable the
                    screen saver.
  
  Escape (/GE):     Allow the end user to exit to DOS by pressing Escape,
                    or not.
  
  Wrapping (/GW):   Allow cursor wrapping or not.  A third setting is called
                    "Selective" - if a mouse is attached, wrapping is
                    disabled, but if there is no mouse, then wrapping is
                    enabled.
  
  LAN (/GL):        If multiple users are going to access the same menus
                    located on a network drive, then the batch files should
                    be placed on a local drive, typically drive C.  (Note
                    that a LAN Server License is required to legally install
                    MCS on a LAN Server.)
  
  
  

                                                                          -4-
  USING THE SET COMMAND (/S)
  
  The Set command allows you to manipulate entire menu sets.
  
  Load (/SL):      Load in an existing menu set.  Menu sets can also be
                   loaded when you invoke MCS - for example, MCS EXAMPLE
                   will automatically load the menu set called EXAMPLE.
                   When no argument is given (e.g. MCS), then the default
                   menu set is loaded (the default menu set is called
                   DEFAULT).
  
  Create (/SC):    Create a new menu set.
  
  Make copy (/SM): Make a copy of the currently loaded set.
  
  Erase (/SE):     Delete a menu set.  You cannot delete the currently
                   loaded set.
  
  
  USING THE RUN COMMAND (/R)
  
  The Run command runs the current menu set.  This is useful for quickly
  moving between the end user and authoring environments as you develop and
  debug your menu sets.  To "complete the loop", define a "Run MCS"
  BatchFileItem so that you can quickly switch environments.
  
  
  USING THE XPORT COMMAND (/X)
  
  The Xport command exports the current menu set to a diskette that can be
  installed on other PCs.  (Note that the purchase of an Unlimited Run-time
  Distribution License is required before you can install this diskette on
  other PCs.)
  
  
  USING THE INFO COMMAND (/I)
  
  The purpose of this command is similar to a README file.  It displays
  information pertaining to The Menu Construction Set.
  
  
  USING THE QUIT COMMAND (/Q)
  
  The Quit command exits The Menu Construction Set and returns you to DOS.
  Since menu information is continuously saved to disk as you use MCS, there
  is no need to save menu sets before you exit to DOS.
  
  
  

                                                                          -5-
  TECHNICAL SUPPORT
  
  Registered users can call 603-362-4758 for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
  technical support.  If you are asked to leave a message, we will call you
  back as soon as possible.
  
  
  INFORMATION ABOUT RECONFIG - THE DOS CONFIGURATION MANAGER

  Reconfig is an extremely useful utility that allows the user to quickly
  change to various Autoexec.bat/Config.sys combinations.  PCM Magazine
  awarded Reconfig 2.1 a Publisher's Pick in its January 1989 issue.  Now
  Reconfig 3.1 is available for $39.50, and can be ordered directly from
  Optimal Solutions of NH.
  
  Currently, DOS users juggle multiple Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files by
  using DOS commands and a text editor.  Now they can use Reconfig with its
  integrated text editor and easy-to-use two-dimensional menus to maintain
  up to 100 different "configurations" (Autoexec.bat/Config.sys
  combinations).
  
  A key feature of Reconfig is its optional command line interface.  With
  just one DOS command, you can switch to a predefined DOS configuration and
  automatically reboot your machine.  Another useful feature is the ability
  to import any DOS text file, which means you won't have to retype your
  current Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files.
  
  And here's a sweetener.  If you buy Reconfig 3.1, you will receive Version
  4.0 of this indispensible utility automatically.  Even if there is a price
  increase, you will receive Version 4.0 at no charge.
  
  Hardware requirements for Reconfig 3.1 are 384K RAM, DOS 2.0 or later, and
  a hard disk.  As is true of all OSNH software products, Reconfig 3.1 is
  not copy protected.  For more information, see the RECONFIG.DOC file on
  MCS Installation Disk 1.
