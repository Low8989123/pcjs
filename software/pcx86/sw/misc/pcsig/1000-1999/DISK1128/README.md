## Information about "SNOBOL4+ UTILITIES 2 OF 2 (ALSO 928)"

    Programmers -- Here's a diskful of handy utilities to take
    over some of the drudgery of programming for you.
    
    Assembler source utilities include ASMGEN2 and MAKASEQ, two disassembly
    aids for the program ASMGEN (not included on this disk).  ASMRECOV
    recovers assembler source from listing files, and PUBLBL is a debugger
    for assembly language.
    
    ASMSTAT generates assembler program statistics, GENTBLS generates
    program source code tables, and SAPREF appends the assembler
    cross-reference to the listing file.  CASE is a text file utility that
    converts files containing upper and lower case characters into all upper
    or lower case characters.  DIFFER finds differences in two text files,
    and LIST displays any text file.
    
    MSCRIBE produces a handy formatted version of a text file for easy
    reading.  OVER shifts a print file to the right, and REPAGING
    repaginates a text file.  PLAYCVMS, PLAYCUT, and PMUSCVT are utilities
    for the program DRVSPKR.SYS (not on this disk).  DELALL deletes all
    matching files, DIRCMP2 compares files in different subdirectories, and
    DIRTREE makes a file of subdirectories present.
    
    Among the other utilities on this disk are MELIZA, a psychoanalysis
    program, and SPACE, a disk-space management and recover utility.
