## Information about "FISH-N-LOG"

    Want to catch a lot more fish?  Want your fishing excursions to be more
    productive today and far more productive tomorrow?  The serious angler
    will find this computerized fisherman's logbook the answer to an empty
    creel.
    
    FISH-N-LOG lets you log important facts about your fishing trip by
    answering questions asked by the program.  You are queried in
    detail about each fishing trip as to weather conditions, water
    levels and conditions, moon phase, feeding times, "hot spots",
    methods used, lures or bait used, depth, and much more.  Angling
    sophisticates who use solunar time as a means of predicting when
    fish bite will find FISH-N-LOG very helpful.  With this information
    you'll be able to duplicate successful fishing trips in the future.
    
    You can enter an "endless narrative" regarding situations you want to
    detail.  Reports to refresh your memory of previous trips are
    recalled by location, month, or location and month with the results
    listed on screen.  The registered version offers a print option.
