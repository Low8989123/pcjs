## Information about "EASY INVENTORY"

    EASY INVENTORY brings small businessmen a near perfect stand alone
    inventory control program. It can end the retailer's worst nightmare:
    too much of what is not selling stacked next to empty racks that ought
    to be holding the goods that sold like hotcakes. Instead, you can have
    the sweet dreams of having on hand what the public wants, when it wants
    it, and for the best price volume purchasing can buy.
    
    The basic inventory control chore of reporting what goods are on hand by
    numbers, locations and supplier is taken care of smoothly. With
    virtually unlimited capacity, it allows the businessman to quickly enter
    purchases and record sales. Then it reports what is on hand and where
    it is located. Lastly, you tell EASY INVENTORY what minimum quantity of
    each should be on hand and it will tell you what is needed, and how much
    you should buy from each supplier.
    
    EASY INVENTORY offers nine reports. It tells you sales by time period
    or sales by both time period and location. It prints purchases and
    sales for the period, a useful tool for cash flow and usage monitoring.
    You can also print out total inventory. The reorder report prints what
    you should order by item. Another report tracks back orders. You can
    print out a price list and an inventory by location and an inventory by
    supplier.
