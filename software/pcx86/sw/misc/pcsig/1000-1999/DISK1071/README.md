## Information about "TEACHER'S TWOSOME"

    Teachers -- GRADER makes statistics that let you evaluate test
    quality and helps you establish grade breakdowns.
    
    Just enter the number of problems in an exam and GRADER displays a
    table of possible scores based on the number of either right or wrong
    answers.  GRADER can give standard statistics including range, midrange,
    median, mean, standard deviation, mode, skewness index, and a
    distribution of scores according to letter grade.  The grade ranges are
    set by the program, but can be changed at any time.  GRADER also
    displays listings of standard (Z) scores and all raw scores ranked in
    descending order.
    
    Other features include: Rapid computation of the score a student needs
    on a final exam in order to pass the course; random number selectors to
    determine the correct answers on multiple-choice questions and to draw
    items from a test item bank; and difficulty and discriminability
    indices.
    
    CLASS RECORD is a spreadsheet-style program for maintaining grades and
    averages over the course of the school year.
    
    A record of each student's name and grades is recorded.  Give grades
    different weights, omit grades for absent students, and drop or change
    grades at any time.  Calculate the total averages for each student and
    the total class average.  You can also calculate a subset average for
    each student, such as the student's average for quizzes, tests, labs,
    etc.  Printouts are available for many record combinations.
