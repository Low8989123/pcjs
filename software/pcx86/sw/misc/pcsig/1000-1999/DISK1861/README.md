## Information about "DSTUFF"

    It's a safe bet that one or more of these DSTUFF utilities will prove
    invaluable to programmers and other people who make their living with
    computers. Serious home computer users will also benefit from these
    speedy utilities.
    
    D makes the DOS "DIR" command obsolete. Using color highlights, D
    displays directory information, sorted by file name in ascending or
    descending order. Switch from displaying the file size to displaying
    the DOS file date. Hidden files can no longer hide. If they're on your
    hard disk, D will find them for you.
    
    DZIP displays the internal directory of members of PKWare "ZIP" files.
    Information is displayed in groups of 58 entries. DZIP will tell you
    what the individual file size will be after it is uncompressed. It can
    display the total compressed size and the total extracted size of all
    archived members of the file and the total disk space that will be used
    if all members are compressed or uncompressed.
    
    DARC displays the internal structure of SEA "ARC" files and their
    compressed sizes or with a quickcommand line option see what the
    un-compressed sizes are! Also, you will be shown what compression
    method was used for each entry.
    
    DDBASE will display all of the header information for any dBase III,
    III+, or IV ".DBF" file. You will see all of the field names, their
    type and length in an easy to follow paged format. Also displayed is
    the total record size, number of records, and the date the file was
    created or last modified.
    
    DICE shows what files are in an LH ".ICE" compressed file. You can see
    all of the files, or by using an optional command line mask only the
    files you wish to see. You can elect to see the compressed file sizes,
    or the un-compressed sizes. You will also be shown what compression
    method was used for each entry.
    
    BIOSD is identical to D except the BIOS is used for screen writing to
    allow operation on DeskView and other multi-taskers.
    
    SCRNPRT.COM allows you to redirect all LPT output to any other device or
    file. It is a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program.
    
    All of the programs in the DStuff Package can detect if they have been
    attacked by most viruses and will warn the user if this occurs. These
    programs also use fast direct screen writing and colors to display the
    needed information as quickly as possible in an easy to read format.
    All colors are user configurable in a simple, easy to use, point and
    shoot manner that automatically detects the presence of a mouse and
    allows it to be used along with the cursor keys.
    
    Users of any of these programs will find their lives made easier with
    these utilities.

DARC displays the internal structure of SEA "ARC" files and provides the
same type of functions as DZIP, except that it does not provide the     
uncompressed individual file sizes.
