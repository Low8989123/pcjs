## Information about "ALIEN WORLDS"

    Here's an exciting game to show off your VGA screen.  You're space
    walking in your space suit and you have to shoot aliens as they attack.
    The surreal view of outer space -- its detail and color -- make ALIEN
    WORLDS a unique action game.  There are no documentation files with this
    program, but what you need to know is given within the program itself.
    The game is easy to grasp, but not as easy to master.

Program title: Alien Worlds v1.01

Detailed Program Description: Alien Worlds is a 256-colour VGA/MCGA
video game. It also requires a mouse. It takes place on alien
worlds (how did you guess). The player is a little guy with a
machine gun in a space suit. He is chased around by many different
kinds of aliens. There are five levels and each one took a long
time to draw and look almost airbrushed and really show off the VGA
capabilities.

Unique features: VGA graphics. There are utilities (with
registration) that allow the user to create new aliens and
background screens by drawing them with a special VGA drawing
program. Also the speed of the game can be changed.

Capacity: Limited only by disk space. Each screen needs about 60k
of disk space, and each alien needs about 5k.

Requirements: A VGA or MCGA compatible display, a mouse, and either
a 3 1/2" drive, a high density 5 1/4" drive, or a hard disk (the
program needs 680k of disk space with all screens installed). Note
that it could be run on a 360k drive with most of the background
screens erased.

How to start: Type "ALIEN"

Registration: $5 registration, $15 creation utilities, $25 Quick-
Basic 4.5 source code.
