## Information about "EASY ACCESS"

    EASY ACCESS is an easy-to-use hard disk menu system that gives you usage
    logging, a screen saver, a calendar, and reminder functions.  It lets
    you build your own custom menus and then select options, rather than
    having to remember specific program names, in order to run that
    program.  You can control your system with just a few keystrokes.
    
    EASY ACCESS gives you 16 options per menu, with unlimited submenus. You
    can set up user log-on ID's which restrict usage to users you've
    chosen.  You can also track the use of particular options such as how
    many times an option is used, by whom, date and time, etc.  A
    screen-saver option blanks the screen after a predetermined length of
    inactive time to prevent damage to the monitor.
    
    You never have to miss another important date or appointment with the
    calendar and reminder option.  The reminders can be set for: one time
    only, annually, monthly, quarterly, weekly, semi-annually, or every day.
