## Information about "ACCOUNT + PLUS"

    Do you need an integrated accounting management system for your
    business? ACCOUNT + PLUS is the ideal choice, providing everything a
    small business needs in one package.
    
    ACCOUNT + PLUS consists of individual modules: payroll, bookkeeping,
    inventory, checkbook, receivables, payables, and report generation.
    The payroll module handles all types of employee payroll. Deductions
    include federal, state taxes, insurance, and pension. Earning may be by
    hour, week, month, or commission.
    
    The bookkeeping module operates as a general ledger, keeping track of
    all of your income and expenses. It will also write the checks you need
    to issue in paying your bills.
    
    The inventory module lets you maintain an inventory database with add,
    delete, and change record functions. Many report generation options are
    available here.
    
    The checkbook module is a complete checkbook management system. It will
    keep track of your deposits, your withdrawals, your checks, balancing of
    your checkbook, and several report printing options.
    
    ACCOUNT + PLUS is menu driven with an on-line help facility that does
    away with the need to constantly refer to printed documentation. No
    small business should be without ACCOUNT + PLUS, the integrated
    accounting management system.
