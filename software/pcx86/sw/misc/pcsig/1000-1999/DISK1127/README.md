## Information about "TERRA*TIME & WCD"

    TERRA*TIME tracks and displays the local time in hundreds of cities
    around the globe.
    
    It considers not only time zone effects, but also daylight savings time
    at each city.  Information comes up on a full-screen color non-graphics
    display.  Windows and menu-driven commands are used for program
    modifications and program options let you tailor the display for their
    specific needs.  As many or as few cities as you want can be displayed.
    The military or 12-hour clock can be selected and the layout of the
    world map can be varied to suit you.
    
    Additional program features include time zone differences, great circle
    distances between cities, and a special alarm feature that can be set
    for any world city time.
    
    The WORLD CITY DISTANCE COMPUTER is designed to provide distance and
    travel time information between more than 400 different world cities,
    including most major US cities.  The program is windowed, menu-driven
    and self-explanatory.
