## Information about "SECURITY ERASE"

    SECURITY ERASE is a file-erasing program that lets you remove a disk
    file completely.  The file is overwritten and cannot be recovered even
    using an ``unerase'' utility, such as Norton Utilities or Professional
    Master Key (PC-SIG disk #598) which can fix normal accidental deletes.
    
    Unlike the DOS erase command, this program does not accept wild cards.
    This eliminates the possibility of accidentally deleting files with
    similar names or extensions.  The program also lets you rethink your
    decision about removing a file before actually proceeding to erase it,
    because once it's gone...it's permanent!
    
    You might like to use SECURITY ERASE if you are working with important
    files and need added security when you erase to ensure that confidential
    information stays that way!

  This program will permanently remove a file from a disk or diskette.  It will
first overwrite all data areas of the file, and then will change the name to a
series of special characters and delete it.  After this process, the file
cannot be recovered by any means.

  You will be prompted by the program for all information required to remove
the file, and may exit at any time.  After the file has been found, you must
enter the word PROCEED to actually delete the file ( anything else will exit
without deleting ).

  You must specify the full filename and extension of the file to be removed.
To prevent accidents, no wildcards are allowed.  Please make sure that you
really want to delete a file before entering PROCEED.  Remember that after this
is done there is no recovery.

  This is a shareware program. You may share copies with others ( please copy
this file also ).  If you continue to use it, please send $12 to Caledonia
Software at the address on the LOGO screen.  Thank-you for trying our program.
