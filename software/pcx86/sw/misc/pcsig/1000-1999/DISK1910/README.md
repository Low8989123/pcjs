## Information about "PC-INVENTORY+"

    An inventory program -- not an accountant, not a computer cash
    register -- just an inventory program. But if that's all you want, then
    this one is easy to use with lots of screen help and good report
    features.
    
    Pull-down menus make this program easy, especially if you are familiar
    with the inventory process. You configure the program at startup to
    handle your particular items, stock numbers, minimum inventory, prices,
    etc., and it will generate "year to date" sales reports, "low
    inventory reports"  listing those items that fall below the minimum
    inventory level, and an "inventory price list" -- a report of all items
    in the inventory showing your profit or loss margin on each item.
    If you have a mouse attached to your computer it will help you move
    around the main menu.
