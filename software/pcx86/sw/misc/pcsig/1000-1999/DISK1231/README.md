## Information about "ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT 1 OF 2 (1232)"

    Want to create your own text adventure games?  Now, with the ADVENTURE
    GAME TOOLKIT (AGT) you can, and you don't need to know programming!
    
    In text adventures, players assume the roles of characters in a story
    which they read.  But unlike a book story, the reader is able to
    interact with the plot, go different directions, ask questions and do
    things which may lead them to treasure or doom.
    
    Using AGT, game enthusiasts can now transform their wildest fantasies
    into high-quality adventure games -- and teachers and parents, with a
    little imagination, now have a wonderful tool for making riveting games
    that can teach basic subjects, such as history, math, foreign langauges,
    vocabulary development, etc., in a fun and impactful way.
    
    AGT can create complex worlds with up to 200 locations, 100
    inanimate objects (swords, trees, cars, lasers, etc) and 100 animate
    objects (hobbits, orcs, famous persons, etc.).  An AGT game can
    understand a 400-word vocabulary that can include complex (multiple
    actions) and function key macros for common commands for a polished
    result that conforms to the Infocom standard in adventure games so
    anyone can learn to play quickly.
    
    AGT comes with complete instructions (100 page on-disk manual) and a
    sample mini-game that is walked through showing what can be created
    using AGT without requiring the game designer to have programming
    knowledge or experience.  It also contains the source code files for the
    Colossal Cave adventure.  This is an AGT version of the original game
    that was written by Crowther and Woods that was the first adventure game
    ever written.  It is a classic!  The AGT files for this game can be
    played and enjoyed simply as great entertainment or as a platform to
    build upon and/or learn from for the AGT game designer.

VENDOR.DOC:  Distribution Restrictions  for  the Adventure Game Toolkit


Distribution of AGT by disk vendors and computer dealers:

    Distributors of "public domain" or user-supported software libraries must
obtain written permission to distribute copies of AGT and related adventure
game files.  No one may use AGT as a promotion for any commercial venture or
as an enticement for the user to pay for any program, product, or service
unless they have received the express written permission of the program's
authors.
     As an exception to this policy, any vendor who is an approved vendor and
associate member (in good standing) of the Association of Shareware
Professionals (ASP) may distribute AGT without prior written permission,
provided that the vendor notifies Softworks in writing that it will
distribute the program.

In order to distribute AGT, a dealer or disk vendor must comply with the
following conditions:
    (1) You must obtain written permission from Softworks to distribute AGT.
If you receive no reply, write again: our silence does NOT constitute
permission, and you may not distribute "pending" receipt of permission.
    (2) A fee of not more than $7 may be charged for each disk sold.  This
includes "multi-disk" volumes: AGT may not be included on any disk sold for
more than $7, including CD-ROM or optical disks, without express written
permission from Softworks.
    (3) Vendors may not modify or delete ANY files on the disk.  Vendors may
add a "GO" program, and/or a reasonable number of small text files designed to
assist or provide a service to the user, but these added files must be easily
identifiable and end-users must be allowed to delete the added files.
    (4) Vendors must make a reasonable effort to distribute only the most
recent versions of AGT.  All vendors who have requested and received written
permission to distribute AGT will be notified of updates as they are
released.
    (5) All disk vendors must comply with any and all vendor guidelines or
vendor requirements set forth by the Association of Shareware Professionals
(ASP); for more information about ASP, contact its chairman, Jim Button, at
Buttonware in Seattle.  Violation of any ASP guideline or requirement
automatically revokes permission to distribute AGT.
    Generally, vendors must make an attempt to educate users on the
nature of Shareware.  Catalogs, advertisements, order forms, and all disks
sold should contain ASP-approved or recommended wording describing the nature
of shareware, and should explicitly state that no part of disk sale revenues
are paid to the programs' authors.  Vendors may not advertise under the
heading "Public Domain Software", "Free Software," or the equivalent.  When
vendor catalogs or advertisements carry both Shareware and PD programs, the
Shareware programs must be differentiated from the public domain programs in
some way (in the description, with an asterisk, by listing the registration
fee, or in some other way).

-----

Distribution of AGT by game authors:
    Authors of AGT games may distribute the AGT "driver" program, RUN.EXE, 
with their games for the purpose of playing games written using the Adventure 
Game Toolkit.  If the game will be widely distributed, we ask that you request 
written permission and send us a copy of your game so we can notify you of 
updates or changes to AGT, especially changes that may affect your game.  If 
your game will be commercially distributed, you must obtain a written license 
to distribute RUN.EXE; there is a one-time fee of $10 for this license for 
commercial distribution.  A disk vendor may sell the RUN.EXE program together 
with adventure games for which the vendor has obtained distribution rights. 

-----

END-USER LICENSE TERMS (Shareware Rules)
    The Adventure Game Toolkit (AGT) is NOT public domain or free software, 
but is being distributed as "Shareware".  This means that if you are a regular 
user of AGT, you should pay for your copy and become a registered user.  Only 
from the income from your registration fees can the authors continue to 
provide product support, make enhancements to AGT, and stay in business. 
    Non-registered users of this software are granted a limited license to 
make an evaluation copy for trial use on a private non-commercial basis, for 
the express purpose of determining whether AGT is suitable for their needs. At 
the end of this trial period, the user should either register his/her copy of 
AGT or discontinue using it. 
    Registered users of AGT may use AGT on any computer, provided that AGT is
used on only one computer at a time, and that the copy is not routinely used
on that computer by other people.  If other people use the copy of AGT
routinely, they should become registered users themselves.  Registered AGT
users may make archival and working copies of the AGT program disk(s) to back
up their software and protect their investment.  They may also make evaluation
copies of AGT for trial use by non-registered users, subject to the terms
outlined above.
    Operators of electronic bulletin boards (Sysops) are encouraged to post
the Adventure Game Toolkit and related Adventure Game files for downloading
by their users.  However, if these bulletin boards also offer AGT-based games
for "On-Line" or "Doors" play, these Sysops should register their copy of AGT
because they are using AGT on a routine basis.  Such registration will entitle
these Sysops to receive a version of AGT especially tailored for use on
bulletin boards, plus copies of all of the latest AGT games.
    This license to use AGT does NOT include the right to distribute or sell
AGT.  You may only distribute AGT for a fee after obtaining written permission
from Softworks.
    AGT may be uploaded to and downloaded from commercial systems such as
CompuServe, GEnie, and BIX, so long as the only charge paid by the
subscriber is for on-line time and there is no charge for the program.  Those
copying, sharing, and/or electronically transmitting the program are required
not to delete or modify the copyright notice and restrictive notices from the
program or documentation; anyone doing so will be treated as a contributory
copyright violator.
    The Adventure Game Toolkit documentation may not be modified by users.
The program may not be separated from the documentation when distributed.
Printed or "Xeroxed" copies of the AGT documentation may not be distributed
or sold without the written permission of Softworks.

WARRANTY:  If purchased directly from Softworks, the program disk(s) and 
printed manual are warranted to be free from defects in materials and 
workmanship for a period of 90 days from the date of purchase.  In the event 
of a defect, registered users of AGT may obtain a replacement copy of the 
program disk(s) and/or manual from Softworks.  The remedy for any breach of 
warranty shall be limited to replacement or refund and shall not encompass any 
other damages, including but not limited to loss of profit, special, 
incidental, consequential, or other similar claims. 

DISCLAIMER:  THE ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT (AGT) COMES WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES 
OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR OF FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ADVENTURE GAME TOOLKIT (AGT) IS AVAILABLE AS IS. IN NO 
EVENT WILL THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS OR 
INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF THE AUTHORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF 
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
