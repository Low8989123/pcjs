## Information about "BOAT BOX"

    BOATBOX is an attractive series of reading drills for children,
    ages 3-7. Parents need to assist their children in these exercises.
    
    Each of four word lists contain 26 unique words. When the word is read
    correctly, the helper pushes the "+" key to reward the pupil with
    brightly-colored objects dancing on the screen to merry music.
    
    Missed words are repeated after all 26 words are completed. When all
    words have been read properly, the pupil is rewarded with flashing
    lights, a siren wail and a cartoon of dancing teddy bears.

                           Brandon's Lunchbox (Boats)

                                  a series of
                             educational programs
                             for 3 to 7 year olds

                            Baton Rouge , La. 70816 


         NOTE:
           
            "Brandon's Lunchbox" requires an IBM PC or compatable with 
         color graphics capability.  The programs all use CGA 
         graphics.

            The timing loops in the programs are based for the 
         standard 4.7 Mhz PC processor.  If you're using a faster 
         machine, you may wish to place your machine in "slow" mode. 
         
            "Brandon's Lunchbox" may be copied to and run from a hard 
         drive.  All programs must exist in the current default drive 
         and directory.

            "Brandon's Lunchbox" is a Shareware product.  It may be 
         distributed for evaluation purposes provided that all 
         programs noted in the appendix plus this documentation file 
         are distributed together.
         
             

 


         The LunchBox


         The Lunchbox programs must all exist in the current drive and 
         directory.  

         There are different offerings in the Lunchbox series.  This 
         particular module is known as "BoatBox".

         To begin, type "BOATBOX" at the DOS prompt and press enter.

                (NOTE: This version of the Lunchbox is 
                customized to display a child's name.  Simply 
                supply the child's name as a parameter.  For 
                example, "BOATBOX MARY" or "BOATBOX ALEX".)

         You'll see:

                             A   B   C   D    


         
         The Lunchbox contains four educational games.  To select a 
         game from the lunchbox, just press one of the letters A 
         through D. 
         
         To quit the Lunchbox and return to DOS, press a "+" or the 
         Escape key. 
         
         


         
        
         Games number one through four -- Games A through D 
         
         
         The "BoatBox" series is a set of reading drills.  Each of the 
         four modules contains 26 unique words.  These drills should 
         be played with a monitoring helper (like Mom or Dad!)

         The player receives a word.  If he reads the word properly, 
         then press the "+" key.  The player receives an audible 
         award, plus a brightly colored object pops up on the screen.

         If the player misses the word, press any other key.  This 
         word goes back into a stack of missed words.  It will not be 
         displayed again until the player goes through the list of all 
         26 words.

         Once the player goes through all 26 words, the missed words 
         will begin to repeat.  When the player successfully reads a 
         word, the word is dropped from the missed stack.  If the 
         player misses a word again, it goes back into the stack.  
         However, it will not repeat until all of the other missed 
         words are displayed.

         This process continues.  Since missed words return to the 
         stack, players get the chance to drill on the words they have 
         the most problems reading.  Since words don't repeat until 
         all of the other words have passed, players don't get bored 
         with the same words.

         Once the player reads all 26 words (and fills the screen with 
         26 rewards), he's rewarded with flashing lights, a siren 
         wail, and a cartoon of dancing teddy bears.  The game then 
         begins over again.

         Press a "@" or the Escape key to return to the main Lunchbox 
         menu. 
         




         Shareware


         This Lunchbox is part of a shareware series of educational 
         programs designed for 3 to 7 year olds.  Commercial packages 
         tend to ignore this age group.

         If you've found this program useful, then please consider 
         forwarding a $5.00 payment (or whatever amount you feel is 
         fair) to:

         Joey Robichaux
         P. O. Box 91016-199
         Baton Rouge, La. 70816

         In return, you'll receive notices of other educational 
         packages that are currently available (most for $5.00), plus 
         you'll get on the list for notice of future offerings. 

         In any case, I'd like to hear your comments -- including any 
         ideas you may have for other educational programs you'd like 
         to see.



         



         Appendix -- Required files



         This Lunchbox requires the following files:

         All of these files must exist in the current drive and 
         directory to run "Lunchbox" successfully. 


         NOTE:  You can run the programs BOAT1 through BOAT4 in 
         standalone mode if you wish.  However, you may not distribute 
         these programs without the main Lunchbox menu program.
