## Information about "CHURCH ACCOUNTING SYSTEM"

    Those looking for a single entry general ledger accounting program need
    look no further. CHURCH ACCOUNTING SYSTEM (CAS) provides a
    service needed by many churches or small businesses. In addition to
    the general ledger functions, CAS has banking and budgeting functions.
    These additional sections are not included in most other programs.
    
    Those who do not need invoicing, accounts receivable or payable
    functions and who need a simple-to-use general ledger with ample
    report options will like this program.
    
    Overall, CAS is a worthwhile program, and while churches will benefit
    from its approach, CAS is actually a "general" general ledger
    accounting program and can be used by any business looking for such a

==================================================================
                         GETTING STARTED
=================================================================

Requirements:

To run the system it is recommended that you have a hard disk.
The system can be run on two floppies with limited disk space.
Dos Version 3.0 or higher is also recommended.  Ram Memory should
be 640k or more.

You MUST have a CONFIG.SYS file on your startup disk.  If you
have a hard disk then this file must be in your root directory
i.e. "C:\".  If you are using floppies then this file must be on
your DOS diskette.  The file must contain the following
statements:

          FILES=35
          BUFFERS=30

The system will not run unless these commands are added to your
CONFIG.SYS file.  Once you have added them you must reboot your
system.  This can be accomplished by CTRL-ALT-DEL sequence or
turning off the computer and turning it back on.

If you do not have an existing CONFIG.SYS file on your computer
then copy the one supplied on the program disk to either your
root directory (if using a hard disk) or to your DOS diskette (if
using two floppies).

Examples:

Hard Disk:    Copy A:CONFIG.SYS C:\   (Program Disk in drive A:)
Floppy Disk:  Copy B:CONFIG.SYS A:    (Program Disk in drive B:)

=================================================================
                          SYSTEM SETUP
=================================================================

Once the program is installed and loaded then you are ready to
set it up for use.  Follow the steps below to accomplish this.

EDIT NAME:

1.  Go to "Setup" from the Main Menu
2.  Select "Edit Name"
3.  Fill in all Spaces

     *Note:

     If you have a monochrome monitor that emulates color then   
     you may wish to place an "M" in the Monitor field to specify 
     that the program always comes up in Monochrome Mode. 

4.  If this is a registered version then enter your serial       
    number.

5.  When you have entered the last field then the program will
    save the system parameters.


CREATE HEADING RECORDS

Now we must create heading records to define our accounts.  Go to
the menu item "CREATE HEADINGS".  This is located on the "SETUP"
menu.

See the Appendix for an example of Headings.

Accounts are defined as follows:

'A' = Assets
'B' = Liabilities
'C' = Capital/Equity/Fund balance
'D' = Income
'E' = Expense
The first letter of the account tells the computer what section
the account number belongs in.  The next (2) digits tell the
computer what Sub Group (Headings) the account belongs in.

Examples:      A01 = Checking Accounts       Assets
               A10 = Fixed Assets            Assets
               A21 = Current Assets          Assets

               B10 = Notes Payable           Liability
               B24 = Accounts Payable        Liability

               C22 = Retained Earnings       Capital/Equity/Fund
               C24 = Fund Balance            Capital/Equity/Fund

               ** YOU MUST HAVE A FUND BALANCE ACCOUNT !!!

               D05 = Income From Operations  Income
               D10 = Misc Income             Income

               E10 = Direct Expenses         Expense
               E11 = Salaries                Expense
               E34 = Utilities               Expense

Create all your Headings First.  Print them out before assigning
Account Numbers.  This list will come in handy.

CREATE ACCOUNT NUMBERS

Once the Headings have been created we are now ready to create
the actual account numbers.  Account Numbers must fall under a
predefined Heading.

Go to the section "CREATE ACCOUNT" on the "SETUP" menu.

Now create your Account Numbers for the Headings you have set up
previously.

Examples:      Heading                  Account

          A01 = Checking           A01100 = General Fund
                                   A01200 = Building Fund

          A10 = Fixed Assets       A10010 = Building
                                   A10020 = Land

          C24 = Fund Balance       C24010 = Fund Balance Acct
          ** YOU MUST HAVE A FUND BALANCE ACCOUNT !!!

          D05 = Income From Op.    D05100 = Sales
                                   D05200 = Programs

          E10 = Direct Expenses    E10005 = Advertising
                                   E10100 = Paper
                                   E10200 = Postage

The "Fund Account (Y/N)" tells the computer if this is an account
to which deposits will be made or checks written.  If it is place
a "Y" in this field.  Examples are: General Fund, Building Fund,
Piano Fund, FLower Fund, Youth Fund, Etc.

=================================================================
                  CHECKING ACCOUNTS/FUND BALANCES
=================================================================

This program allows for multiple checking accounts with 999 funds
under each checking account.  A checking account is setup automatically
by the computer when you enter a fund account.  The checking account
code is the first three digits of the account number.

When setting up an Checking account you must reserve the heading for
only those fund accounts under it.

Example:  I will use "A10" sub heading for my General Checking Account.

          A10  General Checking

          All accounts that start with A10 MUST be part of this
          checking account.

          A10100  General Fund
          A10110  Building Fund
          A10120  Youth Fund
          * These three funds make up the General Checking Account

What these means is that I have ONE checking account and I want to keep
up how the money is divided between the funds.  My checking account may
have a balance of $10,000 but is broken down into the following:

       General Fund  = $7,000
       Youth Fund    = $  500
       Building Fund = $2,500

When you make a deposit or record a check you will select the fund involved.
The computer will then keep track of which checking account is goes to.
This is done by looking at the first three digits of the Fund's Account Number.


=================================================================
                          BUDGET MODULE
=================================================================

EDIT SECTION

If you are going to use the budget module then select the
"BUDGET" option from the main.  Go to "EDIT BUDGET ACCOUNTS".
Here you may enter a twelve month budget value for each account.

After you have entered the first dollar amount you can press the
"F5" key to spread the previous value into the rest of the
fields.  The can be done from any month at any time.


PRINT SECTION

This option will allow you to print your budget on the printer. 
You can print a single month or the totals for the year.  When
the date menu appears simply select the month you want and press
enter.


VIEW SECTION

This option will print the budget to a disk file and allow you to
view the file on the screen.  The disk file is called
"ACCOUNT.PRN".  After selecting this option you transport this
file to another software package if you so desire.
=================================================================
                           POST MODULE
=================================================================

This module is used to enter Bank Deposits, Bank Checks, and
Journal Entries.  This is the only place in the program where you
can enter data into the ledger.

*Note:  When entering any type of transaction the date entered
must be in the current period you will receive an error.

You can always look at the bottom of the Main Menu and see the
current period in which you are working.

ENTER CHECKS/DEPOSITS

Use this option to enter checks written from a bank account or
Deposits made to a Bank Account.

When you select this option a list of all your bank accounts will
appear on the screen.  Select the account you are working with
and press enter.

*Note:  If a bank account did not show up then you will need to
go to the Setup Menu, Edit Account section, find the account
number and place a "Y" in the "Bank Account" field.

When the screen appears you will be prompted for Date, Reference
Number (or check number), Amount, Whether it is a Check or a
Deposit, and a Description (Who you wrote the check to) or (Where
the Deposit came from).

After you have entered this information you can enter up to 50
accounts for this check or deposit.  Only one is required.  The
total of all entries is shown in the bottom right corner of
your screen.  This number must be equal to the amount entered at
the top before the computer will accept the check or deposit.

If you need to look up an Account Number press the "F1" key.  A
list of all Account Numbers will appear on the screen.  Select
the one you want and press enter.  The Number will be placed in
the field and the description will appear next to it.

Next enter a short description for this transaction and the
amount of the transaction.  In most cases the Transaction amount
is the same as the check amount.

After you have entered all information you must press the
F10 key to record this transaction.

DO NOT PRESS THE ESCAPE KEY UNLESS YOU WISH TO ABORT THIS CHECK.

JOURNAL ENTRIES

The journal entry program is used to make entries to the ledger
that does not effect a bank account (Check or Deposit).  Many
entries will be posted to a Bank Account but not in the form of a
check or deposit.

This program was written in the form of a single entry ledger. 
HOWEVER, the balance of the entry you are making must equal zero
when you are finished or you will not be able to finalize your
entries.

The program will ask you for several fields of information. 
Date, Account Number, Debit or Credit (D/C), Description, and
Amount.  Enter all this information and press enter.  The balance
of the Journal Entry will be displayed in the lower right corner
of your screen.  

You can stop at any time, exit the journal entry screen, and
return later to complete the entry.  However, if you do this the
Journal Balance in the lower right screen will reset to zero. 
This does not mean that you entry does not balance. When you
print the edit report you will find out if you balance or not.

You can also press the "F1" key to locate an Account Number.

*NOTE:  If you are posting an entry that will effect a Bank
Account the entry will not show up on the Bank Book
Reconciliation.  You will be out of balance that amount unless
the charge was a Bank Charge and is listed on the Bank Statement.

You may consider using the "Post Checks" or "Post Deposits"
option when making entries that effect a Bank Account.


EDIT REPORT

This option is used to print an Edit Report of all entries posted
so far.  This is the report that tells you if the Posting File is
in Balance.  You should print this report periodically while
posting to verify that you are in balance.


FINALIZE

After you have entered your checks, deposits, and journal entries
you should print an edit report.  If the report is in balance you
MUST Finalize.

The Finalize program will take all the entries that have been
posted so far and move them to the permanent ledger.
=================================================================
                         REPORTS MODULE
=================================================================

The Reports Section has several reports and can be run for one
month or the entire year.  Please note that in some cases when
you select Year-To-Date the computer will look at the current
period and print the report from the beginning of the year to the
current period (not December unless the current period is
December).

To print a report simply select the desired report from the menu
and press enter.  You will be prompted with a date screen.  The
menu bar will automatically be positioned on the current period. 
If this is the month you wish just press enter.  If you want
another month then place the menu bar over that month and press
enter.

A message will appear requesting that you start your printer. 
Verify that your printer is ready and press enter.

The reports are:

     -    Income Statement
     -    Balance Sheet
     -    Trial Balance
     -    General Ledger
     -    Account Analysis (One Account)
     -    Account Analysis (Multiple Accounts)
     -    Expense Statement
     -    Check Book Statement (Or Savings)
     -    Current Income Statement versus Budget
     -    Current Income Statement versus Last Month

*Note:  If you feel that other reports need to be added please
write down what you are looking for and mail to me.

=================================================================
                          CLOSE MODULE
=================================================================

This module allows you to change the current period or close the
year.

CURRENT PERIOD

To change the current period simply select this option and enter
the desired month.  The computer will change the period to that
month.  All entries posted will now go into this period.


CLOSE YEAR

The "Close End of Year" does more than change the period.  This
option adds up all the months and places this number into the
beginning balance for the next year.  It also places zeroes in
all the months.  The entire Income/Expense section will be
blanked out to start the next year.

The Computer will ask you for the Fund Balance Account.  Enter the
Account that you created under Capital.  It should have been called
"FUND BALANCE".  This this account is not found you will NOT be able
to close the year until it is created under the Setup Accounts Option.


ERRORS:

If you have not Finalized the entries made on the "Posting" menu
then you cannot close the Year.

SHAREWARE
=============================================================

This program is "shareware".  Shareware is a marketing method
by which a user can "test drive" the program before paying
for it.  The normal "test drive" period is two weeks to a month.
After that period, continued use requires registration.  Continued
use without registration is not only dishonest, but against
the laws of God.  If you plan to use the program, do the honorable
thing and pay for it.

Included with registration is the right to use the program,
the latest version of the program, and 30 days of free
telephone installation support.

Fees paid for a copy of this program do not constitute registration.
This means that when you pay a shareware distributor $3-4 for a copy,
you have not paid for continued use of the program.  It means you
have paid for an evaluation copy.

Those looking for a single entry general ledger accounting program need 
look no further.  CHURCH ACCOUNTING SYSTEM (CAS) provides a service     
needed by many churches or small businesses.  In addition to the general
ledger functions, CAS has banking and budgeting functions.  These       
additional sections are not included by most other programs.            
                                                                        
Those who do not need invoicing, accounts receivable or payable         
functions and who need a simple-to-use general ledger with ample report 
options may like this program.                                          
                                                                        
Overall, CAS is a worthwhile program, and while churches will benefit   
from its approach, CAS is really a "general" general ledger accounting  
program and can be used by any business looking for such a program.
