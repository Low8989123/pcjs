## Information about "CALL MASTER (ALSO 1622)"

    CALL MASTER is a simple-to-use service call management system with a
    full accounts receivable subsystem, specifically designed for pest
    control, lawn care, air conditioning, and other service businesses.
    CALL MASTER is completely menu driven. CALL MASTER is extremely
    flexible. You define the service provided, the number of calls
    required by each service contract, and the frequency between each
    service call. Once defined, each service can be tracked in a wide
    variety of ways. Services are automatically rescheduled upon posting
    of invoices.
    
    The capability of projecting current service contracts into the future
    will be an invaluable aid when planning vacations, or projecting cash
    flow. Each client can be assigned to multiple service locations. Each
    location can have service contracts for every service you provide. Each
    provided service can have its own schedule and rate.
    
    CALL MASTER also performs basic accounting functions. Reports are
    provided of all dollar activity in a format that allows
    you to prepare entries for any type of accounting system you are
    currently using. Standard reports of aged accounts receivable and
    monthly statements are only a few of the reports provided.
    
    In addition to reports, CALL MASTER will print mailing labels,
    envelopes, Rolodex cards, service maintenance records, service call
    schedules, client telephone listings, and statements. CALL MASTER is
    everything you need to set up and run your own service business.
