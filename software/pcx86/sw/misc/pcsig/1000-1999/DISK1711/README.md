TOMMY'S GIN RUMMY (C) COPYRIGHT 1987 BY TOMMY'S TOYS
P. O. BOX 11261, DENVER, CO 80211 USA.  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
CATALOG #87-067-1A

INSTRUCTIONS:

TOMMY'S GIN RUMMY IMPLEMENTS THE GAME INVENTED IN 1909 BY E. T. BAKER OF THE
KNICKERBOCKER WHIST CLUB OF NEW YORK, WITH AUTOMATIC SORTING OF YOUR HAND TO
GIVE THE BEST SCORE.

PLAYERS:
YOU PLAY AGAINST THE COMPUTER.  YOUR HAND IS DISPLAYED AT THE TOP OF THE
SCREEN, THE COMPUTER'S UNDER IT.  AT PROGRAM STARTUP YOU ARE GIVEN THE OPTION
OF PLAYING WITH OPEN HANDS, MEANING THAT YOU CAN SEE THE COMPUTER'S HAND BUT
IT CAN'T SEE YOURS.

CARDS:
THE STANDARD DECK OF 52 IS USED.  CARD RANKING IS A,2,3,...,10,J,Q,K (HIGH).

DEALER:
THE INITIAL DEALER IS CHOSEN BY THE COMPUTER AFTER ROLLING A DIE IN ITS
CIRCUITS.  AFTER THAT, THE WINNER OF EACH ROUND DEALS THE NEXT.

THE DEAL:
EACH PLAYER RECEIVES 10 CARDS, DEALT TO EACH PLAYER ALTERNATELY STARTING WITH
THE NON-DEALER.  THE TOP CARD OF THE DECK IS THEN TURNED UP AND BECOMES THE
UPCARD ON A SEPARATE UPCARD PILE.

THE PLAY:
ON THE FIRST PLAY, NON-DEALER EITHER TAKES THE UPCARD OR REFUSES IT; IF HE
REFUSES, DEALER HAS THE SAME OPTION.  IF DEALER ALSO REFUSES, NON-DEALER MUST
DRAW FROM THE TOP OF THE DECK, GIVING HIM 11 CARDS. (NOTE: IN TOMMY'S GIN
RUMMY, THIS IS SKIPPED AND NON-DEALER HAS THE OPTION OF UPCARD OR DECK.)

ON SUBSEQUENT PLAYS, EACH PLAYER MUST DRAW ONE CARD, EITHER THE UPCARD OR THE
TOP OF THE DECK, AND THEN DISCARD ONE CARD ON THE UPCARD PILE (BECOMING THE
NEW UPCARD).

KNOCKING:
EACH HAND HAS A POINT VALUE THAT ITS PLAYER TRIES TO MINIMIZE.  AFTER
DRAWING AND DISCARDING, IF THE POINT VALUE IS 10 OR LESS, A PLAYER MAY
"KNOCK", ENDING THE ROUND.

DEAD HANDS:
IF THE 50TH CARD IS DRAWN FROM THE DECK AND, AFTER THE DISCARD, NEITHER
PLAYER HAS KNOCKED, THE HAND IS DEAD AND A NEW ONE IS STARTED.

MATCHED SET:
THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO FORM YOUR HAND INTO "MATCHED SETS":

     1. 3 OR 4 CARDS OF THE SAME RANK ("FLAT")
     2. 3 OR MORE CARDS OF THE SAME SUIT IN SEQUENCE ("STRAIGHT")

CARDS THAT DO NOT FORM PART OF ANY MATCHED SET ARE CALLED UNMATCHED CARDS
(OR DEADWOOD) AND ARE PENALIZED WITH A POINT VALUE (PV).

HAND POINT VALUE (PV):
THE POINT VALUE (PV) OF A HAND DEPENDS ON THE UNMATCHED CARDS ONLY.
IN THIS COUNT, EACH FACE CARD COUNTS AS 10 POINTS, AN ACE COUNTS AS 1 POINT,
AND EACH OTHER CARD COUNTS AS ITS FACE VALUE.

GIN:
TO KNOCK, YOUR PV (AFTER DISCARDING) MUST BE 10 OR LESS.
IF ALL YOUR CARDS ARE MATCHED, YOU HAVE A PV OF 0 (PERFECT) AND YOU "GO GIN".
(YOU SHOULD ALWAYS KNOCK IF YOU GO GIN!)

AUTOMATIC SORTING:
THE COMPUTER AUTOMATICALLY REARRANGES YOUR HAND FOR YOU TO PRODUCE THE HAND
WITH LOWEST PV.  THIS TAKES ALL OF THE DRUDGERY OUT OF THE GAME AND WHO WOULD
EVER WANT TO HAVE TO GO BACK TO SORTING ONE'S OWN HAND EVER AGAIN?  OF COURSE
THIS DOESN'T PREVENT YOU FROM DISCARDING ANY CARD YOU WANT.

NOTE:
AS THIS ALGORITHM'S SPEED DEPENDS EXPONENTIALLY ON THE NUMBER OF "INTERSECT"
CARDS (E.G., 2-CLUBS, 3-CLUBS, 4-CLUBS, 3-HEARTS, 3-DIAMONDS HAS ONE
INTERSECT, 3-CLUBS), THERE ARE A FEW PATHOLOGICAL HANDS THAT TAKE A WHILE
TO OPTIMIZE:  TOMMY SUGGESTS YOU USE THE TIME TO STRAIGHTEN YOUR DESK.

LAYING OFF:
THE PLAYER WHO KNOCKS SHOWS HIS HAND WITH THE MATCHED SETS SEGREGATED.  IF
HE DIDN'T HAVE GIN, THE OTHER PLAYER THEN GETS TO "LAY OFF" ANY OF HIS
UNMATCHED CARDS THAT FIT INTO THE OPPONENT'S MATCHED SETS, THEREBY REDUCING
HIS HAND'S PV.  NOTE THAT YOU CANNOT LAY OFF A STRAIGHT ON AN OPPONENT'S FLAT,
OR VICE VERSA, HENCE IF THE OPPONENT HAS 3 5'S AND YOU HAVE A 4,6 OF THE
RIGHT SUIT, THAT'S TOUGH.

SCORING:
IF THE KNOCKER HAS THE LOWEST PV AFTER THE OPPONENT LAYS OFF HIS UNMATCHED
CARDS, THE KNOCKER WINS THE DIFFERENCE IN THE FINAL PV, BUT IF THE OPPONENT
HAS THE LOWEST PV ("UNDERCUTS THE KNOCKER"), HE WINS THE DIFFERENCE IN PV
PLUS A BONUS OF 25 POINTS.  HOWEVER, IF THE KNOCKER HAS GIN, HE WINS
UNCONDITIONALLY, SCORING THE OPPONENT'S PV PLUS A BONUS OF 25 POINTS.

GAME:
THE FIRST PLAYER TO SCORE 100 GAME POINTS WINS THE GAME.
THE WINNER GETS 100 MORE POINTS, THEN EACH PLAYER GETS 25 MORE POINTS
FOR EACH HAND HE HAS WON (THE SO-CALLED BOX OR LINE BONUS).  THE WINNER
THEN GETS GAME POINTS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE IN TOTAL PV SCORES; BUT IF
THE LOSER HAS WON NO HANDS (0 PV, A SO-CALLED SHUTOUT OR SCHNEIDER), THE
WINNER WINS DOUBLE THE DIFFERENCE IN GAME POINTS AND THE LOSER IS "SKUNKED".

IN TOMMY'S GIN RUMMY, THE CUMULATIVE GAME POINTS ARE SAVED FOR REFERENCE
IN CASE YOU HAVE A STEAK DINNER RIDING ON THE SESSION.

STRATEGY:
MOST HANDS ARE WON WITH 6 OR 7 MATCHED CARDS.  YOU MUST THEREFORE ALWAYS
STRIVE TO KEEP 2 OR 3 LOW CARDS (ACES, DEUCES, TREYS) IN YOUR HAND AT ALL
TIMES, TO KEEP YOUR PV LOW AND MINIMIZE THE RISK SHOULD THE OPPONENT KNOCK.
IT IS ALSO UNWISE TO KEEP HIGH PAIRS AND TWO-CARD SEQUENCES AFTER THE FIRST
FEW ROUNDS.  AS FOR KNOCKING, MOST PLAYERS KNOCK IMMEDIATELY IF THEIR PV
GOES TO 10 OR LESS ANYTIME IN THE FIRST 4 OR 5 TURNS; AFTER THAT, ESPECIALLY
AFTER THE 8TH TURN, YOU PROBABLY SHOULD NOT KNOCK UNLESS YOUR COUNT IS LESS
THAN 6.  OF COURSE, IF YOU SEE THE OPPONENT DRAWING MORE THAN ONCE FROM THE
UPCARD PILE, YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO KNOCK AT ALL, FEARING HE IS TRYING TO
TRICK YOU INTO AN UNDERCUT.  ON THE OTHER HAND, BLINDLY WAITING FOR A DEAD
HAND, OR WAITING TO GO GIN, MAY GIVE THE OTHER PLAYER TIME TO GO GIN AND GIVE
HIM A 50+ POINT JUMP ON YOU.

NOTE THAT THIS GAME GIVES BOTH PLAYERS WIDE OPPORTUNITY FOR SKILL BY
OBSERVING ALL THAT IS GOING ON AND MAKING USE OF IT.  GOOD PLAYERS DEVELOP
A "FEEL FOR THE CARDS" AND INSTINCTIVELY KNOW WHICH CARDS ARE BEING SOUGHT
BY THE OPPONENT.

OKLAHOMA GIN:
IN OKLAHOMA GIN, ALSO KNOWN AS CEDARHURST, THE RANK OF THE FIRST UPCARD
DETERMINES THE MINIMUM POINTS NEEDED TO KNOCK: FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE UPCARD IS
A 3, THEN 3 OR LESS POINTS ARE NEEDED TO KNOCK, IF THE UPCARD IS A FACE CARD,
THEN 10 POINTS OR LESS ARE NEEDED TO KNOCK.  HOWEVER, IF THE UPCARD IS AN ACE,
THEN GIN IS NEEDED.

IN ADDITION, IF THE UPCARD IS A SPADE THEN ALL SCORES FROM THE HAND ARE
DOUBLED.

TOMMY'S SPACE COWBOY GIN:
THIS IS PLAYED LIKE OKLAHOMA, EXCEPT THE RANK OF THE >>>CURRENT<<< UPCARD
DETERMINES THE POINTS NEEDED TO KNOCK.

FUNCTION KEY COMMANDS:
SOUND EFFECTS TOGGLE: FUNCTION KEY F1 TOGGLES THE SOUND EFFECTS ON AND OFF.

DEMO MODE TOGGLE: FUNCTION KEY F2 TOGGLES THE DEMO MODE.  IN DEMO MODE, THE
COMPUTER PLAYS BOTH HANDS.

TO QUIT: HIT FUNCTION KEY F7.

TO DISPLAY THESE INSTRUCTIONS: HIT FUNCTION KEY F5.

TO CHANGE THE SCREEN BORDER COLOR (COLOR MONITORS ONLY): HIT FUNCTION KEY F10.

COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS:
    S    START UP WITH SOUND OFF
    M    FORCE MONO MODE
    C    FORCE COLOR MODE

INSTRUCTIONS:
THIS PROGRAM TURNS YOUR IBM PC OR COMPATIBLE INTO A PERSONAL CROSSWORD PUZZLE
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, ALLOWING YOU TO CREATE AND SOLVE COMPUTERIZED CROSSWORD
PUZZLES IN BEAUTIFUL COLOR: NOW EVEN A PESSIMIST CAN SOLVE A CROSSWORD PUZZLE
WITH A 'FOUNTAIN PEN'.

THIS PROGRAM IS REALLY GREAT FOR SOLVING PUZZLES FROM THE PAPERS: JUST TYPE
THEM IN AT HOME ON YOUR IBM PC, THEN BRING A DISKETTE TO WORK FOR FUN DURING
WORK BREAKS; OR MAKE UP CROSSWORD PUZZLES AND GIVE THEM TO YOUR FRIENDS TO
SOLVE ... WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS AN UNLIMITED FUN MACHINE!

PUZZLE SIZE:
MAXIMUM PUZZLE SIZE IS 17 ROWS BY 18 COLUMNS, MINIMUM IS 2 ROWS BY 2 COLUMNS.

PUZZLE FILES:
EACH PUZZLE IS GIVEN A UNIQUE NUMBER FROM 0 TO 99, AND A 35-CHARACTER TITLE.
SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO START EACH TITLE OUT WITH 1 OR MORE ASTERISKS (*) TO
INDICATE THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL.

PUZZLE FILES HAVE NAMES OF THE FORM "X00IJ.PUZ", WHERE IJ IS THE PUZZLE
NUMBER (00 TO 99), AND THE INITIAL LETTER MAY BE NOT ONLY X BUT ANY LETTER
FROM A TO Z, INDICATING 26 SEPARATE PUZZLE SERIES OF UP TO 100 PUZZLES EACH.
(THE REASON ONLY 100 PUZZLES ARE ALLOWED FOR EACH SERIES IS SO THE PUZZLE
DIRECTORY LISTING WON'T TAKE FOREVER.)

WORK FILES:
WHEN TRYING TO SOLVE A PUZZLE, FOR EXAMPLE, X0012.PUZ, A PERSON MIGHT WANT
TO LEAVE THE PROGRAM AND SAVE HIS WORK FOR LATER.  THIS IS AUTOMATICALLY
DONE BY THE PROGRAM ON A FILE WITH THE EXTENSION .WRK, IN THIS CASE ON
FILE X0012.WRK.

TO USE TOMMY'S CROSSWORDS:
YOU ARE PROMPTED AS TO WHETHER YOU WANT TO CREATE A NEW PUZZLE, OR TRY TO
SOLVE ONE FROM DISK.  IF THE LATTER, THE PUZZLE TITLES AND NUMBERS FOR THE
DESIRED SERIES (A TO Z) ARE DISPLAYED SO YOU CAN SELECT ONE (NOTE: USE THE
UP AND DOWN ARROW KEYS ON THE NUMERIC KEY PAD TO PAGE THE DISPLAY IF
NECESSARY).  IF YOU HAVE WORKED ON THIS PUZZLE BEFORE, THE WORK FILE IS USED
AUTOMATICALLY TO RESTORE YOUR WORK.

TO QUIT THE PUZZLE:

   >> AND EXIT THE PROGRAM, HIT FUNCTION KEY F7.
   >> AND CHOOSE ANOTHER, HOLD DOWN THE CTRL KEY AND HIT THE Q KEY (CTRL-Q).

ANYTIME YOU QUIT THE PUZZLE OR THE PROGRAM, YOUR WORK IS AUTOMATICALLY SAVED.

--------------------
1. SOLUTION MODE

TO SOLVE A PUZZLE:
MOVE THE CURSOR VIA THE 4 ARROW KEYS ON THE NUMERIC KEY PAD, THEN TYPE LETTERS
IN AT THE CURSOR.

SOLUTION CHECK:
THE PROGRAM AUTOMATICALLY CHECKS TO SEE WHEN YOU HAVE SOLVED THE PUZZLE.
*NOTE* WHEN YOU HAVE SOLVED THE PUZZLE, BE SURE AND DELETE THE ".WRK" FILE
BEFORE LETTING SOMEBODY ELSE TRY IT.

CHEAT MODE (F3, F4):
PRESS F3 TO GET THE CURRENT LETTER (POINTED TO BY THE CURSOR) INTO THE PUZZLE.
PRESS F4 TO GET THE ENTIRE PHRASE.

SENSE CONTROL (<ENTER>):
THE <ENTER> KEY CONTROLS THE CURRENT SENSE: ACROSS OR DOWN.  THIS IS USED ONLY
WHEN PRESSING F4, OR ENTERING CLUES (SEE BELOW).

SCORE:
WHEN YOU START TO SOLVE A PUZZLE YOUR SCORE IS INITIALIZED TO 10,000 POINTS.
FOR EACH LETTER YOU GET VIA CHEAT MODE, ONE POINT IS DEDUCTED FROM THE SCORE.

PLAYING AGAINST THE CLOCK:
THE ELAPSED TIME IN SECONDS SINCE YOU BEGAN SOLVING THE PUZZLE IS DISPLAYED IN
THE LOWER RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE SCREEN.

------------------------
2. CREATION MODE

TO ENTER THE PUZZLE:
JUST POSITION THE CURSOR VIA THE 4 ARROW KEYS ON THE NUMERIC KEY PAD, THEN
TYPE A LETTER.  ALL BLANK SQUARES ARE BLOCKED OUT BY THE PROGRAM AFTER
ENTERING CLUE MODE, BUT YOU CAN USE THE ESC KEY TO BLOCK THEM OUT YOURSELF IF
YOU WANT.
*WARNING: NO ONE-CHARACTER PHRASES WILL BE GIVEN CLUE ENTRIES.

ENTERING CLUES (CTRL-C):
AFTER YOU HAVE ENTERED ALL THE PHRASES YOU WANT IN THE PUZZLE, HOLD DOWN THE
CTRL KEY AND PRESS THE C KEY.  THE PUZZLE WILL THEN BE NUMBERED AND YOU WILL
ENTER CLUE MODE.  NOW JUST MOVE THE CURSOR TO ANY PHRASE IN THE PUZZLE, WAIT
FOR THE ROTATING CLUE DISPLAYS TO COME TO A STOP, THEN EDIT THE CLUE (USE THE
<ENTER> KEY TO CHANGE BETWEEN ACROSS AND DOWN CLUES).

EDITING A NUMBERED PUZZLE (CTRL-E):
HOLD DOWN THE CTRL KEY AND PRESS THE E KEY.  YOU CAN THEN CORRECT SPELLING
ERRORS IN THE PUZZLE.  BUT YOU CANNOT USE THE SPACE KEY OR ESC KEY WITHOUT
CAUSING THE PUZZLE NUMBERING TO CHANGE, WHICH WILL CAUSE THE PROGRAM TO THROW
AWAY ALL THE CLUES: THEREFORE YOU ARE PROMPTED WHEN YOU TRY TO DO THIS.  TO GO
BACK TO ENTERING CLUES, HIT CTRL-C AGAIN.

EDITING THE PUZZLE TITLE (CTRL-T):
YOU CAN EDIT THE PUZZLE TITLE BY HOLDING DOWN THE CTRL KEY AND PRESSING THE
T KEY.  AFTER YOU HAVE FINISHED, HIT CTRL-T AGAIN, OR THE <ENTER> KEY.

COMPLETE VS. INCOMPLETE PUZZLE FILES:
WHEN YOU TRY TO SAVE THE PUZZLE YOU CREATED, YOU ARE ASKED IF THE PUZZLE IS
COMPLETE OR INCOMPLETE.  IF YOU SPECIFY COMPLETE, YOU ARE ASKED FOR A PASSWORD
(A NUMBER FROM 1 TO 32767): FROM THAT POINT ON, YOU CANNOT EDIT THE SOLUTION
FILE WITHOUT THE PASSWORD, TO PREVENT THE PUZZLE SOLVER FROM GETTING AT THE
SOLUTION.

ENCRYPTION OPTION:
NORMALLY YOU WOULD WANT YOUR SOLUTION FILE ENCRYPTED SO THE SOLVER CANNOT
CHEAT, HOWEVER, YOU ARE GIVEN THE OPTION TO LEAVE IT UNENCRYPTED.

TO USE THIS PROGRAM TO SOLVE CROSSWORD PUZZLES FROM NEWSPAPERS:
BLOCK OUT THE SHAPE OF THE PUZZLE USING X'S FOR PHRASES; THEN ENTER CLUE MODE
AND ENTER THE CLUES; FINALLY ENTER EDIT MODE AGAIN TO WORK ON THE PHRASES
UNTIL YOU GET THE PUZZLE SOLVED.

TO PUT COPYRIGHT INFORMATION IN YOUR ORIGINAL PUZZLE:
AFTER YOU SAVE THE COMPLETE PUZZLE FILE, GO BACK INTO IT WITH A TEXT EDITOR
(A POP-UP NOTE FILE EDITOR WORKS GREAT) AND ADD, AFTER THE PUZZLE TITLE LINE
(LINE 4), AN OPTIONAL COPYRIGHT LINE, STARTING WITH A LEFT PAREN "(" IN
COLUMN 1.  FOR EXAMPLE:

        (C) COPYRIGHT 1988 BY BETTY LOU

YOU CAN ALSO ADD AS MANY LINES AS YOU WANT AT THE END OF THE PUZZLE; THE
PROGRAM IGNORES THEM.
