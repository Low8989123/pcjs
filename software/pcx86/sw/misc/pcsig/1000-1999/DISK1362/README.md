## Information about "THE PASSING PASSAGES AND GS-TESTIT"

    Trying for your wings? GS-TESTIT will give you practice to pass the
    Private Pilots' written examination administered by the FAA.
    
    Using actual FAA questions, this quiz program lets you select from
    several subject categories, including: the physical aircraft,
    navigation, airports and air traffic control, FAA regulations, the
    weather, and the environmental effects of aircraft. GS-TESTIT then
    selects 40 multiple choice questions to quiz you on, tells you instantly
    which questions you may have answered incorrectly, lets you review the
    question and try again.
    
    Included, also, is PASSING PASSAGES, an educational game where you are
    lost in a maze and confronted by FAA examiners who ask you test
    questions which you must answer correctly in order to move on! To
    survive, you must also find cash, food, and places to sleep. The right
    side of the screen shows a graphic representation of the hallways and
    doors, while the left side of the screen shows a map which is made as
    you explore the maze. May also be played without the questions.

               THE PASSING PASSAGES     &     GS-TESTIT

     This is the newest update for disks #1362 and #1363.  The programs
have been improved in many ways, particularly in speed, plus the fact the
questions have been updated to the newest FAA release (as of 3/1/1990).

     Unfortunately, in improving these fantastic programs, they no longer
fit on two 5 1/4" diskettes since a total of approximately 800k is required.
For your convenience (and mine) I have put these programs into a 
self-extracting EXE file of approximately 200k.  To extract this wonderful
software, simply type  FLYING  and press the Enter key.  Be sure that you
have at least 800k of free disk space available for the extraction.

     For those users who do not have 800k to use (ie: floppy disk users),
when you register your copy for the required fee of $30, write me a note
stating what size, type and quantity of disk drives you have, and I will
modify the program to fit your individual system.  NOTE: these glorious
programs will not work if you have only one disk drive and that disk drive
is a 360k 5 1/4" disk disk drive.  It can be made to work on a 2 drive system
or a 1 drive system if that drive will handle at least 720k.

     Obviously, to maximize your use of these heaven inspired programs, a
hard disk drive is recommended.  Also one of the programs require a CGA card
or greater.

     To register your program (please), send $30 to:

                             Tucson, AZ  85703

     Please pass copies of this program to your local flight instructor,
flight school and FBO.

     Thanks;

PS: With these programs, I passed the written exam on the first attempt.
