## Information about "BANK STATEMENT TAMER"

    BANK STATEMENT TAMER provides a menu-driven, headache-free way to
    balance your checkbook against your bank statement. Step-by-step, you
    are led through the mechanics of how to arrive at the same ending
    balance as your bank--and thereby avoid overdrawn accounts or happily
    discover that the bank actually goofed! It does happen!
    
    The program helps you verify balances from the previous month, find
    checks still out, and mark off paid checks, deposits and other
    credits/debits. As you enter these values into the program, a running
    balance is calculated and displayed, showing any difference between your
    register balance and the adjusted bank statement balance. Included,
    also, is a feature that can help save you hours cleaning up your
    checkbook register. It searches through your checkbook entries and
    locates where you made any arithmetic error(s).
