## Information about "CAPBUF"

    CAPBUF is a memory resident program that lets you capture any text
    screen and save it for later processing or printing.  It is quite useful
    for programs that do not otherwise provide means of printing their
    results.  Use it for intermediate results of games, or collecting copies
    of messages while on a bulletin board.  Remember that many elaborate
    program screens are line graphics.  They too can be captured then
    brought into an ASCII editor.  CAPBUF can be removed from memory once
    you are finished capturing screens.  A second program, Filter, can be
    used to eliminate extra lines or line drawing characters (especially
    useful if your printer does not support these characters).

## CAPBUF.DOC

```
CAPBUF is a memory resident (TSR) program that lets you capture any text 
screen and save it for later processing or printing.  It is quite useful for 
programs that do not otherwise provide means of printing their results.  Use 
it for intermediate results of games, or collecting copies of messages while 
on a bulletin board.  
 
To install the program, type:
 
      >CAPBUF
 
A file will be created in the root of your current directory.  It's named 
"captured.buf".  You can then run any programs you wish.  When you find a 
screen that you want to save, press Alt-J, and that screen will be appended 
to your collection.  When finished, you can print it out, or use any 
wordprocessor to edit it.  Note that if you enter the command

      >TYPE \CAPTURED.BUF

it may appear that there are extra lines.  These will not appear on 
printing, though.   When you are finished with a session, be sure to rename 
the 'captured.buf' file, since the next time the program starts, it will 
erase any previous file it finds.

To remove CAPBUF, just enter the program name again.  You will then be asked 
if you want to remove it.  Any captured material will still be available.
                                 
CAPBUF is a shareware program.  If you find it useful please send a 
contribution of $15 to:
