## Information about "EKG -- TRACING & PUMP FOR NURSES"

    EKG FOR NURSES provides review and practice tests for studying the
    electrical system of the heart and interpreting tracings made by an
    electrocardiograph.  This program also correlates EKG waves with the
    anatomy of the heart and shows the proper placement of EKG electrodes on
    the body.
    
    TRACING tests medical students on their knowledge of heart functions by
    displaying an EKG tracing and asking for the cardiac rhythm to be
    identified.  Each answer then shows the correct cardiac rhythm with a
    short description.
    
    PUMP tests nurses on the math of administering proper dosages of
    medications in I.V. fluids.

Program Title:  EKG - TRACING - PUMP FOR NURSES
PC-SIG version 1

EKG FOR NURSES provides review and practice tests for studying the
electrical system of the heart and interpreting tracings made by an
electrocardiograph.  This program also correlates EKG waves with the
anatomy of the heart and shows the proper placement of EKG electrodes on
the body.

TRACING tests medical students on their knowlege of heart functions by
displaying an EKG tracing and asking for the cardiac rhythm to be
identified.  Each answer then shows the correct cardiac rhythm with a
short description.

PUMP tests nurses on the math of administering proper dosages of
medications in I.V. fluids.

Synopsis: Teaches nurses and medical students about heart functions and
how to interpret basic EKG tracings.

Usage:  Education/ Medicine/ EKG Training.

Special Requirements:  CGA card.

     This disk contains a review of the chambers of the heart and
the large blood vessels entering and leaving the heart.
     The electrical system of the heart is review then the waves
made by EKG tracings are labeled.
     Another section shows the placement of the EKG electrodes and
another a discription of the paper used for tracings.
     The last menu lists 13 Tracings with their interpertations.
