## Information about "HOME INVENTORY RECORD KEEPER"

    You may never figure out where all that stuff in your house came from,
    but as long as you have it, you might as well keep track of it.  The
    HOME INVENTORY RECORD KEEPER lets you do just that, room by room.
    
    It's not dramatic, but it is a handy way of keeping track of everything
    you have in your house.  You can, of course, give a location for
    everything, and indicate the actual or estimated value of each item.
    This will be essential should you ever suffer a loss by theft or fire.
    You can also print a list of your possessions and tuck it away for safe
    keeping.
    
    There is no manual on the disk, because you won't need one -- that's how
    easy this program is to use.  If you need help at any time, just press
    the F1 key and you'll see a context-sensitive help screen.
