o OVERVIEW:
The Text File Reader (ReadIt) allows users to read and print  on-
line documents, at their own pace, with a short  learning  curve.
All commands are displayed on a horizontal menu bar. An intuitive
interface provides a straight forward method to scroll, page  and
print documents.  Users without word processing experience can be
brought "up to speed" in minutes.  ReadIt  provides  a  means  to 
distribute on-line manuals, instructions,  procedures  and  other 
documents, royalty free, to users with a wide range  of  computer
experience.

o HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
An IBM PC/XT/AT/PS/2 or compatible with a minimum of 256K RAM and 
DOS 2.1 or later are required.  While not required, a printer  is
recommended. 

o GENERAL:
ReadIt is supplied on one 3 1/2 or 5 1/4 inch disk.  Before using
the disk, make a backup copy and  read  these  instructions.  The
instructions assume that you are familiar with your microcomputer
and have some knowledge of the Disk Operating System (DOS).

This User's Guide can be printed with ReadIt's  <Alt P>  command.
It contains six pages and may be used  as  an  outline  for  your
document.  As a registered ReadIt  user,  you  are  eligible  for
one year of free technical support.  If difficulties arise,  call
our support staff at  (213)532-6212.  These  instructions  assume
that drive A or C is used.  If a different drive  is  used,  sub-
stitute the correct drive designator. 

o INSTALLATION PROCEDURE:
Installation is not required for floppy drive systems.  If a hard
drive is used, allow at least 200 kilobytes of free  disk  space.
When creating a directory you must supply a name. READIT or other
valid directory name may be used.  If a directory name other than
READIT is used, substitute the correct directory name. To install
ReadIt onto a directory named READIT proceed as shown:

1. From the root directory C> prompt type: MD\READIT <ENTER>.
2. From the C> prompt type: CD\READIT <ENTER>.
3. Place the ReadIt disk in drive A.
4. From the C> prompt type: COPY A:*.* <ENTER>. 


                              - 2 -

o START-UP PROCEDURE:
ReadIt can read files from any drive or directory.  When starting
ReadIt, the filename and extension (to be read) is  passed  as  a 
command line argument as shown in the following examples:

               READIT C:\MYPATH\MYFILE.EXT <ENTER>
               READIT B:MYFILE.EXE <ENTER>
               READIT MYFILE.EXT <ENTER>

When READIT <ENTER> is typed, the on-line ReadIt User's Guide  is 
displayed. You may substitute your document for the ReadIt User's
Guide.  When your document is used, in lieu of the User's  Guide,
it must be renamed READIT.DOC.

Floppy Drive Start-Up Procedure:
1. After the computer is booted place the ReadIt disk in drive A. 
2. At the DOS A> prompt type a start-up command as  shown  above.
   As a minimum, READIT followed by a filename and extension must
   be typed.  If the filename  and  extension  are  omitted,  the
   default text file will appear.

Hard Drive Start-Up Procedure:
1. After the computer is booted type:  CD\READIT  <ENTER>.  If  a
   directory name other than READIT is used, substitute the  cor-
   rect name.
2. At the DOS C> prompt type a start-up command as  shown  above.
   As a minimum, READIT followed by a filename and extension must
   be typed.  If the filename  and  extension  are  omitted,  the
   default text file will appear.
                           
o TEST DRIVE:
It only takes a few minutes to become familiar with the operation
of ReadIt. Before you begin, check that the ten key pad is not in
the numeric mode (NumLock Off).  Perform several  trial  runs  as
shown below:

A. Use the appropriate start-up procedure to display  the  ReadIt
   User's Guide.  Type: READIT <ENTER>.
B. If all has gone well, text and  a  horizontal  menu  bar  will
   appear.  Review the menu selections at the base of the screen.
C. Press the PgDn key to display the next screen page.  To return 
   to the previous screen page, press PgUp. 


                              - 3 -

D. To scroll down one line, press the DOWN arrow key.  To  scroll
   up one line, press the UP arrow key.
E. To display the end of the document, press E.
F. To return to the beginning of the document, press B.
G. To display the middle of a document, press  M.  Note  that  an
   arrowhead will appear in the left margin to mark the mid-point
   of the document.
H. If you have a color  monitor, the  foreground  and  background
   colors can be changed by pressing F1 and F2. Press the F1 key.
   Continue pressing F1 until you step through all the foreground
   colors.  Press the F2 key. Continue pressing F2 until you step
   through all the background colors.  Note that the first screen
   is displayed after any color change. 
I. Before printing the text, check that the  printer  is  on-line
   and has an adequate supply of paper. When the printer is ready
   press Alt and P simultaneously.  If it is necessary  to  abort
   the print sequence, press ESC.
J. When through, press ESC to return to DOS.

o TEXT PREPARATION OVERVIEW:
Using ReadIt with your text file requires that text  be  prepared
as shown:
1. Prepare and proof your document.  Do not space text  with  the
   TAB key.  Each line of text must be terminated by  a  carriage
   return.  The new page character must be on a line by itself at 
   the beginning of each page and after the last page.
2. Save the manuscript as an ASCII (unformatted) text  file.  Any
   valid filename and extension may be used, if  your  text  file
   will not replace the ReadIt User's Guide.  If your file is  to
   replace the ReadIt User's Guide, rename your file  READIT.DOC.
   READIT.DOC must reside on the same  disk  or  directory  which
   contains ReadIt's files.
3. Use ReadIt to check and print your text.

o TEXT PREPARATION:
On-line documents should  be  constructed  for  ease  of  viewing
rather than conforming to a rigid format.  If possible, the table 
of contents should be presented as the first screen. Page numbers
are easily found if they are centered at the bottom of each page. 
If the document is short and has  a  well  constructed  table  of
contents, an index is usually not required.  When preparing text,
keep in mind that each screen page displays 23 lines of text. 


                              - 4 -        

Text should be prepared with a word processor. Do not use the TAB
key.  Each line of text can have up to  65  characters  and  must 
terminate with a carriage return.  Using one inch left and  right
hand margins should produce a line with 65  characters.  If  more
than 65 characters are entered, ReadIt will  truncate  the  line. 
Page length should be set at 46 lines/page.  If page numbers  are
used, they should be placed on the 46th line.  The new page char-
acter should be inserted, on a line by itself, at  the  beginning
of each page and after the last page. Each ReadIt file can accom-
modate approximately 80 screen  pages  (23  lines/screen)  or  40
printed pages (46 lines/page). 

After the text has been prepared, the file must be  saved  as  an
ASCII (unformatted) file. Any valid filename and extension may be
used, if your text file will not replace the ReadIt User's Guide. 
If your file is to replace the ReadIt User's Guide,  it  must  be
named READIT.DOC.  If necessary, rename your file  with  the  DOS
RENAME command.  READIT.DOC must  reside  on  the  same  disk  or
directory which contains READIT.EXE.  To check that each line has
been terminated with a carriage return  and  that  the  new  page
character has been properly inserted,  scan  your  original  text
file with the DOS TYPE command. 

Use ReadIt to proof and print your text.  Compare the ReadIt text
to the original file.  If portions of the text are  missing,  the
line(s) may not have been terminated with a carriage  return.  If
lines appear out of order or are missing, the TAB  key  may  have
inadvertently been used.

o REGISTRATION:
This version of ReadIt is distributed as  user  supported  Share-
ware.  The user is granted a limited license to  use  Readit  for
non-commercial use.  The user may  copy  and  freely  share  this
program with others, subject to the  provisions  of  the  license
