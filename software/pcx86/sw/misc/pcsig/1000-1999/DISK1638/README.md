## Information about "YOURMENU"

    YOURMENU is a menu-driven menu maker -- a quick and easy way to use your
    computer.  Once the menuing system is set up, you no longer need to
    hassle with typing out lengthy subdirectories or worrying about finding
    the correct command to start a program.
    
    With some menuing systems you almost need to learn a programming
    language before you can set up the menu.  Not here.  When you want to
    add a selection to the menu, you are asked for the program title, the
    path to your program, and a one line description of the program
    selection.  That's it. YOURMENU will hold up to ten pages of menu
    selections with twenty selections available on each page -- a total of
    200 selections allowed. This is certainly an easy menuing system to set
    up and use.

	 Hard disk menu and DOS shell
	 Version 1.00

	 This manual and the YOUR MENU software are
	 copyrighted by Steven C. Hudgik.
	 All Rights Reserved.

	 Copyright 1988 - Steven C. Hudgik




	 INTRODUCTION

	 I've tried many hard disk menu systems and have generally 
	 found them to	simplify using a hard disk, but they've also 
	 been difficult to set up.  In some cases you are required to 
	 learn a "programming language" prior to setting up a menu.  
	 YOUR MENU has been designed to avoid that - it is easy to 
	 learn and very simple to use.


	 YOUR MENU is divided into two areas - the menu, which 
	 provides up to 200 selections you can define; and the DOS 
	 shell, which provides access to ten commonly used DOS 
	 functions and utilities.  We'll discuss both of these 
	 areas in detail.


	 INSTALLATION

	 To automatically install YOUR MENU first put the YOUR MENU 
	 disk in the "A" floppy disk drive.  With the DOS A> prompt on 
	 the screen type INSTALL and push ENTER.  As the install 
	 process proceedes you will need to answer several questions 
	 concerning how you wish your system to be set up.

	 The installation will create a new directory called YOURMENU 
	 and copy all of the YOUR MENU files to that directory.  If 
	 you wish, it will modify your AUTOEXEC.BAT file (or create a 
	 new one) to boot YOUR MENU when your computer is turned on.

















	 You will also have the option of creating a new directory, 
	 called DOS, for the DOS utilities YOUR MENU accesses or you 
	 may specify the directory in which these utilities are 
	 located. YOUR MENU needs to use the following files 
	 that are supplied with DOS.

	    DISKCOPY		 SORT
	    FORMAT		 MORE
	    CHKDSK		 FIND

	 YOUR MENU may also be used with a floppy disk system.	For 
	 example, on the computer my kids use (they're 3 and 4 years 
	 old) when they turn on the computer YOUR MENU appears.  They 
	 can select the educational game they want from the menu.  A 
	 total of 12 games are available on two floppy disks (one in 
	 "A" the other in "B").  Thus they can use _their_ computer 
	 without disturbing daddy.  (Yes, the 3 year old can do this 
	 by himself.  He learned by using another program we publish 
	 called Play 'n' Learn).

	 Installing YOUR MENU on a floppy disk is done in the same
	 way as for a hard disk.  Put the floppy you want to have
	 YOUR MENU on in the "A" drive and the original YOUR MENU
	 disk in the "B" drive.  At the B prompt type INSTALL
	 and push ENTER.

	 When asked which disk you want YOUR MENU istalled on push
	 the letter A.







	 USING THE MENU

	 If YOUR MENU is not automatically booted by your AUTOEXEC.BAT 
	 file, go to the directory YOUR MENU is in and type MENU (and 
	 push ENTER) to get started.

	 When YOUR MENU boots up you will see the first screen of menu 
	 selections.  I have entered some examples so you can see how 
	 YOUR MENU works.

	 YOUR MENU can run either in monochrome or color.  To switch 
	 between the two settings push the F1 key.  If you have a 
	 monochrome monitor and it appears there is nothing on your 
	 screen, try pushing F1.  With some monitors when the software 
	 is running in the color mode you may get dark blocks or 
	 nothing on the screen.  Pushing F1 solves this problem.

	 If you wish to get to the DOS prompt, push the ESC key.












	 There are ten pages, each with 20 menu selections.  You can 
	 move from one page to the next using the PgUp and PgDn keys.  
	 To select an option from the menu either push its associated 
	 letter or use the cursor keys to position the scroll bar on 
	 the desired selection and push ENTER.

	 Since I have no way of knowing what software you have you 
	 must enter the information that identifies your software and 
	 tells YOUR MENU which directory it is in.  Push F8 to see the 
	 set up screen where this is done.


	 MENU SELECTION SETUP

	 There are seven lines of information that can be filled in on 
	 the set up screen.  The cursor may be moved up and down, from 
	 one line to the next, using the cursor keys.  Any time the 
	 cursor reaches the end of a line you will hear a beep.  You 
	 can return to the menu at any time by pushing the ESC key.

	 The top line is the menu selection letter.  Push any letter 
	 between A and T.  If a selection has already been entered for 
	 that letter, it will appear on the screen.  If no selection 
	 has been entered, the screen will remain unchanged.  To see 
	 an example push the letter A.

	 The next line is called LINE NAME.  Use this line to enter 
	 the information you want to appear next to the selected 
	 letter on the menu. In the example "WORD PROCESSING" has 
	 been entered.

	 The third line designates the disk drive the selected program 
	 is on.  Usually drives "A" and "B" are for floppy disks and 
	 "C" is a hard disk.  The letter C has been entered in the 
	 example.  You may also have a RAM disk that is designated as 
	 drive "D."  If the program you want to run is on the RAM disk 
	 you can enter D on this line.

	 The next line down is used for the path.  The path tells your 
	 computer which directory it should look in to find the 
	 software you want to run. YOUR MENU will always look in 
	 the root directory first.  If the program you want to run is 
	 not in the root, you need to identify the directory it is in.	
	 If you do not have any directories on your disk (maybe you're 
	 using YOUR MENU on floppies), this line may be left blank.

	 In the example I've provided the word processing program is 
	 in a subdirectory called OFFICE which is located in a 
	 directory called HOUSE.  This is represented as HOUSE/OFFICE.	
	 Notice that a slash is used to separate the subdirectory and 
	 directory.  This could be extended out to three levels as 
	 HOUSE/OFFICE/DESK, which means the DESK subdirectory of the 
	 OFFICE subdirectory in the HOUSE directory.














	 Paths can be thought of in the same way as your house. To 
	 find your computer you may need to go into your house, then 
	 into your home office, and then to your desk.	That's the 
	 path to your computer.  Using those same names it is also a 
	 description of the path your computer follows to get to your 
	 word processing program.

	 The fifth line from the top is where you enter the word that 
	 starts the selected program.  In the example the word 
	 processing program is Word Star.  You normally type WS at the 
	 DOS prompt to start Word Star.  Thus you enter WS on this 
	 line.

	 The Argument line is used for information that is passed to 
	 the program as it is started (not all software has this 
	 capability).  A good example is running a program written in 
	 BASIC.  There are two steps to run a BASIC program - first 
	 you need to load BASIC; then you need to load and run the 
	 program.  These two steps can be accomplished as one, if 
	 both program names are typed at the DOS prompt.  Move 
	 the cursor up to the top and change the letter to "B" to see 
	 an example.

	 In this example we have an invoicing program written in 
	 BASIC. Typing BASICA INVOICE at the DOS prompt would load 
	 BASIC and run the invoicing program.  Notice that BASICA has 
	 been entered as the program name, and INVOICE is entered as 
	 the argument.	This will result in the invoicing program 
	 being run without any intermediate steps.

	 The last line is the Help Line.  Use this line to enter any 
	 additional information about this specific menu selection.

	 Once you have entered everything, push F5 to save it.	The 
	 screen will then return to its original empty condition and 
	 the cursor will on the LETTER line.  You can push ESC to 
	 return to the menu, or push another letter to set up another 
	 menu selection (or edit anyone entered previously).


	 NOTE: If you want to go to the DOS prompt instead of running
	       a program, type the word EXIT on the Program Name
	       line.  Your Menu will bring you to the designated
	       directory and then exit to the DOS prompt.






















	 DOS FUNCTIONS

	 With the menu back on the screen push F3 to use any of ten 
	 DOS functions.  These functions, with their associated F keys 
	 are:

	   F1 - Set Time	     F6 - Check A Disk
	   F2 - Set Date	     F7 - Format A Floppy
	   F3 - List Directories     F8 - Format & Copy System Files
	   F4 - Label Disk	     F9 - Find A File
	   F5 - Copy A Disk	    F10 - List Files In A Directory


	 F1 - SET TIME - Enter the time using the 24 hour clock.

	 F2 - SET DATE - Enter the date as dd/mm/yy.

	 F3 - LIST OF DIRECTORIES - This option will look at the root 
	 on your hard disk and provide an alphabetical list of all the 
	 directories that originate in the root (main) directory.

	 F4 - LABEL DISK - this selection allows you to put a volume 
	 label on any disk. The volume label may be up to 11 
	 characters long.  The volume label is always displayed when 
	 you get a listing of the files on a disk.  Thus the 
	 volume label is a good way to put an identifying label (or 
	 title) on all of your disks.

	 F5 - COPY A DISK - Used to make an exact copy of a floppy 
	 disk.	You will be prompted to put the "source" disk (the 
	 disk to be copied) in the "A" drive and the "target" disk 
	 (the disk to be copied to) in the "B" drive.  If you only 
	 have one floppy disk drive, put the source disk in that drive 
	 to get started and you'll be prompted to change disks when 
	 necessary.

	 F6 - CHECK A DISK - This function will analyze the 
	 directories, files, and the File Allocation Table on the 
	 designated disk and report any problems.  It will also give 
	 you a status report on the RAM memory of your computer.  If 
	 you think you have a problem with a floppy, or your hard 
	 disk, use this function as a first step to check it.

	 F7 - FORMAT - Formats a disk in the "A" floppy disk drive.  
	 The result will be a completely blank, but formatted disk.	
	 (Disks must be formatted before they can be used).  This 
	 function prevents you from accidently reformatting your hard 
	 disk, which would result in your losing everything on your 
	 hard disk.

	 F8 - FORMAT & COPY SYSTEM - Formats a floppy disk in the "A" 
	 drive and puts the DOS operating system on the disk.  This 
	 disk can then be used to boot your computer.  Combined with 
	 an AUTOEXEC.BAT file this disk will boot the computer and run 
	 a program such as YOUR MENU, as described earlier for Play 
	 'n' Learn.











	 F9 - FIND A FILE - Searches your hard disk for any directory 
	 name or filename, or partial filename, you enter.  It 
	 will list the path for all matches that are located.

	 F10 - LIST FILES IN A DIRECTORY - Provides a file listing, in 
	 alphabetical order, of all the files in any directory.  You 
	 will be prompted for the PATH to the directory or 
	 subdirectory you want listed.	You can also use this function 
	 to list the files on a floppy disk by entering the letter 
	 that designates the floppy drive, followed by a colon.  For 
	 example, if you enter A: the files on the floppy disk in the 
	 "A" drive will be listed.


	 To return to the menu push the ESC key.


	 This completes our review of the YOUR MENU functions.	I've 
	 done my best to keep YOUR MENU simple and easy to use, while 
	 providing all of the important functions.  If you are using 
	 YOUR MENU, please become a registered user.  I will be making 
	 improvements and changes based on suggestions from users, and 
	 your registration will insure that you are kept up to date.

	 If you plan on using YOUR MENU on several computers, a site 
	 license is required.  Please contact us for additional 
	 information.
