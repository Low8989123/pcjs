## Information about "PIVOT!"

    AS-EASY-AS users take note!  If you've experienced the frustration of
    trying to print a worksheet that has become too wide -- even with your
    printer set to compressed mode -- you need PIVOT!
    
    This unique printing program from the people who brought you AS-EASY-AS
    allows you great flexibility in printing your finished worksheet.
    Choose the font of your choice, portrait or landscape orientation,
    characters per inch, lines per page, and many other options from the
    simple menu system and then relax as PIVOT! takes charge of putting your
    work on paper.
    
    PIVOT! also comes with a graphics character editor which allows you to
    customize/create a character, or a whole character set, to be used with
    PIVOT!
    
    Ease of use is just the first benefit of using this program -- the real
    payoff comes when you see the finished product.  PIVOT! produces
    high-quality printing on the lowliest of dot-matrix printers and gives
    you a document worthy of the time you spent creating it.
    
    This is a MUST HAVE for all AS-EASY-AS users.
