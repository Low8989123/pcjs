## Information about "THE PROGRADE SYSTEM  2 OF 2 (1778)"

    THE PROGRADE SYSTEM is a full-featured grading program for educators.
    It was designed by an educator and has been rigorously tested by
    "non-computer expert" educators to meet their specific needs.  The
    documentation manuals are complete.  Once you've read the documentation
    and figured out how the system works, you will find that the system's
    power and flexibility is worth the time it takes to learn.
    
    THE PROGRADE SYSTEM will accept letter or numerical grades and lets YOU
    decide the letter grade numerical equivalents.  THE PROGRADE SYSTEM lets
    you enter grades in ANY order -- any assignment for any student at any
    time.  THE PROGRADE SYSTEM calculates weighted grades or unweighted
    grades, points, percents, or letter grades.  And every floppy disk can
    store dozens of class files, each with up to 35 students, 45 assignments
    per student.
    
    PROGRADE computes class averages, comparisons of grades, ranked or
    alphabetical class lists, averages of all tests, homeworks, etc.  It
    will provide individual progress reports with averages for all
    assignment categories.  Your students and their parents can know where
    they stand at all times, and you can, too.

                            THE PROGRADE SYSTEM

              THE FAST, COMPLETE, EASY TO USE GRADING PROGRAM
                               FOR EDUCATORS

             A Message From the Author of THE PROGRADE SYSTEM:


     It is truly a pleasure to get so many fine comments about the
     PROGRADE SYSTEM from users of the programs. When I first
     conceived of the SYSTEM, I wanted to make a program that would be
     FAST and USEFUL to educators. So many grading programs or
     spreadsheets do grades, but they make more work than they save.
     I wanted a grading program that a teacher could use to enter
     grades as quickly as could be done into a traditional gradebook--
     flipping through a stack of papers and quickly recording grades.
     I also wanted to make a program that was as easy as possible to
     learn but sophisticated enough to meet rigorous grading
     requirements and to provide whatever information the teacher
     might need, in as positive a light as possible.

     I am sincerely glad that I have been able to provide this SYSTEM
     to you and am glad that it can save you some effort and make your
     clerical life just a little easier, and your teaching just a
     little more enjoyable.  We will all benefit from this--
     students and teachers alike.

     One thing that I did not foresee when I created the SYSTEM was
     that STUDENTS would like the system, too. It is rewarding to hear
     that many students are actually motivated to work harder when
     they can see their grades so fairly and clearly shown to them,
     and that they actually are pleased to see their grade reports.

     Hopefully teachers will not use these reports as punishments in
     any way.  They can be wonderful, positive instruments.

     We have found that the teachers that issue grade reports to
     students about every week or two see the most positive impacts of
     the PROGRADE SYSTEM because of the strongly reinforcing nature of
     the reports.  The program is not to be considered a mere
     calculator for the end of the term.  Frequently, positively, and
     constructively used, it has been shown to INCREASE STUDENT
     performance.

     Please -- we'd be delighted to hear from you about how you use
     the PROGRADE SYSTEM within your class environment, as there are
     many ways in which it CAN be used.

     Once again, thank YOU for your comments, your ideas, and your
     continued enthusiastic support.


               THANK YOU FOR USING THE PROGRADE SYSTEM!
         THE AUTHOR REQUESTS A $45 FEE FOR USE OF THE PROGRAM.
                PLEASE BE FAIR AND CONSIDER THE AUTHOR.

       If you use the PROGRADE SYSTEM for long, you will notice
       several things. First of all, your students may show an
    improvement in their performance because of the prompt feedback
     that the SYSTEM can provide. Parents may praise you for the
    thorough reports that you can give. And your family and friends
       will rejoice -- no more end of the term "grading" -- it's
            always done and up to date with little effort.

     Please -- the author worked long and hard writing and having this
      program field tested.  He is an educator like yourself, and is
        asking for your help.  Send what you can; it will be truly
                               appreciated.

     Please -- it is a violation of copyright law to use this program
      without registering.  And even more-- it's just not fair to the
      author.  Think about how much benefit YOU get weekly from this
     program!  Registered users who update their program will receive
     professionally packaged software, diskette case, printed manual,
         and most recent program versions automatically sent.  In
         addition, registered users can earn a $10 finder's fee by
       convincing any other user to register also.  Details of this
                    program are sent upon registration.

      PLEASE USE THE ORDER/REGISTRATION FORM IN THE BEGIN PROGRAM TO
             PROPERLY REGISTER OR TO OBTAIN UPDATED VERSIONS.

     The progress report section of the QUICK program on the PROGRADE
     SYSTEM allows you to enter any 14 lines of text that you wish.
     You could use this area to type a general note to parents or to
     students, to make a checklist of some sort, or to print any other
     text.  Many teachers wish to use checklists on this section, as
     it makes issuing periodic progress reports much easier.  Attached
     is a list of comments that you might wish to look through;
     perhaps some of the comments will give you ideas as to comments
     that you yourself could use.

                      I. INTRODUCTION TO THE PROGRADE SYSTEM

        THE PROGRADE SYSTEM was designed by a teacher -- it does what
        teachers want a grading program to do. It is FAST and EASY TO
        USE: a major factor in the design of THE PROGRADE SYSTEM was the
        minimization of the number of keystrokes required to make the
        program work. With THE PROGRADE SYSTEM you will spend no more
        time recording grades than you would spend using a gradebook, and
        averaging your grades at the end of the quarter or year will take
        just SECONDS !

        THE PROGRADE SYSTEM will accept letter or numerical grades and
        lets YOU decide the letter grade numerical equivalents. THE
        PROGRADE SYSTEM lets you enter grades in ANY order -- any
        assignment for any student at any time. It accesses most student
        records with a single keystroke ... that's fast!! THE PROGRADE
        SYSTEM calculates weighted grades or unweighted grades, points,
        percents, or letter grades. And every floppy disk can store
        dozens of class files each with up to 35 students, 45 assignments
        per student.

        THE PROGRADE SYSTEM was designed to PROVIDE INFORMATION and to
        provide it FAST. Students need to know where they stand; once
        quarterly grades or a "scan of the gradebook" is often not
        enough. With THE PROGRADE SYSTEM, you know each student's grade
        average every single time you enter a grade. It's effortless to
        "keep on top" of a student's grades. No more of that extra
        calculating that so often does not get done.

        THE PROGRADE SYSTEM provides summary reports to suit your needs:
        class averages, analyses of any assignments or of class averages,
        comparisons of grades, ranked or alphabetical class lists,
        printed copies of all grades, averages of all tests, homeworks,
        etc. And it will provide individual progress reports with
        averages for all assignment categories. Your students and their
        parents can KNOW where they stand at all times, and you can, too.

        Computers are intended to SAVE time, to make work easier. THE
        PROGRADE SYSTEM is a USER'S PROGRAM. You load THE PROGRADE SYSTEM
        and THE PROGRADE SYSTEM works for you. At times, THE PROGRADE
        SYSTEM will even seem to think for you. This is because THE
        PROGRADE SYSTEM was designed by a professional teacher to meet
        professional teachers' needs.

---
                 II. SETTING DISKS UP TO USE THE PROGRADE SYSTEM

        PREPARATION OF PROGRAM DISK: The PROGRADE SYSTEM disk is ready to
        use. NEVER DELETE, ALTER , OR RENAME ANY FILES ON THE DISK OR YOUR
        PROGRAM MAY MALFUNCTION. DO NOT PLACE A WRITE PROTECT TAB ON THE
        PROGRAM DISK!! Simply follow the commands on the disk label. The
        original program disk must be in Drive A: when the ANY of the
        programs start from the master menu, when you request on screen
        help, or when you view the manual to the screen. It is easiest to
        use the PROGRAM DISK in DRIVE A: and the DATA disk in DRIVE B: (The
        program will also work with a single drive, but there will be some
        disk switching required because of this. Be certain that when you
        are using the MASTER MENU that the PROGRAM DISK is in your drive
        and when saving or getting grades, the DATA DISK is in the drive).

        NOTE: TO AVOID THE REPEATED "INSERT DISK WITH COMMAND.COM"
        MESSAGE YOU NEED TO PLACE YOUR COMMAND.COM FILE ONTO THE PROGRAM
        DISK. THIS IS DONE AS FOLLOWS: Place the DOS DISK in DRIVE A: and
        type
                         COPY COMMAND.COM B: <enter>
        Have the program disk in DRIVE B: or place it in A: when told to
        insert the target diskette. Once the COMMAND.COM file is on the
        PROGRADE disk, you will not longer see this message.

        HARD DISK OR VIRTUAL DISK USERS: Prepare to use the PROGRADE
        SYSTEM as follows. Place the PROGRAM DISK in DRIVE A: and type
                         HARD <enter>
        Then, use the menu to CHOOSE DISK DRIVE C FOR DATA (fastest) or
        DISK DRIVE A (or B if you have one). Then use the menu to save
        the changes. Then use the menu to end. To run the programs, type
                         C: <enter> (if you are not already in drive C)
                         CHDIR \PROGRADE <enter>
                         PRO <enter>

        Hard drive users who do not use drive letter C should follow
        the instructions in the READNOW file found on the program
        disk.

        UTILITY DISK: No preparation is required. The UTILITY disk
        contains the PROGRADE SYSTEM manual. If you print the manual, you
        will be asked to place the UTILITY disk into a specified drive at
        a specific time. To use the sample grade files provided ON the
        UTILITY DISK, use the UTILITY disk AS IF IT WERE YOUR DATA DISK.
        The disk also contains other files. .TXT files are for word
        processor use. .EXE files are programs. ENJOY!

        PREPARATION OF YOUR OWN DATA DISK: Simply format a blank disk for
        use as a data disk. Be sure that whenever you are saving a file
        that this Data Disk is in the Data Drive which you specify in the
        initialization section (see section III). Also, be sure that you
        use the data disk one time with the MAIN PROGRAM before using it
        with QUICK or PROPLUS.

                      III. INITIALIZING THE PROGRADE SYSTEM

        The purpose of the initializing section is to set certain
        variables for THE PROGRADE SYSTEM to use each time it runs. The
        initialization needs to be done only once, but may be redone at
        any time. To initialize the program, simply get to DOS, put the
        program disk in Drive A, and type PRO <enter>. Then choose the
        BEGIN program. The menu that appears will provide you with the
        following choices (see section XX of this manual for details):

                         IV. RUNNING THE PROGRADE SYSTEM

        THE PROGRADE SYSTEM is easy to run. Once you have read section II
        and have initialized the program (see section III), and once you
        are in DOS, simply type PRO <enter> and the SYSTEM MASTER MENU
        will appear. From this, choose the program that you want.
        Alternatively, you can run the programs by typing their
        individual names: PRO for the main program, QUICK for the quick
        printed grade reports or progress reports , PROPLUS for the
        supplementary program, and BEGIN for the program to initialize
        options. The first time you run PROGRADE, you should go through
        each menu option in the BEGIN program (see section III).

                                  ERROR MESSAGES
        If an error message occurs while you run the program, check first
        to see that you have the correct DISK in the computer, that the
        PROGRAM disk has not been altered in any way, that there is NO
        WRITE PROTECT TAB on the program disk, and that if you are getting
        a file, that you are using the filename that is ON THE DISK. If you
        are entering NAMES or ASSIGNMENTS and see the "NAME REJECTED", your
        entry is either too long, or uses non-allowable characters.

                            V. NAMING THE CLASS FILES

        When prompted by THE PROGRADE SYSTEM to enter the classname
        (filename), you may use any DOS acceptable filename (i.e. up to 8
        characters in length; acceptable characters are A-Z, a-z, 0-9,
        ()@#$%&!-_'`^~) DO NOT USE SPACES OR ANY OTHER CHARACTERS NOT
        LISTED HERE. ALSO, DO NOT USE "DEMO" IN YOUR FILE NAME. DO NOT
        USE ANY EXTENSIONS (e.g. .GRD) ON GRADE FILES; THIS WILL CAUSE
        THE BACKUP SYSTEM TO MALFUNCTION. An organized approach to
        filenaming should be used right from the start. For example,
        FRIQ191 could indicate FRENCH I, QUARTER 1, 1991.
---
                            VI. ENTERING STUDENT NAMES

        TO ENTER THE NAME OF A NEW STUDENT: Once you get the program
        running and have chosen a classname (see Sections IV and V) enter
        the names of students at the NAME entry area. Then, simply type
        the desired student name in one character at a time: USE ONLY
        A-Z. Because of PROGRADE'S name recognition feature, other names
        may appear as you type in the first few characters. This is
        normal. Keep typing in the name, check it, and touch enter
        (return) when the name is correctly entered. Before touching
        enter, you may use BACKSPACE once to erase an incorrect entry and
        start all over. After you touch enter, if the program has not
        already stored this name, it will respond with NEW NAME Y/N?
        Typing N will return you to the NAME entry area and the name will
        NOT BE STORED. Typing Y at the Y/N? will cause the program to
        ACCEPT and STORE the NEW NAME. It will then rearrange all names
        (if any) and grades in its memory to make room for the new name.

        TO ENTER AN ENTIRE CLASS LIST: Proceed as above. If the program
        brings you to the ASSIGNMENT.GRADE entry area, touch enter to
        return to the NAME entry area. Although the last name with which
        you worked will still be there, begin typing in the new name and
        proceed as before.

        TO ACCESS THE RECORD OF A PARTICULAR STUDENT: Simply begin to
        type in the student's name! BUT ... as soon as THE PROGRADE
        SYSTEM recognizes the name, it will print to the screen the
        entire name. Usually you will only need to type a single letter
        of the name to achieve complete recognition. If, after typing ONE
        character, the computer recognizes the wrong name, simply type in
        ONE or TWO MORE characters. Don't backspace. As soon as the
        correct name does appear, stop typing in the name and touch
        enter. The average and the grades that appear after you touch
        enter are those of the student whose name remains on the screen.
        You may now enter grades or use the menu selections to access
        other parts of the program.  You may also use the up and down
        arrow keys to move from one name to another.

        NOTE: THE PROGRAM CANNOT HAVE TWO IDENTICALLY NAMED STUDENTS IN
        THE SAME FILE. YOU MUST DETERMINE SOME WAY TO DISTINGUISH THE TWO
        NAMES BEFORE ENTERING THEM. THE PROGRAM REQUIRES UPPERCASE
        LETTERS. NAMES CAN HAVE A LENGTH OF 15 CHARACTERS AND MAY INCLUDE
        SPACES APOSTROPHES, AND PERIODS, BUT NOT COMMAS. IF ON FIRST
        ENTERING A SHORTER NAME LIKE DODD ACCESS TO ANOTHER STUDENT SUCH
        AS DODDMAN OCCURS, THEN SIMPLY TYPE A SPACE AFTER DODD .
---
                           VII. DELETING STUDENT NAMES

        TO DELETE A STUDENT AND ALL GRADES FOR THE STUDENT: First access
        the student's record (see section VI). In the ASSIGNMENT.GRADE
        entry area, type the letter Z <enter>. Once you DELETE a student
        this way, there is NO WAY BACK! The grades for this student will
        no longer be available for ANY reason. Perhaps you should delete
        the student only from averaging calculations (see following
        paragraph).

        TO DELETE A STUDENT FROM AVERAGING FUNCTIONS: Should you wish to
        keep a student's record but not count his or her work toward
        class averages, then proceed as above, but type the letter M
        instead of Z. Then choose option 3 from the Modification Menu.
        (SEE SECTION XI.) You can still access grades, add or change
        grades for this student, but the student's grades will not be
        used in any averaging functions. One reason to do this would be a
        student who leaves the school part way through a course.

                              VIII. ENTERING GRADES

        FIRST TIME YOU ENTER A GRADE FOR AN ASSIGNMENT: After accessing a
        student's record, type the assignment number and the grade for
        the assignment for this student in the ASSIGNMENT.GRADE entry
        area. For example, if the grade for assignment 6 is 88, then type
                                  6.88 <enter>
        The number after the period is the grade for this
        student. Don't forget the period. Do not use decimals in the
        grade itself and do not enter grades less than -398 or that total
        more than 9999. If this is an assignment that has not been
        entered before, then THE PROGRADE SYSTEM will prompt for a
        description of the assignment (example: SOUND TEST), grade
        category (example: T for TEST), and maximum grade value
        (examples: 100 or 25 NOTE: DO NOT USE A VALUE LESS THAN 1.0).

        TO ENTER A GRADE FOR THE SAME ASSIGNMENT AS THE LAST ASSIGNMENT
        ENTERED: Simply enter the grade with NO PERIOD. For example, if
        you had just entered ASSIGNMENT 6 for SMITH, you can now enter
        ASSIGNMENT 6 for JONES without specifying ASSIGNMENT 6. Just type
        in the grade itself. This speeds entry of a class set of grades.
        Should a paper for ASSIGNMENT 5 show up, though, you must use the
        ASSIGNMENT.GRADE format to tell THE PROGRADE SYSTEM to place the
        grade in ASSIGNMENT 5. (example: 5.83) Then use the
        ASSIGNMENT.GRADE format again to return to ASSIGNMENT 6 entries.
        If you continue to enter the grades for one assignment, you do
        not need to specify the ASSIGN. NUMBER.

        TO ENTER A LETTER GRADE (A,A-,C+, ETC.) be certain that you have
        preset the numerical grade equivalents using the initialization
        program. Once this has been done, a letter grade may be entered
        at any location where a number grade can be entered. For example,
        you could enter 5.B- or simply C+ if the assignment is the same
        number as the previously entered assignment. If you enter a
        letter grade, all grades for the assign should be letter grade
        entries.
---
                              IX. CALCULATING GRADES

        THE PROGRADE SYSTEM continuously averages grades. You don't need
        to do anything. To see details on an individual's grades or on
        the entire class' grades, use the reports section at any time.

                      X. RECALCULATING THE VALUE FOR A GRADE

        You can recalculate a grade for any assignment at any time. For
        example, you may enter an assignment with a maximum value of 10
        (8 out of 10, 6 out of 10, etc.). Later, you may recalculate all
        grades for this assignment so that they reflect a maximum of any
        other value, such as 100. (The above grades would then be 80 out
        of 100 and 60 out of 100.) You may later return to the original
        value. You may want to do this to deemphasize or emphasize a
        certain assignment's grades if using an unweighted point system.
        To recalculate grades, access any student's grades, type M for
        MODIFICATION MENU, and choose #9.

                                XI. MODIFICATIONS

        To get to the MODIFICATION MENU, type M in the ASSIGNMENT.GRADE
        entry area. The MODIFICATION section makes it possible to "change
        your mind". Easy modifications include correcting a student's
        name (OPTION 5), or changing any assignment description,
        category, or maximum value (ALL FROM OPTION 4).

        The MODIFICATION MENU also lists several modifications to grade
        status. With these techniques, you can make an assignment "not
        count" for a particular student or for the entire class, for one
        assignment or for all assignments. The NO GRADE status leaves a
        grade recorded, but does not COUNT the grade in ANY averaging.
        This could be used to EXCUSE a student from work or for students
        who were not present for an extended time. It would also be used
        to "DROP" a grade from a student's average, or to "NOT COUNT" a
        certain assignment for all students. The NO GRADE status is
        easily reversible. However, OPTION 6 and OPTION 7 will not alter
        grades for students who have NO GRADE on ALL GRADES already. In
        this situation, use option 8 first. Also, read the menu choices
        carefully; the choices, though similar in appearance, are quite
        different in function. Always check your NO GRADE changes using
        the reports section before issuing averages . A "*" will appear
        in the name of students whose grades do not count, and a "*" will
        appear near any grade that does not count.

        MODIFICATION MENU options 6,7,8 reverse the NO GRADE status,
        returning to grades that do count. Option 11 scales grades. See
        section XV on scaling. Option 12 changes the weighted grades
        status. Option 9 changes the maximum value for a grade (see
        section X.) The Eliminate an Assignment section (option 10) will
        totally remove all grades for a particular assignment for all
        students. Use this section CAUTIOUSLY: THERE IS NO WAY BACK. Use
        it only to DESTROY and to KEEP NO RECORD of a certain assignment.
        DO NOT USE MODIFICATIONS TO CHANGE A GRADE: USE THE MAIN SECTION.

                                   XII. REPORTS

        TO ACCESS THE REPORTS SECTION: Simply type R at the
        ASSIGNMENT.GRADE entry area, followed by enter. The reports menu
        will then appear.

        ALPHABETICAL LIST WITH AVERAGES: This report lists all students
        in the class alphabetically, along with their percent average and
        their total grade.

        RANKED CLASS LIST WITH AVERAGES: This report will list all
        students in rank order, with the student with the highest grade
        listed first. The student's rank in class, percent average, and
        total grade are also listed. This section is excellent for
        quickly spotting all low or high grades in the class.

        LIST ALL GRADES TO PRINTER: This section provides a printed
        "gradebook". It puts all grades for the class out to the printer.
        If you are still suspicious about magnetic grading, then use this
        section as often as you wish.

        INDIVIDUAL GRADE REPORTS: This section produces individual grade
        reports. Separate averages are provided for each grade category
        (TEST, QUIZ, READING, MATH, LANGUAGE, ETC.) The specific
        categories to be analyzed are determined once by you in the
        initializing program (see section III). Use this section to
        provide reports directly to students or parents or simply to keep
        yourself more informed. It is quite easy using this section to
        find "test- phobics" or "homework-phobics" and then to work to
        remedy the situation. To terminate the grade reports at any time,
        touch E. To print reports for an entire class, use the QUICK PLUS
        program.

        LIST ALL ASSIGNMENTS: This section lists all assignments as well
        as the average number of points earned in the class for each
        assignment and the per cent average for each assignment. Also
        shown is the grade category (HOMEWORK, TESTS, MATH etc.) for each
        assignment. (A category followed by the letter L indicates that
        the assignment has been used for LETTER GRADE entry. Assignments
        can be listed in order by ASSIGNMENT number, or can be grouped
        into the categories for easier comparison. This section could be
        used to quickly compare class averages on assignments or tests,
        to detect class trends in grades (homework or test grades
        slacking off for class overall, for example) or simply to check
        category or maximum values for any particular assignments.
---
        LIST ALL NO GRADE ENTRIES: This section lists all student's names
        and assignments for which a NO GRADE status has been chosen.

        LIST ALL GRADES FOR ONE ASSIGNMENT: This section lists the grades
        for a particular assignment for each student in the class.

        STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF GRADES: The statistical analysis section
        will provide the mean, median, standard deviation, maximum, and
        minimum grades for any assignment or for the total class
        averages. This section can be VERY helpful!! Don't be afraid of
        it. THE PROGRADE SYSTEM does the work! The standard deviation is
        an excellent guide to the variability of grades. The teacher's
        attention should be drawn to any assignment with a very low or
        very high standard deviation compared to the standard deviations
        usually seen for this teacher for this category of assignment. A
        comparison of the mean and median can also be enlightening. A
        high mean and a lower median indicates that some students have
        exceptionally high grades in comparison with the class. The
        reverse indicates some very low grades. Either situation may
        require some special attention.

                 TO CONTINUE ONCE A REPORT IS DONE: TOUCH ENTER.

           TO PRINT A REPORT TO THE PRINTER.  Run the report and use the
              print keys on your computer terminal to print the screen.
           The screen is designed to provide an organized printed report.

         AFTER YOU PRINT A REPORT FROM THE MAIN PROGRAM OR FROM PROPLUS,
                YOU SHOULD TOUCH ENTER TO GET THE 1 LINE MENU.
            ON THIS MENU, YOU MAY TOUCH   F   TO OBTAIN A FORM FEED,
          PROVIDED THAT YOUR PRINTER IS ON.  THIS IS USEFUL IN BEGINNING
                  YOUR REPORTS AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW PAGE.
---
                                XIII. SAVING FILES

        The initialize program will set THE PROGRADE SYSTEM to save your
        data periodically. Additionally, the program will save your data
        before you switch files or end the program. You may also save the
        file at any time using the SAVE function (type S in
        ASSIGNMENT.GRADE area)

        It is suggested that you keep 2 DATA disks, one for EXTRA copies.
        You can save a file onto as many disks as you wish by simply
        changing formatted disks before saving. Total ease of mind can be
        achieved by using the REPORT section to print all grades
        periodically onto paper.

        PROGRADE will protect your data in two ways. As soon as it reads
        any file, it will save a copy of the file with a ".BAK"
        extension. If an accident or error were to harm data in the file
        as you work on it, the ".BAK" file would contain data from BEFORE
        the program ran, and would serve as a safety net. DO NOT EVER
        LOAD A ".BAK" file directly into PROGRADE. Make a copy of it
        first using your DOS and giving the new file a new name without
        the .BAK extension. Then LOAD ONLY THE COPY. If necessary, seek
        assistance from someone who knows about computing, as the
        "BAK" file should not be destroyed.

        PROGRADE'S second file protection is to make "EXTRA" file copies
        that have the ".EXT" extension and that contain identical data to
        the current working copy. These should be saved on a SEPARATE
        data disk. Note that "EXT" files only serve as a safety net if
        the original DISK is harmed; they do not contain "OLD DATA", but
        are just extra copies of what you have just done. It may be a
        good idea to keep the EXTRA and original disks in two separate
        locations. Treat these disks with the same security precautions
        as you would use for your written gradebook.

        THE BEST WAY TO SAFEGUARD YOUR DATA IS TO MANUALLY COPY YOUR
        GRADEFILES (USING DOS OR BATCH FILES) DIRECTLY TO YET ANOTHER
        DISK. (see your DOS manual on copying files and on batch files)
        THIS WAY YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE AN OLD COPY OF THE FILE.
---
                      XIV. GETTING OR CREATING ANOTHER CLASS

        To switch to another class, simply access any student's record
        and type G in the ASSIGNMENT.GRADE entry area. The current grade
        file will automatically be saved and you will be prompted to
        provide the file name that you wish to get or create. To see the
        names of the files that are currently on the data disk, simply
        type L in the ASSIGNMENT.GRADE entry area.

                                   XV. SCALING

        THE PROGRADE SYSTEM will scale any or all assignments either UP
        or DOWN. Choose M at the ASSIGNMENT.GRADE entry area to get the
        MODIFICATION MENU and choose option 11 for scaling. THE PROGRADE
        SYSTEM provides two distinct methods of scaling. The first ADDS
        (subtracts) a certain percent of the total (say 5% or 10%) to
        each student's grade for that particular assignment. This
        procedure benefits students with lower grades more than those
        with higher grades. The second method MULTIPLIES each student's
        grade by a certain factor, to increase (decrease) that grade by
        say 5% or 10%. With this method, all students are scaled an equal
        PER CENT of the GRADE THEY ALREADY HAVE. A student with a zero
        grade would gain nothing. Give careful consideration to which
        scaling procedure to use. An example follows.

             ORIGINAL      ADD TO SCALE 10%   MULTIPLY TO SCALE 10%
              24/100           34/100                 26/100
              68/100           78/100                 75/100
              89/100           99/100                 98/100

        To scale grades downward, enter a negative factor such as -10.

                         XVI. ENDING THE PROGRADE SYSTEM

        To end the program, enter E in the ASSIGNMENT.GRADE entry area.
        Your file will automatically be saved. To override the automatic
        save, you may end with CTRL-BREAK, but all your work will be
        lost.

                **********        PROGRADE  PLUS        **********
                **************************************************

                        XVII. PROGRADE PLUS INTRODUCTION

        PROGRADE PLUS provides additional operations that can be
        performed on grade files. Use the regular PROGRADE SYSTEM program
        to routinely make and modify grade files. Use PROGRADE PLUS for
        its slightly more sophisticated analyses of a class' grades. For
        example, PROGRADE PLUS allows you to compare grades for any two
        assignments. PROGRADE PLUS can clone your grade file so that you
        don't need to type in a class's names a second time for the next
        grading period. PROGRADE PLUS will also provide more detailed
        individual grade reports, provide histogram diagrams, and compare
        variability of grades. Finally, PROGRADE PLUS allows you to
        combine averages from several quarters, semesters, or grading
        periods; and along with exam grades, to calculate a year grade.

                           XIII. RUNNING PROGRADE PLUS

        Be sure that you have initialized THE PROGRADE SYSTEM using the
        initialization program (see section III). Also, be certain that a
        grade file already exists on your data disk. If you are working
        with PROGRADE PLUS, be sure that you save any file that you are
        working on; then exit from the regular program. To run PROGRADE
        PLUS, use the MASTER MENU or get to the DOS and type PROPLUS
        <enter>. When PROGRADE PLUS runs, it will require you to pick a
        file on which you will be working first. NOTE: YEAR FILES END IN
        .YR REGULAR FILES, WHICH YOU ARE CHOOSING NOW, DO NOT! DO NOT
        ENTER A FILE WITH A .YR EXTENSION AT THIS POINT IN THE PROGRAM.

        CLONE A GRADE FILE: This section will create a new copy of your
        file with ALL GRADES AND ASSIGNMENTS DELETED. All that will be
        placed in the new file will be student names from the old file.
        The old file will not be changed. Use this section at the
        beginning of a new grading period or quarter. Be careful not to
        save to any file NAME already in use on the data disk, as this
        would destroy the old file by overwriting it with the new clone.
        USE A NEW NAME!

        COMPARE ANY TWO ASSIGNMENTS: This section will compare the grades
        for an entire class for any two assignments. The method used is
        the Pearson product moment correlation for measures . A linear
        regression is also calculated that relates the values on one
        assignment with those on another. With consistent class
        performance overall, you will find a high correlation between
        assignments. A low correlation may require some assessment.

        COMPARE VARIABILITY OF GRADES: This compares the variability of
        student performances, one with another, and ranks the students
        based on this VARIABILITY. Students with highly VARIABLE grades,
        either low or high, will be ranked high with this section.
---
        DISPLAY DISTRIBUTION OF GRADES: Use this section to create a bar
        graph display of any assignment from a grade file or for the
        averages in a grade file. The display may result in an
        approximate normal distribution.

        RANK STUDENTS BY ASSIGNMENT CATEGORY: This section provides a
        rank listing of students based on the average in a single
        category, such as TESTS, HOMEWORKS, READING or MATH. Trends are
        printed based on information set in the initialization program.

        DETAILED INDIVIDUAL GRADE REPORTS: This section will provide more
        detailed grade reports on individual students. It will analyze
        the student's average for all assignment categories, as is done
        in the regular PROGRADE SYSTEM program. In addition, this section
        uses a scanning routine to search for increasing, decreasing or
        consistent grades for each student in each category. To terminate
        the grade reports at any time, touch E. See Section XII on
        beginning grade reports at the top of a new page.

        SEND AVERAGES TO YEAR FILE: This section will take the averages
        (only the averages) from any grade file and place them into
        another file called a year file. Use a separate year file for
        each separate class.

        COLUMN   1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10    AVE

        Using this section, you can take the averages from several
        different grade files for the same class (one file at a time) and
        combine them to calculate a final year's average. To transfer
        averages, choose a year file to which grades will go, the column
        number, and the percent of the final grade. It is IMPERATIVE that
        you have used the exact same student names in each grade file
        that you combine into a single year file. It is also possible to
        use the year file section to monitor the progress of grades
        during a particular grade period. Ignore the AVE and PERCENT
        values and enter the averages to a year file periodically.

        EXAMPLE after one quarter:

        ENTER EXAM GRADES TO YEAR FILE: This section allows you to enter
        exam grades (or other grades) into the year file. This exam grade
        will then be used to calculate the year average. You are NOT
        REQUIRED to use an exam grade, however. To enter exam grades,
        choose the year file to which grades will go, the column number,
        and the per cent of the final grade.

        EXAMPLE after exam grade added:

        COLUMN   1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10    AVE

        ZEDRON   61.7 63.5 71.6

        AVERAGE YEAR FILE: Once a year file is fully prepared using the
        two previous sections, you may average for the year by choosing
        this option. Later, you may reaverage at any time. Be certain
        that the percents for the columns sum to 100. Until they do, the
        average that is displayed is NOT the correct final average. This
        section will also show the year file (with grand average) to the
        screen, from where it may be printed. Finally, this section will
        display a histogram based on the grand average.

        CHOOSE A NEW GRADE FILE TO WORK ON: Use this choice to access a
        different grade file before you put its average in a year file or
        before you analyze its grades using PROGRADE PLUS.

                    XIX. QUICK PLUS REPORT PROGRAM

        QUICK PLUS is designed for quick processing of grade reports.
        With it you can print grade reports or progress reports all of
        your classes at one time; you can also print summary reports
        or class lists. You can specify printout for certain grade
        ranges, for example all reports with averages 65-75%. Finally,
        you can add individual comments to reports and can add a
        general comment to all reports.

        Run QUICK from the MASTER MENU or simply type QUICK. Once
        at the menu, choose the preview option to see grade
        reports on the screen before they are printed; use this
        option also to add a comment to an individual student's
        grade report. Choose the print option to print reports
        without screen preview. Be certain that the date is
        correctly set via your DOS system before running QUICK
        PLUS, or reports will be incorrectly dated.

        QUICK PLUS will request upper and lower limits for grade
        reports. Only reports with averages within these limits will
        be screened or printed. For example, to print all students
        with averages below 65, specify a lower limit of 0 and an
        upper limit of 65. To print all reports, specify 0 and 100.
        To print only "A" grades, specify 90 and 100, and so on.

        QUICK PLUS will also request up to ten filenames to analyze.
        Type in up to 10 filenames, one at a time, each followed by
        the enter key. QUICK PLUS will scan through all files
        requested without additonal information.

        Finally, QUICK PLUS will give you the option of printing a
        full page PROGRESS REPORT with up fourteen extra comment lines
        (see section XX), the standard GRADE REPORT, a summary report,
        or class lists. Many teachers use the full page reports
        occasionally and the standard and summary reports on a more
        frequent basis with students. The lists have many uses. You
        can type absolutely anything at all in the PROGRESS REPORT 14
        line section. See the BEGIN PROGRAM to set this area up.

        To enter a comment on a report, choose the preview option
        and then touch C when a student's report appears. Then
        simply type in the comment you wish to appear on the
        report, followed by enter. NOTE: RETURNING TO THE MAIN
        MENU AT ANY TIME WILL ERASE ALL THE COMMENTS. The PRINT
        ALL choice will terminate the preview mode and begin
        printout of all previously specified reports.

                **********        BEGIN PROGRAM         **********
                **************************************************

                          XX. INITIALIZE (BEGIN) PROGRAM

        To run the initialize program, get to the DOS system, place the
        program disk in drive A, and type BEGIN <enter>. Or, access the
        program from the MASTER MENU. The initialize program options are:

        SCREEN COLOR SELECTIONS: Use this section to choose colors to use
        on the screen.

        PRINT MANUAL TO PRINTER: Use this section to print this manual to
        the printer. Be certain that the printer is ready and on line. You
        may also use your word processor to load, view, and print the
        manual file (PROGRADE.TXT). The word processor must accept ASCII
        files. Another choice is to use DOS commands. (For information
        about using TYPE and MORE, see your DOS manual.)

        HANDS ON TUTORIAL: Use this section to print a hands-on
        tutorial to the printer.

        VIEW MANUAL ON SCREEN: Use this section to view the manual on the
        screen; a menu is provided.

        GRADE WEIGHTING OPTIONS: Use this section to cause THE PROGRADE
        SYSTEM to calculate all averages using WEIGHTED grades. By using
        WEIGHTED grades, you can specify that certain categories (TESTS,
        HOMEWORKS, LABS, etc.) count a certain percent toward the average.
        For example:
                TESTS         50%        OR    READING      25%
                HOMEWORK      25%              MATH         25%
                QUIZZES       15%              SCIENCE      25%
                LABS          10%              LANGUAGE     25%

        If you don't use weighted grades, THE PROGRADE SYSTEM will add all
        the grades that a student has and divide by the total of the
        maximum values of all assignments; this will give the average.
        Here is an example using weighted grades:

                        ASSIGN     GRADE       MAX. VALUE
                         1 TEST      90            100
                         2 TEST      80            100
                         3 HOME      70            100
                         4 QUIZ      60            100
                         5 LAB       50            100

        With weighting as follows (TESTS 50%, HOMEWORK 10%, QUIZ 20%, LAB
        20%) the weighted average would be: 71.5. The weighted average is
        NOT (90+80+70+60+50)/5 or 70.0; that would be an unweighted
        average.
---
        Here is an example using unweighted grades:

                         ASSIGN    GRADE       MAX. VALUE
                         1 TEST      90            100
                         2 TEST      80            100
                         3 HOME       7             10
                         4 QUIZ       6             10
                         5 LAB        5             20

        The unweighted average would be (90+80+7+6+5)/240 or 188/240 or
        78.3. This particular unweighted average emphasizes test grades,
        because the maximum value for tests is 100 compared to 20 for the
        lab and 10 for the other work.

        CHOOSE DISK DRIVE FOR DATA: Use this section to choose the
        disk drive on which THE PROGRADE SYSTEM will read and save
        data files. For two disk drives, it is best to use B for data
        and A for the program disk. For a one drive system, also set B
        for data. This method will give you the most clear prompts as
        to when to change your disks. Thus, it's best to use B for
        data whether you have ONE OR TWO drives. Other drive letters
        can be acceptable, depending on the system configuration.

        NAME GRADE CATEGORIES: Use this section to define grade
        categories, such as TEST, QUIZZES, HOMEWORK, LAB WORK, ORAL PRES,
        VOCAB, BOOK REP, etc. Elementary level teachers could use
        categories such as READING, MATH, LANGUAGE, and so on. A code
        letter, probably best the first letter of the category, is also to
        be chosen. You can define 10 categories or less. These categories
        are then used by some of the averaging functions in the main
        PROGRADE SYSTEM program. Give the categories careful thought. Once
        you have created a grade file, you can add categories, but do not
        delete any.

        AUTOMATIC SAVE - HOW OFTEN: Use this section to tell the PROGRADE
        SYSTEM program how often to automatically save your grade file as
        you work on it.

        SAVE CHANGES TO DISK AND END: Use this section to save all the
        instructions that you have made with the initialize program. Each
        time the main PROGRADE SYSTEM program is run, it will
        automatically check the instructions that you have saved.

        DEFINE LETTER GRADES: Use this section to define numerical
        equivalents (example 92.5) for the letter grades (example A-).
        Allowable letter grades are: A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+,
        D, D-, F+, F, F-. Numerical values should reflect a 0-100% scale.
        However, do not enter the % sign. If you do not enter a value for
        a certain letter grade, this letter grade will be given a value of
        zero.

        Default values for grades are: A+ 98, A 95, A- 91, B+ 88, B 85, B-
        81, C+ 78, C 75, C- 71, D+ 68, D 65, D- 61, F+ 58, F 55, F- 51. If
        you wish to accept the default values, do not access this section
        at all.
---
        END BUT DONT SAVE CHANGES: Use this section if you think that you
        have altered the instructions in a way that you do not wish to
        save.

        ADJUST TREND CALCULATIONS: It is a matter of judgement what is
        "consistent" or "variable" or even "increasing". Use this section
        to fine tune the trend calculations in PROGRADE PLUS to suit your
        judgement. Choose a higher percent to make it less likely for
        PROGRADE PLUS to indicate a trend up or down; the change in a
        student's grade must EXCEED this percent to show a trend.

        HARD DRIVE LETTER: Use this section only if your hard drive is
        not letter C.  It will reset the entire program series to use
        another letter, such as G.

        PROGRESS REPORT COMMENTS: Use this section to save comment lines;
        these lines will be printed by the QUICK program PROGRESS REPORT
        option. You may use up to 70 characters on each of fourteen lines.
        All lines will appear on all QUICK PROGRESS REPORTS. Many teachers
        use a checklist (see below), but any text at all is acceptable.

              ____    Please contact me at the school for a meeting.
              ____    Work has improved considerably.
              ____    Homework needs more attention to detail.

        RESTORE INSTRUCTIONS

        Should you accidentally alter and save the initialize instructions
        to a point where THE PROGRADE SYSTEM malfunctions, you can restore
        the DEFAULT instructions by getting to DOS, replacing the program
        disk in Drive A, and typing RESTORE.

        ABOUT THE ~ FILES

        The ~ files are used to distinguish the program disk from the data
        disk and to contain information necessary to the functioning of
        the programs. NEVER COPY OR REMOVE THESE FILES FROM ANY DISK or
        the program my not function and your data may be harmed.

        ABOUT THE CODE FILES

        The CODE files contain information that you have saved using the
        initialize program. DO NOT COPY OR REMOVE THE FILES FROM ANY DISK
        or the program may not function and your data may be harmed.

                         *** HANDS-ON TUTORIAL ***

     Use this tutorial together with the REFERENCE USER MANUAL your
     computer, and the program and utility disks as a way to introduce
     yourself to the PROGRADE SYSTEM.  This is NOT a READ ONLY tutorial!  It
     is a DO EACH STEP ON THE COMPUTER TUTORIAL!  Once you go through this
     tutorial, you will be familiar enough with the SYSTEM to begin to do
     your own grades.  During the tutorial, the <RETURN> and <ENTER> keys
     have the same meaning.  Use whichever key your computer has.  Finally,
     take it easy!  Do a few sections at a time and take a break now and
     again!  If at any time you should see a request to insert a disk with
     COMMAND.COM on it, don't panic.  This is just your DOS disk.

                         ************************
                                   DISKS
                         ************************

     There are two disks.  The UTILITY DISK contains sample grade files
     (DEMO1, DEMO2, DEMO3, DEMO4).  It also contains other files ending in
     .TXT such as AUTHOR.TXT and COMMENTS.TXT.  The .TXT files can be
     examined with your word processor.  They contain additional information
     about the program.  The utility disk contains the GET program (see
     below).  Place the utility disk in drive A and type DIR.  You will see
     the files listed as discussed above.
---
     Now remove the utility disk and place the other disk (PROGRAM DISK) in
     drive A and type DIR.  The files that end in .EXE are program files.
     The ~ and CODE files on both disks are used to contain information
     necessary for the program to function.  The RESTORE file is used to
     reset the screen colors and all other program parameters should you
     accidentally alter them to a point where the program malfunctions.  The
     HARD files are used to install the program onto a hard disk.  The
     HELPSCRNS area contains on screen helpscreens that the program may call.

     BOTH DISKS CONTAIN A FILE CALLED READNOW  USE A WORD PROCESSOR
     TO VIEW THIS FILE-- IT CONTAINS INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO START THE
     PROGRADE SYSTEM UP.

                   *************************************

                      BEGIN (INITIALIZATION) PROGRAM

                   *************************************

     Be sure to read sections I and II of the REFERENCE USER MANUAL
     before proceeding with the tutorial. It is best to use the manual
     WITH the tutorial as you proceed.

     Now, with the PROGRAM disk in drive A, type PRO. Within a few
     seconds the MASTER MENU will appear. Type the letter B followed
     by <RETURN>.  This will start the INITIALIZE (BEGIN) program.
     Touch any key as indicated and you will get the BEGIN PROGRAM
     menu.  At this point, you should be sure to read sections III and
     sections XX of the REFERENCE USER MANUAL.

                     ***  SCREEN COLOR SELECTIONS   ***

     From the BEGIN PROGRAM menu, touch the letter C followed by <RETURN>.
     Then slowly but repeatedly touch the <RETURN> key until the last line
     on the screen shows the text colors that you want to use; use
     backspace to go back.  Once at the color you want, touch the letter C.
     Now the entire screen will be filled with the colors that you have
     chosen.  Now use the <RETURN> key again to change the border color.
     When the border is correct, touch C and you will be returned to the
     BEGIN PROGRAM menu.

                  *** PRINT REFERENCE USER MANUAL ***

     From the BEGIN PROGRAM menu, touch P followed by <RETURN>. This will
     print the USER REFERENCE MANUAL, much like the one that comes with
     the PROGRADE disks when you register AND update. It is not necessary
     to do this if you have the blue printed manual already.

     Be sure to place the utility disk in DRIVE A when the prompt
     asks you to, and be sure that your printer is ON.

                 ***   PRINT HANDS ON TUTORIAL   ***

     From the BEGIN PROGRAM menu, touch H followed by <RETURN>.  This will
     print this TUTORIAL.  Be sure to place the utility disk in DRIVE A when
     the prompt asks you to, and be sure that your printer is ON.
---

              *** VIEW SHORT VERSION OF MANUAL ON SCREEN ***

     Touch V followed by <RETURN>.  A brief index to the help screens
     will appear.  These are condensed versions of important sections
     of the manual.  To view a section, enter the number for that
     section.  Enter 2 <RETURN> to see the section on SETTING PROGRADE
     UP, for example.  BE CERTAIN THAT THE PROGRAM DISK IS IN DRIVE A!
     When you finish reading the screen, touch <RETURN> to go on.  You
     will be automatically returned to the help screens menu.  Try
     some other help screens.  When you finish with the help section
     altogether, touch <RETURN> to go back to the BEGIN PROGRAM menu.

                  ***   CHOOSE DISK DRIVE FOR DATA   ***

     From the BEGIN PROGRAM menu, touch D followed by <RETURN>. When
     you are prompted, enter the letter for the drive where you will
     have the data disk. Your best bet is probably to use drive B,
     even if you just have a single disk drive in your machine. (By
     using B (not A) if have just one drive, you will be given more
     clear prompts when you need to switch disks.) Of course, if you
     have two drives, then you should use drive B also. Most users
     should use drive B. Just enter the letter B followed by <RETURN>.
     You may also use drive C. Other configurations are possible,
     depending on your system; the most common would be to use drive
     B.

                     ***   NAME GRADE CATEGORIES   ***


     Touch G followed by <RETURN>. A complete list of the default
     grade categories will appear. For example, #1 is TEST, with a
     code letter of T. Try changing a category. Enter the number 10
     followed by <RETURN>. Then, when prompted to do so, enter the
     name of the category. Enter ESSAY <RETURN>. Now you will be
     prompted to enter a one letter abbreviation code for ESSAY. Touch
     SHIFT E <RETURN>. You will be returned to the category list;
     notice that entry 10 has been changed. Probably you will want to
     change it back to OTHER with a code of A.

     Change the categories as you wish, to suit your own grading
     system for your subject.  Keep category names easy to understand
     as they will appear on various reports.  If you teach more than one
     subject to the same group of students, you may wish to read the
     appendix to this tutorial before choosing grade categories.

     Once you finish with this section, touch <RETURN> instead of
     entering a category number.  This action will return you to the
     BEGIN PROGRAM menu.
---

                     ***  GRADE WEIGHTING OPTIONS   ***

     From the BEGIN PROGRAM menu, touch W <RETURN>.  At this point,
     read and consider carefully section XX of the REFERENCE USER
     MANUAL.

     Which method you use will depend on how you already do your
     grades.  Do you just add all the scores on all work and divide by
     the total maximum for all work?  That is using UNWEIGHTED
     grades. Unweighted grades are simple to explain to students;
     however, you must make assignments more or less important to the
     grade by using varying maximum values for the assignments (e.g.
     10 for homeworks, 100 for tests, and so on)

     If you want tests to count 50% and homework 20% and so on, then
     choose WEIGHTED grades. Weighted grades are easy to TELL students
     about ("Tests will be 50%, Homework 20% and so on), but difficult
     for most students to comprehend mathematically. With weighted
     grades, each assignment can be scored out of 100.

     Personally, we feel that UNWEIGHTED GRADES are simpler to
     understand for all involved.

     ONCE YOU HAVE TOUCHED W FROM THE BEGIN PROGRAM MENU, YOU MAY
     EITHER:

     Touch N <RETURN> to choose UNWEIGHTED grades, and you will return
     to the BEGIN PROGRAM menu.

     OR

     Touch Y <RETURN> to choose WEIGHTED grades. Then choose P to
     specify percents for grade categories. Now, each category that
     you have named earlier will appear. Type in the percent that you
     want that category to count, followed by <RETURN>. Try entering
     10 for each of the categories. When the section is complete, you
     will be returned to the BEGIN PROGRAM menu.

                     ***   DEFINE LETTER GRADES   ***

     Use this section to alter the numerical values for letter grades.
     The default values are listed in section XX of the REFERENCE USER
     MANUAL.

     To make changes, touch L from the BEGIN PROGRAM menu. Now you
     will enter a cycle that will ask you to enter numerical values
     for letter grades. For example, you may enter 98 for an A+ and 95
     for an A, and so on.  Continue through all letter grades as
     prompted.  Check your work with the check screen that is
     presented at the end of the section, and then touch enter to
     return to the BEGIN PROGRAM menu.
---
                    ***  ADJUST TREND CALCULATIONS  ***

     From the BEGIN PROGRAM menu, touch T <RETURN>.  The screen
     explains what values are permitted.  Entering 12 <RETURN> will
     reset program to default value.

                    ***  PROGRESS REPORT COMMENTS  ***

     From the BEGIN PROGRAM, touch R <RETURN>. Be certain that the
     PROGRAM DISK is in the operating drive. You will find yourself in
     a simple word processor that can be used to edit the 14 lines of
     text that appear on the screen. These lines will appear on
     printed progress reports. This section will appear at the top of
     a printed sheet; all of the student's grades will appear at the
     bottom. You can use this section to write almost anything to
     appear on the reports.

     Besides letters, numbers and standard punctuation, the following
     keys are active during the progress report word processing:

                                    F1

     The F1 key will save what is on the screen and return you to
     the BEGIN PROGRAM menu.

                                    F2

     The F2 key will blank out the entire word processing area.  That
     way, you can start from scratch.

                                    F3

     The F3 key will insert a line (above the cursor), if there is
     room to insert one.

                                    F4

     The F4 key will delete the line on which the cursor is found.




           Additional editing keys are listed on the next page.

---

                     OTHER KEYS ACTIVE DURING EDITING:

     You may use the PAGEUP, PAGEDOWN, END, HOME, INSERT, DELETE, and
     ARROW KEYS. In addition, you may use standard letters or
     characters, the SHIFT key, the BACKSPACE key, the CAPS key.

     Do not use the CONTROL CHARACTERS, THE ALT CHARACTERS or the ESC
     key or the PRINT key.

         PAGEUP    will bring you to line one of the report
         PAGEDOWN  will bring you to the last line of the report
         END       will bring you to the right column
         INSERT    will add a space in the line at the cursor
         HOME      will bring you to the left column
         DELETE    will delete the letter under the cursor
         ARROWS    will move you up or down one line or character
         BACKSPACE will move you back one space, without deleting

     Work in the report area now and use the above keys to set up a
     report that you like. Once you have changed the report area to
     suit your needs, save it by touching F1. You will be returned to
     the BEGIN PROGRAM menu.

     The PROGRADE SYSTEM is designed to have only one progress report
     form active at a time.  To change the form, use this section as
     it has been described.

                   ***  AUTOMATIC SAVE - HOW OFTEN    ***

     From the BEGIN PROGRAM menu, type A <RETURN>.  The grading
     program will automatically save your grades every _____
     grades.  How often would you like?  Just enter that number
     in response to the prompt.  Then touch <RETURN>

                   ***   ORDER/REGISTRATION FORM   ***

     From the BEGIN PROGRAM menu, type O <RETURN>. Be certain that the
     PROGRAM DISK is in drive A. This will print out a complete order
     form for you to use in ordering/registering for PROGRADE.

                       *** HARD DRIVE LETTER ***
     If you use DRIVE C as a hard drive, SKIP THIS SECTION! ONLY
     ACCESS THIS SECTION IF YOU USE ANOTHER HARD DRIVE LETTER, D, E
     AND SO ON.

                    ***  SAVE CHANGES TO DISK   ***

     It is MOST IMPORTANT, after having gone through all of this
     decision making, to SAVE YOUR CHANGES!! Touch S <RETURN> from the
     BEGIN PROGRAM menu. You will see a screen that summarizes "all
     those numbers". They must be correct for your grades to be
     correct! Check them over, and if necessary, return to the BEGIN
     PROGRAM menu (from here, by choosing N for not correct) and fix
     any errors. If all the values appear correct, then type Y in
     response to the "IS THIS OK" prompt. This will save your grading
     information to the program and utility disks.
---


                 *** SAVE CHANGES TO DISK AND END MENU ***

     From the BEGIN PROGRAM menu, touch E <RETURN> and you will be
     returned to the PROGRADE SYSTEM MASTER MENU.  Be certain that the
     program disk is in DRIVE A.

     The tutorial will now give you an overview of how to use the


                      ******************************

                               QUICK PROGRAM

                      ******************************

     Be sure to read section XIX of the REFERENCE USER MANUAL before you
     proceed with the tutorial.

     First (if not already there) get to the MASTER MENU.  Place the
     PROGRAM DISK in DRIVE A, and type PRO.

     At the MASTER MENU, type Q <RETURN> to access the QUICK PROGRAM.
     Be certain that the PROGRAM DISK is in DRIVE A.

     Once at the title screen for the QUICK PROGRAM, touch any key to
     get to the QUICK PROGRAM menu.  Now you will be asked to place
     your data disk in the correct drive (depending on how you set the
     BEGIN PROGRAM).  For the tutorial, use the UTILITY DISK as your
     data disk.  Place the disk in the correct drive, and touch a key
     to go on.  You will then reach the QUICK PROGRAM menu.  Let's do
     the easy things first!

                            *** MASTER MENU ***

     Touch M <RETURN> and you will be brought back to the SYSTEM
     MASTER MENU.  Try it!  Then repeat the procedures from the last
     section to get back to the QUICK PROGRAM menu.  Be certain to
     insert the correct (PROGRAM or DATA) disk at the correct time.
---
                            *** CLASS LISTS ***

     This is where the FUN begins! From the QUICK PROGRAM menu, touch
     L <RETURN>. This section will make a list of all students in your
     grade file; you could use the list for attendance, or for any
     record keeping. At the first prompt (LOWER LIMIT FOR REPORT),
     type 0 <RETURN> (That's a zero). At the second prompt, type 100
     <RETURN>. This will cause the program to list all students with
     grades from 0 to 100.

     Next, you will see a directory of the UTILITY DISK.  Notice the
     four grade files: DEMO1, DEMO2, DEMO3, DEMO4.  Try typing in now
     DEMO1 <RETURN>.  Notice that the program is ready to take another
     file name.  Type in DEMO3 <RETURN>.  Then type <RETURN> again to
     stop entering file names.  Each file will be used to make a
     separate list.

     Next you will be presented with another prompt.  Do you want
     alphabetic lists or lists based on grade?  For now, choose
     alphabetic by touching A <RETURN>

     And finally, do you want single or double spaced, or boxes next
     to the name?  Try B <RETURN> for the boxes.  WOW!! How many boxes
     do you want?  Touch 10 at the next prompt and <RETURN>

     Set your printer and touch Y in response to OK TO CONTINUE. Your
     lists will now be printed by the printer.  Try some other lists
     using the DEMO files.  The list function is SOME USEFUL!
     Once your list is printed, you will automatically be returned to
     the QUICK PROGRAM menu.

                         ***  SUMMARY REPORT  ***

     The summary report will print a summary of all students in the
     class, showing their overall average and their average for each
     of the ten grade categories.  You can print percent averages or,
     for comparative purposes, class ranks.

     From the QUICK PROGRAM menu, type S <RETURN>.  Once again you
     will be presented with the directory of the disk.  You should
     notice DEMO1, DEMO2, etc. on the directory.  Type in DEMO3
     <RETURN>.  Then type in DEMO4 <RETURN>.  Then, to stop entering
     filenames type another <RETURN>.

     Now you will be asked to choose between PERCENTS for the report,
     or RANKS. This time, touch P <RETURN> to have percents printed.
     Then, be certain that the printer is set up and on line. Next,
     in response to the OK TO CONTINUE prompt, type Y <RETURN>. Since
     the calculations involved in preparing this printout are quite
     lengthy, you may notice a short delay before printing starts.

     When the printout is complete, you will be automatically returned
     to the QUICK PROGRAM menu.
---
                          ***  GRADE REPORTS  ***

     From the QUICK PROGRAM menu, type G <RETURN> to print grade
     reports.  Grade reports are printed two to a page and show the
     student's complete grade record.  PROGRESS reports, on the other
     hand, are printed one to a page and have the 14 line progress
     report comment section (composed using the BEGIN PROGRAM) printed
     at the top of the sheet, and the student's complete grade record
     at the bottom.  Once you have typed G, you will be asked to print
     reports or preview reports. For now, type 2 <RETURN> to preview
     the reports.  Next, you will be prompted, as in the other
     reports, to enter lower and upper limits of grades to find.  To
     see all grades, enter 0 for a lower limit and 100 for an upper
     limit.  Then, as in the previous reports, you will be asked to
     enter the filenames to view.  Enter DEMO3 <RETURN> and then enter
     <RETURN> again to stop entering filenames and go on.

     All students' reports will now appear in alphabetical order.
     Touch C at this point.  Now you can type in a short comment that
     will appear only on Ethan Balmer's report.  Type in:  LET'S GO
     FOR AN A  NEXT TIME, ETHAN.  <RETURN>  You will then be brought
     to the next report.

     You can return to the main menu by typing E, although this will
     lose your comments.  To preserve the comments, pick P at the
     time that a report is being shown.  Try this now.  Type P again
     to choose printing ALL reports.  You will be asked to enter a
     comment that will appear on all reports.  Type in: FINAL REPORT,
     THIRD QUARTER <RETURN>.  Then, get the printer ready and on line
     and type Y in response to the OK TO CONTINUE prompt.

     If the report is dated incorrectly, be certain to enter the date
     correctly when you first boot your computer.  This is the date
     that is placed on the reports.  Notice the comments on the
     reports, as you have typed them in.

     The reports are designed to be quite self explanatory. However,
     some students sometimes ask about the letters in the left column.
     These, of course, are the letters indicating if an assignment is
     a test, quiz, homework, etc.  Sometimes students are concerned
     that the category averages do not "AVERAGE OUT" to the overall
     average.  This, of course, should NOT occur; homework and
     test, for example, are unlikely to be of equal value.  Either by
     setting different maximum values or else by using weighted
     grades, you have told the program to count one assignment more
     than another.  Naturally, it does this; but sometimes students
     need a simple explanation.

     Once the report is complete, you will be returned automatically
     to the QUICK PROGRAM menu. If you do not wish to screen reports
     and add comments, you can choose the grade report option and then
     proceed directly to printing. This is the quickest way to get the
     information out.
---
                        ***  PROGRESS REPORTS ***

     From the QUICK PROGRAM menu, type P <RETURN> to enter the
     progress report section.  From that point on, simply follow the
     same instructions as for the grade report section.  Everything
     will work the same, but the reports will be full page reports
     with the 14 line comment section at the top.

     Try the progress reports for DEMO3.  Use the same instructions as
     in the previous section. Try entering

     PARENT/GUARDIAN SIGNATURE _____________________________

     for the comment that will appear on EACH report. This can help
     make a fine, detailed progress report.

                            *** MASTER MENU ***

     To return to the MASTER MENU type M <RETURN>. Let's return to the
     master menu to look at the MAIN PROGRAM.

     Type M <RETURN> to return to the MASTER MENU.  Be sure that the
     program disk is in the correct drive.
---
     The tutorial will now give you an overview of how to use the

                      ********************************

                               MAIN PROGRAM

                      ********************************

     Be sure to read sections IV - XVI of the USER REFERENCE MANUAL you
     proceed with the tutorial. First (if not already there) get to the
     MASTER MENU. Place the PROGRAM DISK in DRIVE A, and type PRO.

     Then touch M <RETURN> to enter the MAIN PROGRAM.  At the title
     screen, touch any key to continue.  Then, as instructed, be
     certain that the data disk is in the specified drive.  For this
     tutorial, use the UTILITY DISK as the data disk.  Once the disk
     is in, touch any key to go on.  If you have more than one utility
     disk in your program set, use the one of the correct size.

     Next, you will see a directory of the UTILITY DISK.  Notice the
     DEMO1, DEMO2, DEMO3, DEMO4 filenames.  At this point, touch G
     <RETURN> to GET one of these files.  C, which we will not do
     here, would CREATE a totally new file.  The program will now
     prompt you for a filename.  Type in DEMO1 <RETURN>.  After the
     grades are read from the disk, EDWARD BARNET'S grades will
     appear.  Touch the <RETURN> key several times.  Notice how the
     cursor moves from the NAME area to the GRADE area
     (ASSIGNMENT.GRADE area).

     Touch <RETURN> until the cursor is back in the name area.  Now
     touch G (no return). Notice that JOHANNA GRIBLY'S name appears in
     the name area.  Touch <RETURN> and her grades will also appear.

     Return to the name area and touch S (no return) Notice that DAVID
     SMITH'S name appears. Now touch T (no return). The name SAM
     STEVENS now appears. The program recognizes names based on the
     minimum required number of characters. To get STEVEN'S grades,
     you must type ST <RETURN> in the name area. To get SMITH'S, you
     need only type S <RETURN>. You can also move from name to name using
     the up and down arrow keys.  Try going through the list now! EASY!

     Now touch the BACKSPACE key to blank out the name area. Try
     typing STO (no return) . Notice that the program does not
     recognize any names like this. You are free to continue. Do it.
     Type STORRS RICHARD <RETURN> (If you make an error, use backspace
     and redo the entire name.) The program will now ask if this is a
     new name. Type Y <RETURN>. Notice that STORRS has no grades yet!

     Return to the NAME area (NOT THE ASSIGNMENT AREA!) and touch G
     <RETURN>. Now return to the name area and touch STO <RETURN>.
     It's that easy to get the student's record! Don't forget that you
     can always use the arrow keys, too.
---
     Now let's enter a grade for JOHANNA GRIBLY. Get her grades on the
     screen and touch enter to get to the grade area. Then type 35.9
     <RETURN> This will give her a grade of 9 on assignment 35. Notice
     how the grade is changed immediately, as is her overall average.
     Now try changing the grade to 8. Get to the grade area with
     <RETURN> Type in 35.8 <RETURN> Since the program recognizes that
     you are changing the grade, it prompts you to be sure that you
     wish to make the change. Type Y to make the change. Now return to
     the grade area and simply type 7 (no 35 this time) <RETURN> and
     then Y <RETURN> to change the grade. Once you have specified one
     assignment number, you don't need to specify the assignment
     number until you change to another assignment; this speeds entry
     of a class of papers.

     Now get STORRS grade on the screen and enter assignment 35 equal
     to 10 points.  (In the name area, type STO <RETURN> and then type
     10 <RETURN> in the grade area.  DONE!) Try some of the other
     names and other grades.

     To enter a grade for an altogether new assignment, simply specify
     the grade and the assignment number.  Let's say you just get a
     test grade for JOHANNA GRIBLY.  This will become assignment 38,
     the next available assignment.  Get GRIBLY'S grades, and in the
     grade area, enter 38.95 to give her a 95 grade.  Note that the
     program recognizes this as a new assignment and asks you if it
     is.  Respond with Y <RETURN> .  Next you will be asked to give an
     assignment description.  Type in   COSBY TEST <RETURN> and then
     type in T <RETURN> for the category code.  Finally, type in 100
     <RETURN> for the maximum grade value.  You did it!  All of the
     students now have an assignment 38.  Get to DOBSON'S grades and
     enter a value of 86 for this assignment.  While this grade entry
     method is complex to explain, it is fast to use and particularly
     fast to use in going through a class set of papers.

     In the grade entry area, you may also enter one of the letters
     found in the box at the bottom right of the screen.  For
     example, get STORR'S grades and then type Z in the grade area.
     Follow the instructions, and STORR will be totally deleted from
     the grade file.  (There are less drastic measures to make grades
     not count, however.)

     Let's look at each of these letter options individually.

                              *** REPORTS ***

     To get to the reports section, type R in the grade entry area. This
     will get you to a reports menu. Section XII of the REFERENCE USER
     MANUAL has detailed descriptions of what each of the report options
     is about. At this point, you should read this section of the manual
     again. Try one of these options at a time, starting with A for the
     alphabetical lists.

     To return to the report menu from the report itself, simply touch
     the enter key.
---
     Each report can be printed by using the PRINT SCREEN (or SHIFT
     PRINT SCREEN on some computers) key on your computer.

     Be sure to try EACH report option before you proceed with the
     rest of the tutorial.

                         *** SAVE DATA TO DISK ***

     To save your data at any time, type S <RETURN> in the grade entry
     area. Try it now!  Your grade file will be saved and you will be
     returned to your work.  Use this section whenever you like to
     save your grades as you work.

     The demonstration version of the program, it should be noted,
     will not save grade files.

     A detailed explanation of the .EXT and .BAK files is found in
     section XIII of the REFERENCE USER MANUAL.


                           *** MODIFICATIONS ***


     To get to the modifications section, type M <RETURN>. Try it! You
     will then be at the MODIFICATIONS MENU. On your own grades, be
     careful here! The purpose of the modifications section is to allow
     you to revise ANY entry that you have already made. Needless to say,
     careless work here could have a direct negative effect on your
     grades. Read section XI of the USER REFERENCE MANUAL before
     proceeding with the tutorial.

     With the DEMO1 file in memory, you have little to worry about.
     Now is the time to explore! Options 1, 2, and 3 will cause grades
     NOT TO COUNT. Try each one, one at a time, and then return to the
     main program. Look at the grades on the screen to see the effects
     of what you have done. The * next to the assignment indicates
     that it does NOT COUNT. A * next to a student name indicates that
     ALL of the student's grades do not count.

     Options 6, 7, and 8 from the modifications menu will reverse the
     first three options.  Try each of these, one at a time, and then
     return to the main program with choice 13.  Look at the grades to
     see the effects.  Notice that the * are removed and that the
     grades now count again.
---
     Try option 4.  With it you can change the description of an
     assignment.  Change assignment 6 to read DENSITY, a Homework
     assignment worth 10 points.

     Option 5 can be used to change a student name.  Try changing JILL
     THOMPSON'S name to JILL TOMPSON.  Then use option 13 to return to
     the main program, and type in T <RETURN> in the name area.  There
     it is!

     Option 9 will recalculate the values of all grades for one
     assignment; this is so that you can change the maximum value.
     For example, choose option 9.  Then choose assignment 35, which
     is now worth 10 points maximum.  Give it a new maximum value of
     20.  Now return to the main program.  Notice how each grade
     for assignment 35 is now out of 20 points.  It would be rare to
     use this section, but it's there just in case.

     Option 10 will eliminate an assignment from the grades. This
     totally removes all reference to the grades. Try it and remove
     assignment 37. Return to the main program. NO MORE OLD ASSIGNMENT
     37!! and no way back. If you want a less decisive option, use
     option 6 to mark an assignment NOT TO COUNT.

     Now, have some fun!  Try option 11 from the MODIFICATION menu.
     You are given a choice of assignments to scale, or you can just
     touch the <RETURN> key to scale ALL assignments for ALL students.
     This would directly raise the class average.  Type <RETURN> to
     scale all the grades.  Then type A <RETURN> to add to each
     student's grades; then enter a scaling factor of 5 (% sign is not
     to be entered).  Return to the main program and notice that the
     grades are going higher! While we advise some discretion in using
     this option, it is there for those who seek it!

     Read section XV on the scaling of grades. It is well worth your
     serious thought if you do scale grades, as different scaling
     methods benefit different types of students differently.

     Now pick option 12 from the MODIFICATION menu. This will allow
     you to TEMPORARILY switch from weighted to unweighted grades. BE
     CERTAIN that you have used the BEGIN program already to set
     appropriate weights for each category. Try switching from
     unweighted to weighted grades and back. Then return to the main
     program to see the effect on the grades. There are differences in
     the grade outcomes, of course.  Here again, some careful thought
     should be given, in advance!! NOTE: To change more permanently from
     weighted to unweighted or vice versa, use the BEGIN program. This
     option 12 is ONLY TEMPORARY!

     By now, you must know -- option 13 will return you to the main
     program.
---

                         *** GET ANOTHER CLASS ***

     From the main program, you may type G in the grade area to save
     the file you are now working on and to get another file. Try it!
     The file will be saved immediately, so be sure that the data disk
     is in the correct drive. (Reminder: the demonstration program
     does not save files and will skip this section.) Then the program
     will return you to the option to get or create a file. You are
     back at the beginning of the program, and can get or create
     another file.

     If you choose G, you will be getting a file already on the disk
     (such as DEMO1, DEMO2, ETC.). If you choose C (let's do that,
     now), then you will CREATE A TOTALLY NEW FILE. Type C <RETURN> at
     the get/create prompt. You will need to type another <RETURN> to
     continue. This is to be CERTAIN that your wish is to create a
     file. Then enter the filename TEST <RETURN> in response to the
     next prompt.

     You will soon arrive at the main program screen -- but no grades,
     no names.  That's right! It's totally blank.  Try entering a few
     names and grades, as we have already done.  Then save the file.
     (NOTE: DEMO FILES ARE NOT ACTUALLY SAVED TO THE DISK.)

                        *** LIST FILES ON DISK ****

     This simple section can be accessed by typing L in the main
     program grade entry area.  You will simply get a directory of
     your data disk, in case you forget the file names.  You will
     also be given the option of DELETING files at this point.  As
     always, you should use this option sparingly.  Try deleting a
     demo file sometime, but not right now, OK ?

                         *** DELETE A STUDENT ***

     Type Z <RETURN> in the main program grade entry area and the
     student whose grades are on the screen can be totally deleted
     from the grade file.  This section is best used sparingly.  It
     might be better to leave the grades and simply use the
     modification section to mark them not to count.
---
                               *** HELP ***

     Type H <RETURN> in the main program grade entry area and the help
     screens menu will appear. The help screens are condensed versions
     of important sections of the manual. To view a section, enter the
     number for that section. Enter 2 <RETURN> to see the section on
     SETTING PROGRADE UP, for example. BE CERTAIN THAT THE PROGRAM
     DISK IS IN DRIVE A! When you finish reading the screen, touch
     <RETURN> to go on. You will be automatically returned to the help
     screens menu. Try some other help screens. When you finish with
     the help section altogether, touch <RETURN> to go back to the
     main program.


                         *** EXIT FROM PROGRAM ***

     Type E <RETURN> in the main program grade entry area and the
     title screen will first appear. Touch any key to go on and you
     will be given a choice: No (I don't really want to end), Yes (I'm
     all done with the PROGRADE SYSTEM, but save my grades first), and
     Master Menu (save my grades, but I want to get back to that
     MASTER MENU). Try choosing M at this point, so that we can go on
     with the tutorial. Be certain that the PROGRAM DISK is in the
     drive A when prompted. Soon, the MASTER MENU will reappear.

     Were you to choose Y in the above paragraph, the program would
     then terminate completely. The screen would then ask you to type
     in a drive name and the word EXTRA. This command will make an
     EXTRA copy (called an .EXT file) of any file that you have just
     accessed; follow the screen instructions to be certain that you
     are placing an extra disk in the correct drive at the correct
     time.  At this point, however, the tutorial will go on, so you
     will not see this sequence.
---
     The tutorial will now give you an overview of how to use the


                      ********************************

                              PROPLUS PROGRAM

                      ********************************

     Be sure to read sections XVII and XVIII of the USER REFERENCE MANUAL
     before you proceed with the tutorial.

     First (if not already there) get to the MASTER MENU.  Place the
     PROGRAM DISK in DRIVE A, and type PRO.

     Then touch P <RETURN> to enter the PROPLUS PROGRAM.  At the
     title screen, touch any key to continue.  Then, as instructed, be
     certain that the data disk is in the specified drive.  For this
     tutorial, use the UTILITY DISK as the data disk.  Once the disk
     is in, touch any key to go on.

     At this point, enter the filename for the grades you wish to
     examine.  Enter DEMO1 <RETURN> at this point. Shortly the PROPLUS
     menu will appear.

     Let's try one option at a time. Option 1 will clone a grade file.
     Pick this option and see what it does. You will be asked for a
     new filename: use TEST2 <RETURN>. What the clone section does is
     make a new gradefile, named TEST2 in this case, that has NO
     GRADES, NO ASSINGMENTS, ONLY STUDENT NAMES. This is a timesaver
     at the beginning of the quarter, as it makes it so that you don't
     have to reenter those names. It could also be used to make more
     than one grade file for a particular class. If you wish, you can
     load the cloned file from the main program. However, you cannot
     use it in PROPLUS, as it contains no grades to process.

     Now, reload DEMO1. Option 2 from PROPLUS will compare any two
     assignments. Technically, it calculates a correlation coefficient
     between any two assignments. Try comparing several assignments.
     Consistent grading and consistent class performance will cause
     correlations that are high. Other values may require some
     consideration. Any elementary statistics book will provide a
     detailed discussion of correlation.
---
     Option 3 from the PROPLUS menu will calculate the VARIABILITY of
     grades. Try it! The student listed as #1 shows the greatest
     variability in his grades (his scores vary considerably, from 30s
     to 100's to 50's to 90's for example); his work should be given
     close attention to try to determine the cause of this type of
     variation. Simply touch the <RETURN> key and then return to the
     PROPLUS menu.

     Option 4 from the PROPLUS menu will show a histogram graph of
     grades in the class.  You can choose to show just one assignment,
     or you can choose to show all assignments (overall averages).
     Try this, and show averages by just touching <RETURN> at the
     prompt.  The graph is a nice, easy way to get an overall picture
     of the class's work, or of their work on any individual
     assignment.  Touch the <RETURN> key to return to the PROPLUS
     menu.

     Option 5 from the PROPLUS menu will allow you to view ranked
     listings of averages in each of the 10 grade categories. For
     example, who has the highest homework average? Choose option 5,
     and then choose category 3. TARA VINCENT has the highest homework
     average, while MIKE DOBSON (there he is again!) has the lowest.
     Notice that TARA's grade is over 100%. The program will correctly
     handle extra credit and excess credit (104/100, for example); do
     not be afraid to use such grades. More information about extra
     credit is found at the end of this tutorial. The "CONSISTENT",
     "VARIES", "TREND UP' and "TREND DOWN" notations may be helpful to
     you in spotting trends; however, as the REFERENCE MANUAL explains
     in section XX, there is a certain degree of judgement in this type
     of description. Use the begin program if you wish to make the
     trend detection more or less sensitive. To return to the PROPLUS
     menu at this time, touch the <RETURN> key and then M <RETURN>.

     Choose option 6 now from the PROPLUS menu.  This option will
     present you with the student roster.  Pick any student or type
     <RETURN> by itself (for all students).  You will see individual
     grade reports with TRENDS indicated.  You may have some
     occasional use to print reports with these trends shown.  Simply
     use the PRINT SCREEN feature of your computer to do the printing.
     In other ways, the report is identical to reports generated by
     the MAIN PROGRAM or by the QUICK PROGRAM. Go to the next report
     with <RETURN> and touch E <RETURN> to leave this section.

     Option 7,8, and 9 allow you to save OVERALL AVERAGES from your grade
     files into files called YEAR FILES. Use a separate name for your year
     file. The program will automatically attach a .YR extension to the
     filename you give.
---

     Choose option 7 now. For the year file name, enter TEST3
     <RETURN>. Then enter C <RETURN> to CREATE this year file. Once
     the file is created on disk, choose column 1 into which to enter
     the grades. Type 1 <RETURN> and then type Y in response to the OK
     prompt. Finally, enter QUAR1 <RETURN> (for quarter 1) as the
     short code to identify the column, and 20 <RETURN> as the amount
     the quarter's grade will count toward the final average. The
     grades will now appear on the screen. This is the year file. You
     can use it to record grades from up to ten grade files (for the
     same students). Touch <RETURN> to leave the section and save the
     file.

     Choose option 8 now. This section can be used to record exam
     grades for each student. It could be used to store other data,
     also. For the year file, enter TEST3 <RETURN>. Then enter G
     <RETURN> to GET THE file you already created in option 6. At the
     prompt, choose column 2. Now the program will take you through
     the class list. Enter the exam grade for each student, making
     them up as you go. Use EXAM <RETURN> as the short code to
     identify the column, and 10 <RETURN> as the amount to count
     toward the average.

     This will return you to the year file. Remember, you can always
     use PRINT SCREEN to print the screen to the printer. Should you
     wish to change just a single exam grade, enter 99 at this point.
     Try changing a few grades using this method. Return to the main
     PROPLUS menu using 0 <RETURN>. (zero) Option 9 from the PROPLUS
     menu will simply access the year file for you to view it. It will
     also show you a bar graph of grades to date. Try viewing TEST3 at
     this time. Use <RETURN> to leave the section.

     Now choose option 10. You will be reminded to insert the data
     disk and then asked for a new filename.  Try DEMO4.  Then try
     some of the options that we have already looked at.

     Finally, we reach option 11. Option 11 will bring you back to the
     MASTER MENU. Here, choose G to learn about the GET program. More
     information is found on the next page. Once back at the master
     menu, choose E to end the program. You MAY see: INSERT DISK WITH
     COMMAND.COM. What's this? This is a DOS message that sometimes
     appears when large programs are ended. There is nothing to worry
     about. Your own DOS disk is the disk that is being asked for.
     Insert the DOS DISK at this time and touch any key. At a later
     time, you may use sec. II of the REFERENCE MANUAL to avoid seeing
     this message. However, proceed carefully and do exactly what the
     manual says.

     Once you are back to the DOS, you may put the program and data back
     where they had been just before you ended. Then, follow the screen
     instructions to cause your work to be copied to .EXT files. Try it now
     by following the instructions that had appeared on the screen. NOTE:
     DEMO FILES ARE NOT ACTUALLY SAVED TO THE DISK, SO AT THIS TIME,
     YOU WILL GET AN RESPONSE THAT SAYS FILE NOT FOUND.  When you
     do your own grades, you will not get this response.
---

                      *******************************

                                GET PROGRAM

                      *******************************

     This program IS ON THE UTLITY DISK.

     This program will enable you to quickly print a single grade report
     or a handful of grade reports from a single class WITH A SINGLE
     COMMAND and no menus to access. Let's try it now.

     First, get to the DOS SYSTEM prompt. If necessary, reinsert your
     DOS disk. Then, insert the PROGRADE UTILITY DISK in A: The GET program
     is found on the UTILITY disk, not on the PROGRAM disk!  Be
     certain that your printer is ON line and powered ON. Now type:

                 GET DEMO1 STEVENS SMITH* GRIB

     The program will ask you to insert your data disk. Once this has
     been done, then touch enter.  You will now get a printed grade
     report for STEVENS, for SMITH, and TWO for GRIBLY.  The * causes
     an EXTRA report to be printed.  You may use up to 3 * .  Do not
     use first and last names, just last names; you may use any unique
     portion of a name rather than the entire name (such as GRIB
     instead of GRIBLY), and you may use 0-35 names in any sequence.

                 GET DEMO1 STEV** SMIT GRIBLY*

     would print 3 reports for STEVENS, one for SMITH, and 2 for
     GRIBLY.

                 GET DEMO2

     would print a grade report for each student in the class.

     Do not use more than one filename with the GET program.  Use the
     QUICK program instead.  Also, do not use drive letters before
     the filenames.

     The GET program is best used to print a handful of reports when
     students, parents, or school personnel require "instant" service.

---

                      *******************************

                          NOW.... YOUR OWN GRADES

                      *******************************


     You can now proceed using some of your own grades. Use blank
     formatted disks on which to store your grades. Use some sensible
     precautions in protecting your data, too.  Information on
     protecting your data disks, on setting up files for multiple
     subjects with the same students, on extra credit, and on rounding
     follows in the appendix of this tutorial.

     Set up your own grade files using the main program and examine them
     using the MAIN program and then the QUICK and PROPLUS programs.
     You'll probably be overwhelmed with the amount of information
     that the program can generate.  Learn to use the sections that
     you feel are most useful to you.  And most importantly, use this
     information to HELP students, not to PUNISH them.

     Remember, there are other files on the utility disk that you should
     examine. These files end in .TXT and can be examined using most
     word processors.

                                  APPENDIX

                      ***********************************



                   ABOUT ROUNDING IN THE PROGRADE SYSTEM

     Numbers in the PROGRADE SYSTEM programs must necessarily be
     rounded before they are output to the screen or printer.  This
     can sometimes create confusion.  If a student's grade were
     73.461, for example, it would be rounded on output to 73 if it is
     being output to the closest integer.  That is because the .461 is
     less than .500.  The 73.461 would round to 73.5, however, if the
     result is being output to the closest tenth.  This is as it
     should be, as the .461 should round to .5    The problem occurs
     when the rounded values are compared.  73 vs. 73.5    The correct
     grade, as the program reports, is 73 (rounded to the nearest
     integer).  It is not 74, which would be rounding TWICE.  You can
     rely on the PROGRADE SYSTEM to round properly for you.  DO NOT
     ROUND YOURSELF (such as from 73.5 to 74) UNLESS YOU DO NOT MIND
     ROUNDING TWICE.

                 MULTIPLE SUBJECTS IN THE PROGRADE SYSTEM

     THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO ELEMENTARY
     SCHOOL TEACHERS:


     TEACHERS WHO TEACH MULTIPLE SUBJECTS TO THE SAME STUDENTS can
     still use the PROGRADE SYSTEM to do their grades. There would be
     two essentially different ways to go about this. Be sure to go
     through the TUTORIAL (accessed from the BEGIN program) before
     deciding how to set up your own grades.

     METHOD 1: Make a single class file for your class. Use the BEGIN
     program to set the grade categories for the individual areas,
     such as READING, MATH, SPANISH, and so on. When you enter any
     grades to the grade file, you will specify if it is for the
     READING, MATH, SPANISH (etc.) category.


            ADVANTAGE:  You will have just one file for your class.
                        You can get the averages for each category in
                        several places in the program, including the
                        main program reports section, the QUICK program
                        summary report (easiest for the whole class), or
                        the PROPLUS program grade reports and the PROPLUS
                        program rank students section.

            DISADVANTAGE:  The overall average on the grade and progress
                        reports may not have a significance to you, as it
                        would represent a combination of the different
                        subjects.


     METHOD 2: Make a separate class file FOR EACH SUBJECT MATTER. Use
     the main program to make your first subject matter file, such as
     READING, and then use the PROPLUS program to clone that file,
     making one copy of the file for each of your subject areas, MATH,
     SPANISH, and so on. Then use the BEGIN program to set grade
     categories to areas such as QUIZ, TEST, ORAL WORK, and so on.
     When you enter grades, access the file for the subject matter you
     are grading at the time (READING, SPANISH, MATH, etc.) and when
     you are asked to pick the grade category, use Q for QUIZ, T for
     TEST, and so on.

     IF YOU USE METHOD 2, BE SURE TO USE A SEPARATE DISK FOR EACH
     DIFFERENT SET OF STUDENTS.  (Otherwise, for example, a SPANISH
     file for one class could not be distinguished from a SPANISH file
     for another class of students.)
---

            ADVANTAGE:  You will have more information at your disposal.
                        If you need progress reports just for failures in
                        MATH and SPANISH, for example, then you could
                        do this with the QUICK program. The overall
                        average on the report would be the overall
                        average for that particular subject matter.  If
                        you were to use the QUICK program summary report,
                        the overall average would be shown (for the
                        particular subject); also shown would be all the
                        averages for the different categories (TEST,
                        QUIZ).  Since you can enter up to 10 filenames
                        at once into the QUICK program, your work in
                        getting all the individual subject grades is min-
                        imized.

                        DISADVANTAGE: You will have to make several
                        subject matter files in the first place, and this
                        will take more time. Also, you will need to access
                        the files individually to enter the grades for the
                        different subjects, and this will take more time.
                        However, you will then have A LOT of information
                        at your immediate disposal.

     TEACHERS WHO DO NOT TEACH MULTIPLE SUBJECTS TO THE SAME STUDENTS:
     Simply use a separate class file for each of your classes, and grade
     categories as discussed in the REFERENCE USER'S MANUAL.

             HOW TO ENTER EXTRA CREDIT TO THE PROGRADE SYSTEM


     The purpose of an extra credit grade is to reward a student who has
     done extra work, but NOT to penalize the student that has not. It is
     important to keep this in mind. In order to accomplish this fairly,
     extra credit grades must be entered to any grading system in one of
     two fashions, depending on whether you use WEIGHTED GRADES or
     UNWEIGHTED grades. First, make your decision on the type of grades to
     use. See section XX of the REFERENCE USER MANUAL.

                    EXTRA CREDIT FOR UNWEIGHTED GRADES

     To enter extra credit if you use unweighted grades, simply add an
     assignment that is worth 0 points (enter 0 as the MAX VALUE).
     Then if a student has earned 12 points of extra credit, simply
     enter the 12 as his or her grade.  Thus, the student will have
     12 out of 0.  For example, if this is assignment 4, to give the
     extra credit, type
                             4.12

                         NEW ASSIGNMENT  ?      Y

                         DESCRIPTION            EXTRA CRED

                         CATEGORY               E

                         MAX VALUE              0

     This will not penalize students who have no extra credit, as they
     are expected to have a 0; anything above that is "gravy", as the
     expression goes.  (You may need to explain this to your students
     when they see their grade reports; a student with 0 for extra
     credit is not penalized in ANY WAY.)

     You may enter the assignment to any category at all; however,
     that category will show an increased average for students with
     any extra credit.  You can create an EXTRA CRED category (E) and
     then the other averages will not be directly affected, only the
     overall average.  This is the best approach.

---
                     EXTRA CREDIT FOR WEIGHTED GRADES

     If you use weighted grades, it is IMPERATIVE that you DO NOT
     FOLLOW the above procedures.  The reason for this is that you
     would be PENALIZING students with no extra credit, and LOWERING
     THEIR GRADES.  DO NOT CREATE A SPECIAL CATEGORY FOR EXTRA CREDIT
     if you use weighted grades, or else you will lower some student's
     grades.

     Instead, enter the extra credit INTO ANOTHER ASSIGNMENT'S GRADES.

     For example, if you use weighted grades and a student just earned
     some extra credit, then access some existing assignment's grade
     and add the extra credit to the present value. Let's say that the
     student had gotten 57% on ASSIGNMENT 3, a TEST. Then, to add 12%
     extra credit, simply type

                               3.69

                     CHANGE GRADE ?      Y

     The 69 is the 12 added to the 57.  If a student started with 91
     and earned 12, then simply enter 3.103

     With weighted grades, there is no way to do extra credit without
     changing the average in SOME category.  This is not a function of
     the PROGRADE SYSTEM; it is merely a function of the way the
     weighted system works.

     REMEMBER:  DO NOT CREATE ANY SPECIAL ASSIGNMENTS OR CATEGORIES
     FOR EXTRA CREDIT IF YOU USE WEIGHTED GRADES, OR YOU WILL BE
     PENALIZING STUDENTS WITH NO EXTRA CREDIT.

              A FEW POINTERS ABOUT PROTECTING YOUR DATA DISKS

     Needless to say, your grades are important information, and you
     do not want to damage the disk media that contains your grades.
     With this in mind, you should take several precautionary measures
     to prevent grade loss:

     1.  Frequently print your grades using the report section, part L
     Also, physically copy your grade data disk periodically using DOS
     commands.  Find someone to help you if you are not sure how.
     Your grades are important!

     2.  Use only highest quality disks for data storage.

     3.  Keep your disk drives in clean, optimum operating condition.
     Keep dust and cigarette smoke away from your drives.

     4.  Do not try to overfill the disks with grade data.  It is
     probably best to store only one quarter's grades on each disk.
     Use a new disk for the next quarter.

     5.  Never try to use a data disk that has under 40,000 bytes free
     space left.

     6.  Never remove the data disk until the disk drive light is
     completely out.  If you go "by sound" or try to beat the drives,
     you run an excellent chance of creating cross-linked files that
     would be difficult if not impossible to recover.

     7. Keep your disks away from magnetism (loudspeakers, radios);
     keep your disks away from liquids, dirt, dust, heat, or bending;
     and keep your disks away from the monitor or the computer, except
     for the drives.

     8.  Do not use CTRL-BREAK to terminate any program.  You will
     definitely lose the data you have worked on; you may damage the
     entire disk directory.

     9. Always use the COPY instructions that appear at the end of
     PROGRADE. Use a blank formatted disk for the .EXT copies that
     will be produced.

     10. HARD DRIVE USERS:  Frequently store your grades onto a floppy
     disk.  FREQUENTLY use proper procedures to maintain your hard
     drive, especially CHKDSK and other HARD DRIVE UTILITIES.
