## Information about "CHART"

    If you are an electrical engineer who frequently has to use the Smith
    Chart for impedance and admittance calculations, for characterizing
    transistor parameters, or for creating high frequency matching
    networks,  CHART is the one for you!
    
    Forget the calculators and slide rules. Forget the rulers and triangles
    and manually drawing graphs. The chart is drawn for you on-screen, with
    the numeric results shown on the side.
    
    Help is available throughout the program with examples built in. You can
    even use a mouse if you have one. If you are not using any similar
    program and still do calculations the old way, then CHART is a
    must-have.

Program Description

CHART is an electrical engineering Smith Chart program for characterizing 
transistor parameters, examining transmission lines, creating high frequency 
matching networks, adding impedance and admittance elements, and finding 
reflection coefficient and VSWR information.  CHART supports Microsoft and 
compatable 2 and 3 button mice and has limited printer support -- Epson FX80 
and IBM Proprinter support only.  CHART requires a 256K EGA card (or VGA 
equivalent) but has primitive support for the occasional CGA user.  A 640K+ 
AT or 386 machine is suggested.  The user may customize options and save 
them in a configuration file.
