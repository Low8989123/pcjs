## Information about "AGGRAVATION"

    At last, the PC has its own version of that old favorite board game,
    Aggravation.  This is the same game that you played as a kid in summer
    camp or at the dining room table with the family.  Play with up to three
    others or challenge the computer -- you still get your markers sent back
    to the Start.  Play is fast, the computer rolls the dice and you can
    always reach your men.  The only thing missing is that little grin on
    your older sister's face as she sweetly inquires if you want to play
    again?
