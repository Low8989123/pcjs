## Information about "FOURSOME GENERATOR"

    FOURSOME GENERATOR automatically calculates foursomes (teams of four)
    for golf tournaments based upon their handicaps. The program allows you
    to keep a running roster of members eligible to play, including address,
    phone number, and handicap.  Information can be updated at any time.
    From the roster you mark those who are going to play in a tournament.
    FOURSOME GENERATOR generates foursomes so all teams will have an equal
    or almost equal handicap total.  Other options include:
    
    ~ Link players who want to play together while maintaining equal
    foursomes
    
    ~ Produce mixed foursomes (male and female pairing)
    
    ~ Up to 24 trial calculations (no repeats if same players
    participate week after week)
    
    ~ Generate low/high foursomes
    
    ~ Generate random foursomes
    
    ~ Players can be ranked in four different groupings
    
    ~ Tee times generated automatically
    
    ~ Sort roster on any field
    
    ~ Print address labels and print reports to printer, disk, or screen.

             of the player's names are used to record corresponding
             handicaps, and to indicate if the player should be included in
             the computed foursomes.  On the right of the screen is a list
             of valid function keys and cursor movement and editing keys.

             CALCULATING FOURSOMES

                    After you have marked which players are participating in
                    the tournament, you are ready to compute foursomes.

                    To compute, press Function key F2.  A window will pop
                    up.  You must choose which mode to use in calculating
                    the Foursomes.  Normal mode calculates foursomes with
                    total group handicaps as close as possible for each
                    foursome.  Use the scramble modes to reduce repetition
                    of foursomes if the same players play together week
                    after week. Each scramble mode scrambles the foursomes
                    in a different way.  Note that the scramble modes are
                    less accurate in calculating equal foursomes.

                    After selecting a calculation mode choose to send the
                    results to either the printer, or the screen.

                    FOURSOME GENERATOR begins computing foursomes.
                    The number of foursomes computed is the number of
                    participants, divided by four rounded down to the
                    nearest whole number.

                    40 players in tournament  40/4 = 10 foursomes

                    41 players in tournament  41/4 = 10.25
                                      rounded down = 10 foursomes
                                                      1 player left out

                    42 players in tournament  42/4 = 10.5
                                      rounded down = 10 foursomes
                                                      2 players left out

                    FOURSOME GENERATOR notifies you of any left over
                    player(s) which are not included in a foursome.




             SAVING and LOADING A FILE

                  To save or load a file press F3 and choose the load or
             save option.  The file screen will then appear.  With the file
             screen you can specify the name of the file to load or save,
             and also the drive and directory the file should be saved on or
             retrieved from.  The current drive, subdirectory, and directory
             of files is always displayed on the screen.  Files are
             displayed in lowercase letters and subdirectories in uppercase
             letters inclosed by <>.  You can list directories on any drive
             or subdirectory by doing the following.

             Let's say you want to list the directory on the A drive.  Type
             the following and press ENTER --- A: To list directories on the
             B or C drive, type --- B: or C: If you are using a fixed disk
             and want to see a subdirectory, type --- C:\SUBDIR You can also
             look at directories under multiply paths too. --C:
             \SUBDIR1\SUBDIR2\SUBDIR3\



                                     Page 6





             A simple way to move through subdirectories is to use the arrow
             keys to move the highlight bar down into the text directory.
             Select the subdirectory to move to by pressing ENTER when over
             the directory you want to move to.  If you are already in a
             subdirectory and want to move to the "parent" directory
             highlight either <.> or <..> and press ENTER.


             SAVING ---

                  To save a file type the name, including whatever extension
             you want, and press ENTER.  You can give your file any name as
             long as the following applies.

             1. File name can be no longer then eight characters.
             2. Only A-Z and 0-9 are valid characters.

             If the file you want to save already exists on disk you can
             move the highlight bar down with the arrow keys and press ENTER
             when over the file name to save.


             LOADING ---

                  Whenever you want to add or delete names, update
             handicaps, or compute foursomes just load your previously
             created file into computer memory.  To do this, either type the
             name or move the highlight bar to the file and select it.


             Any time you need to exit the file screen press ESC.



             PRINTING THE ROSTER

                  To print your roster press Function key F4.   A window
                  will then pop up.

                  Before you start printing, make sure --

                   1.  The printer is on.
                   2.  The paper is set to top of form.  The program is
                       set to jump over the perforation of each page.
                   3.  Pressing ESC pauses printing until you choose to
                       resume or abort.

                          BACKING UP YOUR PROGRAM DISK


             It is important to make a backup of your program disk in case
             the original copy is damaged.  To do this, follow the steps
             below.


             Get  1. Your DOS disk
                  2. Your master Program disk
                  3. A blank floppy disk


             Place the DOS diskette in floppy disk drive A.

             If something else besides " A> " appears on the screen, such as
             C> then type    A:   followed by ENTER.  A> should then appear.

             At A> prompt type   DISKCOPY A: A:

             The following message will appear ---Insert source disk into
                           drive A: Press any key when ready

             Remove the DOS disk and place the master Program disk in drive
             A and press any key.

             After a while the following message will appear ---Insert
                           target disk into drive A: Press any key when
                           ready

             Place the blank floppy disk in drive A and press any key.  When
             the disk drive stops turning, your backup is complete.  Place
             the master copy in a safe place and use the backup copy from
             now on.

                                   APPENDIX B

             ONE FLOPPY DRIVE SETUP

                  To run FOURSOME GENERATOR using a one floppy drive system
                  you need the following.

                  1. Program Disk
                  2. Data Disk (Blank formatted disk) If you do not have a
                     blank formatted disk, you need to format one.  See the
                     FORMAT command in your DOS manual.

                  1. Place the Program diskette in drive A.

                     At A> prompt type   FG    followed by ENTER

                  2. After the program has been loaded, remove the program
                     disk from drive A and replace with your Data disk.

                     All the Data files you create, load and save will be
                     placed on your Data disk.



             TWO FLOPPY DRIVE SETUP

                  To run FOURSOME GENERATOR using a two floppy drive system
                  you need the following.

                  1. Program Disk
                  2. Data Disk (Blank formatted disk) If you do not have a
                     blank formatted disk, you need to format one.  See the
                     FORMAT command in your DOS manual.

                     Place the Program diskette in drive B and Data Diskette
                     in drive A.  If something else besides "A>" appears on
                     the screen, such as B> type--  A: followed by ENTER

                     At A> prompt type   B:FG    followed by ENTER

                     All the files you create, load and save will be placed
                     on your Data disk in drive A.

                                   APPENDIX C


             HARD-DISK SETUP


             If your computer has a hard disk drive, you'll probably want to
             put the FOURSOME GENERATOR Program and Data files on the hard
             disk.

             The following steps assume that your hard disk is drive "C:",
             your floppy disk drive is "A:", and that you want to put the
             Programs and data files into a subdirectory on the hard disk
             called "GOLF".  You can modify this example to match your own
             requirements.

             1.  "Boot up" your system from the hard disk.  You should see
                  DOS prompt ("C>" or something similar) on your screen.

             2.  Make a subdirectory to hold the Program and data files:
                 Type--

                            MD  \GOLF

             3.  Place the Program diskette in the "A:" drive.

             4.  Copy everything from the "A:" drive into the GOLF
                 subdirectory on your "C:" drive:  Type--

                            COPY A:*.*  C:\GOLF

             5.  Now that you've set up your GOLF subdirectory, you should
                 store the program distribution diskette in a safe place.

                 Whenever you want to run the FOURSOME GENERATOR Program,
                 just perform the following steps after booting up DOS.

                  1.   Change Directories (get into the GOLF Program
                       subdirectory): At C> type --

                              CD  \GOLF

                  2.   Then enter the name of the program   FG  when you
                       want to run it.

                              FG    followed by <ENTER>


                  3.   The program will be loaded into memory and you are
                       ready to go.

Author Version: 3.00
Author Registration: $39.00
Special Requirements: None.

FOURSOME GENERATOR is a program which automatically calculates
foursomes (teams of four) for golf tournaments based upon their
handicaps.  This program allows you to keep a running roster of members
eligible to play, and up to 500 people can be entered on each list.
Separate lists may be saved to disk.  You can edit and update the names
and handicap numbers at any time, and the program lets you define the
range for the handicap numbers.

Once the names are entered, the program can sort the list
alphabetically.  From a list of names you can mark the names of those
people who are going to play in a foursomes tournament.  The program
then quickly generates foursomes so all teams will an equal or almost
equal handicap total.  This program allows you to aproduce a printout of
the entire player listing or a printout of the calculated foursomes.
