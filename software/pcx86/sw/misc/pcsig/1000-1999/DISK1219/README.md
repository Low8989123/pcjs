## Information about "DIRECTOR"

    Highly recommended by Dr. Filefinder, this DOS shell and menu system
    will speed and ease all your program, file, and directory management
    tasks. The commands are logically presented on the menus and can also
    be accessed by the function and control keys. The mouse integration is
    so seamless that you can copy or move directories or files without a
    keystroke.
    
    The four main modules are DL, DB, DA, and DM. DL gives you a pictorial
    view of a directory tree, highlighting the current directory. Want to
    move to a different directory? Cursor to it or simply type a few
    letters. DL will take you to the directory as you type. While in the
    directory view, mark selected directories for copying, moving, or
    removing. Make, hide and unhide, and rename directories as well as
    change drives, search for files and print a copy of the tree.
    Highlighting any directory and pressing Enter will show you a sorted
    list of the files in that directory. From the file view,
    edit, view, copy, rename, change attributes, print, and resort any group
    of files. Run any program or batch file. DL can now handle drives with
    up to 500 directories and up to 1000 files per directory.
    
    File viewers included with this version are:
    
    ~  Lotus 123, Quattro, Symphony and compatible spreadsheets.
    ~  Wordperfect version 5 and greater files.
    ~  dBase, FoxBase, FoxPro, Clipper, Quicksilver and compatible DBF files
    ~  WordStar version 4 and greater files.
    ~  Microsoft Word.
    ~  Window Write.
    ~  Word fo Windows.
    ~  PCX pictures.
    
    DB lets you sort and move your files with uncanny ease. Sort your
    files by filename, file size, modification date, and file extension.
    Move files from one directory to another with ease. The function keys
    are used to delete, rename and mark files. A special menu lets you
    print file lists or contents, change attributes, show disk usage, or
    get program information about DB.
    
    DB is a stripped down version of DL -- it gives you all the functions
    of DL, but only for a single directory. DB gives you a sorted file
    list for any directory. Pathnames, file specifications, and sort
    parameters can be added to the command line. Moving around a file list
    is a snap. Type the first letter of the file and the bar highlights it.
    Mark files for copying and when it's done, DB unmarks them to let you
    know they have been copied.
    
    DA scans an entire drive and produces a listing of all the files on
    that drive. Add the files of additional drives to the view. In
    addition to the standard copy, etc., commands, DA will also show
    duplicate files, and write ASCII or .DBF files of the file list.
    
    DM is a full-featured hard disk menu. Add up to 20 entries to the main
    menu with unlimited submenus of up to 19 entries each. DM can be run
    from the command line or also popped up in DL or DB. When running DM
    from DL, run programs and add the highlighted or marked files from DL
    and DB to the command line. In this manner you can also use DM to run
