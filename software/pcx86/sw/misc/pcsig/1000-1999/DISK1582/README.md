## Information about "SALES TOOLS"

    If you are looking for a dBase program that keeps track of your sales
    calls, appointments and expenses, try SALES TOOLS. This program is a
    detailed sales management application that can be used as is with your
    copy of dBase II, dBase III, or dBXL, or (if you know how to program in
    dBase) the template can be customized to fit the unique needs of your
    particular business. Good screen layouts and logical program design
    make this program useful.
    
    SALES TOOLS provides menu items that, when selected, perform the
    desired function.
    
    All creation, deletion, and editing functions, as well as reports,
    address labels, and appointment functions can be retrieved from
    within the database manager.
