## Information about "GARDEN CITY SOFTWARE COLLECTION #1"

    Psychologists tell us that watching fish can reduce stress. They don't
    understand what a $150.00 fish, belly-up in the tank, can do to your
    blood pressure. Instead, try electronic fish. Not a game, FISHTANK is
    a soothing alternative to pet care and maintenance. With proper
    voltage, your fish will live forever. You get all the accessories
    complete with a snail and eel.
    
    History buffs will love HIST-PAL, a simple timeline database that gives
    the years of birth and death, the occupations, and noted quotes ("Let
    them eat cake!") of over five hundred famous people. With a word
    processor you can add to the time line. Want to be among the "Rich and
    Famous"? Just drop yourself into this electronic "Who's Who" to impress
    your friends and enemies alike.
