## Information about "CMOS-RAM/CHEKCMOS"

    Eventually the batteries in your AT will run out!  What happens then,
    you ask?  Well, your computer just won't boot up.  CMOS_RAM is the
    closest thing to having AT insurance.  It stores all battery maintained
    information on a disk file then allows you to easily restore it once
    you've replaced your battery.
    
    Not only the date and time depend on charged batteries, vital system
    configuration information is also held in CMOS RAM by battery power.
    Your computer is lost without it.  This program keeps a record of all
    that information.  It should be run, then stored away on floppy disk
    until the inevitable day comes when you need it.  On that day you won't
    have to panic or hire a technician.  You'll just slip this diskette in
    your A drive, boot your computer from floppy, type CMOS_RAM, press
    return, and after a short but delightful introductory screen the program
    will let you restore your CMOS RAM information from a disk file.
    
    This program also comes with a lookout utility that keeps an eye on your
    configuration file.  If you ever change your configuration, it will
    prompt you to update your CMOS RAM backup.  This lookout utility, called
    CHEKMOS, is also smart enough to watch your battery voltage and alert
    you if it starts to fade.
