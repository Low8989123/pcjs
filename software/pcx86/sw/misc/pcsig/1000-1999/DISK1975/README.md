## Information about "PC-SUPERMENU PLUS DISK 1 OF 2 (1976 ALSO"

    SUPERMENU PLUS allows users to group programs by program functions
    rather than by the drive directories.  Special libraries may be created
    for word processing, database, finance, DOS functions, CADD, graphics,
    etc.  Up to 25 program libraries consisting of 9 programs each may be
    created and read by the SUPERMENU system.
    
    The system is designed for the inexperienced user.  It is 100%
    menu-driven and requires little instruction to set up.  SUPERMENU may be
    operated from any floppy or hard drive and can access up to 225

SUPERMENU consists of three routines and up to 25 program libraries,    
however, only the SUPERMENU system and its library menus need be present
to operate.  The MENUMAKER and CONFILE utilities may be located on      
another drive or floppy disk that is only loaded as needed.  A desirable
feature for users with limited disk space.
