## Information about "FILE-MAN (FORMERLY SUPERDIR 210)"

    FILE-MAN is a menu-driven utility program that aids in managing disk
    files.  Directory and file names are displayed in sorted order.  File
    names can be sorted by name, extension, date or size.  Single files or
    file groups may be quickly marked and acted upon.  Actions include
    copy, move, spawn, append, erase, rename, change attribute status,
    display, print and locate.  Features include macro execution, color
    display, directory tree, disk labels and a utility option that allows
    extensive customization.
    
    FILE-MAN runs up to 18 user-entered macros.  The program supports a PC
    mouse and includes an on-disk a manual of over 120 pages.
