## Information about "MARK RECORD PLUS 1 OF 2 (ALSO 2310)"

    MARK RECORD PLUS allows teachers to harness the power of their PCs to
    avoid much of the drudgery involved in calculating and recording their
    students' marks.
    
    MARK RECORD PLUS can handle up to 50 students per course and up to 50
    grades per student.  Reports can be generated using either the
    students' real names or their aliases (for privacy).  Any combination
    of reports such as student ranking, weighted marks, and distribution
    curves can be printed or saved to disk.  The teacher can easily
    generate bar graphs for visual representations.  Includes 17 page on-
    disk guide.
