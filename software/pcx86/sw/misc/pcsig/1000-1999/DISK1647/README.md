## Information about "LEARN IBR HEATLOSS"

    Now there's a way to figure out where all your heat is seeping on those
    cold winter nights.  Or if you're about to build -- this program may
    help keep your future home toasty warm.  For the homeowner or heating
    professional who understands a little about heating, this program can be
    used to calculate heat loss.
    
    The IBR HEAT LOSS program asks a series of questions.  The first
    questions pertain to conditions the house will be exposed to at the
    coldest time of year.  Then questions are asked which will determine the
    dimensions of a specific room.  Further questions are asked in order to
    determine the size of openings in walls exposed to the outdoors.
    Answers to the final questions are used to derive the actual amount of
    heat that will flow through the room.
    
    If help is required, pressing Alt and Period together will pop up an in-
    memory screen to provide more information.  As the operator answers heat
    flow questions, the heat losses through the walls, ceiling, floor, or
    openings appear.  The room's total loss appears below the answers.  A
    copy of the room's loss may be kept using the DOS printscreen keys.
