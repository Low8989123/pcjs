      1d - USING THE DEMO ACCOUNTS 

      Included  at no  extra cost  with the  "Payroll" module,  is a  set of
      sample/demo accounts  for practice use.   On your disk are  some files
      with the  name of "WORK".   In order to  use these demo  files, simply
      copy all of  the "WORK.*" files onto  a blank disk to be  used as your
      demo disk.   When starting up FINANCE  MANAGER, use this disk  as your
      data disk and put it in the appropriate disk drive (usually B:).  When
      FINANCE MANAGER asks you for the  File name, enter "WORK".  The use of
      these demo files will very likely get you going faster and help you to
      use this module to your best advantage. 

      It is important to remember that you  do not use these demo files when
      you are  setting up  your own  live data,  since demo  files obviously
      contain existing practice-only data and  demo employees.  Setting up a
      new "live"  set of books,  however, is  very simple and  is thoroughly
      described in the following section. 

      1e - RUNNING THE PAYROLL MODULE 

      To run  the "Payroll" module, you  must first install it  by following
      the instructions  under "Installing  FINANCE MANAGER" in  the "Getting
      Started" Manual.   After it is  installed, follow the simple  steps in
      the order given below: 

      1.   Start up  FINANCE MANAGER  per the  instructions in  the "Getting
           Started" manual.  Upon starting  FINANCE MANAGER, you must decide
           to use either  live data or the practice-only  demo accounts data
           on  the Payroll  Documentation &  Demo  disk.  If  you prefer  to
           practice  and experiment,  you should  remember to  use the  Demo
           disk.  If  you wish to set  up your own live  Payroll, you should
           put your FINANCE  MANAGER General Ledger data disk  in your drive
           B: (not necessary if you have a hard disk).

      2.   At the disk  drive prompt, enter the disk drive  letter where you
           put your Demo  or G/L data disk,  usually drive B: (or  C: if you
           have a hard disk). 

      3.   At the Enter Filename prompt, enter the name of the data file you
           want to use ("WORK" if you have  the demo disk in drive B:, or if
           you are using your live G/L data files enter the filename you are
           using for your live data). 

           Remember, you can only use this module if you have previously set
           up  your  General Ledger  data  files  using the  General  Ledger
           module.  When  using the demo  data files, this has  already been
           done for you. 

      4.   You will now be at the FINANCE MANAGER Master Menu. 

      5.   OPTIONAL: If you have  not already done so (when you  set up your
                     G/L data  files), you  may go  to the  System Utilities
                     Menu  and  change  any   system  defaults.   This  may,
                     however, be  done at any  time and is not  necessary to
                     run FINANCE  MANAGER.  We do, however,  suggest you set
                     up  the "Compressed"  and "Normal"  print codes  before
                     printing the Payroll reports, since you will find it is
                     required for a few of them. 




                                       Page 6
                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll



      6.   Next you must  add several accounts to your  General Ledger Chart
           of Accounts.  See section 7a for details.  These G/L accounts are
           required  to use  the Payroll  module.  See  your General  Ledger
           documentation manual  on setting up  your Chart of  Accounts.  If
           you have  these accounts  already set up  in your  General Ledger
           Chart of Accounts, this step is not necessary. 

      7.   From the FINANCE  MANAGER master menu: If you  have floppy disks,
           put your  Payroll program  disk into  drive A:  (if you  have not
           already done so).  Then select menu  "F5", and this will take you
           into Payroll.   If this is the  first time you are  using Payroll
           for this set of books, the  system will ask you: "Create new file
           (Y/N):_", which  you should  answer with  a "Y".   This procedure
           will create all the necessary Payroll data files.  Don't worry it
           will not damage your General Ledger data files. 

      8.   From the Payroll  main menu select "F6", and then  "F4", in order
           to  set up  your Payroll  configuration settings.   This step  is
           important since  it will set  up the interface with  your General
           Ledger Chart of Accounts.  See section 7a for details. 

      9.   Return to the  Payroll Utilities menu and select "F5",  to set up
           your tax tables.  These tax  tables will calculate federal, state
           and city taxes  as well as Earned Income Credit.   See section 7d
           for details. 

      10.  Return to  the Payroll main menu  and select "F4" to  set up your
           employees.  See section 3 on employee accounts. 

      11.  After  setting  up your  employees,  you  may print  an  employee
           listing report.  See section 5 on reports. 

      12.  Return  to  the  Payroll  main  menu and  select  "F1"  to  input
           transactions.  See section 4 on transactions. 

      13.  After you have entered some transactions, you may print a Payroll
           Register report  (select "F2" from  the Payroll Reports menu)  to
           see what you have entered.  See section 5 on reports. 

      14.  Print any other reports as required.  The most useful reports are
           "PAYROLL REGISTER" and the "PAID PAYROLL RECAP". 

      These basic steps are merely intended  to show you the order of events
      in setting up new Payroll books.

                        SECTION TWO - THE PAYROLL MAIN MENU 

      The Payroll  Main Menu is  the starting point  for all of  the various
      Payroll  functions.  It  is  a sort  of "Table  of  Contents" for  the
      Payroll module.  It can guide you to all of the other useful sub-menus
      and practical features of the time and money-saving Payroll module. 

      The Payroll Main Menu appears as follows: 

                     ----------- PAYROLL MAIN MENU ---------- 
                     |                                      | 
                     |   ESC  Return to Master Menu         | 
                     |   F1   Input TRANSACTIONS            | 
                     |   F2   CHANGE/Delete Transactions    | 
                     |   F3   REPORTS Menu                  | 
                     |   F4   Update EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS      | 
                     |   F5   Payroll Checks Menu           | 
                     |   F6   Payroll Utility Menu          | 
                     |                                      | 
                     |                                      | 
                     |                                      | 
                     |                                      | 
                     |   ENTER YOUR SELECTION:              | 
                     |   Payroll configuration not set up   | 
                     ---------------------------------------- 


      Note that  many of the  selections are used to  go on to  other menus.
      All of  the menu selections  are discussed  in later sections  in this
      documentation.   If  you get  a  message,  as above,  saying  "Payroll
      configuration not set up" or "Tax Tables not set up" you should set up
      these configurations  by selecting  "F6", "PAYROLL UTILITIES  MENU" to
      set these items up.  For clarification, these procedures are discussed
      in Section Seven. 


      As  mentioned   above,  it   is  essential  that   you  set   up  your
      configuration.   Jump to  Section 7a  to complete  that easy-to-follow
      procedure before continuing. 

      The next  step is to  set up  your employee accounts.   This procedure
      follows in Section Three.

                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll


                         SECTION THREE - EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS 

      Your Employee Accounts are the foundation of your Payroll.  To set up,
      or to change your employees, select "F4 Update EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS" from
      the Payroll main menu. 

      3a - WHAT ARE EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS 

      Your  employee  accounts  are  used  to keep  track  of  all  of  your
      employees, their address, overtime, holiday, sick leave, the amount of
      time they  worked, Pay frequency,  deductions and liabilities.   It is
      important to remember that any person  that is drawing a paycheck from
      you, should be set up as an employee. 

      Whenever you hire a  new employee, you must set up  this new person in
      the employee  accounts.  WHEN  YOU ENTER A  NEW EMPLOYEE  INTO FINANCE
      MANAGER HAVE THE EMPLOYEES COMPLETED W-4  FORM NEXT TO YOU, AS MOST OF
      THE INFORMATION YOU WILL ENTER  WILL COME DIRECTLY FROM THE EMPLOYEE'S
      W-4  FORM.  Each  employee must  be  given a  unique employee  account
      number,  which can  be any  alphanumeric input  up to  four characters
      long.  This account number will then be used whenever you are entering
      transactions for that employee. 


      3b - EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS ORGANIZATION 

      Your employee account numbers, and their order within the program, are
      totally up to you. 

      An important  consideration for  your employee  account numbers  is to
      group  your employees  into  account number  ranges  or in  alphabetic
      order.  For example, give all of  your employees who work in shipping,
      account numbers 9000-9999.  This may  be useful when printing reports.
      Remember to  always leave  enough room  for new  accounts to  be added
      within your selected range. 


      3c - EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS DATA FIELDS 

      Each account number in your  employee database represents one specific
      employee.   Along with  this employee  account number  are kept  other
      elements  of information  about  each employee.   When  setting up  an
      employee account, the following information will be needed: 

      EMPLOYEE NUMBER     An alphanumeric  input up to four  characters used
                          to identify each employee.  This can be any number
                          or group of letters or a combination of the two. 

      ACTIVE              Enter "Y" if the employee is currently working for
                          you  or "N"  if  he is  not and  you  do not  want
                          FINANCE MANAGER to continue to update his file. 

      NAME                Enter the  employee's full name (how  it is listed
                          on his W-4 form).  We  suggest that you enter last
                          name, comma (,), first name.  FINANCE MANAGER will
                          reverse the employee's  name when printing labels,
                          checks or  W-2s.  If  you do not  put a  comma (,)
                          between last and first  names, the employee's name
                          will be printed as input.

      ADDRESS             Enter  employee's address.   This address  is used
                          when printing  address labels,  employee paychecks
                          and W-2s. 

      ADDRESS             Enter second address line if any.

      accounts.   Changing and  deleting employee  accounts is  described in
      easy to follow lay mans terms in the following sections. 

      1. From the Payroll Main Menu select  "F4" on the menu.  You will then
         be prompted for the following information: 

      Employee Num:____ Active(Y/N):_  Social Security Number:_____________

      3e - ENTERING YOUR OWN EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS 

      When you actually enter your own employee accounts, it would be a good
      idea to collate your employees into some kind of logical order in your
      mind.  This will be  helpful to you later, each time  you need to look
      up employees by account number. 

      In order  to enter employee accounts  switch to your live  data files.
      To do  this, simply return to  the FINANCE MANAGER Master  Menu (press
      the ESC key  until you are there).   When you are at  the Master Menu,
      enter one  more ESC.   The program  will then prompt  "DO YOU  WANT TO
      RESTART (Y/N):_" enter "Y". 

      At this point (if you have your  data on floppy disks) switch from the
      Doc and Demo disk to your  live G/L data diskette.  Select your "real"
      data file  name.  From the Master  Main Menu select "F5".   The system
      should tell you that it did not find your Payroll files.  Enter "Y" at
      the "Create  new Files"  prompt.  From the  Payroll main  menu, select
      "F4" and you will be ready to enter your employee accounts. 

      1.   At  the  input screen,  the  cursor  will  be positioned  at  the
           employee account number field.  Unless you are entering your very
           first employee  account number, there  should be default  data in
           this field. 

      2.   Instead of using the default data  (if any), enter a new employee
           account number of your choice.   The step by step input procedure
           for an example employee account is as follows:

      39.  After you have  entered the data in the Accrual  Rates field, the
           message "Change Beginning Balance  Data (Y/N):_" will appear.  If
           you answer with a "N" Finance Manager will continue to item 41. 

      40.  If you answer "Y" Finance Manager  will display on the lower half
           of the screen the following: 


      EMPLOYEE BEGINNING BALANCE: 
      Earnings taxable    :0_________  FICA  :0_________ Extra Deduct  :0___ 
      Earnings Non-taxable:0_________  FUTA  :0_________ 
      Withholdings Federal:0_________  SUTA  :0_________ 
      Withholdings State  :0_________  SDI   :0_________ Vacation Hours:0___ 
      Withholdings City   :0_________  Oth Tx:0_________ Sick Hours    :0___ 


      41.  Enter  any   preexisting  employee  balances.    These  beginning
           balances will show on your year-to-date reports and W-2. 

           NOTE: Another  alternative is  to  enter individual  transactions
                 broken  down by  pay periods  for each  employee, and  then
                 enter manual  checks to pay these  transactions.  Make sure
                 that you delete any preexisting payroll transactions in the
                 General Ledger.  You do not want to have these transactions
                 listed twice.   It is always  best to start this  module at
                 the beginning of the year to avoid any confusion. 


      42.  Once all  of the data has  been entered correctly, answer  "Y" at
           the "Are  inputs correct(Y/N):_"  prompt.  If  you answer  with a
           "N", the  cursor will  return to the  Employee Number  prompt and
           previous input will be ignored. 


      43.  If you answered with a "Y", the new employee account is added and
           you will automatically return to the employee number prompt.  You
           are then ready for more input. 

           NOTE: Please note that the employee number you have just added is
                 automatically added to the "pop  up" window which lists all
                 accounts.  Use the cursor keys (when at the employee number
                 field),  in order  to  scroll through  the active  employee

                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll


                 accounts to search for the account you have just added.  If
                 you   have   added   your  account   correctly,   it   will
                 automatically be in order within this list.  The list reads
                 from left to right. 


      44.  The  cursor will  once again  be  at the  employee number  field.
           Repeat steps  2-41 until you  have finished entering all  of your
           employees. 


      45.  Make sure you answer the prompt "Are inputs correct (Y/N):_" with
           a "Y" to save your inputs before pressing the ESC key.  Otherwise
           all of the data  you just entered will be lost  and you will have
           to re-enter it.   To leave the current input field  and return to
           the previous menu simply press the ESC key. 


      3f - CHANGING EXISTING EMPLOYEES 

      The  steps below  outline the  procedure  for making  changes to  your
      existing employee accounts. 

      1.   Select "F4" at the Payroll main menu. 

      2.   With  the cursor  at  the  employee number  prompt,  type in  the
           account number  you wish to  change.  If  you wish to  accept the
           default account press ENTER.  To choose a different account, move
           the highlighted pointer through the  account list that appears on
           the screen by using the up and down keypad arrows. 

      3.   Because  the  account number  you  have  entered is  an  existing
           employee number, the system prompts: 


                    ACTIVE ACCOUNT Modify/Delete/Quit(M/D/Q):_ 


           Answer this prompt with "M".  You are now in the change mode. 

      4.   Make any desired changes the existing  data, but you are not able
           to change  the account  number.  Press ENTER  to leave  any field
           unchanged. 

      5.   If you want to go back to a previous field while you are changing
           data, you may do so by pressing the Backspace key. 

      6.   After you make the necessary changes to your data, press ENTER or
           the  PgDn  key  until  the system  prompts  "Are  inputs  correct
           (Y/N):_".  Type  "Y" to save your  changes.  If you enter  a "N",
           the system will ignore all changes  and the cursor will return to
           the account number field. 


      3g - DELETING EMPLOYEES 

      When deleting  employees, there  cannot be  any transactions  for that
      employee  number.  If  there are  transactions for  the account  to be
      deleted, FINANCE MANAGER will not allow the account to be deleted. 



                                       Page 17
                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll



      Be sure  to practice deleting accounts  on your demo WORK  file before
      you delete a "real" employee from your "real" data files. 

      To delete an employee account follow the steps below: 

      1.   Select "F4" at the Payroll main menu. 

      2.   Then enter the  number of the account to be  deleted while at the
           employee account number prompt.  The system will then prompt: 


                    ACTIVE ACCOUNT Modify/Delete/Quit(M/D/Q):_ 


      3.  Select "D".  The system will prompt  you "Are you sure (Y/N):_" If
          you answer with "Y" the account will then be deleted. 


      3h - SUGGESTED METHOD FOR SETTING BEGINNING BALANCES 

      When setting up your Payroll,  as well as employee beginning balances,
      you must  be sure that  you are in  balance with your  General Ledger.
      This is a vitally important procedure to remember when setting up your
      books.  The following steps will insure that you are in balance: 

      1.   Set up all  your employee accounts with a  zero beginning balance
           first. 

      2.   You then have two options to enter any prior payroll balance: 

      3.   You  may  enter them  in  the  Employee Beginning  Balance  input
           fields.  These  balances will  then show  as a  lump sum  on your
           year-to-date  Payroll  Register  report  and W-2s.   If  you  are
           starting a new accounting year  and have preexisting vacation and
           sick leave  balances we recommend  for those  to be entered  as a
           total sum in there corresponding fields. 

      4.   Or you may enter them as individual transactions (see section 4),
           broken down by prior pay periods for each employee.  We recommend
           entering   all  your   prior  payroll   balances  as   individual
           transactions.  Then  enter manual checks to  pay all transactions
           just  entered.   As these  transactions  will  be posted  to  the
           General  Ledger  you should  ensure  that  you have  removed  any
           previously entered G/L transactions to avoid duplicate data. 

      5.   After  all   beginning  balances  have  been   entered,  print  a
           year-to-date  (Jan-Dec) Payroll  Register  report  to verify  all
           current  employee  balances for  your  selected  pay period.   To
           verify the correct balances for  sick leave and holiday print the
           Vacation & Sick Report. 

      6.   After you  have verified all account  balances you are now  up to
           date  and fully  operational.  If  you want  your General  Ledger
           Payroll account  to reflect the  current balances of  all Payroll
           accounts, you should go to the Payroll Utility main menu and post
           the  transactions to  the  General Ledger.   See  section 7c  for
           detailed information. 

           Note: Make  sure   that  you   delete  any   preexisting  payroll

                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll


                 transactions in  the General  Ledger, so  they will  not be
                 listed twice.

                            SECTION FOUR - TRANSACTIONS 

      4a - WHAT ARE TRANSACTIONS 

      One transaction should  be entered into the payroll system  at the end
      of each pay period.  Each entered  transactions will become a check to
      the  employee when  paid.  Thus  only enter  one transaction  for each
      payroll check needed. 


      4b - TRANSACTION DATA FIELDS 

      The  transaction input  fields  are described  below.   Each of  these
      fields has a  default which is the last data  entered into that field.
      This default saves keystrokes when doing repetitive inputting. 

      EMPLOYEE NUMBER     This is  the account  number for the  employee for
                          which you  are entering a transaction.   Note that
                          the employee's name will automatically appear when
                          an active account number is entered as well as the
                          frequency of the employee's pay.  REQUIRED. 


      PAY PERIOD ENDING   This is  the last day  of the pay period)  not the
                          date on the check).  REQUIRED. 


      HOURS PAID          These are  the total number of  hours for regular,
                          overtime, sick, vacation  or holiday, the employee
                          will  be paid  for this  pay period.   Notice that
                          Finance Manager  will automatically  calculate the
                          number of  regular hours  paid for  each employee.
                          REQUIRED, HOURLY EMPLOYEES ONLY. 


      OTHER EARNINGS 1&2  These  input   fields  would  include   any  other
                          compensation the employee  receives (car allowance
                          etc.) If  this compensation should be  taxed enter
                          "Y" in the  following "Taxable(Y/N)" field.  Enter
                          "N" if this compensation  should not be taxed.  If
                          "N" is selected these amounts WILL NOT be shown on
                          the employees W-2.  OPTIONAL 

      OTHER DEDUCTION     This  deduction  can  be  used  for  miscellaneous
                          deductions from  the employees paycheck.   If this
                          deduction  should  be  taxed   enter  "Y"  in  the
                          following "Taxable(Y/N)" field.  Enter "N" if this
                          deduction should not be taxed.  These amounts WILL
                          be  shown   in  box  10  of   the  employees  W-2.
                          OPTIONAL. 

      ACCOUNT             The "Account"  field allows you to  select the G/L
                          account  number to  which the  Other Earnings  and
                          Other Deduction amount fields correspond (e.g. for
                          a car  allowance other  earnings you  would select
                          your   G/L   car   allowance   expense   account).
                          OPTIONAL.

      4c - GETTING FAMILIAR WITH TRANSACTIONS 

      Before entering your "real" transactions, follow the procedures listed
      below by practicing with the WORK demo accounts.  This will aid you in
      learning how to enter transactions without using live data. 

      1.   From  the  Payroll Main  Menu  select  "F1".   You will  then  be
           prompted for the following information: 

      Employee Number   :_____ 
      Pay Period Ending :__-__-__ 
      HOURS PAID:Regular:_______Overtime:_______Sick:_______Vacation:_______ 
                 Holiday:_______                         TOTAL HOURS:    

      Other Earnings 1:__________ Taxable(Y/N):_ Account:____ 
      Other Earnings 2:__________ Taxable(Y/N):_ Account:____ 
      Other Deduction :__________ Taxable(Y/N):_ Account:____ 


      2.   The cursor will be positioned at the "Employee Number" prompt. 

           On  the lower  half  of  the screen  you  will  see the  existing
           employee accounts appear.  Seeing  these accounts is helpful when
           you are selecting employees. 

           The selected employee  account is highlighted.  In  order to move
           to other accounts,  press the up or down arrow  keys on the right
           keypad.  If you  move the highlighting pointer down  a few lines,
           notice how the list scrolls. 

           You  may  select  an  existing   account  number  by  moving  the
           highlighting pointer up  or down to the desired  account and then
           pressing the ENTER key. 

           This advanced feature allows you  to scroll through your employee
           account listing without ever having to memorize, or even type in,
           an account number. 

      3.   To return to the previous menu, press ESC. 

      Before entering  your own transactions, practice  adding, changing and
      deleting  transactions  by  using  the WORK  demo  files.   This  will
      familiarize you  with how  to enter,  change, or  delete transactions.
      Changing  and  deleting transactions  is  described  in the  following
      sections. 


      4d - ENTERING TRANSACTIONS 

      As you enter each transaction,  FINANCE MANAGER saves this information
      and updates  the employee  listing as appropriate.    

      1.   In order  to begin  entering transactions,  select "F1"  from the
           Payroll Main Menu.   You will then be prompted  for the following
           information: 







                                       Page 21
                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll


      Employee Number   :____ 
      Pay Period Ending :__-__-__ 
      HOURS PAID:Regular:_______Overtime:_______Sick:_______Vacation:_______ 
                 Holiday:_______                         TOTAL HOURS: 

      Other Earnings 1:__________ Taxable(Y/N):_ Account:____ 
      Other Earnings 2:__________ Taxable(Y/N):_ Account:____ 
      Other Deduction :__________ Taxable(Y/N):_ Account:____ 


      2.   When entering  transactions, the last transaction  entered always
           provides the  default data (unless  of course, this is  your very
           first  transaction).  To  accept the  default data,  simply press
           ENTER and  you will move to  the next field.  In  order to change
           data, simply type in the new data and then press ENTER. 

      3.   First enter the employee number: 

                                 Employee Num:SMIT 

           The existing employees will appear on the screen.  You may either
           select an employee from this list  by using keypad arrow keys (as
           described earlier), or  you may type in the  employee number.  If
           you are using the keypad arrow keys,  be sure the Num Lock key is
           off. 

           NOTE: When you  enter the  employee number the  following message
                 appears: 

                                FREQUENCY:BIWEEKLY 

           This message reminds you of the employee's pay schedule.   


      4.   Enter the date the Pay Period ends: 

                            Pay Period Ending:05-08-89 


      5.   Enter  the total  number of  hours for  regular, overtime,  sick,
           vacation or holiday to be paid: 

           Regular:80.00__ Overtime:3.00___ Sick:0.00____ Vacation:0.00____ 
           Holiday:0.00____ 


      6.   Enter any  other earnings and/or  deductions, as well  as taxable
           flags, and account numbers: 

             Other Earnings 1:10.00_____ Taxable(Y/N):Y Account:5230 
             Other Earnings 2:0_________ Taxable(Y/N):_ Account:____ 
             Other Deduction :0_________ Taxable(Y/N):_ Account:____ 


      7.   At  this point  FINANCE MANAGER  will calculate  and display  the
           deductions for this transaction.  After the automatic calculation
           is made the following message will be displayed: 

                        Change Payroll Calculations (Y/N):_ 



                                       Page 22
                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll


           Note: Answer this message with "Y" if you need to manually change
                 the  computers  calculated payroll  deductions.   Otherwise
                 answer with  "N".  If you  had preexisting payroll  or were
                 calculating  earnings and  deductions differently  than the
                 automatic method  used by Finance Manager  you would answer
                 the above  prompt with  "Y".  You will  then be  allowed to
                 change each of the calculated amounts. 

      8.   If you are  entering a transaction and  you want to go  back to a
           previous field, use the Backspace key. 

      9.   You may abort the transaction at any time by pressing ESC. 

      10.  After  you have  entered all  your transactions  the system  will
           prompt you: 

                            Are inputs correct (Y/N):Y 

           Answer the prompt  with "Y" if you wish to  save the transaction.
           The cursor will then automatically  return to the Employee Number
           field for the next transaction.  If you answer this prompt with a
           "N", you will  return to the Employee Number field  and all prior
           inputs will be ignored and the  cursor returns to the first input
           field. 

      11.  After you have  entered all your transactions, press  the ESC key
           to return to the Payroll Main Menu. 


      4e - CHANGING EXISTING TRANSACTIONS 

      If you  discover an error in  an earlier transaction, or  if you would
      like to change previously  entered information, FINANCE MANAGER allows
      you  to  do  so.   Outlined  below are  the  procedures  for  changing
      previously entered transactions. 

      1.   Select "F2" at the Payroll Main Menu. 

      2.   The system  prompts you for  "ENTER DATA FOR  PAYROLL TRANSACTION
           SEARCH". 

      3.   Enter data in the fields you want to search for.  For example, if
           you want to  search for all transactions which have  a pay period
           ending  date of  "05-06-89", you  would  move to  the Pay  Period
           Ending field and  enter the date.  Upper and lower  case does not
           matter in  alphanumeric fields, and  you do not have  to complete
           the field.   For example, if you  entered only the first  part of
           the date  "05", FINANCE MANAGER  will find all dates  which begin
           with "05"  (i.e.  "05-06-89").   You could  also add  an employee
           number parameter to  the search and, consequently,  find only the
           "05" pay period dates for a particular employee. 

           Any field  left blank  is an  assumed wild  card for  that field.
           Thus if you  leave ALL of the fields blank,  all transactions are
           selected by the search.  Either press ENTER or the PgDn key until
           you  are prompted  with "Are  Inputs Correct  (Y/N):_".  If  your
           entries are correct enter "Y".  If  you enter "N" you will return
           to the first input screen to start again. 

           To assist you in finding an employee or chart of accounts account

           number, pressing  the "F2" key  while at the  corresponding input
           field will display a pop-up  accounts window.  You can now scroll
           through your accounts listing  and select the appropriate account
           to search for.   Pressing "Enter" or "Backspace"  will remove the
           pop-up accounts window. 

      4.   Next, FINANCE  MANAGER searches  for all  transactions containing
           the values you have specified.  As each transaction is displayed,
           the program displays the following prompt: 

                Modify/Delete/Continue/Reverse/Begin/End/+/-/Quit:_ 

           You must select M,D,C,R,B,E,+,-, or Q. Where: 

                M = Modify (change) transaction shown. 
                D = Delete (remove) transaction shown. 
                C = Continue (find next transaction that matches search). 
                R = Reverse  continue (find  prior transaction  that matches
                    search). 
                B = Beginning (go to first transaction in file). 
                E = Ending (go to last transaction in file). 
                + = Go to next consecutive transaction in file. 
                - = Go to prior consecutive transaction in file. 
                Q = Quit transaction search. 

      5.   As long  as you  continue to  answer the  above prompt  with "C",
           FINANCE   MANAGER  continues   searching  for   all  transactions
           containing the values you have specified.  Selecting "R" does the
           same as "C" except it searches backwards. 

      6.   Answering  the  prompt with  a  "+",  causes FINANCE  MANAGER  to
           display the  next consecutive  transaction; a  "-" shows  you the
           previous transaction (regardless of search parameters). 

      7.   Entering a "B" or an "E" will take you to the Beginning or End of
           the transaction file respectively.  It ignores search parameters. 

      8.   When the  search function  displays the  transaction you  wish to
           change, answer the prompt with an "M" (Modify). 

      9.   You are now  in the change mode.  Remember, ENTER  leaves a field
           unchanged.  Change data  in any field by typing in  the new value
           for the  given field.  If  you change any payroll  number FINANCE
           MANAGER  will  recalculate  the  earnings,  deductions,  employer
           liability and  accrued vacation and  sick hours at the  bottom of
           the screen. 

      10.  FINANCE MANAGER will tell you if the transaction has already been
           posted  to your  General  Ledger.  If  the  transaction has  been
           posted  you will  not  be  able to  make  ANY  changes.  This  is
           necessary to  avoid out-of-balance  conditions with  your General
           Ledger.   

           If  you need  to change  the fields  of a  posted transaction  we
           recommend  that  you  enter  a new  transaction  to  reflect  any
           adjustment to the original transaction. 

      11.  If you  have made  a mistake, or  you would like  to return  to a
           previous field, simply use the Backspace key.  Use the ESC key to
           ignore your changes and return to the Main Menu.

                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll



      12.  After you  have made all  necessary changes to  your transactions
           the program will prompt you "Are inputs correct (Y/N):_".  Answer
           "Y" if you wish to save them.  The cursor will then return to the
           first input screen  and you can continue on.  Answer  "N" and the
           system  will ignore  all changes  and return  to the  first input
           field. 

      13.  If  you press  the  ESC key  the system  will  prompt you:  "FIND
           ANOTHER (Y/N):_"  if you  answer "Y" your  cursor returns  to the
           first input screen.  Answer "N" you will return to the main menu. 


      4f - DELETING TRANSACTIONS 

      To delete or remove a transaction PERMANENTLY, do the following: 

      1.   Select "F2" at the Payroll Main Menu. 

      2.   Enter search  data and find  desired transaction as  described in
           "Changing Transactions". 

      3.   When  the transaction  you wish  to  delete is  displayed on  the
           screen, answer "D" at the prompt below. 

                Modify/Delete/Continue/Reverse/Begin/End/+/-/Quit:

      5.   After you  have deleted the  desired transaction(s), you  may use
           the  "Sort" function.   (See  Section Seven  "Other features  and
           functions   -   Sorting    Transactions.")   When   sorting   the
           transactions,  the program  frees disk  space which  was formerly
           used by the now deleted transactions. 

      PAID (Not posted) To delete a  paid (not posted)  transaction you must 
      TRANSACTIONS:     first void the check and then you will be allowed to
                        delete the transaction. 

      PAID & POSTED     To delete a paid and posted transaction all you have 
      TRANSACTIONS:     to do  is delete  the transaction.   Finance Manager
                        will automatically delete the transaction and create
                        a reversal transaction to be  posted to the G/L next
                        time you do a posting. 


      4g - POINTS TO REMEMBER 

      When  searching for  transactions remember  that the  transaction file
      will be  shown in  the order  it was  last sorted  by. See  section 7b
      "Sorting Transactions" for more information. 

      When you delete a posted  transaction, Finance Manager will remove the
      transaction from the payroll system as  well as make a reversing entry
      to be posted to the General Ledger.   The net effect will be as if the
      transaction was never entered.

                              SECTION FIVE - REPORTS 


      The Payroll  Reports Menu allows  you to  generate a full  spectrum of
      Payroll reports from your data base.   The reports menu ("F3" from the
      Payroll Main Menu) appears as follows: 

                     --------- PAYROLL REPORTS MENU ---------

      Reports can be generated to show results for a specific month, a range
      of months, a quarter,  a year, a pay period, etc.   All reports may be
      generated at any time and for any 12 month range.  This means that you
      are not limited to printing a report only once, and it also means that
      you can print a report for a prior period as well. 

      Samples of  each report are  shown in Appendix  A, and may  be printed
      while using the DEMO accounts. 


      5a - GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR GENERATING REPORTS 

      While printing any report you  may, if desired, interrupt the printing
      in one of two ways: 

      PAUSE THE PRINTER:    When you  are printing reports on  your printer,
                            you may pause the  printing by pressing any key.
                            Please keep  in mind  that most printers  have a
                            print   buffer.     Consequently,   the   report
                            continues to  print until  the buffer  is empty.
                            Pressing  any  key   again  will  continue  your
                            printout.  This  function will  not work  if you
                            are sending reports to the screen, since reports
                            will stop automatically as each screen is full. 

      STOP THE PRINTER:     If while printing, you  wish to stop the printer
                            and return  to the menu,  all you have to  do is
                            press the  "Esc" key.  Please keep  in mind that
                            most printers  have a print buffer,  causing the
                            report to continue to  print until the buffer is
                            empty.  You  will, however,  return to  the menu
                            immediately. 






                                       Page 26
                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll


      When generating  reports, you  have three output  destination options.
      First, you may send the reports to  the screen.  Second, if you have a
      printer,  you can  print  a hard  copy.  Finally,  you  can send  your
      reports  to a  disk file.   With this  useful option,  reports can  be
      stored and then printed at a later date. 

      This  "Destination" prompt  is an  option  for each  of the  available
      reports.  To select the destination, answer the prompt below: 

                         TO SCREEN/PRINTER/DISK (S/P/D):__ 

      If you  select "D"  for disk, the  system will prompt  you for  a disk
      "filename".  Enter  a filename  of up to  eight characters.   The file
      will be  saved on your data  disk, with the file  extension of ".RPT".
      If a file  with the name entered already exists,  the system will tell
      you so and ask if you want to delete the old file.  If you answer "N",
      the new report will be appended to the already existing disk file. 

      For some  reports, you also  need to  specify reporting dates  via the
      "Date" prompt.  The date prompt appears as follows: 


                           ENTER DATE RANGE FOR REPORTS: 
                               STARTING Month:__ Year:__ 
                                 ENDING Month:__ Year:__ 


      These  dates  determine which  months  and  years  are shown  on  your
      reports.  The  ending month and year  must be within twelve  months of
      the  starting month  and  year (maximum  12 month  range).   To get  a
      year-to-date report  you might  select the  dates 1-89  through 12-89.
      Likewise, if  you want a first  quarter report you should  select 1-89
      through 3-89.

      When entering prompts for reports, remember  that you may back up to a
      previous field by pressing the Backspace  key.  If you want to go back
      to the reports menu while you are at the input screen, press ESC. 


      5b - PRINTING THE PAYROLL JOURNAL 

      This  report  is  a  listing  of all  transactions  entered  during  a
      specified period of  time and shows which General  Ledger accounts are
      credited and debited. 

      When  printing  the  PAYROLL  JOURNAL  (F1), be  sure  to  employ  the
      following procedures: 

          a.  Select "F1" from the reports menu. 

          b.  The following screen will appear:

                           SELECT PAID,UNPAID OR ALL (P,U,A) :_ 
                           ENTER DATE RANGE FOR REPORTS: 
                                     STARTING Month:__ Year:__ 
                                       ENDING Month:__ Year:__

          c.  First, type in the destination for your report. 

          d.  Then, enter  the type of  transactions to be included  in this
              report.  If you enter "P",  only the paid transactions will be
              printed.  If you enter "U",  only the unpaid transactions will
              be  printed.   If you  enter  "A",  all transactions  will  be
              printed. 

          e.  Finally, enter  the date range  wanted for your  report.  This
              report  is  compared   to  the  Period  Ending   date  of  the
              transactions. 

          f.  The report will then be printed. 

              NOTE: If  the message  "LOAD PRINTER  WITH AT  LEAST 11"  WIDE
                    PAPER" comes up while you  are waiting for the report to
                    print, your settings for  printing in compressed mode is
                    not  set  up  correctly  in the  G/L  System  Utilities.
                    Please check your printer manual for the correct control
                    codes.

      In  order to  get to  the Payroll  Checks menu,  select "F5"  from the
      Payroll Main menu.  It appears as follows:

                     ---------------------------------------- 

      We will  discuss each  of the  above menu  selections in  the sections
      which follow. 


      6a - PRINTING CHECKS 

      Load  your printer  with your  pre-printed continuous-form  checks and
      check to be sure you have  set up the Payroll configuration (utilities
      menu) for the  checks you will be using (Nebs check form # 9001). 

      Select "F1"  from the  checks menu  and you will  be prompted  for the
      following information: 

      NOTE: In order to  print continuous form checks you need  an 85 column
            printer. 

                        Enter DATE for Checks:__-__-__ 
                        Enter NEXT Check Number:____ 
                        G/L Check Account Number:____ 
                        Payroll for type(A,W,B,S,M):_ 

          a.  Enter the date you want printed on your checks. 

          b.  Enter  the check  number of  the  first check  in the  printer
              (FINANCE  MANAGER will  not print  the check  number on  check
              lineups).   If  your  checks  do not  have  pre-printed  check
              numbers,  enter the  number you  wish to  have printed  on the
              first  LIVE   (non-line  up)  check.   FINANCE   MANAGER  will
              automatically  increment  the  checks  numbers  for  the  live
              printed checks.

                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll


          c.  Enter  the  General Ledger  checking  account  number for  the
              checks  you are  writing.  It  is important  that you  use the
              correct  G/L  account number  otherwise  your  funds for  this
              check(s) will come out of  the wrong account.  Notice when you
              reach  this  section, how  FINANCE  MANAGER  will display  the
              account number listing on your screen  so you will not have to
              memorize any account numbers. 

          d.  Enter the  category for which  you want checks to  be printed.
              Enter   "A"  (all),   "W"   (weekly),   "B"  (biweekly),   "S"
              (semi-monthly) or "M" (monthly). 

          e.  After entering  the category FINANCE  MANAGER will ask  you if
              you want printer lineup. 

                          Print Alignment Pattern (Y/N):_ 

              Answer with a "Y" until you have the checks properly lined up.
              When you  answer this prompt with  a "N", your checks  will be
              printed. 

      Until you answer the alignment pattern with a "N", you may at any time
      abort the  check printing process and  return to the menu  by pressing
      the ESC key. 


      6b - VOIDING PRINTED CHECKS 

      Check written to  a specific employee may be voided  by selecting "F2"
      from the checks  menu.  This function will allow you  to void the last
      check written  and also mark  the transaction(s) unpaid  again, either
      computer  generated  or  manual.   Upon selecting  this  function  the
      following screen will appear: 

                          Enter Check Number to Void:____ 


      If you  cannot remember which check  number you wanted to  void simply
      hit ENTER.   FINANCE MANAGER  will display  on the  lower half  of the
      screen all checks written, starting with the last one. 


      6c - ENTERING MANUAL CHECKS 

      Another great feature  included in the FINANCE  MANAGER Payroll module
      is  the  ability  to  enter  checks manually.   This  allows  you  the
      flexibility of  hand writing  checks.  You simply  write the  check by
      hand  if you  do not  want  to do  a full  check  run or  do not  have
      pre-printed checks. 

      In order to use this feature,  select "F3" from the Checks menu.  Upon
      selecting this function you will be prompted as listed below: 


                    Enter DATE for Checks      :__-__-__ 
                    Enter NEXT Check Number    :____ 
                    G/L Check Account Number   :____ 
                    Payroll for type(A,W,B,S,M):_ 

      Enter the DATE, CHECK NUMBER, G/L  ACCOUNT NUMBER AND PAY FREQUENCY as


                                       Page 37
                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll


      in  section 6a.   This procedure  is just  like printing  computerized
      checks, except that no check will be printed. 

      Finance Manager will then display all the transactions (one at a time)
      that are not paid so you can select which ones to pay. 

      When a transaction to  be paid is found you will  be prompted for "PAY
      THIS EMPLOYEE".  Answer with  a "Y" to pay or "N" to  skip and not pay
      the transaction. 

      After all non-paid transactions are shown you will then be returned to
      the Checks Menu for further processing.

                           OTHER FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS 


      The remainder of the features and  functions of the Payroll Module are
      contained on the Payroll Utilities Menu.  These features are also very
      powerful  and  important  functions  of this  module.   To  use  these
      features select "F6"  from the Payroll Main Menu.   The following menu
      will be shown:

                     ---------------------------------------- 

      In this section we will discuss each  function as well as its uses and
      features.  Since  setting up  the Configuration settings  are required
      before you  will be able  to enter  any transactions, we  will discuss
      this selection first. 


      7a - CONFIGURATION SETTINGS 

      The configuration settings allow you  to configure this module to your
      specific company, and to its  specific General Ledger account numbers.
      This  configuration  is  very  important  to  your  transactions,  for
      pre-printed continuous form  checks and to the  General Ledger account
      numbers used.   We recommend using  Nebs checks form #9001  and either
      standard business  window envelopes  or Nebs  form #775  DU-O-VUE Dual
      window  envelopes.  For  the W-2s  we recommend  using Nebs  W-2s form
      #9852.  Nebs toll free order number is 1-800-225-9550.

                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll


      By selecting "F4"  from the utilities menu you will  see the following
      screen: 

      ID#'S FED:____________ STATE:____________ Detail posting to G/L(Y/N):_

                                                                       Row Col 
      CHECK WRITING:Print Check#(Y/N):_Print Address(Y/N):_Name Location:__ __ 


      The configuration  settings must be set  up for each set  of books you
      have.   Be sure  to  carefully employ  the  following procedures  when
      setting up the configuration settings. 

      Prior to setting up this configuration,  you must set up (add) several
      Payroll accounts to  your G/L Chart of Accounts.   These accounts must
      be active accounts in  your G/L Chart of Accounts in  order to be able
      to use  the Payroll Module  correctly (i.e.  do not use  these account
      numbers for  any General  Ledger transactions  - only  for use  by the
      Payroll module). 

      These accounts  are used  as interface  accounts and  posting accounts
      between the  Payroll module and  your General Ledger module.   You can
      not use  the Payroll module  without these important accounts  even if
      you want to  use the Payroll module  as a stand alone  module.  Set up
      one of each,  of the following accounts in your  G/L Chart of Accounts
      for Payroll: 

           a.  FICA Liability (type L) account 
           b.  FICA Expense (type E) account 
           c.  FUTA Liability (type L) account 
           d.  FUTA Expense (type E) account 
           e.  SUTA Liability (type L) account 
           f.  SUTA Expense (type E) account 
           g.  SDI Liability (type L) account 
           h.  SDI Expense (type E) account 
           i.  Other payroll tax Liability (type L) account 
           j.  Other payroll tax Expense (type E) account 
           k.  Federal Withholding (type L) account 
           l.  State Withholding (type L) account 
           m.  City Withholding (type L) account 
           n.  Salary & Wages (type E) account 
           o.  Checking account (type A) if not already set up 
           p.  Extra Deductions (type L) account

      When setting up the Payroll check printing feature for your continuous
      checks  and   other  forms,   you  must   specify  in   the  following
      configuration what  and where  you want to  have the  following fields
      printed: 

      ID#'S FED           Enter your employer  federal identification number
                          as it will be listed on your W-2 forms.           

      STATE               Enter your employer state identification number as

      COMPANY             Enter your  company name as  it will be  listed on
                          your W-2 forms. 

      ADDRESS 1           Enter the  address of your  company as it  will be
                          listed on your W-2 forms. 

      ADDRESS 2           You may enter a second address for your company as
                          it will be listed on your W-2 forms.   

      CITY                Enter your company's city. 

      STATE               Enter your company's two  letter state or province
                          code. 

      ZIPCODE             Enter your company's zipcode or postal code. 

      DETAIL POSTING      Allows the option of  posting transactions to your 
      TO G/L (Y/N)        General  Ledger  in   detail  or  summary  format.
                          Selecting  detail posting  will post  each Payroll
                          transaction   as  a   individual  General   Ledger
                          transaction and  you can  post at any  time; while
                          answering "N" will  cause the Payroll transactions
                          to be  grouped and  summarized when posted  to the
                          General Ledger.  Which ever  method you choose the
                          financial results will be  the same.  There is one
                          other  difference,  however,  if  you  select  the
                          detail  posting,  the actual  Payroll  transaction
                          date  will be  used  when posting  to the  General
                          Ledger, while summary posting  will prompt you for
                          a POSTING  DATE   and  will  post   every  entered
                          transaction to  the posting date (even  those with
                          different month dates).  If you are a beginner and
                          do not have many transactions, we suggest that you
                          select "Y" at this prompt. 

      WORK DAYS/          Enter the actual number of days your employees 
      YEAR                will  work  each   year  including  all  holidays,
                          usually 260 (52x5) days. 

      HOURS PER           Enter the number of hours your employees will work 
      DAY, WEEK,          for the pay periods listed.  When calculating for 
      SEMI-MONTH,         Semi-Month and Month, calculate the hours per 
      MONTH               year.  Example:  If your  employees work  40 hours
                          per week and are paid semi-monthly, multiply 40 by
                          52  weeks  in the  year,  divided  by the  24  pay
                          periods  per year  to  equal 86.67  hours per  pay
                          period. 

      FICA, FUTA, SUTA,   For these fields, enter the percentage of tax, the

                          expense accounts for these taxes. 

                          FICA is paid by both  the employee and employer at

                          SUTA is paid by the employer. 

                          SDI  is  paid  by   either  the  employer  or  the
                          employee.  Answer the "EMPLY PAYS" prompt with "Y"
                          to have the employee pay this amount, or enter "N"
                          to have the employer pay.   In most states this is
                          paid by the employer ("N").

                          you want the check number to be printed and "N" if
                          you have the check  number already printed on your

                          At the  "Print Address(Y/N):_" prompt,  answer "Y"
                          if you want your  employee's address to be printed
                          on  his check,  or  "N"  if you  do  not want  his

                          numbers will place the name and address so that it
                          will show correctly when  using a window envelope.
                          (Standard business window envelope uses Row 34 and
                          COL 11). 

      FINANCE MANAGER  will then ask  you "Are inputs correct  (Y/N):Y".  If
      you take the default of "Y"  then you be notified that FINANCE MANAGER
      is saving your  configuration and then you will return  to the Payroll
      Utilities menu.   If you answer "N"  the cursor will return  to "ID#'S
      FED" field and you can start again. 


      7b - SORTING TRANSACTIONS 

      The Payroll module normally keeps  transactions organized in the order
      in which they are input.  The Sort function allows the user to sort or
      organize  the  transactions  by:  date  of  input,  transaction  date,
      employee order or check number order. 

      The sort  procedure is not  a required feature  but it is  useful, for
      example,  when  printing  transaction  journals  or  employee  balance
      reports and you would like to insure that all transactions are in date
      order.  To  accomplish this, all you  have to do is  select date order
      sort.  It  would be a  good practice to  sort the transactions  once a
      month before  printing your reports.   The sort order does  not affect
      any  report balances  and it  is purely  for cosmetic  purposes.  When
      sorting  transactions this  will also  free  up disk  space which  was
      formally occupied by deleted transactions. 

      To start  sorting transactions, select  "F1" at the  Payroll Utilities
      Menu.  The following screen appears: 


                     ----------- SELECT SORT ORDER ---------- 
                     |                                      | 
                     |   ESC  Return to Utilities Menu      | 
                     |   F1   Transaction Input Order       | 
                     |   F2   Date Order                    | 
                     |   F3   Employee Order                | 
                     |   F4   Check Number Order            | 
                     |                                      |

                     |                                      | 
                     |   ENTER YOUR SELECTION:              | 
                     |                                      | 
                     ---------------------------------------- 


      1.  Select the order in which you  would like to sort the transactions
          by. 

      2.  FINANCE MANAGER automatically sorts all transactions. 

      3.  Press any key to exit and return to the Payroll Main Menu when the
          sort is completed. 

      If you  have more transactions than  memory can hold at  one time, the

      default disk  drive is used  to store  a temporary file  while sorting
      transactions.   It  is  important  to remember,  therefore,  that  the
      default drive must have adequate remaining disk space, and it must NOT
      be "write protected" . 

      The system  will tell if  there is not  enough memory on  your default
      drive  to sort  your file,  the sort  will abort  and you  must put  a
      formatted, blank disk in your  default drive (usually drive A:) before
      selecting your sort order again. 


      7c - POSTING TO THE GENERAL LEDGER 

      Payroll Utilities  Menu selection "F2" will  post transactions entered
      into  this  module to  your  General  Ledger accounts.   Depending  on
      whether  you  selected  the  detail  or summary  post  option  in  the
      configuration (described  above) your Payroll transactions  are posted
      according to the option you selected. 

      You'll  be pleased  to know  that this  posting procedure  is a  smart
      procedure.  It will only post  the transactions which have not already
      been posted.  Because of this  incredible time saving feature, you may
      accidentally  post as  many times  as you  wish without  worry of  any
      errors or double posting. 

      Note: This posting procedure will  only post the transactions (checks)
            which have already been paid. 

      This  posting process  is mandatory  in  order to  interface with  the
      General Ledger.   Without running  this procedure, no  transactions or
      activity  from  this   module  will  shown  on   your  General  Ledger
      reports. 

      NOTE: After this posting procedure is complete, the transactions which
            were posted can no longer be changed. 

      Because of this unique safety feature, we recommend that you only post
      after  you are  absolutely  sure all  transactions  have been  entered
      correctly and that any adjustments  have been made.  Generally, a good
      rule for you  to follow is to  post transactions once a  month, on the
      last day of that month. 

      After you  have run this procedure,  you can print any  General Ledger
      reports, and all  paid payroll from this module  will be automatically
      included in your General Ledger reports. 

      In order to  run this procedure, select "F2" on  the Payroll Utilities
      menu.   If you  selected the  detail posting  option the  posting will
      commence.   If you  did not  select detail  posting you  will then  be
      prompted for a posting date.  This prompt is as follows: 

                       Enter Post Transaction Date:__-__-__ 

      When using the summary post option this date will show for all of your
      Payroll transactions  in the  General Ledger as  the date  of posting.
      Usually this date  should be the current date (i.e.  the last date for
      the  current  month).  If  detail  posting  was selected  the  Payroll
      transactions in your  General Ledger will have the same  dates as they
      do in the Payroll Journal.

      7d - PAYROLL TAX TABLES 

      WARNING: It  is very  important that  you  enter your  Tax Table  data
               correctly.   Hooper International  assumes  no liability  for
               errors.   We  consider  it  mandatory to  test  your  payroll
               deductions  by manually  calculating your  payroll to  verify
               that all deductions are correct. 

      The payroll tax tables contain all  of the Federal, State and City tax
      information  as well  as  any other  information  about Earned  Income
      Credit for your particular state.  FINANCE MANAGER needs these numbers
      to calculate your employee's taxes  and withholdings.  Many states and
      cities have different percentages and  these percentages are liable to
      change every  year.  With  FINANCE MANAGER you  can modify  the tables
      yourself to keep them current with changing tax laws. 

      By selecting  "F5" from the  Payroll Utilities  menu you will  see the
      following screen:

      3.  For state and  city tax only.  Use with item  two above to specify
          the maximum federal tax deduction allowed in your state.  If there
          is no maximum enter 999999.99 (optional).

      6.  For  state or  city tax  only.   Enter the  percentage your  state
          income  tax  guide allows  an  alternative  to entering  a  dollar
          amount.   You can  also use  this field  if your  state gives  the
          option of  a dollar amount  or a  percentage amount as  the annual
          deduction amount. 

                                    Pct:17____% 


      7.  For state  or city tax only.   Use if you  are in a state  or city
          which requires you to take either  a dollar amount or a percentage
          amount and gives a qualifier.   For example, your state income tax
          guide tells you  to take either $5,000 or 17%  of the gross income
          which ever is greater.  Enter "Y".  Or your state income tax guide
          may tell  you to  take either  $5,000 or 17%  of the  gross income
          which ever is less.  You enter "N". 

                                     Greater:Y 


      8.  Enter the  beginning wage amount  your state specifies  from which
          you will begin deducting taxes.  Refer  to page 23 in your Federal
          Tax Guide, table 7.

                             PLUS PERCENTAGE:15_____% 


      When you finish entering all of the amounts in their respective fields
      press the PgDn key and FINANCE MANAGER will prompt "Are Inputs Correct
      (Y/N):_".  If you answer "Y" FINANCE MANAGER will save your inputs and
      the cursor will return to the Tax Table field.  Continue to enter your
      other tax  tables.  If you  enter "N" at  the prompt, the  cursor will
      return  to the  Tax Table  field and  will allow  you to  reenter your
      inputs.  It is very important that you enter the correct data into the
      correct fields  otherwise all of  your tax calculations will  be wrong
      for the entire year. 

      Continue entering  the Tax Table  information for your City  and State
      and the information for Earned Income Credit.  Please refer to the Tax
      Guides for your respective City and State.  Repeat steps 1-10 for each
      of the Tax tables you will need for your particular City and State. 

      After you have  entered all your Tax Table information  for each table
      that is  necessary for  your City  and State  and the  Advanced Income
      Credit information, make sure you  have saved your inputs by answering
      "Are Inputs Correct" before you  return to the Payroll Utlilities main
      menu. 


      7e - PRINTING END OF YEAR W-2s 

      This feature  of FINANCE  MANAGER will  print W-2  forms automatically
      without you having to figure out any of the amounts. 

      Load  your  printer  with   your  pre-printed  continuous  W-2  forms.
      Continuous W-2s can be ordered from Nebs.  Nebs toll free order number
      is 1-800-225-9550.  If  you do not have continuous W-2  forms the same
      information can be obtained from your Payroll Register Report. 

      Select "F6" from  the Payroll Utilities Menu and  FINANCE MANAGER will
      ask you to enter a city short name (to be placed in box 22 on the W-2)
      and ask if you want a  test printer lineup printed.  These prompts are
      as follows: 

                          Enter City short name:________ 
                          Print Alignment Pattern (Y/N):_ 

      First enter a eight character city  short name.  Next enter the "Print
      Alignment Pattern" prompt with a "Y"  until you have the W-2s properly
      lined up.   When you answer  this prompt with  an "N", your  W-2s will
      then be printed.   Until you answer the alignment pattern  with a "N",
      you  may abort  the W-2  printing process  and return  to the  menu by
      pressing the ESC key. 

      NOTE: Notice the warning at the bottom  of the screen that warns about
            Extra-Deductions  and  Non-taxable   Other  Earnings  being  not
            included on  the W-2 statement.   These amounts must  be entered
            manually in Box 16 or 16a as appropriate.

      8b - HELPFUL HINTS AND SUGGESTIONS 

        * Keep a CURRENT backup copy of  all your data files.  Each time you
          have finished entering new data make a copy of your data files and
          have at  least four set's  which you rotate.  This  will safeguard
          against loss of data due to a power failure or other problems. 

        * Use the  Shift PrtSc keys  to make a  hard copy of  current screen
          display. 

        * You  may run  this module  WITHOUT  the interface  to the  General
          Ledger module simply  by not posting to the General  Ledger (F2 on
          the  Utilities Menu).   The  system will,  however,  post to  your
          General Ledger  when you do  an End of  Period Posting (F3  on the
          Utilities Menu).   To totally avoid  any interface, simply  set up
          this module with a separate data file, using a different name than
          your General  Ledger data file  name.  You will, however,  have to
          set up a few dummy G/L accounts (the required G/L accounts need to
          run this module). 

        * When  printing checks,  be sure  that  your printer  can print  85
          column across.  Deviation  from this will result  in the inability
          to line up your pre-printed checks. 

        * The following explains how FINANCE MANAGER figures taxes: 

          1. FINANCE MANAGER figures the  yearly gross income by multiplying
             amount paid per pay period by either: 

                       12 for those employees paid monthly 
                       24 for those employees paid semi-monthly 
                       26 for those employees paid biweekly 
                       52 for those employees paid weekly 

          2. Subtracts deductions. 


                                       Page 49
                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll



             Deductions =  Annual tax  deduction amount  (on the  tax table)
             times the number in the  State deduction field (in the employee
             account data base) 

             If the employee has more than  one deduction and the annual tax
             deduction amount (on the tax table) multiplied by the number in
             the state deduction  field (in the employee  account data base)
             is not correct  according to the state tax guide,  then you can
             add any additional amounts in the state exemption field (in the
             employee  account  data base).   For  example,  the annual  tax
             deduction  amount for  a  single deduction  is  $2,500 and  the
             annual tax deduction  amount for two deductions  is $3,000.  If
             the employee  has two deductions  you will enter $2,500  in the
             annual tax deduction amount field (on  the tax table) and a "1"
             in  the state  deduction field  (in the  employee account  data
             base).  1 times  $2,500 = $2,500.  Enter the  remaining $500 in
             the state annual exemption field  (in the employee account data
             base). 

          3. Subtracts  amount  in  State  annual exemption  field  (in  the
             employee account data base) 

          4. Subtracts Federal Income  Tax already paid if  you answered "Y"
             on the tax table and your state allows it to be deducted. 

          5. All of the above equals the annualized Taxable Income. 

          6. From  the Taxable  Income  FINANCE MANAGER  will calculate  the
             taxes that the employee will pay. 

          7. Finally, if your  state gives you a tax credit  enter the total
             dollar  amount in  the State  Annual  Tax Credit  field in  the
             employee account data base. 

          8. The annualized Payroll deduction is  then divided by the number
             of pay periods  in one year to give you  the deduction for this
             pay period. 

        * If you have multiple state payroll you have two options: 

           A. Set up  a set  of books for  each state and  then use  the G/L
              merge transactions  function to  combine the  G/L transactions
              into one set of books. 

           B. Using the  DOS copy command,  create different tax  tables for
              each state and save each one as a seperate filename.  Copy the
              one you need to the filename  of your set of books (e.g.  COPY
              COLORADO.TAX WORK.TAX to use Colorado tax tables).

      1d - USING THE DEMO ACCOUNTS 

      Included  at no  extra cost  with the  "Payroll" module,  is a  set of
      sample/demo accounts  for practice use.   On your disk are  some files
      with the  name of "WORK".   In order to  use these demo  files, simply
      copy all of  the "WORK.*" files onto  a blank disk to be  used as your
      demo disk.   When starting up FINANCE  MANAGER, use this disk  as your
      data disk and put it in the appropriate disk drive (usually B:).  When
      FINANCE MANAGER asks you for the  File name, enter "WORK".  The use of
      these demo files will very likely get you going faster and help you to
      use this module to your best advantage. 

      It is important to remember that you  do not use these demo files when
      you are  setting up  your own  live data,  since demo  files obviously
      contain existing practice-only data and  demo employees.  Setting up a
      new "live"  set of books,  however, is  very simple and  is thoroughly
      described in the following section. 

      1e - RUNNING THE PAYROLL MODULE 

      To run  the "Payroll" module, you  must first install it  by following
      the instructions  under "Installing  FINANCE MANAGER" in  the "Getting
      Started" Manual.   After it is  installed, follow the simple  steps in
      the order given below: 

      1.   Start up  FINANCE MANAGER  per the  instructions in  the "Getting
           Started" manual.  Upon starting  FINANCE MANAGER, you must decide
           to use either  live data or the practice-only  demo accounts data
           on  the Payroll  Documentation &  Demo  disk.  If  you prefer  to
           practice  and experiment,  you should  remember to  use the  Demo
           disk.  If  you wish to set  up your own live  Payroll, you should
           put your FINANCE  MANAGER General Ledger data disk  in your drive
           B: (not necessary if you have a hard disk).

      2.   At the disk  drive prompt, enter the disk drive  letter where you
           put your Demo  or G/L data disk,  usually drive B: (or  C: if you
           have a hard disk). 

      3.   At the Enter Filename prompt, enter the name of the data file you
           want to use ("WORK" if you have  the demo disk in drive B:, or if
           you are using your live G/L data files enter the filename you are
           using for your live data). 

           Remember, you can only use this module if you have previously set
           up  your  General Ledger  data  files  using the  General  Ledger
           module.  When  using the demo  data files, this has  already been
           done for you. 

      4.   You will now be at the FINANCE MANAGER Master Menu. 

      5.   OPTIONAL: If you have  not already done so (when you  set up your
                     G/L data  files), you  may go  to the  System Utilities
                     Menu  and  change  any   system  defaults.   This  may,
                     however, be  done at any  time and is not  necessary to
                     run FINANCE  MANAGER.  We do, however,  suggest you set
                     up  the "Compressed"  and "Normal"  print codes  before
                     printing the Payroll reports, since you will find it is
                     required for a few of them. 




                                       Page 6
                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll



      6.   Next you must  add several accounts to your  General Ledger Chart
           of Accounts.  See section 7a for details.  These G/L accounts are
           required  to use  the Payroll  module.  See  your General  Ledger
           documentation manual  on setting up  your Chart of  Accounts.  If
           you have  these accounts  already set up  in your  General Ledger
           Chart of Accounts, this step is not necessary. 

      7.   From the FINANCE  MANAGER master menu: If you  have floppy disks,
           put your  Payroll program  disk into  drive A:  (if you  have not
           already done so).  Then select menu  "F5", and this will take you
           into Payroll.   If this is the  first time you are  using Payroll
           for this set of books, the  system will ask you: "Create new file
           (Y/N):_", which  you should  answer with  a "Y".   This procedure
           will create all the necessary Payroll data files.  Don't worry it
           will not damage your General Ledger data files. 

      8.   From the Payroll  main menu select "F6", and then  "F4", in order
           to  set up  your Payroll  configuration settings.   This step  is
           important since  it will set  up the interface with  your General
           Ledger Chart of Accounts.  See section 7a for details. 

      9.   Return to the  Payroll Utilities menu and select "F5",  to set up
           your tax tables.  These tax  tables will calculate federal, state
           and city taxes  as well as Earned Income Credit.   See section 7d
           for details. 

      10.  Return to  the Payroll main menu  and select "F4" to  set up your
           employees.  See section 3 on employee accounts. 

      11.  After  setting  up your  employees,  you  may print  an  employee
           listing report.  See section 5 on reports. 

      12.  Return  to  the  Payroll  main  menu and  select  "F1"  to  input
           transactions.  See section 4 on transactions. 

      13.  After you have entered some transactions, you may print a Payroll
           Register report  (select "F2" from  the Payroll Reports menu)  to
           see what you have entered.  See section 5 on reports. 

      14.  Print any other reports as required.  The most useful reports are
           "PAYROLL REGISTER" and the "PAID PAYROLL RECAP". 

      These basic steps are merely intended  to show you the order of events
      in setting up new Payroll books.

                        SECTION TWO - THE PAYROLL MAIN MENU 

      The Payroll  Main Menu is  the starting point  for all of  the various
      Payroll  functions.  It  is  a sort  of "Table  of  Contents" for  the
      Payroll module.  It can guide you to all of the other useful sub-menus
      and practical features of the time and money-saving Payroll module. 

      The Payroll Main Menu appears as follows: 

                     ----------- PAYROLL MAIN MENU ---------- 
                     |                                      | 
                     |   ESC  Return to Master Menu         | 
                     |   F1   Input TRANSACTIONS            | 
                     |   F2   CHANGE/Delete Transactions    |

                     |   F4   Update EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS      | 
                     |   F5   Payroll Checks Menu           | 
                     |   F6   Payroll Utility Menu          | 
                     |                                      | 
                     |                                      | 
                     |                                      | 
                     |                                      | 
                     |   ENTER YOUR SELECTION:              | 
                     |   Payroll configuration not set up   | 
                     ---------------------------------------- 


      Note that  many of the  selections are used to  go on to  other menus.
      All of  the menu selections  are discussed  in later sections  in this
      documentation.   If  you get  a  message,  as above,  saying  "Payroll
      configuration not set up" or "Tax Tables not set up" you should set up
      these configurations  by selecting  "F6", "PAYROLL UTILITIES  MENU" to
      set these items up.  For clarification, these procedures are discussed
      in Section Seven. 


      As  mentioned   above,  it   is  essential  that   you  set   up  your
      configuration.   Jump to  Section 7a  to complete  that easy-to-follow
      procedure before continuing. 

      The next  step is to  set up  your employee accounts.   This procedure
      follows in Section Three.

                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll


                         SECTION THREE - EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS 

      Your Employee Accounts are the foundation of your Payroll.  To set up,
      or to change your employees, select "F4 Update EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS" from
      the Payroll main menu. 

      3a - WHAT ARE EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS 

      Your  employee  accounts  are  used  to keep  track  of  all  of  your
      employees, their address, overtime, holiday, sick leave, the amount of
      time they  worked, Pay frequency,  deductions and liabilities.   It is
      important to remember that any person  that is drawing a paycheck from
      you, should be set up as an employee. 

      Whenever you hire a  new employee, you must set up  this new person in
      the employee  accounts.  WHEN  YOU ENTER A  NEW EMPLOYEE  INTO FINANCE
      MANAGER HAVE THE EMPLOYEES COMPLETED W-4  FORM NEXT TO YOU, AS MOST OF
      THE INFORMATION YOU WILL ENTER  WILL COME DIRECTLY FROM THE EMPLOYEE'S
      W-4  FORM.  Each  employee must  be  given a  unique employee  account
      number,  which can  be any  alphanumeric input  up to  four characters
      long.  This account number will then be used whenever you are entering
      transactions for that employee. 


      3b - EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS ORGANIZATION 

      Your employee account numbers, and their order within the program, are
      totally up to you. 

      An important  consideration for  your employee  account numbers  is to
      group  your employees  into  account number  ranges  or in  alphabetic
      order.  For example, give all of  your employees who work in shipping,
      account numbers 9000-9999.  This may  be useful when printing reports.

      changing and deleting  employee accounts by using the  WORK demo file.
      This will familiarize you with how to enter, change or delete employee
      accounts.   Changing and  deleting employee  accounts is  described in
      easy to follow lay mans terms in the following sections. 

      1. From the Payroll Main Menu select  "F4" on the menu.  You will then
         be prompted for the following information: 

      Employee Num:____ Active(Y/N):_  Social Security Number:_____________ 
      NAME   :_______________________  Deduction:FWH:__ SWH:__ CWH:__ EIC:_

      3e - ENTERING YOUR OWN EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS 

      When you actually enter your own employee accounts, it would be a good
      idea to collate your employees into some kind of logical order in your
      mind.  This will be  helpful to you later, each time  you need to look
      up employees by account number. 

      In order  to enter employee accounts  switch to your live  data files.
      To do  this, simply return to  the FINANCE MANAGER Master  Menu (press
      the ESC key  until you are there).   When you are at  the Master Menu,
      enter one  more ESC.   The program  will then prompt  "DO YOU  WANT TO
      RESTART (Y/N):_" enter "Y". 

      At this point (if you have your  data on floppy disks) switch from the
      Doc and Demo disk to your  live G/L data diskette.  Select your "real"
      data file  name.  From the Master  Main Menu select "F5".   The system
      should tell you that it did not find your Payroll files.  Enter "Y" at
      the "Create  new Files"  prompt.  From the  Payroll main  menu, select
      "F4" and you will be ready to enter your employee accounts. 

      1.   At  the  input screen,  the  cursor  will  be positioned  at  the
           employee account number field.  Unless you are entering your very
           first employee  account number, there  should be default  data in
           this field. 

      2.   Instead of using the default data  (if any), enter a new employee
           account number of your choice.   The step by step input procedure
           for an example employee account is as follows:

      36.  Input the number  of hours PER PAY PERIOD that  are to be accrued
           for vacation.

      38.  If you make a mistake in any field, and would like to correct it,
           you  can easily  back  up to  a previous  field  by pressing  the
           backspace key. 


      39.  After you have  entered the data in the Accrual  Rates field, the
           message "Change Beginning Balance  Data (Y/N):_" will appear.  If
           you answer with a "N" Finance Manager will continue to item 41. 

      40.  If you answer "Y" Finance Manager  will display on the lower half
           of the screen the following: 


      EMPLOYEE BEGINNING BALANCE: 
      Earnings taxable    :0_________  FICA  :0_________ Extra Deduct  :0___ 
      Earnings Non-taxable:0_________  FUTA  :0_________ 
      Withholdings Federal:0_________  SUTA  :0_________ 
      Withholdings State  :0_________  SDI   :0_________ Vacation Hours:0___ 
      Withholdings City   :0_________  Oth Tx:0_________ Sick Hours    :0___ 


      41.  Enter  any   preexisting  employee  balances.    These  beginning
           balances will show on your year-to-date reports and W-2. 

           NOTE: Another  alternative is  to  enter individual  transactions
                 broken  down by  pay periods  for each  employee, and  then
                 enter manual  checks to pay these  transactions.  Make sure
                 that you delete any preexisting payroll transactions in the
                 General Ledger.  You do not want to have these transactions
                 listed twice.   It is always  best to start this  module at
                 the beginning of the year to avoid any confusion. 


      42.  Once all  of the data has  been entered correctly, answer  "Y" at
           the "Are  inputs correct(Y/N):_"  prompt.  If  you answer  with a
           "N", the  cursor will  return to the  Employee Number  prompt and
           previous input will be ignored. 


      43.  If you answered with a "Y", the new employee account is added and
           you will automatically return to the employee number prompt.  You
           are then ready for more input. 

           NOTE: Please note that the employee number you have just added is
                 automatically added to the "pop  up" window which lists all
                 accounts.  Use the cursor keys (when at the employee number
                 field),  in order  to  scroll through  the active  employee


                                       Page 16
                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll


                 accounts to search for the account you have just added.  If
                 you   have   added   your  account   correctly,   it   will
                 automatically be in order within this list.  The list reads
                 from left to right. 


      44.  The  cursor will  once again  be  at the  employee number  field.
           Repeat steps  2-41 until you  have finished entering all  of your
           employees. 


      45.  Make sure you answer the prompt "Are inputs correct (Y/N):_" with
           a "Y" to save your inputs before pressing the ESC key.  Otherwise
           all of the data  you just entered will be lost  and you will have
           to re-enter it.   To leave the current input field  and return to
           the previous menu simply press the ESC key. 


      3f - CHANGING EXISTING EMPLOYEES 

      The  steps below  outline the  procedure  for making  changes to  your
      existing employee accounts. 

      1.   Select "F4" at the Payroll main menu. 

      2.   With  the cursor  at  the  employee number  prompt,  type in  the
           account number  you wish to  change.  If  you wish to  accept the
           default account press ENTER.  To choose a different account, move
           the highlighted pointer through the  account list that appears on
           the screen by using the up and down keypad arrows. 

      3.   Because  the  account number  you  have  entered is  an  existing
           employee number, the system prompts: 


                    ACTIVE ACCOUNT Modify/Delete/Quit(M/D/Q):_ 


           Answer this prompt with "M".  You are now in the change mode. 

      4.   Make any desired changes the existing  data, but you are not able
           to change  the account  number.  Press ENTER  to leave  any field
           unchanged. 

      5.   If you want to go back to a previous field while you are changing
           data, you may do so by pressing the Backspace key. 

      6.   After you make the necessary changes to your data, press ENTER or
           the  PgDn  key  until  the system  prompts  "Are  inputs  correct
           (Y/N):_".  Type  "Y" to save your  changes.  If you enter  a "N",
           the system will ignore all changes  and the cursor will return to
           the account number field. 


      3g - DELETING EMPLOYEES 

      When deleting  employees, there  cannot be  any transactions  for that
      employee  number.  If  there are  transactions for  the account  to be
      deleted, FINANCE MANAGER will not allow the account to be deleted. 



                                       Page 17
                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll



      Be sure  to practice deleting accounts  on your demo WORK  file before
      you delete a "real" employee from your "real" data files. 

      To delete an employee account follow the steps below: 

      1.   Select "F4" at the Payroll main menu. 

      2.   Then enter the  number of the account to be  deleted while at the
           employee account number prompt.  The system will then prompt: 


                    ACTIVE ACCOUNT Modify/Delete/Quit(M/D/Q):_ 


      3.  Select "D".  The system will prompt  you "Are you sure (Y/N):_" If
          you answer with "Y" the account will then be deleted. 


      3h - SUGGESTED METHOD FOR SETTING BEGINNING BALANCES 

      When setting up your Payroll,  as well as employee beginning balances,
      you must  be sure that  you are in  balance with your  General Ledger.
      This is a vitally important procedure to remember when setting up your
      books.  The following steps will insure that you are in balance: 

      1.   Set up all  your employee accounts with a  zero beginning balance
           first. 

      2.   You then have two options to enter any prior payroll balance: 

      3.   You  may  enter them  in  the  Employee Beginning  Balance  input
           fields.  These  balances will  then show  as a  lump sum  on your
           year-to-date  Payroll  Register  report  and W-2s.   If  you  are
           starting a new accounting year  and have preexisting vacation and
           sick leave  balances we recommend  for those  to be entered  as a
           total sum in there corresponding fields. 

      4.   Or you may enter them as individual transactions (see section 4),
           broken down by prior pay periods for each employee.  We recommend
           entering   all  your   prior  payroll   balances  as   individual
           transactions.  Then  enter manual checks to  pay all transactions
           just  entered.   As these  transactions  will  be posted  to  the
           General  Ledger  you should  ensure  that  you have  removed  any
           previously entered G/L transactions to avoid duplicate data. 

      5.   After  all   beginning  balances  have  been   entered,  print  a
           year-to-date  (Jan-Dec) Payroll  Register  report  to verify  all
           current  employee  balances for  your  selected  pay period.   To
           verify the correct balances for  sick leave and holiday print the
           Vacation & Sick Report. 

      6.   After you  have verified all account  balances you are now  up to
           date  and fully  operational.  If  you want  your General  Ledger
           Payroll account  to reflect the  current balances of  all Payroll
           accounts, you should go to the Payroll Utility main menu and post
           the  transactions to  the  General Ledger.   See  section 7c  for
           detailed information. 

           Note: Make  sure   that  you   delete  any   preexisting  payroll

                 transactions in  the General  Ledger, so  they will  not be
                 listed twice.

                            SECTION FOUR - TRANSACTIONS 

      4a - WHAT ARE TRANSACTIONS 

      One transaction should  be entered into the payroll system  at the end
      of each pay period.  Each entered  transactions will become a check to
      the  employee when  paid.  Thus  only enter  one transaction  for each
      payroll check needed. 


      4b - TRANSACTION DATA FIELDS 

      The  transaction input  fields  are described  below.   Each of  these
      fields has a  default which is the last data  entered into that field.
      This default saves keystrokes when doing repetitive inputting. 

      EMPLOYEE NUMBER     This is  the account  number for the  employee for
                          which you  are entering a transaction.   Note that
                          the employee's name will automatically appear when
                          an active account number is entered as well as the
                          frequency of the employee's pay.  REQUIRED.

                          date on the check).  REQUIRED. 


      HOURS PAID          These are  the total number of  hours for regular,
                          overtime, sick, vacation  or holiday, the employee
                          will  be paid  for this  pay period.   Notice that
                          Finance Manager  will automatically  calculate the
                          number of  regular hours  paid for  each employee.
                          REQUIRED, HOURLY EMPLOYEES ONLY. 


      OTHER EARNINGS 1&2  These  input   fields  would  include   any  other
                          compensation the employee  receives (car allowance
                          etc.) If  this compensation should be  taxed enter
                          "Y" in the  following "Taxable(Y/N)" field.  Enter
                          "N" if this compensation  should not be taxed.  If
                          "N" is selected these amounts WILL NOT be shown on
                          the employees W-2.  OPTIONAL 

      OTHER DEDUCTION     This  deduction  can  be  used  for  miscellaneous
                          deductions from  the employees paycheck.   If this
                          deduction  should  be  taxed   enter  "Y"  in  the
                          following "Taxable(Y/N)" field.  Enter "N" if this
                          deduction should not be taxed.  These amounts WILL
                          be  shown   in  box  10  of   the  employees  W-2.
                          OPTIONAL.

                          account  number to  which the  Other Earnings  and
                          Other Deduction amount fields correspond (e.g. for
                          a car  allowance other  earnings you  would select
                          your   G/L   car   allowance   expense   account).
                          OPTIONAL.

      4c - GETTING FAMILIAR WITH TRANSACTIONS 

      Before entering your "real" transactions, follow the procedures listed
      below by practicing with the WORK demo accounts.  This will aid you in
      learning how to enter transactions without using live data. 

      1.   From  the  Payroll Main  Menu  select  "F1".   You will  then  be
           prompted for the following information: 

      Employee Number   :_____ 
      Pay Period Ending :__-__-__ 
      HOURS PAID:Regular:_______Overtime:_______Sick:_______Vacation:_______ 
                 Holiday:_______                         TOTAL HOURS:    

      Other Earnings 1:__________ Taxable(Y/N):_ Account:____ 
      Other Earnings 2:__________ Taxable(Y/N):_ Account:____ 
      Other Deduction :__________ Taxable(Y/N):_ Account:____ 


      2.   The cursor will be positioned at the "Employee Number" prompt. 

           On  the lower  half  of  the screen  you  will  see the  existing
           employee accounts appear.  Seeing  these accounts is helpful when
           you are selecting employees. 

           The selected employee  account is highlighted.  In  order to move
           to other accounts,  press the up or down arrow  keys on the right
           keypad.  If you  move the highlighting pointer down  a few lines,
           notice how the list scrolls. 

           You  may  select  an  existing   account  number  by  moving  the
           highlighting pointer up  or down to the desired  account and then
           pressing the ENTER key. 

           This advanced feature allows you  to scroll through your employee
           account listing without ever having to memorize, or even type in,
           an account number. 

      3.   To return to the previous menu, press ESC. 

      Before entering  your own transactions, practice  adding, changing and
      deleting  transactions  by  using  the WORK  demo  files.   This  will
      familiarize you  with how  to enter,  change, or  delete transactions.
      Changing  and  deleting transactions  is  described  in the  following
      sections. 


      4d - ENTERING TRANSACTIONS 

      As you enter each transaction,  FINANCE MANAGER saves this information
      and updates  the employee  listing as appropriate.    

      1.   In order  to begin  entering transactions,  select "F1"  from the
           Payroll Main Menu.   You will then be prompted  for the following
           information:

      Other Earnings 2:__________ Taxable(Y/N):_ Account:____ 
      Other Deduction :__________ Taxable(Y/N):_ Account:____ 


      2.   When entering  transactions, the last transaction  entered always
           provides the  default data (unless  of course, this is  your very
           first  transaction).  To  accept the  default data,  simply press
           ENTER and  you will move to  the next field.  In  order to change
           data, simply type in the new data and then press ENTER. 

      3.   First enter the employee number: 

                                 Employee Num:SMIT 

           The existing employees will appear on the screen.  You may either
           select an employee from this list  by using keypad arrow keys (as
           described earlier), or  you may type in the  employee number.  If
           you are using the keypad arrow keys,  be sure the Num Lock key is
           off. 

           NOTE: When you  enter the  employee number the  following message
                 appears: 

                                FREQUENCY:BIWEEKLY 

           This message reminds you of the employee's pay schedule.   


      4.   Enter the date the Pay Period ends: 

                            Pay Period Ending:05-08-89 


      5.   Enter  the total  number of  hours for  regular, overtime,  sick,
           vacation or holiday to be paid: 

           Regular:80.00__ Overtime:3.00___ Sick:0.00____ Vacation:0.00____ 
           Holiday:0.00____ 


      6.   Enter any  other earnings and/or  deductions, as well  as taxable
           flags, and account numbers: 

             Other Earnings 1:10.00_____ Taxable(Y/N):Y Account:5230 
             Other Earnings 2:0_________ Taxable(Y/N):_ Account:____ 
             Other Deduction :0_________ Taxable(Y/N):_ Account:____ 


      7.   At  this point  FINANCE MANAGER  will calculate  and display  the
           deductions for this transaction.  After the automatic calculation
           is made the following message will be displayed: 

                        Change Payroll Calculations (Y/N):_

                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll


           Note: Answer this message with "Y" if you need to manually change
                 the  computers  calculated payroll  deductions.   Otherwise
                 answer with  "N".  If you  had preexisting payroll  or were
                 calculating  earnings and  deductions differently  than the
                 automatic method  used by Finance Manager  you would answer
                 the above  prompt with  "Y".  You will  then be  allowed to
                 change each of the calculated amounts. 

      8.   If you are  entering a transaction and  you want to go  back to a
           previous field, use the Backspace key. 

      9.   You may abort the transaction at any time by pressing ESC. 

      10.  After  you have  entered all  your transactions  the system  will
           prompt you: 

                            Are inputs correct (Y/N):Y 

           Answer the prompt  with "Y" if you wish to  save the transaction.
           The cursor will then automatically  return to the Employee Number
           field for the next transaction.  If you answer this prompt with a
           "N", you will  return to the Employee Number field  and all prior
           inputs will be ignored and the  cursor returns to the first input
           field. 

      11.  After you have  entered all your transactions, press  the ESC key
           to return to the Payroll Main Menu. 


      4e - CHANGING EXISTING TRANSACTIONS 

      If you  discover an error in  an earlier transaction, or  if you would
      like to change previously  entered information, FINANCE MANAGER allows
      you  to  do  so.   Outlined  below are  the  procedures  for  changing
      previously entered transactions. 

      1.   Select "F2" at the Payroll Main Menu. 

      2.   The system  prompts you for  "ENTER DATA FOR  PAYROLL TRANSACTION
           SEARCH". 

      3.   Enter data in the fields you want to search for.  For example, if
           you want to  search for all transactions which have  a pay period
           ending  date of  "05-06-89", you  would  move to  the Pay  Period
           Ending field and  enter the date.  Upper and lower  case does not
           matter in  alphanumeric fields, and  you do not have  to complete
           the field.   For example, if you  entered only the first  part of
           the date  "05", FINANCE MANAGER  will find all dates  which begin
           with "05"  (i.e.  "05-06-89").   You could  also add  an employee
           number parameter to  the search and, consequently,  find only the
           "05" pay period dates for a particular employee. 

           Any field  left blank  is an  assumed wild  card for  that field.
           Thus if you  leave ALL of the fields blank,  all transactions are
           selected by the search.  Either press ENTER or the PgDn key until
           you  are prompted  with "Are  Inputs Correct  (Y/N):_".  If  your
           entries are correct enter "Y".  If  you enter "N" you will return
           to the first input screen to start again. 

           To assist you in finding an employee or chart of accounts account


                                       Page 23
                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll


           number, pressing  the "F2" key  while at the  corresponding input
           field will display a pop-up  accounts window.  You can now scroll
           through your accounts listing  and select the appropriate account
           to search for.   Pressing "Enter" or "Backspace"  will remove the
           pop-up accounts window. 

      4.   Next, FINANCE  MANAGER searches  for all  transactions containing
           the values you have specified.  As each transaction is displayed,
           the program displays the following prompt: 

                Modify/Delete/Continue/Reverse/Begin/End/+/-/Quit:_ 

           You must select M,D,C,R,B,E,+,-, or Q. Where: 

                M = Modify (change) transaction shown. 
                D = Delete (remove) transaction shown. 
                C = Continue (find next transaction that matches search). 
                R = Reverse  continue (find  prior transaction  that matches
                    search). 
                B = Beginning (go to first transaction in file). 
                E = Ending (go to last transaction in file). 
                + = Go to next consecutive transaction in file. 
                - = Go to prior consecutive transaction in file. 
                Q = Quit transaction search. 

      5.   As long  as you  continue to  answer the  above prompt  with "C",
           FINANCE   MANAGER  continues   searching  for   all  transactions
           containing the values you have specified.  Selecting "R" does the
           same as "C" except it searches backwards. 

      6.   Answering  the  prompt with  a  "+",  causes FINANCE  MANAGER  to
           display the  next consecutive  transaction; a  "-" shows  you the
           previous transaction (regardless of search parameters). 

      7.   Entering a "B" or an "E" will take you to the Beginning or End of
           the transaction file respectively.  It ignores search parameters. 

      8.   When the  search function  displays the  transaction you  wish to
           change, answer the prompt with an "M" (Modify). 

      9.   You are now  in the change mode.  Remember, ENTER  leaves a field
           unchanged.  Change data  in any field by typing in  the new value
           for the  given field.  If  you change any payroll  number FINANCE
           MANAGER  will  recalculate  the  earnings,  deductions,  employer
           liability and  accrued vacation and  sick hours at the  bottom of
           the screen. 

      10.  FINANCE MANAGER will tell you if the transaction has already been
           posted  to your  General  Ledger.  If  the  transaction has  been
           posted  you will  not  be  able to  make  ANY  changes.  This  is
           necessary to  avoid out-of-balance  conditions with  your General
           Ledger.   

           If  you need  to change  the fields  of a  posted transaction  we
           recommend  that  you  enter  a new  transaction  to  reflect  any
           adjustment to the original transaction. 

      11.  If you  have made  a mistake, or  you would like  to return  to a
           previous field, simply use the Backspace key.  Use the ESC key to
           ignore your changes and return to the Main Menu. 


                                       Page 24
                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll



      12.  After you  have made all  necessary changes to  your transactions
           the program will prompt you "Are inputs correct (Y/N):_".  Answer
           "Y" if you wish to save them.  The cursor will then return to the
           first input screen  and you can continue on.  Answer  "N" and the
           system  will ignore  all changes  and return  to the  first input
           field. 

      13.  If  you press  the  ESC key  the system  will  prompt you:  "FIND
           ANOTHER (Y/N):_"  if you  answer "Y" your  cursor returns  to the
           first input screen.  Answer "N" you will return to the main menu. 


      4f - DELETING TRANSACTIONS 

      To delete or remove a transaction PERMANENTLY, do the following: 

      1.   Select "F2" at the Payroll Main Menu. 

      2.   Enter search  data and find  desired transaction as  described in
           "Changing Transactions". 

      3.   When  the transaction  you wish  to  delete is  displayed on  the
           screen, answer "D" at the prompt below. 

                Modify/Delete/Continue/Reverse/Begin/End/+/-/Quit:

      5.   After you  have deleted the  desired transaction(s), you  may use
           the  "Sort" function.   (See  Section Seven  "Other features  and
           functions   -   Sorting    Transactions.")   When   sorting   the
           transactions,  the program  frees disk  space which  was formerly
           used by the now deleted transactions. 

      PAID (Not posted) To delete a  paid (not posted)  transaction you must 
      TRANSACTIONS:     first void the check and then you will be allowed to
                        delete the transaction. 

      PAID & POSTED     To delete a paid and posted transaction all you have 
      TRANSACTIONS:     to do  is delete  the transaction.   Finance Manager
                        will automatically delete the transaction and create
                        a reversal transaction to be  posted to the G/L next
                        time you do a posting. 


      4g - POINTS TO REMEMBER 

      When  searching for  transactions remember  that the  transaction file
      will be  shown in  the order  it was  last sorted  by. See  section 7b
      "Sorting Transactions" for more information. 

      When you delete a posted  transaction, Finance Manager will remove the
      transaction from the payroll system as  well as make a reversing entry
      to be posted to the General Ledger.   The net effect will be as if the
      transaction was never entered.

                              SECTION FIVE - REPORTS 


      The Payroll  Reports Menu allows  you to  generate a full  spectrum of
      Payroll reports from your data base.   The reports menu ("F3" from the
      Payroll Main Menu) appears as follows: 

                     --------- PAYROLL REPORTS MENU --------- 
                     |                                      |

      Reports can be generated to show results for a specific month, a range
      of months, a quarter,  a year, a pay period, etc.   All reports may be
      generated at any time and for any 12 month range.  This means that you
      are not limited to printing a report only once, and it also means that
      you can print a report for a prior period as well. 

      Samples of  each report are  shown in Appendix  A, and may  be printed
      while using the DEMO accounts. 


      5a - GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR GENERATING REPORTS 

      While printing any report you  may, if desired, interrupt the printing
      in one of two ways: 

      PAUSE THE PRINTER:    When you  are printing reports on  your printer,
                            you may pause the  printing by pressing any key.
                            Please keep  in mind  that most printers  have a
                            print   buffer.     Consequently,   the   report
                            continues to  print until  the buffer  is empty.
                            Pressing  any  key   again  will  continue  your
                            printout.  This  function will  not work  if you
                            are sending reports to the screen, since reports
                            will stop automatically as each screen is full. 

      STOP THE PRINTER:     If while printing, you  wish to stop the printer
                            and return  to the menu,  all you have to  do is
                            press the  "Esc" key.  Please keep  in mind that
                            most printers  have a print buffer,  causing the
                            report to continue to  print until the buffer is
                            empty.  You  will, however,  return to  the menu
                            immediately. 






                                       Page 26
                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll


      When generating  reports, you  have three output  destination options.
      First, you may send the reports to  the screen.  Second, if you have a
      printer,  you can  print  a hard  copy.  Finally,  you  can send  your
      reports  to a  disk file.   With this  useful option,  reports can  be
      stored and then printed at a later date. 

      This  "Destination" prompt  is an  option  for each  of the  available
      reports.  To select the destination, answer the prompt below: 

                         TO SCREEN/PRINTER/DISK (S/P/D):__ 

      If you  select "D"  for disk, the  system will prompt  you for  a disk
      "filename".  Enter  a filename  of up to  eight characters.   The file
      will be  saved on your data  disk, with the file  extension of ".RPT".
      If a file  with the name entered already exists,  the system will tell
      you so and ask if you want to delete the old file.  If you answer "N",
      the new report will be appended to the already existing disk file. 

      For some  reports, you also  need to  specify reporting dates  via the
      "Date" prompt.  The date prompt appears as follows: 


                           ENTER DATE RANGE FOR REPORTS: 
                               STARTING Month:__ Year:__ 
                                 ENDING Month:__ Year:__ 


      These  dates  determine which  months  and  years  are shown  on  your
      reports.  The  ending month and year  must be within twelve  months of
      the  starting month  and  year (maximum  12 month  range).   To get  a
      year-to-date report  you might  select the  dates 1-89  through 12-89.
      Likewise, if  you want a first  quarter report you should  select 1-89
      through 3-89.

      When entering prompts for reports, remember  that you may back up to a
      previous field by pressing the Backspace  key.  If you want to go back
      to the reports menu while you are at the input screen, press ESC. 


      5b - PRINTING THE PAYROLL JOURNAL 

      This  report  is  a  listing  of all  transactions  entered  during  a
      specified period of  time and shows which General  Ledger accounts are
      credited and debited. 

      When  printing  the  PAYROLL  JOURNAL  (F1), be  sure  to  employ  the
      following procedures: 

          a.  Select "F1" from the reports menu. 

          b.  The following screen will appear: 


                           TO SCREEN/PRINTER/DISK (S/P/D):_ 


                           SELECT PAID,UNPAID OR ALL (P,U,A) :_ 
                           ENTER DATE RANGE FOR REPORTS: 
                                     STARTING Month:__ Year:__ 
                                       ENDING Month:__ Year:__

                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll




          c.  First, type in the destination for your report. 

          d.  Then, enter  the type of  transactions to be included  in this
              report.  If you enter "P",  only the paid transactions will be
              printed.  If you enter "U",  only the unpaid transactions will
              be  printed.   If you  enter  "A",  all transactions  will  be
              printed. 

          e.  Finally, enter  the date range  wanted for your  report.  This
              report  is  compared   to  the  Period  Ending   date  of  the
              transactions. 

          f.  The report will then be printed. 

              NOTE: If  the message  "LOAD PRINTER  WITH AT  LEAST 11"  WIDE
                    PAPER" comes up while you  are waiting for the report to
                    print, your settings for  printing in compressed mode is
                    not  set  up  correctly  in the  G/L  System  Utilities.
                    Please check your printer manual for the correct control
                    codes. 


      5c - PRINTING THE PAYROLL REGISTER 

      This report gives in detail a  gross total of all earnings, deductions
      and liabilities for the selected pay period. 

      When  printing the  PAYROLL  REGISTER (F2),  the following  procedures
      apply: 

          a.  Select "F2" from the reports menu. 

          b.  The following screen will appear: 


                             TO SCREEN/PRINTER/DISK (S/P/D):_ 


                             SELECT PAID,UNPAID OR ALL (P,U,A):_ 
                             ENTER DATE RANGE FOR REPORTS:

                     ---------------------------------------- 

      We will  discuss each  of the  above menu  selections in  the sections
      which follow. 


      6a - PRINTING CHECKS 

      Load  your printer  with your  pre-printed continuous-form  checks and
      check to be sure you have  set up the Payroll configuration (utilities
      menu) for the  checks you will be using (Nebs check form # 9001). 

      Select "F1"  from the  checks menu  and you will  be prompted  for the
      following information: 

      NOTE: In order to  print continuous form checks you need  an 85 column
            printer. 

                        Enter DATE for Checks:__-__-__ 
                        Enter NEXT Check Number:____ 
                        G/L Check Account Number:____ 
                        Payroll for type(A,W,B,S,M):_ 

          a.  Enter the date you want printed on your checks. 

          b.  Enter  the check  number of  the  first check  in the  printer
              (FINANCE  MANAGER will  not print  the check  number on  check
              lineups).   If  your  checks  do not  have  pre-printed  check
              numbers,  enter the  number you  wish to  have printed  on the
              first  LIVE   (non-line  up)  check.   FINANCE   MANAGER  will
              automatically  increment  the  checks  numbers  for  the  live
              printed checks.

                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll


          c.  Enter  the  General Ledger  checking  account  number for  the
              checks  you are  writing.  It  is important  that you  use the
              correct  G/L  account number  otherwise  your  funds for  this
              check(s) will come out of  the wrong account.  Notice when you
              reach  this  section, how  FINANCE  MANAGER  will display  the
              account number listing on your screen  so you will not have to
              memorize any account numbers. 

          d.  Enter the  category for which  you want checks to  be printed.
              Enter   "A"  (all),   "W"   (weekly),   "B"  (biweekly),   "S"
              (semi-monthly) or "M" (monthly). 

          e.  After entering  the category FINANCE  MANAGER will ask  you if
              you want printer lineup. 

                          Print Alignment Pattern (Y/N):_ 

              Answer with a "Y" until you have the checks properly lined up.
              When you  answer this prompt with  a "N", your checks  will be
              printed. 

      Until you answer the alignment pattern with a "N", you may at any time
      abort the  check printing process and  return to the menu  by pressing
      the ESC key. 


      6b - VOIDING PRINTED CHECKS 

      Check written to  a specific employee may be voided  by selecting "F2"
      from the checks  menu.  This function will allow you  to void the last
      check written  and also mark  the transaction(s) unpaid  again, either
      computer  generated  or  manual.   Upon selecting  this  function  the
      following screen will appear: 

                          Enter Check Number to Void:____ 


      If you  cannot remember which check  number you wanted to  void simply
      hit ENTER.   FINANCE MANAGER  will display  on the  lower half  of the
      screen all checks written, starting with the last one. 


      6c - ENTERING MANUAL CHECKS 

      Another great feature  included in the FINANCE  MANAGER Payroll module
      is  the  ability  to  enter  checks manually.   This  allows  you  the
      flexibility of  hand writing  checks.  You simply  write the  check by
      hand  if you  do not  want  to do  a full  check  run or  do not  have
      pre-printed checks. 

      In order to use this feature,  select "F3" from the Checks menu.  Upon
      selecting this function you will be prompted as listed below: 


                    Enter DATE for Checks      :__-__-__ 
                    Enter NEXT Check Number    :____ 
                    G/L Check Account Number   :____ 
                    Payroll for type(A,W,B,S,M):_ 

      Enter the DATE, CHECK NUMBER, G/L  ACCOUNT NUMBER AND PAY FREQUENCY as


                                       Page 37
                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll


      in  section 6a.   This procedure  is just  like printing  computerized
      checks, except that no check will be printed. 

      Finance Manager will then display all the transactions (one at a time)
      that are not paid so you can select which ones to pay. 

      When a transaction to  be paid is found you will  be prompted for "PAY
      THIS EMPLOYEE".  Answer with  a "Y" to pay or "N" to  skip and not pay
      the transaction. 

      After all non-paid transactions are shown you will then be returned to
      the Checks Menu for further processing.

                           OTHER FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS 


      The remainder of the features and  functions of the Payroll Module are
      contained on the Payroll Utilities Menu.  These features are also very
      powerful  and  important  functions  of this  module.   To  use  these
      features select "F6"  from the Payroll Main Menu.   The following menu
      will be shown:

                     ---------------------------------------- 

      In this section we will discuss each  function as well as its uses and
      features.  Since  setting up  the Configuration settings  are required
      before you  will be able  to enter  any transactions, we  will discuss
      this selection first. 


      7a - CONFIGURATION SETTINGS 

      The configuration settings allow you  to configure this module to your
      specific company, and to its  specific General Ledger account numbers.
      This  configuration  is  very  important  to  your  transactions,  for
      pre-printed continuous form  checks and to the  General Ledger account
      numbers used.   We recommend using  Nebs checks form #9001  and either
      standard business  window envelopes  or Nebs  form #775  DU-O-VUE Dual
      window  envelopes.  For  the W-2s  we recommend  using Nebs  W-2s form
      #9852.  Nebs toll free order number is 1-800-225-9550.

                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll


      By selecting "F4"  from the utilities menu you will  see the following
      screen:

                                                                       Row Col 
      CHECK WRITING:Print Check#(Y/N):_Print Address(Y/N):_Name Location:__ __ 


      The configuration  settings must be set  up for each set  of books you
      have.   Be sure  to  carefully employ  the  following procedures  when
      setting up the configuration settings. 

      Prior to setting up this configuration,  you must set up (add) several
      Payroll accounts to  your G/L Chart of Accounts.   These accounts must
      be active accounts in  your G/L Chart of Accounts in  order to be able
      to use  the Payroll Module  correctly (i.e.  do not use  these account
      numbers for  any General  Ledger transactions  - only  for use  by the
      Payroll module). 

      These accounts  are used  as interface  accounts and  posting accounts
      between the  Payroll module and  your General Ledger module.   You can
      not use  the Payroll module  without these important accounts  even if
      you want to  use the Payroll module  as a stand alone  module.  Set up
      one of each,  of the following accounts in your  G/L Chart of Accounts
      for Payroll: 

           a.  FICA Liability (type L) account 
           b.  FICA Expense (type E) account 
           c.  FUTA Liability (type L) account 
           d.  FUTA Expense (type E) account 
           e.  SUTA Liability (type L) account 
           f.  SUTA Expense (type E) account 
           g.  SDI Liability (type L) account 
           h.  SDI Expense (type E) account 
           i.  Other payroll tax Liability (type L) account 
           j.  Other payroll tax Expense (type E) account 
           k.  Federal Withholding (type L) account 
           l.  State Withholding (type L) account 
           m.  City Withholding (type L) account 
           n.  Salary & Wages (type E) account 
           o.  Checking account (type A) if not already set up 
           p.  Extra Deductions (type L) account

      When setting up the Payroll check printing feature for your continuous
      checks  and   other  forms,   you  must   specify  in   the  following
      configuration what  and where  you want to  have the  following fields
      printed: 

      ID#'S FED           Enter your employer  federal identification number
                          as it will be listed on your W-2 forms.           

      STATE               Enter your employer state identification number as
                          it will be listed on your W-2 forms. 

      COMPANY             Enter your  company name as  it will be  listed on
                          your W-2 forms. 

      ADDRESS 1           Enter the  address of your  company as it  will be
                          listed on your W-2 forms. 

      ADDRESS 2           You may enter a second address for your company as
                          it will be listed on your W-2 forms.   

      CITY                Enter your company's city. 

      STATE               Enter your company's two  letter state or province
                          code. 

      ZIPCODE             Enter your company's zipcode or postal code. 

      DETAIL POSTING      Allows the option of  posting transactions to your 
      TO G/L (Y/N)        General  Ledger  in   detail  or  summary  format.
                          Selecting  detail posting  will post  each Payroll
                          transaction   as  a   individual  General   Ledger
                          transaction and  you can  post at any  time; while
                          answering "N" will  cause the Payroll transactions
                          to be  grouped and  summarized when posted  to the
                          General Ledger.  Which ever  method you choose the
                          financial results will be  the same.  There is one
                          other  difference,  however,  if  you  select  the
                          detail  posting,  the actual  Payroll  transaction
                          date  will be  used  when posting  to the  General
                          Ledger, while summary posting  will prompt you for
                          a POSTING  DATE   and  will  post   every  entered
                          transaction to  the posting date (even  those with
                          different month dates).  If you are a beginner and
                          do not have many transactions, we suggest that you
                          select "Y" at this prompt. 

      WORK DAYS/          Enter the actual number of days your employees 
      YEAR                will  work  each   year  including  all  holidays,
                          usually 260 (52x5) days. 

      HOURS PER           Enter the number of hours your employees will work 
      DAY, WEEK,          for the pay periods listed.  When calculating for 
      SEMI-MONTH,         Semi-Month and Month, calculate the hours per 
      MONTH               year.  Example:  If your  employees work  40 hours
                          per week and are paid semi-monthly, multiply 40 by
                          52  weeks  in the  year,  divided  by the  24  pay
                          periods  per year  to  equal 86.67  hours per  pay
                          period.

                          At the  "Print Address(Y/N):_" prompt,  answer "Y"
                          if you want your  employee's address to be printed
                          on  his check,  or  "N"  if you  do  not want  his

                          numbers will place the name and address so that it
                          will show correctly when  using a window envelope.
                          (Standard business window envelope uses Row 34 and
                          COL 11). 

      FINANCE MANAGER  will then ask  you "Are inputs correct  (Y/N):Y".  If
      you take the default of "Y"  then you be notified that FINANCE MANAGER
      is saving your  configuration and then you will return  to the Payroll
      Utilities menu.   If you answer "N"  the cursor will return  to "ID#'S
      FED" field and you can start again. 


      7b - SORTING TRANSACTIONS 

      The Payroll module normally keeps  transactions organized in the order
      in which they are input.  The Sort function allows the user to sort or
      organize  the  transactions  by:  date  of  input,  transaction  date,
      employee order or check number order. 

      The sort  procedure is not  a required feature  but it is  useful, for
      example,  when  printing  transaction  journals  or  employee  balance
      reports and you would like to insure that all transactions are in date
      order.  To  accomplish this, all you  have to do is  select date order
      sort.  It  would be a  good practice to  sort the transactions  once a
      month before  printing your reports.   The sort order does  not affect
      any  report balances  and it  is purely  for cosmetic  purposes.  When
      sorting  transactions this  will also  free  up disk  space which  was
      formally occupied by deleted transactions. 

      To start  sorting transactions, select  "F1" at the  Payroll Utilities
      Menu.  The following screen appears: 


                     ----------- SELECT SORT ORDER ---------- 
                     |                                      | 
                     |   ESC  Return to Utilities Menu      | 
                     |   F1   Transaction Input Order       | 
                     |   F2   Date Order                    | 
                     |   F3   Employee Order                | 
                     |   F4   Check Number Order            | 
                     |                                      |

                     |                                      | 
                     |                                      | 
                     |                                      | 
                     |   ENTER YOUR SELECTION:              | 
                     |                                      | 
                     ---------------------------------------- 


      1.  Select the order in which you  would like to sort the transactions
          by. 

      2.  FINANCE MANAGER automatically sorts all transactions. 

      3.  Press any key to exit and return to the Payroll Main Menu when the
          sort is completed. 

      If you  have more transactions than  memory can hold at  one time, the

      default disk  drive is used  to store  a temporary file  while sorting
      transactions.   It  is  important  to remember,  therefore,  that  the
      default drive must have adequate remaining disk space, and it must NOT
      be "write protected" . 

      The system  will tell if  there is not  enough memory on  your default
      drive  to sort  your file,  the sort  will abort  and you  must put  a
      formatted, blank disk in your  default drive (usually drive A:) before
      selecting your sort order again. 


      7c - POSTING TO THE GENERAL LEDGER 

      Payroll Utilities  Menu selection "F2" will  post transactions entered
      into  this  module to  your  General  Ledger accounts.   Depending  on
      whether  you  selected  the  detail  or summary  post  option  in  the
      configuration (described  above) your Payroll transactions  are posted
      according to the option you selected. 

      You'll  be pleased  to know  that this  posting procedure  is a  smart
      procedure.  It will only post  the transactions which have not already
      been posted.  Because of this  incredible time saving feature, you may
      accidentally  post as  many times  as you  wish without  worry of  any
      errors or double posting. 

      Note: This posting procedure will  only post the transactions (checks)
            which have already been paid. 

      This  posting process  is mandatory  in  order to  interface with  the
      General Ledger.   Without running  this procedure, no  transactions or
      activity  from  this   module  will  shown  on   your  General  Ledger
      reports. 

      NOTE: After this posting procedure is complete, the transactions which
            were posted can no longer be changed. 

      Because of this unique safety feature, we recommend that you only post
      after  you are  absolutely  sure all  transactions  have been  entered
      correctly and that any adjustments  have been made.  Generally, a good
      rule for you  to follow is to  post transactions once a  month, on the
      last day of that month. 

      After you  have run this procedure,  you can print any  General Ledger
      reports, and all  paid payroll from this module  will be automatically
      included in your General Ledger reports. 

      In order to  run this procedure, select "F2" on  the Payroll Utilities
      menu.   If you  selected the  detail posting  option the  posting will
      commence.   If you  did not  select detail  posting you  will then  be
      prompted for a posting date.  This prompt is as follows: 

                       Enter Post Transaction Date:__-__-__ 

      When using the summary post option this date will show for all of your
      Payroll transactions  in the  General Ledger as  the date  of posting.
      Usually this date  should be the current date (i.e.  the last date for
      the  current  month).  If  detail  posting  was selected  the  Payroll
      transactions in your  General Ledger will have the same  dates as they
      do in the Payroll Journal.

      7d - PAYROLL TAX TABLES 

      WARNING: It  is very  important that  you  enter your  Tax Table  data
               correctly.   Hooper International  assumes  no liability  for
               errors.   We  consider  it  mandatory to  test  your  payroll
               deductions  by manually  calculating your  payroll to  verify
               that all deductions are correct. 

      The payroll tax tables contain all  of the Federal, State and City tax
      information  as well  as  any other  information  about Earned  Income
      Credit for your particular state.  FINANCE MANAGER needs these numbers
      to calculate your employee's taxes  and withholdings.  Many states and
      cities have different percentages and  these percentages are liable to
      change every  year.  With  FINANCE MANAGER you  can modify  the tables
      yourself to keep them current with changing tax laws. 

      By selecting  "F5" from the  Payroll Utilities  menu you will  see the
      following screen:

      10. Enter the  percentage of the  employee's wages you  will withhold.
          Refer to  the same page  in the Federal Tax  Guide as you  did for
          number 7. 

                             PLUS PERCENTAGE:15_____% 


      When you finish entering all of the amounts in their respective fields
      press the PgDn key and FINANCE MANAGER will prompt "Are Inputs Correct
      (Y/N):_".  If you answer "Y" FINANCE MANAGER will save your inputs and
      the cursor will return to the Tax Table field.  Continue to enter your
      other tax  tables.  If you  enter "N" at  the prompt, the  cursor will
      return  to the  Tax Table  field and  will allow  you to  reenter your
      inputs.  It is very important that you enter the correct data into the
      correct fields  otherwise all of  your tax calculations will  be wrong
      for the entire year. 

      Continue entering  the Tax Table  information for your City  and State
      and the information for Earned Income Credit.  Please refer to the Tax
      Guides for your respective City and State.  Repeat steps 1-10 for each
      of the Tax tables you will need for your particular City and State. 

      After you have  entered all your Tax Table information  for each table
      that is  necessary for  your City  and State  and the  Advanced Income
      Credit information, make sure you  have saved your inputs by answering
      "Are Inputs Correct" before you  return to the Payroll Utlilities main
      menu. 


      7e - PRINTING END OF YEAR W-2s 

      This feature  of FINANCE  MANAGER will  print W-2  forms automatically
      without you having to figure out any of the amounts. 

      Load  your  printer  with   your  pre-printed  continuous  W-2  forms.
      Continuous W-2s can be ordered from Nebs.  Nebs toll free order number
      is 1-800-225-9550.  If  you do not have continuous W-2  forms the same
      information can be obtained from your Payroll Register Report. 

      Select "F6" from  the Payroll Utilities Menu and  FINANCE MANAGER will
      ask you to enter a city short name (to be placed in box 22 on the W-2)
      and ask if you want a  test printer lineup printed.  These prompts are
      as follows: 

                          Enter City short name:________ 
                          Print Alignment Pattern (Y/N):_ 

      First enter a eight character city  short name.  Next enter the "Print
      Alignment Pattern" prompt with a "Y"  until you have the W-2s properly
      lined up.   When you answer  this prompt with  an "N", your  W-2s will
      then be printed.   Until you answer the alignment pattern  with a "N",
      you  may abort  the W-2  printing process  and return  to the  menu by
      pressing the ESC key. 

      NOTE: Notice the warning at the bottom  of the screen that warns about
            Extra-Deductions  and  Non-taxable   Other  Earnings  being  not
            included on  the W-2 statement.   These amounts must  be entered
            manually in Box 16 or 16a as appropriate.

      the Payroll Utilities menu.

      8b - HELPFUL HINTS AND SUGGESTIONS 

        * Keep a CURRENT backup copy of  all your data files.  Each time you
          have finished entering new data make a copy of your data files and
          have at  least four set's  which you rotate.  This  will safeguard
          against loss of data due to a power failure or other problems. 

        * Use the  Shift PrtSc keys  to make a  hard copy of  current screen
          display. 

        * You  may run  this module  WITHOUT  the interface  to the  General
          Ledger module simply  by not posting to the General  Ledger (F2 on
          the  Utilities Menu).   The  system will,  however,  post to  your
          General Ledger  when you do  an End of  Period Posting (F3  on the
          Utilities Menu).   To totally avoid  any interface, simply  set up
          this module with a separate data file, using a different name than
          your General  Ledger data file  name.  You will, however,  have to
          set up a few dummy G/L accounts (the required G/L accounts need to
          run this module). 

        * When  printing checks,  be sure  that  your printer  can print  85
          column across.  Deviation  from this will result  in the inability
          to line up your pre-printed checks. 

        * The following explains how FINANCE MANAGER figures taxes: 

          1. FINANCE MANAGER figures the  yearly gross income by multiplying
             amount paid per pay period by either: 

                       12 for those employees paid monthly 
                       24 for those employees paid semi-monthly 
                       26 for those employees paid biweekly 
                       52 for those employees paid weekly 

          2. Subtracts deductions. 


                                       Page 49
                            FINANCE MANAGER II - Payroll



             Deductions =  Annual tax  deduction amount  (on the  tax table)
             times the number in the  State deduction field (in the employee
             account data base) 

             If the employee has more than  one deduction and the annual tax
             deduction amount (on the tax table) multiplied by the number in
             the state deduction  field (in the employee  account data base)
             is not correct  according to the state tax guide,  then you can
             add any additional amounts in the state exemption field (in the
             employee  account  data base).   For  example,  the annual  tax
             deduction  amount for  a  single deduction  is  $2,500 and  the
             annual tax deduction  amount for two deductions  is $3,000.  If
             the employee  has two deductions  you will enter $2,500  in the
             annual tax deduction amount field (on  the tax table) and a "1"
             in  the state  deduction field  (in the  employee account  data
             base).  1 times  $2,500 = $2,500.  Enter the  remaining $500 in
             the state annual exemption field  (in the employee account data
             base). 

          3. Subtracts  amount  in  State  annual exemption  field  (in  the
             employee account data base) 

          4. Subtracts Federal Income  Tax already paid if  you answered "Y"
             on the tax table and your state allows it to be deducted. 

          5. All of the above equals the annualized Taxable Income. 

          6. From  the Taxable  Income  FINANCE MANAGER  will calculate  the
             taxes that the employee will pay. 

          7. Finally, if your  state gives you a tax credit  enter the total
             dollar  amount in  the State  Annual  Tax Credit  field in  the
             employee account data base. 

          8. The annualized Payroll deduction is  then divided by the number
             of pay periods  in one year to give you  the deduction for this
             pay period. 

        * If you have multiple state payroll you have two options: 

           A. Set up  a set  of books for  each state and  then use  the G/L
              merge transactions  function to  combine the  G/L transactions
              into one set of books. 

           B. Using the  DOS copy command,  create different tax  tables for
              each state and save each one as a seperate filename.  Copy the
              one you need to the filename  of your set of books (e.g.  COPY
              COLORADO.TAX WORK.TAX to use Colorado tax tables).
