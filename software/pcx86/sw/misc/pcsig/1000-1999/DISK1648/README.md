## Information about "SHOP"

    Whether it's groceries, clothes, or supplies, SHOP can help make your
    shopping a little easier by keeping track of the money you spend.
    
    SHOP will store lists of items, their prices, and the date last
    purchased.  It is organized by store and by item category.  After a few
    diligent months using SHOP, you will have an accurate database of
    everything you regularly purchase.  Using the selection feature, items
    can be selected and then printed to produce an ordered shopping list
    with an estimated total cost.
    
    SHOP tracks household spending and cost inflation while making sure you
    always have the right amount of cash on hand, thereby saving you from
    those potentially embarrassing times at the checkout counter.  SHOP is
    quick and painless to use.  A hard disk is suggested for the serious
    shopper.
