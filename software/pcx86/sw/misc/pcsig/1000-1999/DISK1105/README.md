## Information about "BEST-PLAN 3 OF 3 (ALSO 690, 691)"

    BEST-PLAN is a mathematical modeling package which simplifys analysis
    with a build-in modeling language, a report writer and multiple
    analyses "what-if" capability thru a build-in database management
    system.
    
    The general goal of designing a linear programming planning system like
    BEST-PLAN was to put maximum analytical power into the hands
    of the people directly concerned with the problem, with only a
    minimum of specialized knowledge or experience on the part of the user,
    and at the same time give him the advantages of mathematical
    modeling for planning.
    
    LIMITATIONs in the DEMO PACKAGE: Systems operations are intended for
    demonstrations ONLY! Limitations are incorporated. The user is allowed
    only to execute the supplied samples. In summary:
    
    ~  The user CANNOT create a NEW problem/model.
    ~  The user CANNOT Optimize a master PLAN.
    ~  The user CANNOT modify the  BEST-PLAN  environment
    file  (BP-ENV.CON) other than change screen  color
    and disk assignments.
    ~  The problem size has been limited to 6,000 elements
    elements=(no. of rows) * (2 * no. of rows + no. of columns)
    
    System Requirements: 512K memory and a hard drive.
