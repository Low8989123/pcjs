              THINGS TO DO Program User Instructions (Version 4.05)
    Copyright (C) 1986, 1987 by Stan Christman, 1987 - All Rights Reserved
                See license information on last page (page 4)
      
         This program is a reminder list of Things To Do.  It includes a 
         Future reminder (tickler file) section, a Current section, plus 
         has an archive, or history, section.


         To start the program, enter THI at the DOS prompt.

         The following Commands are offered from the initial "Current" 
         screen.  For each option, you may hit the Command Number as a 
         single key entry (which means without <Enter>ing), or you may 
         use the letter that is shown in UPPER CASE for each Command:
          
         <Enter>-list ALL "Things To Do":  Gives a display of all current 
           Jobs currently active.  Listing will be sorted by Function or 
           by Priority, depending on option setting (as set by Command 8, 
           sort Order).

         1-List jobs: This is used to review a selected list of Things To 
           Do, or Job.  Each Job is assigned a function when entered, and 
           you are offered a list of the functions to select your listing 
           on.  The first letter is sufficient, and the <Enter> key means 
           all functions. 
          
         2-Add a job:  This is used to add a Job.  First, a description 
           is requested (up to 55 characters).  Then, a function is 
           picked, either using one of the existing ones by entering its 
           first letter (don't worry about upper or lower case), or a new 
           Function striking only <Enter>. 
         
           Hitting the "Tab" key, will cause "Due " to be added at the 
           end of the Description, which you can then add a date to. 
          
                 (A few words about Functions.  You may create new ones, 
                 up to maximum of 15, with up to six characters.  No two 
                 may use the same first character.  Also, there is always 
                 a <Space> function available, which you can use when no 
                 Function name is desired.) 
          
           Last, the priority is chosen from "A" (being high) to a 
           low of "E" (Default=E). 
          
         3-Edit a job: This is used to revise any aspect of a job entry.  
           The program will prompt you.  For the description, you may use 
           the Cursor, Delete, or Insert keys in your editing. 
          
         4-Remove a job: You will be asked to choose whether it will be 
           saved in the history file or simply erased.
          
         5-Defer a job: This code will allow you to move a job from the 
           current Things To Do list to the Future one.  The Effective 
           date can be chose relative to the current date (in 1 week, in 
           2 months, etc.), or by entering the date directly.

         THINGS Program User Instructions (Version 4.04)       Page 2
          
         6-eXit:  End of program.
          
         7-Print: For sending a listing of jobs to your printer.  Options 
           are offered to print one or all functions.


         8-change sort Order: This command toggles (changes back and 
           forth) from a PRIORITY to a FUNCTION primary sort on jobs are 
           they are listed or printed. 
          
         9-remove a Function:  To drop (or change) a Function name.  To 
           cancel a function name, simply respond to the input as 
           requested.  

             To change a function name, immediately after dropping the 
             old function name, edit one of the jobs that had been using 
             the deleted name, and when asked if the blank function name 
             is OK, type N(o).  Then type in the new function name.  It 
             will automatically be applied to all jobs that had been 
             using the old function name. 
          
         F-Future: Accesses the Future Things To Do part of the program.  
           Here, Jobs are saved for automatic call-up at a specified date 
           in the future.  When THINGS is run on or after that date, you 
           are advised at the beginning of the run that a job is being 
           loaded from the future file. 
          
         H-History: Accesses a search of the history file of Jobs that 
           were removed and saved in the history file.  More later.

         S-Sequence functions: See FUNCTION SEQUENCE CHANGES later.
         
        ===F10 PRIORITY COLOR changing code: This will access a screen
           with instructions on how to change the colors that are
           being used if the PRIORITY sort order is being used to
           display the different priorities.  If you don't like the
           ones I picked, proceed! 
          
          
         FUTURE THINGS TO DO
              The Menu commands for this section are as follows:
          
         <Enter>-List all:  Lists all jobs in the future file with their 
           effective dates.
          
         2-Add a job: To set up an entry.  You will be asked for the
           description, the function name, and the Effective Date.
           This can be entered relative to the current date (in 1 month, 
           etc.) or directly.  If the direct method is used, begin by 
           typing in the month in ALPHA (Jan...Feb.); and the computer 
           will finish the name as soon as it is unique.  Then enter the 
           day of the month with an <Enter> command.  Lastly, the current 
           year is suggested as the year.  Change the last digit for a 
           future year. 

  
         THINGS Program User Instructions (Version 4.04)      Page 3
                 
         3-Edit a job:  This is used to revise the text or the Effective 
           Date.  It is also used to access an optional feature for 
           REPEATING FUTURE JOBS.  When originally entered, future jobs 
           are assumed to be One-time.  During the Edit command, this can 
           be changed to Weekly, Bi-weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Semi-
           Annual, or Annual.  If one of these Repeating options is 
           chosen, then the future reminder will be repeated at the 
           selected frequency.  Jobs that have Repeating options have 
           the option shown in the list by a Cyan letter just to the left 
           of the date.
          
         4-Remove a job:  You will have the opportunity to confirm.
          
         6-eXit:  End program.

         7-Print: Prints a listing of the Future Jobs to the Printer.
          
         C or <Esc>-Return to Current: Goes to Current Jobs menu.  The C 
           command will return to a Current Jobs listing, while the <Esc> 
           command will return to the Current Jobs original menu.
                    
         HISTORY COMMAND
               Options are offered on which functions to list from: 
         Current, Archived (for no longer used functions), Both groups, 
         or an option to Select functions.  Then, the choice is offered 
         whether to list the results on screen, the printer, or a disk 
         file.  A choice is allowed on the time period to be reviewed.  
         After each screen, there are options to quit, to edit, or to 
         continue.  Dates CANNOT be edited.
          
         FUNCTION SEQUENCE CHANGES
              If you wish to change the ORDER that the Functions are 
         displayed, and their sequence during listing sorted by Function, 
         use the "S" command from the Current Jobs screen.  Instructions 
         are indicated by the program as you go.

         INITIALIZING YOUR DATA FILES
              The four data files used are CURDAT.THG, FUTDAT.THG, 
         HISTORY.THG, and HISTARK.THG.  Each of these can be created or 
         re-created by running THINGFIL, as follows: 

                   "THINGFIL <Enter>"

         You will be prompted by the program for the necessary
         responses.  You will have the choice of initializing only
         selected data files, or all of them.
          
         In the case of re-creating a HISTORY.THG file, you will be
         given the choice of including current history data after a
         specified month and year in the new file.  All of the old
         data will be saved in a file called HISTOLD.THG.
