PARTYDOT

DESCRIPTION:  
	
Partydot is a user-created art generator similar to a kaleidoscope. 
There are three main levels of involvement possible. You can start a 
design by pressing <Enter> and that is the simplest level.  You can 
specify what sort of shapes the computer should use in creating the 
art. That is the second level.  Finally you can manipulate the numeric 
variables the computer uses in drawing the design and that is the most 
intense level from a user viewpoint. It is also possible to load a set 
of design parameters from disk. 	The idea for the design generator came 
from an article in A. K. Dewdney's Computer Recreation column in the 
September 1986 issue of SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazine called Wallpaper 
of the Mind.  Partydot goes beyond the original concept by allowing 
smooth dithering between colors, and rapid (or slow, if desired) 
changes of those colors in EGA and VGA modes giving the impression of a 
brilliantly hued explosion. 

INTENDED USE:

Partydot is intended for use by 1) The host or hostess of a party who 
can add the computer display as a light show or by 2) the curious or 
scientific-minded person. 

FEATURES:

Unique features include the ability to create nearly instantaneous 
graphics "dazzlers", the ability to save and load the design 
parameters, and the inclusion of two complete user interfaces, one 
optimized for entertainment and the other for scientific exploration. 

LIMITATIONS:

The only known limitation is that in CGA mode the tiled triangle option 
can produce "out of memory" errors.  The tiled triangles were retained 
anyway so they can be enjoyed for a time before the program "crashes". 
There does not seem to be a similar problem in the other modes. 

REQUIREMENTS:

Partydot requires 512K memory, one floppy disk drive, and a color 
system. VGA and EGA are by far the best, but Partydot does use all of 
the capabilities of CGA for as good a result as can be expected. 




STARTING THE PROGRAM:

To start the program, place the program disk in your floppy drive, type 
PARTYDOT and <Enter>. 

REGISTRATION:

The registration fee is $10.00 and this entitles you to printed 
instructions, clues, and background data such as the formula used in 
creating the designs. Make check out to RITE ITEM  and send it with the 
word PARTYDOT and your return address to: 

			Jim Preston
			1622 Xerxes Ave. N.
