## Information about "EDNA'S COOK BOOK"

    EDNA'S COOKBOOK is a program that will store and organize all your
    recipes and even provides password protection to keep your guarded
    family recipes secret from prying eyes.
    
    Now, you no longer have to deal with disorganized slips of paper and
    clippings thrown together in a drawer or box, only to be frustrated when
    you can't find that particular recipe. EDNA'S COOKBOOK is a program for
    collecting, filing, sorting, finding and printing recipes. Essentially,
    it is the equivalent of the cookbook in which you now keep all your
    recipes, except that it is electronic. The program may also be used in
    the preparation of cookbooks for publication.
    
    The screen is divided into an ingredients section and a directions
    section, making it simple to enter your recipes along with a selected
    category (such as soups), a subcategory (lentil), a name (Mama's Hearty
    Soup), and a source where the recipe was obtained (my mom). Categories
    and subcategories can be changed to suit your own preferences. Once
    entered, recipes may be listed or printed individually, by category,
    subcategory, or all at once.
    
    EDNA'S COOKBOOK automatically sorts and arranges your recipes for you
    alphabetically by category, then by subcategory, and then by recipe
    name -- making it easy to find things. You can also encrypt any recipe
    you wish with a password, so that certain recipes may be kept private.

                                    INTRODUCTION
          
          Edna's Cook Book (ECB) is a program for recording, filing,
          listing, and printing recipes.  Essentially, it is the
          electronic equivalent of the cookbook in which you now keep all
          your recipes, except that it is electronic.  The program may
          also be used in the preparation of cook books for publication,
          since it facilitates organization and printing.
          
          Edna Burton, for whom this program is named, was a remarkable
          lady, as well as an award-winning cook whose recipes numbered
          into the many hundreds.  Like most prize-winning cooks, she had
          some recipes that were well-guarded secrets.  Her security
          system was to put parts of the recipes on separate unlabeled
          pieces of paper which were filed in different parts of her
          cookbook.  This program came into being partly as an effort to
          organize some of those recipes, maintaining the ability to
          guard recipes that are not meant to be shared, and partly in
          response to the request of Bill Low, another good cook and a
          good friend.
          
          If you can type, you no longer have to deal with disorganized
          slips of paper and clippings thrown together in a drawer or
          box, only to be frustrated when you can't find that particular
          recipe that you remember you had, except you can't remember
          where it is, or what the precise name of it is.  ECB will take
          care of the tedious part, so you can get on with the real work-
          -good cooking.

                                  GETTING STARTED
          
                                 Making a Work Copy
          
          1.  Format a disk to use for your work copy, using the DOS
              FORMAT command.  Label this disk "ECB."
          
          2.  If you are using a dual floppy setup, you will want to
              format a second blank disk to use as a data disk. Label
              this disk "ECB Data" or "Recipes."
          
          3.  Put the ECB Program disk into Drive A and your work copy
              into Drive B.
          
          4.  At the A:> prompt type "Copy *.* B:" (without the quotes).
              Then press the <Return> key.
          
          5.  Place your original ECB Program Disk in a safe place.  In
              case something happens to your work copy, you will then
              have a backup.
          
          Do NOT put a write protect tab on the work copy disk.  Any
          permanent changes that you make (print parameters, boot
          drive/directory, password) will have to be written back to this
          disk.
          
          
                                Starting the Program
          
          FOR FLOPPY DISK USERS:  Place the work copy of the program disk
          into Drive A.  Place your data disk into Drive B. The DOS
          prompt should be "A:>".  This disk must remain in Drive A
          unless ECB instructs you to remove it.
          
          FOR HARD DISK USERS:  The program files must be on the default
          directory, so if you have placed the program files in a
          directory other than the root directory, you should change to
          that directory before running the program.
          
          At the DOS prompt, type "ECB" (without the quotations) and then
          press <Return>.  Disk things should happen and soon you should
          see the Recipe Screen and the Title Box and notification of the
          Currently Logged Data Drive.  If this is your first time
          through the program the Data Drive will be the drive from which
          you booted the program.
          
          If you have a color card and a monochrome monitor, you may have
          difficulty seeing some of ECB.  To run ECB in black and white
          (or green and green or whatever two colors you may have on your
          monitor), type "ECB BW" (without the quotations) and press
          <Return>.

                                  First-Time Users
          
          If you are using ECB for the first time, there are a couple of
          things you probably want to do before entering recipes:
          
          1.  FOR DUAL FLOPPY SYSTEMS:  Flip to the section on
              CHANGING THE DRIVE/DIRECTORY.  Enter "B:\" (without the
              quotation marks) for the new drive.  When ECB asks if you
              want to log on to this directory upon bootup, answer "Y".
          
              FOR HARD DISK SYSTEMS:  If you want to keep your Recipe
              Data files on a different drive and/or directory from your
              program, flip to the section on CHANGING THE DRIVE/
              DIRECTORY.  Enter the new drive and/or directory.  When ECB
              asks if you want to log on to this directory upon bootup,
              answer "Y".
          
          2.  If you have a serial printer, or if you are using a
              parallel printer on LPT2, turn to the section on CHANGING
              THE PRINTER PORT.  Select your new port and configure if
              necessary.  When ECB asks if this port is to be used as
              default, answer "Y".

                                   GENERAL NOTES
          
          The <Return> key may be named something different on your
          computer; on some machines it is called "Enter".  On the IBM it
          is a bent-to-the-left arrow.
          
          ECB requests that you reply "Yes or No" in a number of
          instances.  These responses may be either upper- or lower-case,
          even though they are represented as upper-case in this manual.
          Do be careful that you press only ONE letter at these
          responses.  ECB remembers what you type and will try to put
          those extra letters in at the first opportunity.  You may also
          press <Esc> at a yes/no prompt.  ECB will consider that a "No"
          response.
          
          In almost all cases, pressing the <Esc> key will get you out of
          anything you can get into in ECB.
          
          ECB has two kinds of menus: vertical (or pull-down) and
          horizontal.  Only the Main Menu and the Review Menu are
          horizontal; all others are pull-down.  There are two methods of
          selection from either menu:
          
              A.  Move the highlight to the desired selection
                  with the cursor keys and press <Return>.
          
              B.  Press the first letter of any entry, whether
                  highlighted or not.  In the case of the pull-
                  down menus, these will all be choice letters
                  which appear to the left of the menu option.
                  In the case of horizontal menus, these will
                  be the first letters of the options.  Letter
                  choices may be entered in either upper or
                  lower case.
          
          If there are no Recipe files on the Data Drive/Directory,
          ECB will notify you. If you would like to create a new set
          of files, simply answer "yes" when ECB asks if you'd like
          to create new files.
          
          
          
                                 THE RECIPE SCREEN
          
          The recipe screen serves as the background for all program
          operations and is divided into a number of sections, some of
          which serve a variety of uses during the operation of the
          program.
          
          The top section surrounded by a border is the Header.  The
          leftmost section in the Header at the top of the screen is just

          such an area.  When ECB initially boots, you will see your
          registration number and your name in this section. To the right
          of this section is a small box that is empty.  When you are
          adding or reviewing recipes, this box will contain the page
          number of the recipe.  To the right of the page box are
          sections for the category and subcategory under which your
          recipes are filed (more about this later).  On the second line
          of the Header is the space for the recipe name, followed by a
          space for the recipe source.  To the right of the source block,
          is another tiny empty block.  This is the Overwrite/Insert
          indicator.  This indicator is active only when you are adding
          or updating recipes, and tells you whether you will be typing
          over something you have already written or inserting text into
          that already written.
          
          The large area below the Header is the Ingredient section.
          Below that is the Directions section.
          
          
                                   THE MAIN MENU
          
          If you press any key the Title Box and Data Drive Notice will
          disappear and the Main Menu will appear on the screen.  The
          Main Menu lists the options that you have and provides a very
          brief explanation of each option.  To review these options, use
          the left and right cursor keys to highlight each option.  On
          the line below the menu options a brief description of each
          option appears as the option is highlighted.  To review these
          quickly:
          
               ADD     : This is the option that allows you to
                         put new recipes into the file.
          
               REVIEW  : This option allows you to view the
                         recipes that you have already entered,
                         and subsequently to update or delete
                         them.
          
               LIST    : This option provides you with a
                         listing of the recipes in the file.
          
               PRINT   : This option prints the recipes, either
                         singly or in groups.
          
               CATEGORY: This option allows you to change the
                         names of the categories and sub-
                         categories under which your recipes
                         are filed.
          
               DRIVE   : This option allows you to establish
                         and change the drive or directory on

                         which the program maintains your
                         recipe files.  In running ECB the
                         first time, this will be the first
                         option you choose.
          
               UTILITY : This option enables the performance
                         of three service tasks: obtaining a
                         recipe count, changing the password
                         (for encrypted recipes), rebuilding
                         the index files and selecting a
                         printer port.  Each of these areas
                         will be covered in detail later.
          
               QUIT    : This option quits the program.
          
               <Esc>   : also quits the program.

                                   ADDING RECIPES
          
          To add a recipe:
          
          1.  Select "Add" on the Main Menu.
          
          2.  Select a category from the list on the screen (see Appendix
              A, below, for list) either by using the cursor keys and
              <Return> or by pressing the letter to the left of the
              category.  The Category will appear in the Category box.
          
          3.  Select a subcategory in the same manner.  The Subcategory
              will appear in the Subcategory box.
          
          4.  Type in the name of the recipe and press <Return>.
          
          5.  Type in the source of the recipe if you wish and press
              <Return>.  If you do not wish to enter a source, just press
              <Return>.
          
          6.  Enter ingredients.  Press <Return> after each item.
          
          7.  When you have finished entering ingredients, press <Pg Dn>
              to move to the Directions section.
          
          8.  Enter directions in any format that you wish.
          
          9.  When you have finished entering directions, press <Ctrl-
              Return>.  ECB will ask you:
                             Enter Another New Recipe?
              If you wish to add another recipe press the "Y" key.  You
              will be given a fresh screen and you can proceed just as
              before.  If you do not wish to add another recipe, press
              the "N" key, and you will be returned to the main menu.
          
          
                         Additional Notes on Adding Recipes
          
                                      General
          
          If you got into Add by mistake, simply press the <Esc> key and
          you will be returned to the Main Menu.
          
          The upper left block of the Header will advise you that you are
          adding and what you are adding at any particular time.  That's
          for those of us who forget what we're doing a lot of the time.
          Even though you won't need it, there are some who will be
          called away from the computer as they are working and want to
          be reminded where they were when they return.

                                    Recipe Names
          
          Should you leave the Recipe Name blank, ECB will name it for
          you: "Untitled Recipe" -- not terribly original, but necessary,
          since the program could confuse itself terribly if there were
          recipes without names.
          
          Not quite as confusing are identical names.  ECB has no
          hesitation about accepting recipes with identical names.
          However, you will have a problem in attempting to locate these
          recipes by name.  Since the names are identical, ECB won't know
          which one you want, and will give you the first one every time.
          This can be a little frustrating if you are looking for the
          second one.  There is a way to find that second recipe; it's
          just not as direct.  Therefore, it's a good idea to add
          something to the name to make it not identical:
          
               Chocolate Pie              Potato Salad
               Chocolate Pie - 2          Potato Salad (GrandMa's)
               Chocolate Pie (3)          Peggy's Potato Salad
          
          Incidentally, ECB does not consider the case of letters when
          looking up recipe names.  It thinks that "Lemon Custard" and
          "lemon custard" are the same name.
          
                                Entering Ingredients
          
          If you have more ingredients than there are spaces on the
          screen, don't worry; when you press <Return> in the last
          ingredient space, ECB will ask you whether you have more
          ingredients.  If you do, then press "Y", and ECB will give you
          a clean screen to enter them on.  You will note two differences
          on this screen.  It will be numbered "2"  and there will be a
          notice that says, "<Ctrl-Return> to Return to First Page."
          
          Should you have even more ingredients than fit on this page,
          just answer "yes" again when asked and ECB will bring up page
          three.  When you are finished entering ingredients, just press
          <Ctrl-Return> (hold down the <Ctrl> key and press <Return>) and
          ECB will take you  back to the first page of the recipe and the
          cursor will be at the beginning of the directions section.
          
          Although not impossible, it is difficult to view any pages
          except the page you are typing on and the first page when you
          are adding recipes.  If you need to check these pages, use the
          Review function on the Main Menu.

          If you group ingredients as in the following:
          
              Batter:
                1 cup flour
                .
                .
                1/2 cup sugar
                              <<-- Enter a space on this ingredient line.
              Filling:
                1/4 cup sugar
                .
                .
                1 cup milk
          
          Be sure to put a space in the lines that you leave blank
          between the groupings, such as the line between the last batter
          ingredient and the Filling ingredients above (Just press the
          space bar and then press <Return>.  To leave these spaces
          completely blank will cause no problem until you attempt to
          print the recipe.  The print portion of the program thinks it
          has reached the end of the ingredients when it encounters a
          completely blank ingredient space, so it quits looking.
          
          As you enter ingredients, you may have need to move the cursor
          around.  The following editing commands may be used for
          ingredients in either the Add function or in Review/Update:
          
               KEY COMMAND      RESULT
          
               LArr          moves the cursor one space to the
               (left         left -- does not work past the end
               arrow)        of the typed entry.
          
               RArr          moves the cursor one space to the
               (right        right -- does not work past the
               arrow)        beginning of the typed entry.
          
               Home          moves the cursor to the beginning
                             of the entry line.
          
               End           moves the cursor to the end of the
                             typed entry.
          
               UArr (up      moves the cursor to the beginning

                             type over any letters that
                             already exist.  In insert mode
                             (INS), anything you type will be
                             inserted in any existing text at
                             the cursor position and the
                             existing text will be pushed to
                             the right.
          
               F-1           provides a brief description of
                             these commands on the screen.
                             This help function may be invoked
                             at any time during the Add or
                             Update operations.
          
               F-2           inserts the current date at the
                             cursor position.
          
               F-5           encrypts a Recipe.  (See the

               Esc           returns to the Add Another Option
                             without saving anything on the
                             page, unless you have added a
                             second page.
          
               Ctrl-Rtn      records the page and exits to the

                                Entering Directions
          
          The Directions portion of ECB works like a tiny word processor.
          In other words, you can type away.  When you get to to the end
          
          
                                                 ECB User's Guide      11





          of the line, the program will break the line for you and move
          the cursor to the next line.  When this happens at the end of
          the first line, the guide lines will disappear.  (They'll
          reappear with the next page, however.)
          
          If you get to the end of the page and need more room for
          Directions, just keep typing.  ECB will add a new page for
          additional directions.  This feature only works if you type
          past the line limit on the last line.  If you are writing in
          paragraphs, and the new paragraph falls one line past the end
          of the page, just hit return and ECB will ask if you want
          another page.  If there is some other reason that you want
          another page for directions and you are not typing on the last
          line, for example, skipping lines between paragraphs, you can
          either go to the last line and press return or you can press
          F-9.  Either will present you with a fresh page.
          
          A Note of Caution:  once a page has been added, you have it
          forever, or until you delete the recipe; there is no provision
          for deleting a single page of a recipe.
          
          Again, ECB will only let you see the page you are typing on and
          the first page of the recipe when Adding.  To view other pages,
          select Review on the Main Menu.
          
          ECB considers any line that begins with a space to be the
          beginning of a new paragraph for formatting and reformatting
          purposes.
          
          Other little oddities of the Directions section:  the LArr and
          RArr will not work on any area that has not been typed, i.e.
          you cannot cursor past the beginning or end of a typed line.
          
          UArr and DArr will move the cursor vertically, until it reaches
          a shorter line or until it reaches the last typed line.  In
          both cases, the cursor will automatically go to the end of the
          line.
          
          Other editing commands you may want to use in entering
          directions in either in Adding or Review/Updating are as
          follows:
          
               KEY COMMAND      RESULT
          
          
               LArr          moves the cursor one space to the
               (left         left -- does not work past the end
               arrow)        of the typed entry.

               End           moves the cursor to the end of the

                             page one, or to the Name block on
                             subsequent pages.
          
               Ctrl-PgUp     moves the cursor to the Category
                             block.
          
               Ctrl-PgDn     moves the cursor to the last line
                             of the Directions section.
          
               PgUp          moves the cursor to the first line
                             of the Ingredients section.
          
               Bksp          deletes the character to the left
                             of the cursor.
          
               Del           deletes the cursor character.

                                 REVIEWING RECIPES
          
          To review recipes:
          
          1.  Select REVIEW on the Main Menu.
          
          2.  Select method of search either by Category or Name.
          
              A.  "Category."  You will have to select the
                  Category and the Subcategory.  ECB will then
                  find the first recipe, alphabetically in the
                  Category/ Subcategory that you have selected.
                  (Recipes are automatically alphabetized
                  within Category/Subcategory groups.)
          
          
              B.  "Name."  You will have to enter the Recipe
                  Name ECB will then find the recipe name that
                  most closely matches the one you typed.
          
          
          3.  Select your next choice from the Review Menu, which will
              appear in the upper left block of the Header.  This menu
              functions exactly like the Main Menu, and choices are made
              the same way.
          
              These are your options in the Review Menu:
          
               Next     : The recipe on the screen will be
                          replaced by the next one in the
                          file. If the recipe takes more
                          than one page, the next recipe
                          in the file will be the next
                          page of that recipe.
          
               Previous : The recipe on the screen will be
                          replaced by the one before it in the
                          recipe file. If the recipe on the
                          screen has a page number higher than
                          one, this command will give you the
                          previous page of the same recipe.
          
               Update   : Allows you to edit the recipe, using
                          any of the editing features described
                          in the ADDING RECIPES section.
                          Reminders appear in the upper left
                          block of the Header.  <Ctrl-Return>
                          or <Esc> saves the changes and
                          returns you to the Review Menu.

               Delete   : Deletes the entire recipe, after you
                          confirm that you want to delete the
                          recipe.  If you do not confirm, ECB
                          takes no action.
          
               Quit     : Quits the Review function and returns
                          you to the Main Menu.
          
               Esc      : Also quits the Review function and
                          returns you to the Main Menu.
          
          
                         Arrangement of Recipes in the File
          
          Recipe indexes are arranged alphabetically by Category letter
          (the letter in front of the category name on the list), then by
          Subcategory letter, then by Recipe Name (and in cases of
          identical Recipe Names, order of entry).  Although the index
          has a definite beginning and end, it is circular, so if you're
          on the last recipe in the file and ask for the next one, you
          will get the first recipe in the file.  You will be notified
          at both the beginning and end of the file.

              B.  "Printer" will list the recipes to your
                  printer.
          
              C.  "ASCII File" will list the recipes to a disk
                  file.  If you elect this option, ECB will ask
                  you for a path and file name.  (See note

                        Additional Notes on Listing Recipes
          
          
          Whatever the target you choose, ECB will list your Recipes in
          one of two formats:
          
          (1) If you are listing a Category or Subcategory or sorting by
          
          
                                                 ECB User's Guide      17





          Category, a Category/Subcategory label will be printed, with
          the Recipes belonging to that Category/Subcategory listed
          alphabetically beneath.
          
          (2) If you are listing all Recipes, sorted by name, the list
          will be alphabetical by name with Category and Subcategory in
          parentheses to the right.
          
          If you are listing to the screen, you will see the list a page
          at a time, and you can choose whether to continue viewing the
          list or return to the Main Menu.  ECB will also notify you when
          the listing is finished.
          
          The ASCII File option is useful if you want to keep a separate
          disk copy of the names of the recipes you have and is also
          useful for creating a table of contents or index if you happen
          to be writing a recipe book.

                                PRINTING THE RECIPES
          
          To print your recipe(s):
          
          1.  Select PRINT on the Main Menu.
          
          2.  Examine the Print Parameters.
          
               Output to        : "Printer" will direct the
                                  output to the printer (LPT1).
                                  "ASCII File" will direct the
                                  output to a disk file. If
                                  select this option, ECB will
                                  ask you for a path and file
                                  name (See note below.)  The
                                  Default is "Printer."
          
               Pause Between
               Pages            : "Yes" will pause the printer
                                  at the end of each page and
                                  wait until you have put in a
                                  new sheet of paper.  "No"
                                  will enable continuous
                                  printing.  Default is "No."
          
               Single Recipe
               per Page:       : "Yes" will print only one
                                 recipe on a page.  "No" will
                                 print as many recipes as will
                                 fit on a page (recipes may be
                                 divided at page divisions.
                                 Spacing between recipes is
                                 automatic.)  Default is "No."
          
               Print Encrypted
               Recipes         : "Yes" will print encrypted
                                 recipes, provided that you
                                 enter a correct password when
                                 asked.  "No" prints only non-
                                 encrypted recipes.  Default is
                                 "No."
          
               Print Recipe
               Source          : "Yes" prints the source of the
                                 recipe, if present.  "No" will
                                 print no sources. Default is
                                 "Yes."
          
               Print Source at : If you have selected "Yes" for

                                 "Bottom".  "Top" will print
                                 the source at the top of the
                                 recipe; "No" will print it at
                                 the end of the recipe. The
                                 default is "Top."
          
               Print Page
               Numbers         : "Yes" will print a page number
                                 at the bottom of each page.
                                 "No" will print no page
                                 numbers. Default is "Yes."
          
               Print
               Cats/SubCats:   : "Yes" will print the name of

                                 is printed.  Default is "Yes."
          
               Page Width
               (spaces)        : The number of columns on the
                                 page.  This will depend upon
                                 the font in which you are
                                 printing. (Pica is 10
                                 characters per inch; Elite is
                                 12 cpi).  Check your printer.
                                 ECB does not set fonts, so
                                 these must be set prior to
                                 printing.*  Default is 80.
          
               Left Margin

                                 and the right edge of the
                                 paper.*  Default is 10.
          
               Page Length
               (lines):        : The number of print lines on a

               Top Margin
               (lines)         : The number of print lines

          3.  Decide whether you wish to change any of these parameters.
              If you do NOT wish to change any, then answer "N"; if you
              want to change the parameters, answer "Y" and follow these
              directions:
          
              A.  Move through the parameters using the
                  Tab/Shft-Tab or the UArr/DArr keys until you
                  find the parameter that you want to change.
                  You will notice that parameters become
                  highlighted as you move through them.
          
              B.  Change the Parameter.
          
                  (1)  In the first column, you may change
                       parameters by pressing the return key
                       when the parameter is highlighted.
          
                  (2)  In the second column, you can change
                       parameters by typing in the new
                       parameter and pressing <Return>.
          
              C.  When you have finished adjusting the
                  parameters, simply press <Ctrl-Return> (or
                  <Return> if you happen to be on "Beginning Page
                  Number").
          
              D.  Decide if you want to keep these parameters
                  as the default parameters.  If you answer "Y",
                  the parameters will be stored, and will appear
                  as the default parameters the next time you

                  select Print. If you answer "N", they will be
                  used for the current printing session and then
                  erased.
          
          4.  Select what you want to print.
          
              A.  "Single Recipe" will print one recipe only.
                  You will have to enter the Recipe Name.  ECB
                  will print the recipe if it finds an exact
                  match for the Name you typed.  If it cannot
                  find an exact match, nothing will be printed.
          
              B.  "Subcategory" will print all of the recipes
                  in a given Subcategory, which you will
                  select.
          
              C.  "Category" will print all of the recipes in a
                  given Category, which you will select.
          
              D.  "All" will print all the recipes in the file.
          
          
          5.  Print your selection(s).
          
          
                        Additional Notes on Printing Recipes
          
          ECB will keep you aware of the progress of the printing.  If
          for some reason you need to abort the printing operation, press
          the <Esc> key.  The printer may not stop immediately, because
          it will print whatever ECB has already loaded into the print
          buffer, but ECB will stop adding to the buffer and the printer
          will stop as soon as the buffer is empty.
          
          The "ASCII File" output option is especially useful if you need
          to do more editing on the recipes than can be done with ECB
          before they are printed on paper; you can print to an ASCII
          file, then edit the text with a word processor.  All other
          print parameters apply even when the output is directed to an
          ASCII file.
          
          Most of the editing commands noted earlier will work with
          parameter entry, e.g. <Ctrl-PgUp> will take you to the first
          parameter; <Ctrl-PgDn> will take you to the last.

                                MODIFYING CATEGORIES
          
          
          
          To modify the list of Categories or Subcategories:
          
          1.  Select MODIFY on the Main Menu.
          
          2.  Select what you want to modify.
          
              A. "Add Category" adds a Category Name to the
                  list of Categories.
          
              B. "Change Category" changes the name of a
                  Category on the list.
          
              C. "Delete Category" deletes a Category Name from
                  the list.
          
              D. "Add Subcategory" adds a Subcategory Name to
                  the list of Subcategories.  You will, of
                  course, have to first select a Category.
          
              E. "Change Subcategory" changes the name of a
                  Subcategory on the list.  Again, you will
                  have to first select a Category.
          
              F. "Delete Subcategory" deletes a Subcategory
                  Name from the list.  Again, you will have to
                  select a Category first.
          
          2.  Select a Category.
          
          3.  If you are modifying a Subcategory, select a Subcategory.
          
          4.  If deleting or changing, select the Category/Subcategory to
              change or delete.
          
          5.  If adding or changing, enter the new name followed by
              <Return>. Do NOT include the letter prefix; ECB will add it
              for you.
          
          
                      Additional Notes on Modifying Categories
          
          If you add a Category, that category will automatically be
          given the Subcategory "None"; this happens because each
          Category must have at least one Subcategory.  It is likely that
          you will want to change this first automatic category.

          which recipes have already been entered does NOT change the
          Category and Subcategory labels indicated on the recipe itself
          (in the Header).  Under certain circumstances, this can lead to
          some very strange results.  So, if you change the Category or
          Subcategory under which recipes have already been entered,
          remember to be sure to go back and update the recipes
          themselves.
          
          ECB has space allotted for 20 Categories, each of can have up
          to 20 Subcategories, making it possible to have 400
          subdivisions of Recipes.
          
          For the default categories and subcategories supplied with ECB,
          see Appendix A, below.

                            CHANGING DRIVES/DIRECTORIES
          
          To change the Drive or Directory for your Data Files:
          
          1.  Select DRIVE on the Main Menu.
          
          2.  View the currently logged Data Drive and Directory.
          
          3.  Decide if you want to change the Data Drive.  If you do NOT
              want to change the Data Drive, answer "N".  If you want to
              change the Data Drive answer "Y".
          
          4.  Enter the new Data Drive and Directory Path, followed by
              <Return>. You may enter any legal DOS path name.
          
          5.  Decide whether you want to enter this Drive/Directory
              automatically when you start the program.
          
          ECB will then close the recipe files on the current directory
          (if they were open), change the Data Drive to the one that you
          have specified, and return you to the Main Menu.

                                 UTILITY OPERATIONS
          
          If you select the UTILITY option on the Main Menu, ECB will
          present you with four Utility options:
          
          1. "Display # of Recipes" will show you how many recipes
             are in the file.  This information is also shown when you
             exit the program.
          
          2. "Change Encryption Password" allows you to create or change
             the Password which allows you to encrypt and decrypt
             individual recipes (see the Encryption section, below).
             To change the password:
          
              A.  Enter the current Password if there is one.
                  If this is your first Password, ECB will skip
                  this step.
          
              B.  Enter the new Password, then press <Return>.
          
              C.  Decide whether to keep the Password you have
                  entered.  Remember, once you confirm the
                  Password, you will never see it on the screen
                  again.
          
          
                        Additional Notes on Password Changes
          
          WARNING:  IF YOU CHANGE THE PASSWORD, RECIPES PREVIOUSLY
          ENCRYPTED USING A DIFFERENT PASSWORD WILL BE UNREADABLE.
          
          REMEMBER: Passwords are case-sensitive.  That means that in
          considering Passwords, ECB distinguishes between upper- and
          lower-case letters.  Thus, "COOKIE", "cookie", "Cookie", and
          "CooKie" are all different passwords as far as ECB is
          concerned.
          
          One other note:  When ECB asks you for your Password, and you
          enter it, the letters will not appear on the screen--just in
          case someone is looking over your shoulder.  NO ONE KNOWS YOUR
          PASSWORD EXCEPT YOU.  WITHOUT IT, ENCRYPTED RECIPES CANNOT BE
          DELETED, AND RECIPES CAN NEITHER BE ENCRYPTED OR DECRYPTED.
          
          
          
          3.  "Rebuild Index Files" allows you to rebuild the index files
              by which ECB accesses the Recipes.  Sometimes, if the files
              are not closed properly (the result of a power outage, or
              someone unplugging your computer, or a couple other
              things), the indexes which ECB uses to find your recipes
              are mangled, causing you to be unable to find anything.
          
          
                                                 ECB User's Guide      26





              This, in turn, would probably cause you an unhappy moment
              or two.  Should any of these happen and ECB be unable to
              find your recipes, select this option.  ECB will then read
              your recipe data files , rebuild the indexes, store them in
              files, and return you to the Main Menu.
          
          4.  "Change Printer Port" allows you to change the port through
              which ECB communicates with the printer. The default is
              LPT1; if, however, you are using a serial printer, you will
              probably want to change it to one of the COM ports.  To
              change the port, follow these steps.
          
              A.  View the current Printer Port.
          
              B.  Decide whether you want to change ports.  If
                  you do NOT want to change ports, answer "N".
                  If you do want to change ports, answer "Y".
          
              C.  Select the printer port you want.  You may
                  choose from LPT1, LPT2, COM1 or COM2.  If you
                  select one of the COM ports, you will have to
                  configure the port:
          
                  (1)  Select the baud rate.
          
                  (2)  Select the number of stop bits.
          
                  (3)  Select the number of data bits.
          
                  (4)  Select the parity.
          
                  (5)  Confirm that your selections are
                       correct.
          
              D.  Confirm that you want to use this port.
          
              E.  Decide whether you want to keep this port
                  and/or configuration as the default printer
                  port.  If you make this the default, ECB will
                  direct printer communications to this port
                  automatically.
          
          
                                QUITTING THE PROGRAM
          
          Selecting QUIT or <Esc> on the Main Menu closes the files,
          displays the number of recipes on file, and quits the program,
          and returns you to DOS.

                                     ENCRYPTION
          
          Some folks have recipes that they would prefer not to share
          with  anyone who might be able to turn on a computer; others
          have recipes which have long been family secrets and dare not
          share them with others.  It is for both of these types of
          situations, and any others requiring confidentiality that ECB
          is equipped with an encryption function.  This function not
          only prevents anyone who does not have the Password from seeing
          your recipes, it also encrypts the data on the disk, so even if
          someone were able to read the file, all they would see is
          garbage.
          
          Of course, any encryption scheme is subject to being broken.
          So if you have recipes that you are genuinely concerned might
          be stolen, do not stop with encryption; use physical security
          devices.  The encryption function provided should prove more
          than adequate for most needs.
          
          ENCRYPTING A RECIPE:  To encrypt a recipe that you are Adding
          or Updating:
          
              A. Press F-5.
          
              B. Enter your Password, then <Return>.
          
          The recipe will be encrypted when you finish Adding or Updating
          it (<Ctrl-Return>).
          
          VIEWING ENCRYPTED RECIPES:  When reviewing, encrypted recipes
          will not appear on the screen.  Instead, the Header information
          will be visible and the remainder of the screen will be empty
          except for a notice that the recipe is encrypted.  To view an
          encrypted recipe:
          
              A.  Select "Update" on the Review Menu.
          
              B.  Enter your Password.
          
              C.  Select the type of Decryption:
          
                  (1)  "Temporarily" decrypts the recipe for
                       this viewing only.  There may be a
                       momentary delay while ECB decrypts
                       the recipe.  You can read it or
                       edit it, but it will be re-encrypted
                       immediately upon leaving "Update".
          
                  (2)  "Permanently" decrypts the recipe
                       permanently and stores it in the file
                       in readable form when you leave
          
          
                                                 ECB User's Guide      28





                       "Update".  Again, there may be a
                       delay during decryption.
          
          DELETING AN ENCRYPTED RECIPE:  To delete an encrypted recipe:
          
              A.  Confirm that you want to delete the recipe.
          
              B.  Enter your Password.
          
          If you enter the Password correctly, the recipe will be
          deleted.
          
          
          PRINTING AN ENCRYPTED RECIPE:  To print an encrypted recipe,
          change the "Print Encrypted Recipe" parameter to "Yes".  If you
          enter your Password correctly, the encrypted recipes will be
          printed.

                           APPENDIX C: RAM DISK OPERATION
          
          If you have sufficient memory, you may want to run ECB from a
          RAM disk rather than a floppy disk, since a RAM Disk can load
          overlays much faster than can a floppy disk. This overlay load
          time is particularly noticeable when beginning a LIST or PRINT
          operation.
          
          Since a power outage will cause everything in memory to be
          lost, it is better to put the program files on the ram disk,
          and use the physical drives for data.
          
          To help you in RAM disk operation of ECB, two batch files are
          included on your program disk.  The first, TO-RAM.BAT, copies
          all of the files necessary for operation from your work copy
          onto the RAM disk and starts ECB.  (This procedure assumes that
          the RAM disk is already installed as Drive C.)  This takes
          almost long enough to get a cup of coffee, if the coffee pot is
          close by.
          
          The second program, FROM-RAM.BAT, is activated by the first and
          copies any files that might have been modified in the operation
          of ECB back onto the floppy disk, so you won't lose the
          changes.
          
                           Using the ECB with a RAM Disk
          
          To operate ECB with your RAM Disk:
          
                   1.  Install your RAM disk.
          
                   2.  Place the work disk in Drive A.
          
                   3.  At the "A>" prompt, type "to-ram" (without the
                       quotes).
          
                   4.  Be sure that your work disk is in Drive A when
                       you Quit the program, so that your changes will
                       be preserved.
          
          NOTE:  If your RAM disk is other than C, and you wish to use
          these files, you will have to edit them using DOS's EDLIN or
          any word processor that creates a pure ASCII file.

                               APPENDIX D: SHAREWARE
          
          
                               The Shareware Concept
          
          ECB is distributed through a unique marketing approach called
          shareware.  The diskette with the files on it can be freely
          copied and shared with others.  We ask you to help us
          distribute ECB by sharing unmodified copies of the diskette
          with others, to make it easy for other people to try ECB.
          
          The concept of shareware is based on three principles:
          
                 1. People need to try programs to see if they are
                    useful.
          
                 2. Software authors can be supported directly by the
                    users.
          
                 3. Copying and distribution of programs can be
                    encouraged.
          
          After trying the ECB, if you decide to use it, WE TRUST YOU to
          purchase a registered program.
          
          
                                    Registration
          
          Registration has a number of benefits:
          
               -  A new personalized ECB diskette with unique
                  registration number and the most recent
                  version of the program.
          
               -  Full technical support by mail and limited
                  technical support by phone.
          
               -  Preprinted user's manual, including all
                  recent updates and additions.
          
               -  Notification of updates and new product
                  announcements.
          
          To purchase a registered copy of the program, send a check for
          $29.00 (plus $3.00 shipping and handling).  Your registered
          copy will be sent by first class mail.
          
          An unregistered copy of the most recent version of ECB is
          available for $10.00 (plus shipping and handling).  The
          unregistered diskette contains all of the program files with
          complete documentation ready to be printed by your own printer.

                  copied or reproduced in any manner.
          
               -  The ECB disk or files may not be packaged with any
                  other programs or materials or sold as part of a larger
                  package without written permission of Specialty

                                    RECONST

                            OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

RECONST (Reconstruct) reconstructs the ECB data and index files. In older
versions of the program a condition was possible that would cause the program
to look like it was performing correctly when it was not.  Version 1.23 added
code to detect this condition and advise you to run the RECONST utility.  You
may also wish to run RECONST if you have a recipe files with a number of
deleted recipes in it.  RECONST does not reconstruct deleted files, so the
resulting file size is smaller.

The RECONST utility must run from your ECB program directory.  If you have used
the UPGRADE utility to copy your program files, or simply copied any ECB
program disk (v. 1.23) that is already done.

RECONST reads your ECB setup files and operates on the directory that is
indicated in these files, i.e. if your program boots to drive B:, that is
where RECONST will look for files; if your program boots to C:\RECIPE, then
RECONST will look there.  If you are running ECB on a hard disk and have more
than one directory with recipes on it, you will have to change directories
from inside ECB for RECONST to reach them.

RECONST creates a temporary file (which it erases after use) the same size as
your RECIPE.DAT file; however, it does not check for disk space, so you must
check to see that you have sufficient free disk space before running the
program.  Floppy users should have an empty, freshly-formatted "scratch" disk
to accept the temporary file.

NOTE:  version 2.00 of RECONST adds a the CHECK-CATEGORY feature; this function
examines the categories and sub-categories of each recipe and adjusts any
indexes that need to be adjusted to insure that recipes are appropriately
categorized.  If the category or subcategory does not exist in the program
files, no change is made in the indexing.  This function becomes particularly
useful if decide to rearrange your categories after recipes have already been
entered.  You can now do so to your heart's content; just run RECONST on all
recipe files after rearrangement.

To run RECONST follow these directions:

        1.  Floppy users put the program disk in drive A: and type
            "A:".  Hard disk users change the default drive to your
            ECB program directory.

        2.  Type "reconst" and press <return>.

        3.  RECONST will present you with a preliminary notice and
            give you the opportunity to abort.

        4.  RECONST will then present you with the directory it will
            use for the temporary file and give you the opportunity to
            change it.

        5.  RECONST will construct the temporary file, then
            reconstruct a new RECIPE file and index files.

        6.  RECONST will then erase the temporary file and return you
            to DOS.

                          ECB UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS

UPGRADE will modify your current ECB program files, upgrading them to the
version on this disk WITHOUT modifiying any parameters or passwords that you
have already set up.

The procedure is almost painless:

1.  Place the upgrade disk in drive A:

2.  Be sure that the default drive is set to A: (type "a:" <return>).

2.  If you are using a hard disk, note the directory containing your ECB
program files.  If you are using floppies, put your ECB work disk in
drive B:

3.  At the DOS prompt, type "upgrade" followed by a space and the drive/
directory of your program files.  Then press <return>.  For example, floppy
users will type "upgrade b:" <return>

4. IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading from a version prior to 1.19, run an
an index rebuild (select UTILITY at the main menu, then select REBUILD INDEXES.
The index structure of versions 1.19 and higher is slightly different from
previous versions; running the rebuild will correct any problems in your
current index.  If you already have v. 1.19 or higher, this step is
unnecessary.  NOTE:  If you have more than one recipe file, you will need
to perform this step on each recipe file.

In order to insure that all your copies of ECB are the same, it is suggested
that you UPGRADE all copies of the program using the above procedure.  If you
share the program, please share the latest version.
