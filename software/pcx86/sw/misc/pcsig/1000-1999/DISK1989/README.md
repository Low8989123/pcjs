## Information about "MENU-RANGE FOR LOTUS 1-2-3"

    MENU-RANGE is a spreadsheet template which works with Lotus 1-2-3 and
    Quattro and allows the user to designate any range in the spreadsheet
    as an active menu.  This allows the construction of custom applications
    in which the user selects from menu options, without the usual
    limitations in the number of options available at one time.  Thus, it is
    possible to avoid complex nested menus which increase the possibilities
    for error.  A helpful feature is the inclusion of different versions of
    the template for users of Lotus 1-2-3, and Quattro.  In fact there are
    three different versions; one for 1-2-3 users, one for Quattro users,
    and one for users who run Quattro in 1-2-3 menu emulation mode.
    
    This powerful program is best suited to those already well versed in
    Lotus 1-2-3 or Quattro.  MENU-RANGE will appeal particularly to
    sophisticated users of Lotus 1-2-3 and Quattro who must build
    spreadsheets containing a large number of complex calculations that are
    repeated frequently.  They will find MENU-RANGE a very useful tool.
    Normally these people rely heavily on the programs' macro abilities.
    MENU-RANGE will allow those macros to be listed on a menu and selected
    by moving the cursor/light bar to the appropriate entry and pressing
    ENTER.
    
    MENU-RANGE can also be helpful to users responsible for building
    spreadsheets to be updated or analyzed by people who are not expert in
    the spreadsheet program itself.  The process of updating may be
    automated through the creation of macros that may then be selected from
    the menu.  Less experienced users can then take advantage of the
    powerful features of 1-2-3 and Quattro which would normally be beyond
    their reach.
    
    Like any template, MENU-RANGE will add to the memory overhead of a
    spreadsheet, so users with scarce memory may find that they cannot

MENU-RANGE is a spreadsheet template which works with Lotus 1-2-3 and

in which the user selects from menu options, without the usual

and one for users who run Quattro in 1-2-3 menu emulation mode.         
                                                                        
MENU-RANGE will appeal particularly to sophisticated users of Lotus     
1-2-3 and Quattro who must build spreadsheets containing a large number 
of complex calculations that are repeated frequently.  They will find   
MENU-RANGE a very useful tool.  Normally these people rely heavily on   
the programs' macro abilities.  MENU-RANGE will allow those macros to be
listed on a menu and selected by moving the cursor/light bar to the     
appropriate entry and pressing <ENTER>.  MENU-RANGE may also be useful  
for users responsible for building spreadsheets that will be updated    
and, perhaps, analyzed by people who are not expert in the spreadsheet  
program itself.  The process of updating may be automated through the   
creation of macros that may then be selected from the menu.  Like any   
template, MENU-RANGE will add to the memory overhead of a spreadsheet,  
so users with scarce memory may find that they cannot manipulate        
spreadsheets as large as those to which they are accustomed.            
                                                                        
The weakest part of MENU-RANGE is the documentation.  A user already    
well versed in Lotus 1-2-3 or Quattro needs to set up the template      
for a particular application.  If the documentation provided some       
examples, some model macros, etc., it would make the templates easier   
to use. Less experienced users could then use it to take advantage of   
the powerful features of 1-2-3 and Quattro which normally might be      
beyond their reach.
