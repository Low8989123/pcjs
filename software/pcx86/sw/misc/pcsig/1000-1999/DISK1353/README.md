## Information about "TURBO DESIGNER"

    TURBO DESIGNER is a programmer's toolbox for the Turbo Pascal
    compiler.  TURBO DESIGNER helps you create pull-down menus, pop-up
    menus, and sophisticated hypertext help screens in your applications.
    It is very easy to use.  The program asks you to input your data (what
    you want to appear when the program runs), on a series of ``what you see
    is what you get'' full-screen editors.  Once you have set up your menu
    work environment, which includes windows, icons, and even a trash can,
    TURBO DESIGNER creates a Pascal source file according to your data.
    This new file can be compiled using Turbo Pascal.  The result is a
    program with a complete environment, and a sophisticated user
    interface.
    
    Using a price/performance ratio, TURBO DESIGNER is one of the best code
    generators of its type in the market today.  Its screen routines are as
    fast as they possibly can be, and the algorithms used cannot be
    surpassed on the IBM-PC.  TURBO DESIGNER is better than ``just a
    library,'' since it creates actual code, and has routines for a pop-up
    directory listing, trash can, sophisticated help screens, and much
    more.  It maintains an easy-to-use environment, including icons,
    pop-up windows, and pull-down menus.  TURBO DESIGNER detects a
    monochrome monitor and corrects the display.  A new palette of black
    and white colors are used, so all data is displayed correctly.  This is
    a great utility for shareware developers, since it creates an
    easy-to-use environment, perfect for the first-time user.
