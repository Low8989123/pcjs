## Information about "DOSLOCK"

    File security is a difficult problem when more than one person has
    access to a PC.  DOSLOCK provides complete file security for up to 26
    users, as well as some very useful accounting tools.
    
    With the DOSLOCK the system administrator can create file access,
    application access, and access to DOS.  After installation the
    machine can only be used by those with a valid password.  After
    logging on, a main menu appears showing the user all his valid options;
    there is no control key sequence to break out of DOSLOCK.  On-line help
    is available which can be customized by the system administrator.
    
    As most system administrators know, verbal reminders to back up data
    are often ignored by users.  DOSLOCK's automatic backup feature solves
    that problem:  before logging out users will be prompted to place a disk
    in the floppy drive and DOSLOCK does the rest.  DOSLOCK also provides an
    audit report listing the users' activities with time stamps.  This will
    help the administrators monitor application use and any improper system
    use (i.e. not logging out).
    
    It should be noted that DOSLOCK has an impressive customer list,
    including Westinghouse and Readers Digest.  Security like this has been
    available at the mainframe level for quite some time.  MIS professionals
    will find DOSLOCK a welcome, and long overdue, relief.

Special Requirements: MS DOS 2.0 (or higher) and a hard disk.           
                                                                        
File security is a difficult problem when more than one person has      
access to a PC.  The HAXTON DOSLOCK provides complete file security     
for up to 26 users on one MS-DOS computer as well as some very useful   
accounting tools.                                                       
                                                                        
With the DOSLOCK the system administrator can create user names         
and passwords to specify file access and application access, if         
desired users can be totally locked out of DOS.  After installation     
the machine can only be used by those with a valid password.  After     
logging on a main menu appears showing the user all his valid options,  
there is no control key sequence to break out of DOSLOCK.  On-line      
help is available which can be customized by the system administrator.  
                                                                        
As System most administrators know verbal reminders to back up data     
are often ignored by users.  DOSLOCK's automatic backup feature solves  
that problem: before logging out users will prompted to plave a disk in 
the floppy drive and DOSLOCK does the rest.  DOSLOCK also provides an   
audit report listing the users' activities with time stamps.  This will 
help the administrators monitor application use and any improper system 
use (i.e. not logging out).
