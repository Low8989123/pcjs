## Information about "E!"

    E! is a powerful full-screen text editor.  Its implementation has been
    driven by three keywords; quick, simple, and efficient.  E! will allow
    you to edit as many files as your system memory can hold
    simultaneously.  A "split screen" mode is available to see two
    different parts of a file on the same screen.  Although E! is not a
    wordprocessor, it offers some functions you will rarely find in a text
    editor.  E! has a versatile interface with DOS which makes it a
    valuable tool for both programmers and non-programmers alike. It edits
    and saves ASCII files but does not include any control characters in
    the text flow except if you insert them yourself.  Support for a
    specific printer is not included, but you can add printer control
    characters in your text very easily.
    
    E! is a professional level tool.  It is highly configurable, allowing
    you to tailor it to your specific needs using profiles and macros.  E!
    supports EGA 43 lines mode, VGA 50 lines mode, and a special 35 lines
    mode which is even more readable.  The IBM 101T enhanced keyboard is
    also fully supported.  E! has an abundance of built-in functions that
    can be grouped together to build macros and then saved in a macro file,
    to be used at any time during the editing process.  You can even assign
    a macro to any key.  E!'s configuration can be changed at any time by
    loading a new profile. You can have profiles for programming support,
    profiles adapted to program documentation editing, etc.  When loading a
    file E! automatically expands tabs if this is specified in the main
    profile.  The same option compresses blanks to tabs when saving edited
    files.
    
    E! offers programming support by allowing you to compile any source
    file from within the editor without leaving it.  Compiler detected
    errors can be retrieved from the compiler and E! will then point
    directly to the error in the source text.
    
    E! supports full windowing.  You can edit up to six files simultaneously
    on the same screen in separate windows.  Also included in E! is a very
    convenient application programming interface (API) which allows you to
    write new functions and utilities using your usual programming language,
    such as C, Pascal, etc.

  DESCRIPTION
  -----------


      E!  is  a  powerful  full-screen text editor. Its implementation
      has  been  driven  by  three  keywords : quick, simple and efficient.
      It  will  allow  you  to edit as many files as your system memory can
      hold  simultaneously.  A  "split screen" mode is available to see two
      different  parts  of  a file on the same screen. Although E! is not a
      word  processor  it  offers  some functions you will rarely find in a
      text  editor.  His  very  versatile  interface  with  DOS  makes it a
      valuable   tool   for   programmers  but  it  will  be  used  by  non
      programmers as "every day's" text editor.

      And  now,  E!  version  4.0  has  2  new and important features.
      First,  full  windowing  is now supported. You may edit up to 6 files
      simultaneously  on  the  same  screen  in  separate  windows.  And E!
      has  now  a  very  convenient Application Programming Interface (API)
      allowing  you  to  write new functions and utilities using your usual
      language (C, Pascal, etc...).
