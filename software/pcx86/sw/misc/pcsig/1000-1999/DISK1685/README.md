## Information about "AUTOMATIC FORTRAN FORMAT STATEMENTS"

    FMT takes the drudgery out of writing FORTRAN FORMAT statements by
    automatically generating FORMAT statements for you.  Simply use a
    wordprocessor or text editor to create an ASCII file that looks just
    like the output you would like your program to produce.  FMT turns your
    data into a set of FORMAT statements that can be pasted into your
    FORTRAN program.  This is a great tool for any FORTRAN programmer.
    
    The input to FMT is an ASCII file containing the output that is to be
    transformed into FORTRAN FORMAT statements.  The file should look just
    the way it is to appear on screen.  FMT automatically adds the leading
    blank character required by FORTRAN.  FMT can be instructed to treat
    each line in the input file as a separate FORMAT statement.

                                   OPERATION

            The input to FMT is an ASCII file  containing  the  output
        that is to be transformed into FORTRAN FORMAT statements.  The
        file  should look just the way it is to appear on screen.  FMT
        automatically adds the leading  blank  character  required  by
        FORTRAN.

            The name of the input file must  have  the  qualifier  UNF
        (for  "UNFormatted").  The resulting FORMAT statements will be
        written to a file with the same basename and the qualifier FMT
        (for "ForMaTted").  For  example,  when  DESIGN  is  given  in
        response to the FMT prompt

                Enter basename for text to be formatted.
                       unformatted .UNF, formatted .FMT:

        the  text  file  DESIGN.UNF  is  used  to  create  the  FORMAT
        statement file DESIGN.FMT.

        Numerical data

            Digits are represented by carets.  Floating point  numbers
        are  distinguished  by  the presence of a decimal point in the
        string.

                            ^^^^   becomes I4
                           ^^^^.   becomes F5.0
                         ^^^.^^^   becomes F6.3

        Numerical fields  cannot  run  into  each  other.  FMT  cannot
        distinguish between 2I2 and I4.

        Character data

            The tilde (~) represents a CHARACTER*1  variable  (A1).  A
        substring  of  'n'  tildes  becomes  nA1 in the FMT file.  The
        first and last characters of  character  variables  of  length
        greater  than  1  are  denoted by the left brace ({) and right
        brace (}), respectively.

                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~  becomes  12A1
                      {          }  becomes  A12
                      {   }~~~{  }  becomes  A5,3A1,A4



                                     NOTES

            1.  The  qualifier  UNF  is  not  added to the basename in
                response to the FMT prompt.

            2.  Blank  lines in the UNF file become slashes (/) in the
                FMT file.

            3.  Lines in the UNF file with a period (.) in  the  first
                column become blank lines in the FMT file.

            4.  Carets  (^),  tildes  (~),  and braces ({,}) cannot be
                used as text in the UNF file.  If these characters are
                necessary,  use a surrogate in the UNF file and use  a
                text  editor  to  replace  them after the FMT file has
                been created.

            5.  Unbalanced braces will cause the program to  terminate
                with an error message.

            6.  Single  quotes  may appear in the UNF file.  They will
                be doubled appropriately in the FMT file.

                                 STATOOLS(tm)

        STATOOLS(tm) is a set of stand-alone programs designed to fill
        in some of the gaps left by major statistical program packages
        such as SAS, SPSS-X, BMDP, and SYSTAT:

        STAT-SAK is the STATistician's Swiss  Army  Knife.  While  not
        the custom tool for any particular job,  it carries out a wide
        variety of miscellaneous tasks that are not  easily  performed
        by most large statistical packages.  These include probability
        distributions (normal,  t,  chi-square,  F, binomial, Poisson,
        studentized range);  exact confidence intervals  for  binomial
        p's;  Fisher's  exact test for 2 by 2 tables;  Mantel-Haenszel
        test and approximate 95% confidence interval  for  the  common
        odds  ratio;  Bartholomew's  test  for increasing proportions;
        Bartholomew's test for increasing normal means;  one  and  two
        sample   t-tests   from   summary   statistics;    correlation
        coefficients:  test that a population value is  0,  confidence
        interval  for  a  single coefficient,  test of equality of two
        independent coefficients,  test of equality of  two  dependent
        coefficients (coefficients from the same correlation matrix).

        PC-SIZE  determines  the  sample  size requirements for single
        factor experiments, two factor experiments,  randomized blocks
        designs,  paired  t-tests,  and comparison of proportions.  It
        can calculate the power of specific sample sizes  as  well  as
        determine the sample size needed to achieve specific power.

        PC-PLAN generates randomization plans.

        PC-EMS produces tables of expected mean squares  for  balanced
        experiments using the Cornfield-Tukey algorithm.

        PC-PITMAN,   calculates  observed  significance  levels  using
        recursive   relationships   to   obtain   the    randomization
        (permutation)  distribution  of a number of statistics without
        directly examining all possible permutations of the  data.  It
        performs one and two sample randomization tests and rank tests
        in the presence of an arbitrary number of ties in the data.

        PC-MULTI  performs multiple comparisons using Tukey's honestly
        significant differences (studentized range statistic).

        FORGET-IT produces Forget-it  Plots  (also  known  as  Two-way
        Plots),  a  graphical  device  for  displaying the interaction
        structure of a two-way table.

        STRUCTR  fits  structural  relations  when  the ratio of error
        variances is known.

        PC-AIP fits additive-in-the-probits models to  two-dimensional
        contingency tables with ordered column classifications.








        To  obtain  a  set  on  three  diskettes  (for  the IBM PC and
        compatibles running DOS 2.0 or later versions) containing  the

        command  file  that allows SYGRAPH (Systat,  Inc.) to draw the
        measurements curves.  ($5 OR formatted 5-1/4" floppy  diskette
        in a self-addressed stamped mailer)

        WUBA-WUBA:  Converts  space  or comma delimited ASCII files of
        numerical data to MYSTAT/SYSTAT files. ($5 OR formatted 5-1/4"
        floppy diskette in  a  self-addressed  stamped  mailer.  Also,
        accompanies  any  program  that analyzes data in SYSTAT/MYSTAT
        files at no additional charge.)

        GENERIC:  Set of FORTRAN source code that can  be  used  as  a
        template   for  writing  MYSTAT/SYSTAT  supplements.   ($5  OR

            A word about MYSTAT...

        MYSTAT is a full-featured subset  of  the  statistics  package
        SYSTAT  by Systat,  Inc.  MYSTAT can analyze up to 32000 cases
        and 50 variables.  It contains a full-screen editor which  can
        import  ASCII  files and,  through an extensive transformation
        facility,  create new variables and modify existing variables.
        MYSTAT's  statistical capabilities include summary statistics,
        scatterplots,  histograms,  stem-and-leaf displays,  t  tests,
        correlation  coefficients,  regression analysis,  balanced and
        unbalanced multi-way analysis of variance, and the analysis of
        two  dimensional  tables  of  counts.   MYSTAT  will  soon  be
        packaged  with  number  of  introductory statistics textbooks.
        Anyone may obtain a free copy of MYSTAT by sending  a  written
        request to Systat,  Inc.,  1800 Sherman Avenue,  Evanston,  IL
        60201. (Reference:  Wilkinson, L.  (1987), "MYSTAT: A Personal
        Version of SYSTAT," The American Statistician, 41,  334.) I am
        unable to provide copies of MYSTAT.
