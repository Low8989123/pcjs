## Information about "THS ENGLISH  1 OF 2 (ALSO 1743)"

    THS ENGLISH TUTORIAL is an on-line textbook of English grammar and
    usage.  Many of the lessons and examples have a Christian
    orientation.
    
    Chapter One teaches the parts of speech:  noun, pronoun, and adjective.
    Chapter Two teaches the other five parts of speech:  verb, adverb,
    preposition, conjunction, and interjection.  The parts of speech are
    defined according to their functions in sentences; examples are given;
    and exercises are provided, typically using passages taken from the
    Bible, for practice in identifying the parts of speech.
    
    There are a variety of exercises that differ in degree of difficulty and
    type of skills applied.  The computer checks the exercises and gives a
    list of correct answers beside the list of student answers for
    comparison.  On creative exercises the computer offers the option of
    printing the exercises if a printer is available.
    
    Extra exercises are included at the end of the table of contents in each
    part of speech.
    
    The program runs from menus and on-screen instructions.  There are a few
    footnotes for additional help.  The footnotes can be reached from the
    menu screen in any part of speech.
