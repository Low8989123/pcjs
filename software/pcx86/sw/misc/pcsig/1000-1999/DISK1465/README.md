## Information about "BRANDON'S LUNCHBOX"

    Primary colors and cheery music enhance the six programs in BRANDON'S
    LUNCHBOX that drill children, ages 3-7, in basics such as addition,
    number sequences, and letter matching.
    
    Your child can learn upper/lower case letter-matching and play games
    that train memory and teach problem solving. There are also games to
    teach counting and basic addition.
    
    Correct answers are rewarded with cartoon dancing bears, cheerful
    sounds, flashing colors and music. Parents should monitor their
    child's progress and are needed to help with some of the games.

                                  a series of
                             educational programs
                             for 3 to 7 year olds


                            @ 1989, Joey Robichaux 
                               P. O . Box 91016-199
                            Baton Rouge , La. 70816 


         NOTE:
           
            "Brandon's Lunchbox" requires an IBM PC or compatable with 
         color graphics capability.  The programs all use CGA 
         graphics.

            The timing loops in the programs are based for the 
         standard 4.7 Mhz PC processor.  If you're using a faster 
         machine, you may wish to place your machine in "slow" mode. 
         
            "Brandon's Lunchbox" may be copied to and run from a hard 
         drive.  All programs must exist in the current default drive 
         and directory.

            "Brandon's Lunchbox" is a Shareware product.  It may be 
         distributed for evaluation purposes provided that all 
         programs noted in the appendix plus this documentation file 
         are distributed together.
         
             

 


         The LunchBox


         The Lunchbox programs must all exist in the current drive and 
         directory.

         To begin, type "LUNCHBOX" at the DOS prompt and press enter.

                (NOTE: This version of the Lunchbox is 
                customized to display a child's name.  Simply 
                supply the child's name as a parameter.  For 
                example, "LUNCHBOX MARY" or "LUNCHBOX ALEX".)

         You'll see:
         



                                 -------

                          A   B   C   D   E   F 


         
         The Lunchbox contains six educational games.  To select a 
         game from the lunchbox, just press one of the letters A 
         through F. 
         
         To quit the Lunchbox and return to DOS, press a "+" or the Escape
         key. 
         
         


         
        
         Game number one -- Game A 
         
         
         The first game drills letter matching. 
         
         The Lunchbox displays an upper case letter.  The player tries 
         to press the upper case key matching this letter. 
         
         If the player presses a non-matching key, he'll receive an 
         audible warning.  He'll receive a hint -- and a second 
         chance. 
         
         If he misses again, the Lunchbox cycles through to another 
         upper case letter. 
         
         If the player matches the letter successfully, he'll receive 
         an audible award -- plus a "ticky" mark in a tote box on the 
         screen.  He gets two ticky marks on a successful first guess 
         and one for a successful second guess. 
         
         Once the player fills his tote box with ticky marks, the 
         Lunchbox breaks away to a cartoon scene with dancing ... 
         little things.  The Lunchbox then returns to upper case 
         drilling. 
         
         Press a "+" or Escape at any point to quit this first game and 
         return to the main "Lunchbox" menu. 



         
        
         Game number two -- Game B 
         
         
         The first game drills upper and lower case letter matching. 
         
         The Lunchbox displays a lower case letter.  The player tries 
         to press the upper case key corresponding with this lower 
         case letter. 
         
         If the player presses a non-matching key, he'll receive an 
         audible warning.  He'll receive a hint -- the proper upper 
         case key -- and a second chance. 
         
         If he misses again, the Lunchbox cycles through to another 
         lower case letter. 
         
         If the player matches the letter successfully, he'll receive 
         an audible award -- plus a "ticky" mark in a tote box on the 
         screen.  He gets two ticky marks on a successful first guess 
         and one for a successful second guess. 
         
         Once the player fills his tote box with ticky marks, the 
         Lunchbox breaks away to a cartoon scene with dancing ... 
         little things.  The Lunchbox then returns to lower and upper 
         case drilling. 
         
         Press a "+" or Escape at any point to quit this second game and 
         return to the main "Lunchbox" menu. 
         


         
        
         Game number three -- Game C 
         
         
         The third game is a memory / problem solving drill. 
         
         The Lunchbox displays a series of ten doors.  They are number 
         "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", and "0".  This 
         number sequence corresponds with the number keys on the top 
         of the alphabeteic keyboard.
         
         The Lunchbox displays a picture of an object in the center of 
         the screen.  The player tries to guess which door conceals a 
         matching object.
         
         The player can open a door by pressing that door number.  The 
         door opens for a moment, revealing the object behind the 
         door.
         
         If the objects match, the player receives an audible award 
         and the door disappears.  If the objects don't match, the 
         door closes.
         
         In either case, another object appears on the center of the 
         screen.  The matching process continues.
         
         
         As the player remembers which doors conceal which objects, 
         the doors will gradually disappear.  When the last door is 
         opened and matched successfully, the screen cycles through a 
         kaleidescope of colors while a siren wails.
         
         The game then resets and another ten doors appear.
         
         Press a "+" or Escape at any time to return to the main 
         Lunchbox menu. 
         



         

         Game number four -- Game D
         
         
         Game number four is a counting game.
         
         Players see a number of objects on the screen (between 1 and 
         9 objects will appear).  They must press the number key that 
         describes the number of objects on the screen.
         
         If they press the wrong key, they'll receive an audible 
         warning, a hint -- and a second chance.
         
         If they guess wrong again, they'll recieve another audible 
         warning, plus a short repeating drill to reinforce the proper 
         number.  A new set of objects then appear on the screen.
         
         If the player selects the proper number, he's rewarded with an 
         audible trill. 

         Press a "+" or Escape at any time to return to the main 
         Lunchbox menu. 







         Game number five -- Game E



         Game five is a numeric sequence game.  Players are drilled in 
         number relationships on a number line.  The numeric keys on 
         the top of the alphabetic help serve as a number line 
         mneumonic.

         Players receive a starting number between 1 and 9.  They must 
         first select the proper number just less than the given 
         number.  They'll receive a hint if they guess wrong.

         They must then select the next number greater than the given 
         number.  Again, they'll receive a hint if they guess wrong.

         When both lesser and greater numbers are selected, the rest 
         of the number sequence displays in a graphic manner that 
         reinforces the sequential number relationship.

         Press "+" or Escape to return to the main Lunchbox menu.







         Game number six -- Game F



         Game number six is an addition drill.


         Players first see an addition problem displayed in the form:

                       3
                     + 4
                   ------
                       ?

         They must try and select the proper answer.

         If they're incorrect, the program displays graphic objects in 
         the amounts that correspond with the problem.  

         For example, the hint for the above problem may be three 
         sneakers displayed above four sneakers.  The player may count 
         the objects to find the proper answer.  This drills the 
         player in counting -- it also drills the player in 
         identifying patterns of numerical groups.

         If the player misses the problem twice in a row, he'll 
         receive the correct answer.  It will repeat several times as 
         reinforcement.

         When the player selects the proper answer, he'll receive an 
         audible reward.

         In both cases, the game then cycles with a new addition 
         problem.

         Press a "+" or Escape to return to the main Lunchbox menu.







         Shareware


         This Lunchbox is part of a shareware series of educational 
         programs designed for 3 to 7 year olds.  Commercial packages 
         tend to ignore this age group.

         If you've found this program useful, then please consider 
         forwarding a $5.00 payment (or whatever amount you feel is 
         fair) to:

         Joey Robichaux
         P. O. Box 91016-199
         Baton Rouge, La. 70816

         In return, you'll receive notices of other educational 
         packages that are currently available (most for $5.00), plus 
         you'll get on the list for notice of future offerings. 

         In any case, I'd like to hear your comments -- including any 
         ideas you may have for other educational programs you'd like 
         to see.



         



         Appendix -- Required files



         This Lunchbox requires the following files:


         BRUN30.EXE
