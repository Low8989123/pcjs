## Information about "UNDER THE GULF"

    If you're a game player who's considered going pro, here's the test.
    UNDER THE GULF is a game which simulates the actions of a United States
    attack submarine.  You are in control of the nuclear powered vessel
    while the computer controls an opposing fleet of ships and submarines.
    The game takes place in a 500nm x 500nm area of the Black Sea.  In the
    south west corner, two land masses merge to form a natural canal into
    the Mediterranean Sea.
    
    Your mission is to keep all of the opposing ships from reaching the open
    waters of the Mediterranean.  UNDER THE GULF demands the highest level
    of concentration and forces you to stay on top of numerous
    variables -- only the best of you will be able to hack this game, which
    relies heavily on your ability to keep track of your vessel's status.
    
    Your submarine has complete radar and sonar systems, short and long
    range torpedoes, defensive systems, mining systems, and extensive
    navigational capabilities.  Periodically, the weapons systems and the
    enemy ships will be updated.  Unlike the enemy, however, your submarine
    is updated constantly and displayed with numeric status fields.
