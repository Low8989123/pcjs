## Information about "EVERGLADE"

    Programming as a performance art?  Experimental computer composition?
    EVERGLADE is the first work of hypertext poetry ever written, the
    creation of an internationally recognized poet -- author of five books
    of poetry and a forthcoming novel -- who designed and coded his own
    display program in order to achieve the optimal combination of speed,
    beauty, and friendliness.
    
    Unlike help systems and knowledge bases (what hypertext is usually used
    for) in this work, the hypertext links are full of magic and humor,
    enticing the reader to explore for the sheer enjoyment of it.  Reading
    EVERGLADE is like opening door after door in an endlessly intriguing
    mansion.  The poetry was written over a period of four months in the
    spring and summer of 1989, using a technique that gave the poet the same
    freedom to explore that hypertext gives the reader.
    
    Starting from the idea of hypertext -- the world of choices before us
    and what happens when we choose -- the poem moves first into the past,
    memories of childhood, adolescence and hippiedom, marriage, children,
    discoveries of oneself and of community.  Here and there we meet other
    people, explorers like ourselves, and the stories they tell draw us onto
    the paths of their lives into the present and the future.
    
    The author, Rod Willmot, is one of the first innovators to recognize the
    creative potential of hypertext and the art of hypermedia.
