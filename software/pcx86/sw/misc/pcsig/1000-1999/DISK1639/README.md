## Information about "OWL PERSONAL PORTFOLIO MANAGER"

    OWL PERSONAL PORTFOLIO MANAGER is a program that can manage and analyze
    investments and finances for individual investors.  With this program
    you may keep a record of your security investment transactions and
    other assets and liabilities, and produce charts and reports to assist
    you with investment decisions, tax reporting, and loan applications.
    
    From the data entered, the program can produce on-screen or printed
    reports on security transactions, dividend income, security performance
    rankings, portfolio status summaries, and net worth.  You can even
    select which portfolios to include in a given report.
    
    This program can display several charts and graphs on-screen for
    analysis.  These include price/volume graphs with multiple moving
    averages, relative performance charts which show the price strength of a
    security relative to the overall market or other securities, and stock
    and index correlates.  The correlation charts allow the user to see how
    much the price of a security is influenced by the larger market index
    and helps pinpoint abnormal price changes known as breakout points.
    
    OWL PERSONAL PORTFOLIO MANAGER has documentation which either can be
    printed or read screen-by-screen on the monitor.  Also included on this
    disk is sample data to allow you to become familiar with the program
    without having to enter your own information.
