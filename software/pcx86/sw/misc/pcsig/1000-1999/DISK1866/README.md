## Information about "LABEL UTILITIES"

    A pair of programs that will take some of the headaches out of label-
    making.
    
    LABELIT is for printing duplicate labels on any kind of printer that
    accepts label forms.  This program is direct and simple.  It can print
    any number of labels with the same information such as company names,
    return addresses, diskette labels, etc.  These labels can be up to 12
    lines of text and LABELIT will center or left-justify each label if
    desired.  Print one-up or two-up and LABELIT accepts printer control
    codes for custom effects.  The labels can always be re-used since
    LABELIT will save these custom formats to disk.
    
    BAKLABEL does one thing -- it prints sequentially numbered and dated
    labels for the diskettes used in backing up hard disks.  The user
    selects the number of labels, a title line, and the name of the drive
    being backed up.
