QUICK START

POWER DESK requires a hard disk drive because of the extensive filing
system and the unlimited capacity of the database and associated modules.

CONFIG.SYS
You must set the Files and Buffers to 20 (or more) in your CONFIG.SYS
file.  If you are not sure how your system is set, change to the root
directory by typing:

"CD\"
"TYPE CONFIG.SYS"

You should see lines reading:
FILES=20
BUFFERS=20

If not, here are the steps to add these vital commands to your CONFIG.SYS
file:

Type "COPY CON:CONFIG.SYS" (Enter)
     "FILES=20" (Enter)
     "BUFFERS=20" (Enter)
Press Function Key 6 (F-6) which will display a control Z on the screen.
Press (Enter).  The system will respons "1 File(s) Copied"
Restart your system using Control+Alternate+Delete

PATH
POWER DESK uses many DOS commands to perform certain functions.  Therefore,
your DOS files must be in the PATH statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file on
your root directory.

If you are unsure, from the DOS C:> prompt, type: "PATH"

You should then see a list of all the directories in your path statement
among which should be the subdirectory containing your DOS commands.

If you receive the response "NO PATH" then you must set your PATH statement
in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file on your root directory.  To do so, add the
following statement to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

PATH=C:\;C:\(subdirectory)

Where (subdirectory) is the name of the subdirectory containing your DOS
commands.

POWER DESK is shipped with the color code set for color output.  You
can change the color code in the INSTALLATION menu, but on some systems
with a monochrome monitor you may be unable to see the information displayed
on the screen just to get to the INSTALLATION menu.  Therefore, to access
POWER DESK in the Black and White mode from the outset, type:

PD B

This will start POWER DESK in the B&W mode and you can permanently set the
color code in the installation menu.


STARTING POWER DESK
To start POWER DESK simply type PD


POWER DESK is not free.  This program was developed with considerable effort
and craftsmanship over a period of several years.  If you use this program
it is your responsibility to pay the low registration cost of $49 (plus
$5 shipping).  For this registration you will receive a copy of the
detailed, printed documentation, free updates, free telephone support,
and a copy of the most recent version of POWER DESK.

You may register POWER DESK by mail or by phone with a Visa/ MC:

Gentlemen, and Ladies, start your engines--because now you've got       
POWER DESK.  This is the desk utility to turn a computer klutz into a   
power user or let most anyone sail through the daily grind with con-    
fidence and without ever looking at a manual.  Do you need a great      
address filer with mail merge?  POWER DESK's got it.  Would you like    
a word processor with a spell checker and letter head printer, plus     
envelope printer, label maker, calender, scheduler, reminder,           
automatic phone log, an expense log, and file handling capabilities     
to rival many a hard disk utility?  That's POWER DESK, too.             
                                                                        
Not only does POWER DESK rev up and run, it handles like a much more    
expensive model.  Drop down menus give you well-ordered options, and    
every situation is covered by clear instructions available through      
the F1 help button.  Back out of any situation with the Escape key.     
                                                                        
Whether you use POWER DESK as a complete desk organizer, for personal   
time management or just take advantage of its excellent address/mail    
merge abilities, POWER DESK is going to take you as far as you want     
to go.  The program installs itself on your hard disk and then tells    
you to "Prepare printer with continuous paper."  Don't worry about it   
running off a lot of documentation, it prints just one page and a       
quarter of very clear instructions on setting up your computer.  And    
that's all the printed instructions you need to get up and going with   
POWER DESK.
