## Information about "WRECK TANGLE"

    WRECK TANGLE is a challenging strategy game for all ages.  You have to
    match a given pattern by moving different shaped blocks in as few moves
    as possible.  It will drive you crazy as you try to better the lowest
    scores and get your name on the master scoreboard.  There are 25
    different puzzles of varying degrees of difficulty.  When you've
    mastered all 25, you can use the built-in puzzle generator to create
    your own WRECK TANGLE.  Suitable for monochrome and color monitors.
    WRECK TANGLE is another game in the "Mind Maze" series (Maze Cube on
    disk #1419 is the first).
