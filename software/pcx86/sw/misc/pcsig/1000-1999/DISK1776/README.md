## Information about "PC-NURSEWORKS"

    Nurses, make your job easier!  Automate some of the routine tasks that
    take up much of your time.  NURSEWORKS consists of seven modules that
    nurses in clinical practice and nursing students will find helpful.
    
    Module 1 facilitates speedy and accurate tallying of intake-and-output
    ("I & O") sheets.  Module 2 makes short work of all sorts of drug
    dosage calculations:  solid and liquid forms, children's dosages using
    the body surface area method, and individual doses of drugs that are
    administered in mg/kg/day.  Module 3 computes I.V. flow rates using
    standard solutions and administration sets.  Module 4 calculates I.V.
    flow rates for solutions of drugs that are ordered in mcg/kg/min such as
    are frequently given in critical care units.  Module 5 instantly
    displays all of the conversions for temperature, weight, and volume that
    nurses use every day.  Module 6 determines desirable body weight for a
    person's sex and height.
    
    Get the most out of those computers at work.  Suggest that NURSEWORKS be
    installed!
