## Information about "ACTIVE LIFE FOR MS-WINDOWS"

    ACTIVE LIFE is an ambitious daily scheduling program which makes the
    desk calendar obsolete.
    
    Keep track of all of your daily time commitments.  Entering individual
    items is as simple as noting on a desk calendar.  There is a great deal
    of flexibilty in that an event can occur at a specific or ``floating''
    time frame.  Rescheduling events is a matter of one or two keystrokes.
    Daily, weekly, monthly, or even annually recurring events can be
    automatically added to the system saving repetitive entries.  Comments
    can also be associated with events using ACTIVE LIFE's helpful notepad
    editor.
    
    ACTIVE LIFE will generate printed reports of up to three months of
    activity and automatically saves past events for easy retrieval.  Since
    ACTIVE LIFE is a MS Windows application, it can be run quickly from any
    other Windows application, is easy to use and is mouse-compatible. This
    program is the cure for the congenitally disorganized.

                        How to Install Active Life 1.2
                        ------------------------------
The installation process allows you to select which directory you would like
to contain Active Life files. The directory you name will be created if it
doesn't already exist, and the files will be copied from the diskette(s) to
this target directory. Some files are in compressed form on the diskette(s)
and will be automatically uncompressed as they are installed.

Step 1: Insert the Active Life diskette into drive A: and type A:

Step 2: Type one of the following, depending on the version you're installing:

        ALWIN       (Active Life for Windows)
        ALDOS       (Active Life for DOS)
        ALPM        (Active Life for OS/2 Presentation Manager)

Step 3: Turn to the Active Life User's Guide for further information.
        If you have a packaged copy of Active Life 1.2, the manual will be
        in the box. Evaluation disks contain an abridged user's guide in a
        file called AL.DOC. Use the DOS Print command to print this file:

        C> Print AL.DOC
```
