## Information about "PC-WRITE MACROS"

    PC-WRITE devotees will enjoy a macro feast with this collection designed
    for shareware's most popular wordprocessor.  You also get a mass of
    information and three tutorials to educate you on macros -- their care
    and feeding.
    
    PC-WRITE MACROS offers 100 special commands for PC-Write and helps you
    place them on the keys of your choice.  You will gain greater power and
    convenience with many commands not found in PC-Write or any other
    wordprocessor.  With PC-WRITE MACROS you can:
    
    ~ "Grab" an address block from a letter and print it on an envelope.
    
    ~ Reverse the video on your mono or single-color monitor so it shows
    dark text on a light background.
    
    ~ Set up margins, ruler, spacing, all in an instant.
    
    ~ Mark, delete, or transpose an entire sentence or paragraph witha
    single keystroke.
    
    ~ Store deleted text in a special file, ready for retrieval at any time.
    
    ~ Begin continuous printing with one stroke.
    
    A choice of four versions of keyboard and keypad options are provided.
    You can load macros as you need them or keep them in memory to use again
    and again.  You can load them singly or in groups.
