Disk No: 1272
Disk Title: ReSearch (formerly Litigex)
PC-SIG Version: S3

Program Title: ReSearch (formerly Litigex)
Author Version: 1.01

Designed for attorneys, LITIGEX packs the power to document and sort
through caseloads full of research material to find vital evidence.

A research, document, and evidence organizer, LITIGEX lets you enter
notes on evidence or other research, and file up to an eleven line
summary according to source, page, line number and subject.  Notes can
be chained together if 11 lines are inadequate.  Using up to 32,000
entries per hard disk, LITIGEX can file the data under 500 subjects or
types.  Keep tabs on documents or other evidence including who sent it,
where it is located, and where and when it was found.

Scan and find tools are fast and accurate and enable you to sort through
massive files for obscure bits of incriminating data.  The program uses
ASCII, making it compatible with your wordprocessor.
