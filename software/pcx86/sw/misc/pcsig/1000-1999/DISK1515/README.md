## Information about "XYPLOT"

    XYPLOT provides you with a precise graph of your data for better
    visualizing mathematical, scientific, engineering, or business
    information.
    
    This versatile program displays and prints fully calibrated XY graphs of
    up to 1500 plotted points drawn from equations, individually inputted
    data, or imported "fixed length record" data files common to most
    spreadsheets and databases.  X versus Y plots can be produced in a
    variety of line textures.  X and Y axes may be linear or logarithmic.
    The aspect ratio of the graphs may be selected as 1.5 or 1. This
    permits complex data such as a sine versus a cosine to be displayed as a
    circle rather than an ellipse.  Display resolution can be 640 x 350
    pixels (EGA) or 640 x 200 pixels (CGA).  Mouse compatible, but not
    required.
    
    Program Limitations:  HP Laser printing, curve approximations, and bar
    graphs only available in registered version.

        1.0  INTRODUCTION
                                                                      
        
        XYPlot is a general purpose program that may be used as a 
        stand alone program to display fully calibrated XY graphs of 
        data from any source that can generate data files in the 
        "fixed length record" format, such as database programs, 
        accounting programs, sequential files generated in BASIC, etc.  
        Data may also be input manually.  The maximum number of data 
        points is 1500.  XYPlot is a useful tool for engineering, 
        sales, marketing, etc. applications. 

        Resolutions of 640 x 350 pixels (EGA) or 640 x 200 pixels 
        (CGA) may be selected.  The high resolution color choice 
        requires the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA).  The 320 x 200 
        pixel color graphics mode is not used because the resolution 
        is inadequate for useful XY graphics. 

        XYPlot displays X versus Y plots in a variety of line 
        textures.  Bar charts may also be displayed in two or three 
        dimensions.  X and Y axes may be linear or logarithmic.  B 
        spline smoothed curves and least squares straight lines may be 
        generated.  The aspect ratio of the graphs may be selected as 
        1.5 or 1.  This permits complex data such as a sine versus a 
        cosine to be displayed as a circle rather than an ellipse. 

        XYPlot supports a mouse as well as a cursor that is 
        manipulated by the arrow keys. 

        The displays of XYPlot may be printed on an Epson compatible 
        dot matrix printer or a HP LaserJet printer.

        To execute XYPlot use the following syntax: 

        XYP [[Xfilename]][[,Y1filename]][[,Y2filename]]...[[,Y5filename]]

        where:  Xfilename is the name of the X (real) axis filename; 
        alternatively, enter L for a linear X axis

        Y(n)filename are the names of up to five Y (imaginary) axis filenames

        If no arguments are entered with XYP, the screen will prompt 
        for manually entered data or for the filenames you wish to 
        display. 








                                       1

        Example 1:

                XYP L,Y1,Y2,Y3,Y4,Y5 [Enter]

        The initial display will be a monochrome continuous line XY graph 
        of the data in Y1 versus a linear X axis.  Y2 may be selected for 
        display by typing SD [Enter] 2 [Enter].  Y1 through Y5 may be 
        displayed simultaneously by typing NG [Enter] before typing SD.  
        With no grid in effect the screen is not erased and the scale is 
        not changed when succcessive Y axis data inputs are selected by 
        SD.  The line texture and/or color of each trace may be selected 
        to be unique.  The data may also be compared in side by side bars 
        or stacked bars.  The bars may be displayed in two or three 
        dimensions and in color or with patterns to distinguish each data 
        segment.  Labels may be entered at fixed locations on the display 
        or located with the cursor anywhere on the display.  Type Q 
        [Enter] to return to DOS. 

        Example 2:

                XYP SINE,COSINE [Enter]

        The initial display will be a monochrome continuous line XY graph 
        of a sine wave on the X axis versus a cosine wave on the Y axis.  
        The aspect ratio will be 1.5, thus, the display will be an 
        ellipse.  The aspect ratio may be changed to 1 by typing AR 
        [Enter].  The display will now appear as a circle.  Type Q 
        [Enter] to return to DOS. 

        Example 3:

                XYP L,SALES.TXT,FCST.TXT [Enter]

        You wish to display sales and forecast data derived from dBASE 
        versus time.  Using dBASE, copy your sales database field to file 
        SALES.TXT and your forecast database field to file FCST.TXT.  
        This is accomplished by using the SDF type option, e.g., COPY TO 
        SALES WITH SDF.  This automatically appends the .TXT extension to 
        the file.  The L argument will cause XYPlot to initially display 
        your sales versus a linear axis.  You may change the X axis 
        labels to reflect the time period of interest by typing XMIN 
        [Enter] followed by the name of the first month, week, etc. and 
        typing XMAX [Enter] followed by the name of the last month, etc.  
        Overlay the forecast data by typing NG [Enter] SD [Enter] 2 
        [Enter] C2 [Enter] D [Enter].  NG does not clear the screen 
        before displaying the next curve.  SD 2 selects the FCST.TXT 
        file.  C2 selects a dashed line and D displays all of these new 
        parameters overlayed on the original curve.

        2.0  DISPLAY DESCRIPTION
                       
        XYPlot provides flexibility in display format, color, scaling, 
        etc. by use of interactive commands that may be displayed on the 
        monitor when you type HELP [Enter] or press F1.  
                                                         
        The initial XYPlot header display will be replaced by a XY graph 
        display when any key is pressed.  The initial header display may 
        be bypassed on subsequent calls to XYPlot by typing SET [Enter] 
        after the XY graph and the interactive prompt appears.  The 
        screen will prompt: 

        (E)GA or (C)GA

        Responding with E will bypass the initial screen and display the 
        XY graph with 640 x 350 pixel resolution each time XYPlot is 
        called.  Likewise, typing C will bypass the initial screen and 
        display with 640 x 200 pixel resolution.  Typing any other key 
        will not change the operation of XYPlot and the initial screen 
        will be displayed. 

        
        2.1  Default Display 
                             
        The XY graph is drawn on the screen, fully calibrated with 
        default display parameters.  This default display may be modified 
        at will to change scales, labels, colors, etc. 
                                                               
        The default display is a monochrome, solid line, XY graph of the 
        X axis versus the first Y axis data that you entered as arguments 
        after typing XYP.  This display is fully calibrated with minimum 
        and maximum values displayed.  The grid displayed is open with 
        tick marks around the inside periphery of the graph frame.  Both 
        the X and Y axes scales are linearly divided into 10 units.  If 
        the data has negative values, a solid zero line will be 
        displayed.  
                                            

        2.2  Interactive Commands           
                                            
        Practically every parameter of the display may be modified with 
        the entry of interactive commands.  A small rectangle will appear 
        on the lower left corner of the monitor screen when the XY graph 
        is displayed.  This is a prompt for the interactive commands.  
        Commands may be input when this prompt is displayed and followed 
        by pressing Enter.  The interactive commands may be concatenated 
        before displaying the data because the new parameters will not be 
        displayed until the command D [Enter] is used.  Typing HELP 
        [Enter] or F1 will enable you to enter the same commands from a 
        screen display.  A few of the commands may entered with the 
        function keys.  A list of the function key commands may be 
        displayed by typing K [Enter].

        2.2.1 COLOR

        The color commands are only active in the 640 x 350 pixel (EGA) 
        resolution mode. 

        CM  {color menu}--Type CM [Enter] to display a list of color 
        commands and the palette of 64 color selections.  A row of eight 
        colors are displayed in the middle of the screen with the number 
        representing the color printed directly above the color.  You can 
        observe all 64 colors eight at a time by pressing any key to 
        display each successive group of eight colors.  Press PgUp to 
        display previous group of eight colors.  Press End to exit the 
        color palette display selection.  At this time you may enter new 
        commands and return to a graphics display.  The background color 
        is black when the color menu is called. 
        
        CLB  {color labels}--Type CLB [Enter] to change color of labels 
        on the graph.  Enter the desired color number when prompted.  The 
        label color will instantly change. 
                      
        CLN  {color graph lines}--five choices of colors are available to 
        color the graph lines so overlays of data selected by SD may be 
        displayed with separate colors for each Y database.  Type CLN 
        [Enter] and enter the five desired color numbers when prompted. 
                            
        CFR  {color graph frame}--Type CFR [Enter] to color the 
        rectangular frame of the XY graph.  Enter desired color number 
        when prompted.                        

        CBK  {color background}--The background may be changed to a 
        desired color by typing CBK [Enter].  Enter a color number when 
        prompted.  The background color will instantly change. 

        CGB  {color grid background}--The background within the grid 
        frame may be colored separately from the rest of the background 
        by typing CGB [Enter] and entering the desired color number when 
        prompted.                                
                  
        CGR  {color grid}--Type CGR [Enter] to color the grid lines.  
        Enter the desired color number when prompted.  
                                                       
        COL  {color bar outline}--Type COL [Enter] to color the outline 
        of wide and stacked bar displays and the shading in 3D displays.  
        The default color is white. 









                                       4

        2.2.2 CURSOR

        CR  {cursor}--A cursor represented by + may be called by typing 
        CR [Enter].  If a mouse is present the cursor will be an arrow 
        and the mouse will be used to move the cursor.  The cursor 
        appears near the center of the screen.  Move the cursor with the 
        arrow keys or the mouse.  The + cursor will speed up if 
        continuously moved in the same direction.  Reverse directions to 
        slow the + cursor and to permit precise location of the cursor.  
        Press Home (the left button if a mouse is used) to display the X 
        and Y levels in units of the graph data across the top of the 
        graph.  You can resume movement of the cursor after pressing Home 
        to select a new location at which you wish the X and Y levels.  
        Exit the cursor routine by pressing End (the right button if a 
        mouse is used.) 

        MS  {toggle cursor}--The default cursor is an arrow which is 
        moved with the mouse if a mouse is detected by XYPlot otherwise 
        the cursor is a +.  Select use of the arrow keys and the + cursor 
        by use of the MS command.  Using MS a second time returns to the 
        mouse cursor.  MS has no effect if a mouse is not present.

        desired to have the same number of grid divisions as there are 
        data points, type GX [Enter] for the X axis and GY [Enter] for 
        the Y axis, e.g., you X axis data has 12 linear digits 
        representing the 12 months of the year.  The GX command will 
        generate a calibration or tick mark at each one of these numbers 
        or months.  (Note: wide bars and stacked bars will have the tick 
        marks moved to the center of the bars.)

        GLAB  {graph label}--A graph label that appears centered below 
        the X axis label may be input by typing GLAB [Enter]. 
                                                             
        XMIN, XMAX, YMIN, YMAX  {labels in characters vice numerical data 
        levels}--The  calibrated XY graph automatically displays the 
        minimum and maximum value for both the X and Y axes.  If you 
        desire to change any or all the labels you may type XMIN [Enter], 
        XMAX [Enter], YMAX [Enter], or YMAX [Enter].                 
                   
        LEG  {bar pattern or color legend}--When using wide bar or 
        stacked bar charts it is often useful to have a legend that

        LGX, LGY  {log axis display}--LGX [Enter] and LGY [Enter] produce 
        a logarithmetic display of the data in X and Y axes respectively.  
        Of course, negative data cannot be logrithmically displayed.  The 
        grid remains calibrated  with the display. 
                    
        AR  {toggle aspect ratio}--The default aspect ratio of the XY 
        graph is 1.5.  Type AR [Enter] to toggle the display to an aspect 
        ratio of 1.  This permits of display of complex data such as a 
        sine versus a cosine to be displayed as a circle rather than an 
        ellipse.  Type AR [Enter] to return to the default aspect ratio. 


        2.2.10 SELECT DATA

        SDn  {select Y axis data}--If more than one Y axis filenames have 
        been entered you may select any of these data by typing SD 
        [Enter] followed by the number of the Y axis filename you wish to 
        display.  Press Enter after the number is typed.  Up to five 
        filenames may be selected.   

        NEW  {select new data}--Type NEW [Enter] to input new filenames 
        or manually enter data for both the X and Y axis.  The maximum 
        number of data points is 1500.  Manually entered data will be 
        stored in filenames XMAN and YMAN. 

        RS  {restore saved screen}--If you have saved a screen to a file 
        on your disk using the SV command it may be recalled by typing RS 
        [Enter] followed by the filename that you entered when saving the 
        screen.  The colors, format, etc. will be restored on the monitor 
        screen.  Return to the regular display by pressing R [Enter]. 

        SV  {save screen to file}--You may save a display to a file on 
        your disk by typing SV [Enter].  Use RS to restore the saved 
        screen to your monitor for later viewing or printing.
