## Information about "STEVE'S LIBRARY FOR TURBO-C"

    Do you want to speed up your C programs and reduce their size at the
    same time?  STEVE'S TURBO C LIBRARY is a set of direct video functions
    that can do the job.
    
    STEVE'S TURBO C LIBRARY provides a complete facility for direct writes
    and reads in video memory.  This allows you to produce extremely fast
    screen displays, with full control over colors and attributes.  With
    direct video access you can create the rapid, sparkling displays that
    attract users.
    
    A special feature of STEVE'S TURBO C LIBRARY is the "ticker" interrupt
    handler function.  With this function, you have the ability to install a
    special routine of your own to intercept DOS interrupt 1CH.  This allows
    you to perform operations relative to the system's clock.
    
    Several utility functions are also included in the library; search the
    current path for an excutable program, compare two ASCII files, count
    words, lines, characters, etc in a file, time and date formats, and a
    file dump to aid in debugging.
