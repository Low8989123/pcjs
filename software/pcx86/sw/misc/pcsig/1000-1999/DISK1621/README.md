## Information about "EXPLORING THE COSMOS"

    EXPLORING THE COSMOS is an exciting, colorful, planetarium simulator
    that utilizes high resolution graphics to bring the universe to your
    personal computer.  This program is completely menu driven and designed
    to be run without the need to reference a printed manual.  All menus are
    fully self explanatory.  If you need help at any time, simply hit the F1
    key and a pop-up help menu will appear to assist you.
    
    EXPLORING THE COSMOS has many advanced features.  You can display the
    horizon and view from any latitude/longitude at any time in any
    direction.  The stars are shown in simulated intensity, just like a real
    planetarium.  You can watch the stars and planets move across the
    horizon based upon a user selectable update period, from seconds to
    years.  You can point at any object, using the cursor keys to move an
    on-screen arrow, press the enter key and obtain right
    ascension-declination and altitude/azimuth information, object name,
    spectral class, magnitude, name of constellation and highlight of all
    other objects in the constellation.  You can view the solar system
    showing the orientation of the planets about the sun.  This option comes
    with a zoom feature; you can zoom in for close up viewing or zoom out
    for a broader view.  The planets are shown moving in simulated orbits
    about the sun based upon a update period you select.  You can even
    turn on trail generation which plots the paths of the planets over time.
    This makes it easier to see the actual orbits.  You can also select a
    listing of the planets that displays right ascention-declination, rise
    and set time and phase time for each of the planets in the solar system.
    
    Please Note:
    This version contains the following limitations:  it contains only
    200 stars, only allows viewing to the north and the south, and
    shows the stars in 1988.
