## Information about "PC-PROJECT 1 OF 2 (ALSO 1341)"

    PC-PROJECT lets you organize and control complex projects.  It uses the
    critical path method to produce a project schedule displayed in the form
    of a Gantt chart.  It is designed to help you manage complex jobs so you
    can finish them on time and under budget.
    
    PC-PROJECT views a project as a group of tasks or activities.  When you
    supply the estimated duration of each task and the relationships between
    the tasks (the predecessor tasks and successor tasks), it automatically
    calculates a schedule for you and displays it as a Gantt chart.  With
    the chart, you can see when each task should begin and end, the current
    status of each task and whether or not the task is on the critical path.
    Like a spreadsheet, PC-Project can immediately show you how any change
    alters the project's finish date and cost.  This allows you to try
    repeated what-if scenarios until you have reached the optimal project
    schedule.
    
    PC-Project also has a resource worksheet to track payroll,supplies, and
    equipment costs.  The worksheet allows you to list your employees and
    equipment and assign them to tasks, so you can coordinate your resources
    efficiently.  The resource worksheet tracks costs to date, anticipated
    costs, final cost, and cashflow.
    
    The program is completely menu-driven and contains excellent on-line
    help, plus a detailed 75+ page on-disk manual.  If you are moderately
    familiar with project management and critical path method, you will be
    able to use this program with relative ease.  It is written in C for
    increased speed.

PC-PROJECT 1.2  Released 8/1/90
(C) Copyright 1986, 1988, 1990 James Howey All rights reserved

THE PC-PROJECT RELEASE PACKAGE

PC-Project comes on two disks.  The system disk contains the files necessary to 
run PC-Project.  The documentation disk contains a complete manual for      
PC-Project.  The files on each of the disks should be as follows:

     THE SYSTEM DISK

       README   DOC          This file.
       PCPROJ   EXE          PC-Project main program.
       INSTALL  BAT          Batch procedure to install PC-Project.
       PCPROJ   HLP          Text of the PC-Project help screens.
       YESNO    EXE          A program used only during installation.
       SAMPLE                A sample project.
       MONO     DEF          Defaults for monochrome systems.
       BW       DEF          Defaults for black/white, COMPAQ systems.
       COLOR    DEF          Defaults for CGA, EGA, VGA.
       PCPROJ   DEF          Copy one of above three here before starting.
       FORM     DOC          Order form.

    THE DOCUMENTATION DISK

       README   DOC          This file again.
       FORM     DOC          Order form again.
       PCPROJ   DOC          The manual.

A description of the use of each of these files is found in the last appendix 
of the manual.  If you are missing any of these you do not have a valid 
PC-Project release package.  If you are unsure of your copy of PC-Project, you 
can order an evaluation package from BIG PICTURE.  It costs $10.00 and can be 
purchased by writing to PC-Project; BIG PICTURE; Greenwood P.O. Box 30851; 
Seattle, WA 98103.  Use the order form on this disk.  


INSTALLING PC-PROJECT

To install PC-Project on a hard disk, put the system disk in drive A and type:

        a:          (return)
        install c   (return) 

to create \pcp directory on your C disk and transfer software.  (Other drive 
letters will work as well.)  

To install PC-Project on a floppy disk type:

        a:          (return)
        install b   (return)

to create a floppy work disk with essential PC-Project files.  You will be 
required to insert a newly formatted disk in the B drive, so have one ready 
before starting.


RUNNING PC-PROJECT

After PC-Project is installed, it may be invoked on a floppy disk system by 
putting the work disk in drive A and typing the following:

        a:              (return)
        pcproj          (return)

On a hard disk system, type the following:

        c:              (return)
        cd \pcp         (return)
        pcproj          (return)

On a monochrome system, PC-Project can be run from the system disk without 
going through the installation process.  Put the system disk in drive A and 
type: 

        a:              (return)
        pcproj          (return)

It is recommended that you go ahead and use the installation process however.  
This is because you will require a backup disk in any event and this will serve 
quite well as a backup.  In addition, this being shareware, you are encouraged 
to share exact copies of the release package.  If you should modify information 
on the system disk, then you would be unable to pass the software on.  


ORDER INFORMATION

To print order information, put either disk in A and type:

        copy a:form.doc prn     (return)

Substitute any other device or filename for prn to change destination of form.


DOCUMENTATION

To print the manual, put the documentation disk in A, line the print head up on 
the very first line of the page, and type:

        copy a:pcproj.doc prn   (return)

This is going to take a large pile of continuous forms (about 90 pages). 


IF YOU RECEIVED PC-PROJECT IN AN ARCHIVED FORM

If you received PC-Project in an archived form, and have a hard disk, you can 
create the proper release package by the following procedure: 

Format two floppy disks, each with no operating system.  Label the first: 

        PC-Project 1.1 (C) 1986, 1988 James Howey All rights reserved
        SYSTEM DISK

Label the second:

        PC-Project 1.1 (C) 1986, 1988 James Howey All rights reserved
        DOCUMENTATION DISK

Create a temporary directory to hold PC-Project files:

        C:\>md temp             (return) 
        C:\>cd \temp            (return)

Now, use your archive program to extract all PC-Project files into the new 
temporary directory.  

Put the DOCUMENTATION DISK in drive A, and type: 

        C:\TEMP>copy *.doc a:   (return)
        
The documentation disk is done and should be set aside.  Put the SYSTEM DISK in 
drive A and type the following: 

        C:\TEMP>del pcproj.doc  (return)
        C:\TEMP>copy *.* a:     (return)

The system disk is done.  Set it aside and clean up your disk as follows:

        C:\TEMP>del *.*         (return)
        C:\TEMP>cd \            (return)
        C:\>rd \temp            (return)

You should be all set.

If you received PC-Project in an archived form and you have a two floppy 
system, format two disks without the operating system, label them as above, and 
extract the proper files to each of them as shown in the lists at the top of 
this file.  

You now have an official two disk release package to share with your friends 
and co-workers.  Install the software as instructed above.  


Thank you for supporting shareware, and good luck with PC-Project.


UPDATES since 1.11

Added fixed costs to each task, allowing for materials, contracted 
amounts, etc.

Added two new cash flow reports.

Modified printer driver to eliminate initial form feed, allow for 
variable top and bottom margins, and perform better on an HP Laser 
Jet.
