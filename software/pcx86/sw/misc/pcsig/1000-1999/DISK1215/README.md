      PC-SIG is the world's oldest and largest distributor of shareware.
      Since 1982 PC-SIG has been compiling the most respected shareware
      collection anywhere by actively seeking top software authors and
      their high quality programs.

      Shareware is a unique approach to software retailing in which
      consumers purchase software directly from the author.  Individual
      authors avoid costly marketing, promotion, and packaging by
      allowing their programs to be copied and shared with few
      restrictions.  PC-SIG plays a vital role in the sharware process by
      bringing shareware to the consumer.  As a central distributor,
      PC-SIG can give these programs the exposure they deserve at a
      fraction of the cost of bringing a single software package to
      market.  In the end, the consumer wins with great software at
      prices far below traditional retail markets.

      The end user also wins with the opportunity to try the full program
      before buying it from the author.  This ``try-before-you-buy''
      method of software distribution is successful because shareware is
      high-quality software.  Authors are confident that once you have
      used their programs you'll be impressed and want to register.

      The PC-SIG Retail Rack is a great way to obtain the best that
      shareware has to offer.  Buying PC-SIG Shareware insures the
      highest quality, the most current versions, and support for every
      product we distribute.  If you're interested in the shareware
      phenomenon subscribe to SHAREWARE Magazine, a publication dedicated
      to shareware and the programs that make it successful: USA (except
      California) call toll free (800)245-6717, inside California call
      (800)222-2996.

      See these 50 popular titles on the PC-SIG Retail Rack at a store near
      you or order them from PC-SIG for $9.95 each.  These particular shareware
      programs have 4-color packaging and make great gifts.

3 Quick Snacks to make ahead of time and keep on hand:

PIGLETS IN BLANKETS

Cut hotdogs into thirds and wrap with biscuit dough.  Cook in toaster oven
until dough swells and is toasted brown.  Store in ziplock bags and
toss in microwave for 5 seconds when hunger attack hits.

PEANUT BUTTER FINGER FOOD

JIF crunchy or smooth peanut butter.  Add jelly or jam if you have a
sweet tooth.  Smear on bread and chop into eighths, on celery sticks (3"
long) and whatever else you have left over.  Store in zip
lock bags until needed.   Also great on apple slices and for making banana
sandwiches (only they don't store well, so it's make and eat.)

MELLO JELLO

Save all the little margerine containers (6-12).  Mix any flavor Jello and
canned fruit ( or fresh fruit chunks) and pour into containers and pop into
the fridge.  Then when you want a tasty treat, just grab one and plop on a
dollup of whipping cream.  Instant wobbly delite!

   Onions in the above dish have many benefits, they contain sulphur,
vitamins, minerals, salts and protein.  In addition, members of the
onion family have been found to balance blood pressure and cleanse
the body from inside out.  But always keep your mouth tightly shut
when chopping onions and cut the root end off last, to aid in
holding back tears.
