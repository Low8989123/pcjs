## Information about "SALES CALL REPORTS"

    SALES CALL REPORTS (SCR) enables a sales representative to easily and
    effectively use a computer to automate the reporting and customer list
    functions that are usually performed manually or not at all.  SCR will
    help sales reps organize and document their relationships with a
    customer, while helping a company keep records of what their sales reps
    are doing.  And all without ever actually filing reports.
    
    SCR becomes an effective central data source for customer status,
    contacts, specific sales notes, address information, and other
    pertinent data for every sale call.  Mailing labels, Rolodex cards, and
    sales reports are instantly available.  Paperwork is saved, and
    important customer contacts and personal notes won't be lost if a
    salesperson leaves the staff.  Best of all, the program is menu driven
    and so simple, even computerphobes will find it easy to use.
    
    SCR will increase the efficiency of your organization and provide
    better documentation on which to base business decisions.

        The minimum system required to operate SCR is:         
                                                               
          a.  Computer with MS- or PC-DOS                      
                                                               
          b.  512K RAM                                         
                                                               
          c.  Hard disk and 5.25" floppy disk drive    
                                                               
          d.  Printer                                          
        
        Note: SCR may be operated on a dual floppy system provided one 
        of the floppy drives is high capacity (720KB or greater) to 
        hold the SCR programs.
                                                               

        1.3  Disk Contents                                             
                                                                       
        SCR is supplied in archived file on a 360KB floppy disk.  
        AINSTALL.BAT is the program that installs SCR on your hard 
        disk in a directory named SCR.  This program also places 
        SCR.BAT in the root directory of your hard disk enabling one 
        to start using the Argonaut Systems Sales Call Report software 
        by typing SCR while in the root directory.      
                                                 

        2.0  INSTALLATION                        
                                                 
        You need the CONFIG.SYS file on the boot disk to properly run 
        SCR.  If CONFIG.SYS already exists on your disk, modify the 
        file by adding the following lines using your word processing 
        program or EDLIN:                             
                         
                                   FILES = 24      
                                   BUFFERS = 24    
                                                   
        If CONFIG.SYS does not exist on your boot disk you may copy it 
        from SCR disk   Place disk into drive A.  Select drive A by 
        typing:                            
                    
                                   >A: [Enter]  
                                                
        Follow this by typing:                  
                                                
                          A>COPY CONFIG.SYS C:\ [Enter]
                                                       
        Where C:\ represents the root directory of the disk to which 
        you wish to copy SCR.  If the disk is not C, change the letter 
        to the appropriate one.                               
        




                                       2

                
        Begin installation of SCR with the disk in drive A and type:                
                    
                               A>AINSTALL C: [Enter]   
                                                       
        This operation will install SCR on your disk.  If the 
        designation of your drive is not "C:", you must type the 
        appropriate drive letter.      
                                       
        SCR will be installed in a directory called SCR.  SCR.BAT will 
        be in the root directory of drive C.  Use SCR by selecting 
        drive C and typing:     
                                
                                  C>SCR [Enter]   
                                                  
        3.0  GETTING STARTED                      
                                                  
        After typing SCR [Enter] to start SCR the initial SCR menu 
        will be displayed on the monitor.  This menu will reappear 
        after each function is completed.  Select a function by 
        pressing the letter preceeding each function in the menu or by 
        moving the arrow keys to  highlight the desired function and 
        pressing Enter.  This same technique is used for selections in 
        all menu within SCR.  Areas that require operator entry are 
        highlighted.  Most messages (instructions, notes, etc.) appear 
        at the bottom of the monitor screen.  If you have a color 
        adaptor (CGA or EGA) and a color monitor SCR will display in 
        color.    
                
        Setup should be entered prior to proceeding with other SCR

        a search for "Joe" will not be successful if you type "JOE".  
        The complete word is not necessary for a search, e.g., "Joe" 
        would be found if you typed "J" as well as  all other names 
        that begin with "J" in the file.

        5.0  SALES CALL REPORTS
                                                           
        Sales call reports may be developed and saved by pressing B 
        when initial SCR menu is displayed followed by pressing A when 
        the Sales Call Report menu appears.  
             
        6.0  ENTER NEW CALL REPORTS   
                                      
        The most efficient interface between your sales personnel that 
        are making the customer contacts and SCR is the handheld 
        microcassette recorder that each salesperson can use to 
        dictate the call reports.  The tapes can then be         
        transcribed directly into SCR.  This minimizes paperwork by 
        sales personnel and allows then to use their time in effective 
        selling.  Press A to select the new  data entry function.  The 
        current date is automatically displayed for date of contact, 
        but may be changed to any date.  Enter appropriate data for 
        each of the items followed by Enter, e.g.,      
               
        Date of contact  07/27/87  
        Salesperson                
        Company  Acme Widgets, Inc.
                                   
                                   
        A Y for yes is automatically displayed after "Mail list?", but 
        may be changed to N if it is not desired to add this contact 
        to the mail list file or if this contact already is included 
        in the mail list file from prior call reports.  All data entry 
        is followed by Enter unless the data completely fills the        
        space allotted.  After the last entry (EXT) the screen will be 
        replaced by:     
           
        Contact no. 2   
        Contact_________________    
                                    
        If a name is entered additional data items will be listed on 
        the screen that include the contact's title, add to mail list, 
        area code, phone and extension.  The original key contact's 
        phone will appear, but may be changed.  You may include up to 
        five additional contacts in each call report.  If you have no 
        additional contacts and wish to exit this routine, merely 
        press Enter without typing a contact name.  You will be given 
        a last chance to add names if you pressed Enter in error.  The 
        prompt is:                                         
              
        Any more contacts? Y,N   
        
        
        
        
                                       4

        If you press Y when asked if you want any more contacts, you 
        may add more contacts but still limited to a maximum of five.  
        Press N to exit routine.  The following message is now 
        displayed at the bottom of the screen:             
          
        Enter summary:  
        1.  Press Ctrl-PgDn to begin typing summary or contact report.
        2.  Upon completion of text, press Ctrl-PgUp to exit editor.  
        3.  Press Enter to proceed with next page or next input.      
                                                                      
        (Exit editor, press Enter & use 2nd page if text exceeds 35 lines) 
        Press any key to continue...                                       
                                                                           
        Press the Ctrl key and the PgDn key at the same time.  You can 
        now type the text or summary of the sales call report.  At the 
        conclusion of the text, exit the editor by pressing Ctrl key 
        and PgUp key together and press Enter.  The memo file does not 
        keep track of the number of lines of text that you type and 
        will not eject the printer paper at the end of the page.  
        Therefore, if you exceed approximately 35 lines your printer 
        may print past the end of the page.  
                                                                
        If the text of your call report is longer than 35 lines exit 
        the editor and enter a second summary page.    
                                                       
        Upon exiting the first summary page the screen will prompt:
                                                                   
        Complete summary on 2nd page? Y,N                          
                                                                   
        If you respond with a Y you will enter the editor again by 
        pressing Ctrl and PgDn together.  After completion of the 
        text, again press Ctrl and PgUp and Enter.  At the completion 
        of the second page or if you pressed N when prompted for a 
        second page the prompt will be:                     
                                                            
        Edit this call report? Y,N                          
        
        If you wish to make changes in the just completed call report 
        press Y.  The screen will display the same format with the 
        data you enter at the beginning of the contact report.  You 
        may change any of the parameters merely by typing over the 
        appropriate data.  You may move through the data fields with 
        the arrow keys and skip a whole page with the PgDn key.  You 
        can also re-enter the edit mode from the main call report menu 
        after you have displayed or printed the report.  
                                                         
        If editing is not required, press N.  The screen now erases 
        and displays the date of contact, salesperson and company 
        again to permit entry of another contact report.  The date and 
        salesperson displayed will be the same as the last call report 
        to minimize typing if you have several reports by the same

        If you choose to print the cards rather than display on the 
        monitor the next prompt will be:

        After printing the cards the screen prompt will be:

        Press C to print mail labels.  The first menu to appear is the 
        same as for displaying or printing reference cards.
            
        You may choose to display the labels on the monitor without 
        printing them by pressing N in response to the query "Print? 
        Y,N".  Pressing Y will print the labels.  
           
        You are given an opportunity to modify the label format by 
        pressing Y when the following message appears:    
                                                          
        Modify label format? Y,N    
                                    
        Finally you may wish to print sample labels, i.e., asterisks 
        in place of the actual label data just before printing all the 
        labels so you may align the labels in your printer.  Press Y 
        when the message on the screen is:                       
             
        Print sample labels? Y,N   
                                   
        Turn on the printer and load the labels prior to responding.  
        At the conclusion of printing the labels, the monitor will 
        again display the customer mail list

        Should you wish to begin a whole new customer mail list press 
        D to clear files of all data.  If you pressed D in error you 
        have an opportunity to exit the deletion routine when the 
        screen message is:                                    
                
        Are you sure? Y,N   
                            
        Press N to return to the customer mail list menu.  Press Y to 
        proceed with deletion of all data.  If you would like to save 
        this data on floppy disk for historical records press Y in 
        response to the following:               
        
        15.0  EXIT
