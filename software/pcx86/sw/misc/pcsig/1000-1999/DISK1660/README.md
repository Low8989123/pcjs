## Information about "TRACK MAN THOROUGHBRED CHALLENGE"

    Here's one for the serious horse racing fan, a fully integrated and
    comprehensive thoroughbred handicapper and database manager.  Handicap a
    race using actual racing data against TRACK MAN's favorite five. Learn
    how your personal computer can eliminate those tedious timne consuming
    manual calculations.  This shareware version has all the features and
    functions of the commercial version except you handicap against TRACK
    MAN's favorite five horses.  The commercial version allows you to
    handicap up to a ten horse field.
    
    The program consists of two modules; a handicapper module and a database
    module.  The handicapper module is designed to analyze certain elements
    and give predictions for win, place, show and speed.  Data elements
    analyzed include winning time, post position, weight, distance, stretch
    run, track, class, jockey record, times in the money and last race
    finish position.  These elements can be varied to fine tune predictions
    without reentry.  Also included is a feature that displays and prints
    charts to compare data between all the horses in the race.
    
    The database module provides a variety of statistical data elements to
    be tracked including race date, track name/race number, post position,
    jockey or driver name, finishing time, distance, weight, last race
    finish position, if claiming race, jockey or driver rating, times in the
    money, speed factor, names of winning, place and show horse, prices
    paid, and finishing position.  You can add, delete, modify, edit and
    search a record in the database and track your own predictions for win,
    place, show and speed.  Once a horse is handicapped, only data for the
    horse's last race is required when handicapping a new race.  Performance
    data for earlier races of the horse being handicapped is automatically
    added to the handicapper module from the database module for increased
    accuracy and decreased data entry time.
