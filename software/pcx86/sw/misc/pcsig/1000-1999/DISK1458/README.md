## Information about "MICRO SERVE"

    The MICRO SERVE program supports up to four users and a system
    administrator at one time. Depending upon the host machine speed and
    number of ports used, 300 to 9600 baud can be maintained. With over
    32,000 possible menus and nine options per menu, almost 300,000
    different user options can be created. Such advanced functions as
    private mail, conference mode, questionnaires, and file transfer (ASCII
    and XMODEM and YMODEM protocols) are included.
    
    This package is perfect for the small company or individual who wants to
    have a state of the art BBS. Watch out CompuServ!

## CONFEREN.TXT

{% raw %}
```
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Help using the Conference >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

   Conference mode allows multiple on-line users to chat with one another,
much like the CB mode of CompuServe.
   When you enter the Conference, MicroServe will inform other conference
members that you have joined the conference.
   To participate, just start typing a message.  Once you press RETURN,
your message, prefixed with your User Name, is transmitted to all other
conference members.  Press RETURN after about 60 or 70 characters for best
results so that your message is not too long.
   Although not required by the software, observe the following protocol
when using the Conference mode to help streamline its operation.  If you
need more than one line to when transmitting your statement, suffix your
line with ... to inform others that more text is coming.  When you complete
your last line, suffix your message with /O, which is an abbreviation for
"over", which means you are done transmitting and awaiting a response from
someone else.
   One "quirk" about the Conference mode (not unlike CompuServe's CB mode)
is that if you are in the middle of typing a message, another user may have
just transmitted a message, thus trashing the looks of your message.  Note
that your message is not really trashed, it just looks that way on the screen.
If this happens, just finish your messages just as if nothing happened.
Some terminal programs, such as PROCOMM, have a CHAT mode function which
prevents this problem by display input and output in two different windows.
   If you wish to see the User Names of other Conference members, enter
/WHO on a blank line.  Note that this shows only other users who are in the
Conference mode, not users on the system.
   To exit from Conference mode, enter /EXIT on a blank line.  When you
exit, MicroServe will inform other Conference members that you have left
the Conference Mode.
```

## E-MAIL.TXT

{% raw %}
```
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< What is E-Mail? >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

E-Mail is short for Electronic Mail, pretty much like what the post
office does, only here you get mail from users from the system, and
the mail is always private (nobody except the Sysop can read it).

Basically, a regular message base and E-Mail are the same except:

1) When entering mail, you cannot send to ALL
2) When entering a message, the system does not ask you if it is
   a private message (E-Mail is always a private message).
3) When reading mail, the system does not prompt for <N>ext or
   <P>revious, since these functions are not needed.
4) When you log into any MicroServe system that has enabled E-Mail,
   the system will inform you that you have mail waiting when you
   log in (if you do indeed have mail).

## FILEXFER.TXT

{% raw %}
```
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Uploading & Downloading >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


   MicroServe currently supports 4 upload and download protocols; ASCII,
XMODEM, XMODEM CRC, and YMODEM.
   ASCII is for pure text files only, and is almost never used anymore
because most files are not ASCII files, and because it performs no error
checking.
   XMODEM, aka Christensen Protocol (named after its creator), is the very
first public domain error checking protocol.  Although it is light years
ahead of ASCII transfers, it is one of the most primitive of the "error
checking" protocols.  Most terminal communication programs support XMODEM.
   XMODEM CRC is almost exactally the same as XMODEM except this version
performs more robust error checking.  Instead of using a 1 byte checksum
to validate data, CRC impliments a 2 byte validation which greatly increases
data integrity.
   YMODEM is the next generation after XMODEM CRC.  Again, YMODEM is
structured almost identical to XMODEM CRC, with the significant exception
that YMODEM uses a 1024 byte block in contrast to XMODEM's 128 byte block.
Whereas XMODEM must wait for an acknowledgement approximately every 128
bytes, YMODEM transfers just over 1024 bytes before waiting for an ACK.
Since there is 7 times less handshaking and waiting with YMODEM, you get
much higher thru-put of data especially at higher baud rates (2400 or higher).

Downloading from MicroServe:

   Once you have determined the file you want to download, select the menu
option to download a file.  MicroServe will ask you the name of the file you
want to download.  Once entered, MicroServe will look at the first few
hundred bytes of the file to see if it is an ASCII file.  If it is,
MicroServe will prompt for you to select one of all available download
protocols.  If it is not an ASCII file, the program will prompt for one of
all the available protocols except ASCII.
   Be careful when making your selection, as they are case sensitive.  Enter
a lower case x for regular XMODEM, and an upper case X for XMODEM CRC.  Once
you have initialized a protocol from MicroServe, then initialize the same
protocol from your terminal program.


Uploading to MicroServe:

   When invoked, MicroServe will ask you what the name of the file you
are uploading is.  Enter a standard filename.  If the filename syntax
you gave is correct, and if the file does not already exist, MicroServe
will prompt for which protocol to use.  Again, protocol selection IS case
sensitive (See Downloading for details).  When MicroServe tells you it's
ready to receive, initialize the same protocol from your terminal program.
   If you select ASCII uploading, as with most ASCII upload program, the
program has no idea when the upload is complete.  Thus, you must manually
type /EXIT to turn off the upload mode after the upload is complete.

## MENU.TXT

```
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Using the Menu System >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

The MicroServe menu system is designed to be easy to use.  Unlike most other
BBS's where all you get is a command line prompt followed by nearly every
letter of the alphabet as command options (sometimes called expert mode),
or a novice mode that is to specific and time consuming to display between
every command you use, MicroServe displays a brief but descriptive menu for
most basic functions.  Aside from entering the number of the menu options,
there are a few other commands that you may use to navigate through any
MicroServe system:

P - Previous Menu

If you select a menu option that takes you to another menu, enter a P to
return to the previous menu you were in.  Also, simply pressing RETURN
will do the same thing.

T - Top Menu

Takes you to the TOP menu.  Useful if you get lost in a complex structure
of menus and you want to get back to the beginning menu without having
to go through all the previous menus.

I - Index of Menus

Displays a brief index of all the menus in the system.

G - Goto Menu

When used in conjunction with the "I" command, this command allows you to
go to any menu in the system.  Simply enter G x, where x is the menu # of
where you want to go.  This allows you to bypass other menus so you can get
to your destinations quicker.
 
```
{% endraw %}

## MESSAGE.TXT

{% raw %}
```
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< E-MAIL & Message Base Help >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

   There are four basic functions which make up a message base area.
These functions are 1) Enter Messages, 2) Read Messages, 3) Survey Messages,
and 4) Kill Messages.  Your Sysop may have called your menu options for
these functions something else, however, they should reflect the same
functions.  Also note that your Sysop may have excluded some of the functions
from any message base.
   When you enter a message base area, the system will inform the user if
he has any mail and if so, will display the mail message numbers.  The system
will also show the message # of the first message that has been entered since
the user has last called the system.

* Entering Messages

   This option allows you to enter messages into the message base.  When
invoked, the system will ask "To: " to which you enter a user name, or
enter ALL if everyone is to read it.
   Next the system ask "Subject: ".  Enter a few words describing the
message you will be entering (up to 30 chars).
   Unless you are entering E-Mail (which is always a private message) and
the message is not addressed to ALL, the system will ask if your message
will be a private message.  Answer Yes if only the receiver should see
the message, and answer No if everyone is allowed to read it.
   Now the system is ready to receive your message.  MicroServe allows up
50 lines per message, unless your Sysop has lowered this limit.  Simply
type in your message, and finish with a blank RETURN if you do not reach
the maximum # of lines.  Note that the system will automatically line
wrap to the next line if you enter a space after the 64th character of a
line.
   When you are done entering the message text, the system will prompt
with 5 options; <S>ave, <L>ist, <E>dit, <C>ontinue, or <A>bort:

<S> - Saves the message to disk and returns you back to the menu.
<L> - List the message.
<E> - The system will ask what line # to edit.  Enter the line #, then
      the system will allow you to re-enter that line.
<C> - Continue entering lines to the message.
<A> - Abort, does not save the message, and returns back to the menu.


* Survey Messages

   When invoked, this option displays a prompt consisting of a range of
valid messages #'s to select from.  Enter a number within the range to
start the survey.  Message #'s may be suffixed with either a + or -, where
a + tells the system to survey forward to the end of the message base (this
is the default), and a - tells the system to survey backwards to the
beginning of the message base.
   When the survey has completed, the system wil automatically take you
into Read mode.


* Read Messages

   This options displays a prompt consisting of a range of valid message
#'s to read, or enter P to read the previous message, or enter N to read
the next message.
   If you select a message # that has been deleted, the system will simply
re-display the prompt.
   Message #'s may be suffixed with either a + or - sign.  A + tells the
system to read all other forward messages to the end of the file, and the -
tells the system to read all the preceding messages to the beginning
of the file.
   Simply press RETURN at the prompt to return to the previous menu.


* Kill Message

   Select this option to remove unwanted messages.  Again, like the other
message base functions, the system will display a prompt consisting of a
valid message # range.  Simply enter the # of the message to delete, and
the computer will do the rest.
   You may only delete messages that are from you or sent to you.
   Note that all deleted messages are retained in the message base until the
SYSOP purges the message base, and deleted messages are simply ignored when
requested (by read or survey).
   Again, simply press RETURN at the prompt to return to the previous menu.

           MicroServe  is a multi-user bulletin board system designed for
        IBM PC/ATs and compatibles.  The system can support up to 5 users
        at a time (including the local Sysop).
           The  system uses CompuServe type menu screens that are totally
        configurable  by the Sysop.   Up to 32767 menus may exist  within
        the system,  with up to 9 menu options per menu,  for a total  of
        almost 300,000 possible menu options.
           Major functions include message bases (including private  mail
        and  E-Mail),  Co-Sysops, ASCII, XMODEM, and YMODEM  uploads  and
        downloads,  questionnaires, and a conference mode (similar to  CB
        on CompuServe).

           This  system  was developed primarily  to  achieve  multi-user
        capability  of a BBS system for a single user  computer/operating
        system  (MS-DOS).   Secondary,  but important considerations  are
        ease  of  use  for  the  users  and  the  Sysop,   expandability,
        customization, and speed.
           The  system  is  easy  to  use for users  since  most  of  the
        functions  available  are  selected  by  a  menu  screen.    Also
        available to users is a set of direct commands (commands that may
        be issued even though they do not appear on the menu) that may be
        performed  at  any  time while on a menu screen.   Help  for  the
        direct  commands may be displayed simply by entering a ?  at  the
        menu prompt.
           As mentioned earlier,  the system can be expanded by the Sysop
        to  utilize over 32000 menus (gee,  not even CompuServe has  that
        many menus!),  thus,  as long as disk space is available,  system
        capacity is practically unlimited.
          The Sysop can define as many menus as he wishes,  structure the
        menus in any order (much like the directory structure of MS-DOS),
        and make each menu option do one of about a dozen menu functions.
        These menu functions are the building blocks of the  system,  and
        provide the basic services most BBS programs provide:  uploading,
        downloading, message entry, message read, message survey, message
        kill,  logoff, message purge, file display, and a conference mode
        (similar  "chat" on other BBS's).   Each function can be assigned
        an access level from 0 to 255.  If a user's access level is equal
        to or greater than the function's, then the function is available
        to the user.
           Version  2 of MicroServe (formerly known as MUBBS) is  written
        in  Turbo4  (as opposed to version 3),  now  takes  advantage  of
        interrupt  driven input routines and utilizes a user index  file.
        All  of these factors combined result in a system that is  easily
        100% faster, if not more.

           Any  IBM-PC/AT or compatible,  256K memory,  and at least  one
        floppy drive (a fast hard disk is recommended, as this will speed                        ____
        up the system even more),  MS-DOS 2.0 or greater,  up to 4  Hayes
        compatible  modems  (internal or external),  color or  monochrome
        monitor, and obviously, as many phone lines as you have modems.
           Each modem (or serial port) must be set up as not to  conflict
        with  other  modems  for  port addresses and  IRQ's  (your  modem
        documentation should elaborate on this).
           If  Hayes  SmartModem 1200's (or 100%  compatible)  are  being
        used,  then the modem DIP switches should be set at UUDUDUUD.  If
        your  modem's DIP switches aren't compatible with a  Hayes,  then
        set your modem as follows:

        1) Forced DTR disabled.
        2) Forced Carrier Detect disabled.
        3) Auto Answer disabled (the software handles this).
        4) Command recognition enabled.

        All other settings are either not used or set by the software.

        Getting Started        Getting Started        Getting Started

           If  you are using a hard drive,  create a sub-directory called
        MICROSRV and put all of the files and programs in that directory.
        Also, modify (or create) your CONFIG.SYS file so that it contains
        the line "FILES=20" (without the quotes).
           Enter "MICROSRV" to start the program.   Any system files  not
        found will be created by the program.   As a default,  the system
        uses COM1 only, so be sure you have at least one modem (or serial
        port) initialized as COM1.
           The distribution disk comes with a sample MENU.DAT and several
        TXT  files.   These samples are to help give you ideas on how  to
        set  up  your  system.   If you are upgrading from version  1  to
        version  2,  your  USER.DAT  and message.MSG files  must  be  re-
        initialized  by  MicroServe (they are not compatible).   You  may
        preserve your MENU.DAT, and all your .TXT files.
           Once  the system initializes it will display  the  status/user
        screen.   This is the main screen,  and where all the action will
        take place.
           Here are the basic steps you'll need to take to get MicroServe
        up and running: 1) go into Setup and configure the system to suit
        your  application, 2) login to the system and set up your  menus,
        and   3)   edit  the  BULLETIN.TXT,   WELCOME.TXT,   GOODBYE.TXT,
        BADBAUD.TXT  and  NEWUSER.TXT  files to finish  setting  up  your
        system.   See the Appendix for more specific information on these
        files.
           This  is just a rough overview of what needs to be done.   See
        the  appropriate section of this manual for specific  details  on
        how these functions work.
           Oh,  and don't forget to change your sysop password (and other
        vital statistics) via the C direct command (see section 3).

        Section 2                                     Sysop Function Keys        Section 2                                     Sysop Function Keys        Section 2                                     Sysop Function Keys



           The  Sysop  function keys allow the Sysop to  perform  special
        functions such as exiting the program, creating reports, snooping
        on  other users,  and other functions from the main  console,  as
        such options would be impractical or impossible to perform from a
        modem.
           As  many  Sysop  functions as practical  were  implemented  as
        internal  functions  (accessible by modem,  whereas  an  external
        function  can  only  be accessed from the  main  console).   This
        allows  greater  flexibility for the Sysop,  allowing  other  Co-
        Sysop's  to perform such functions as  creating/modifying  menus,
        purging message bases, and changing user access levels or  delet-
        ing users.
           This  section will describe all the external functions of  the
        system.   Each  external  function is initiated by  pressing  the
        corresponding  function key.   Here is a detailed description  of
        the Sysop functions available:



        F1 - LOGIN        F1 - LOGIN        F1 - LOGIN

           This  allows the console user to log into the system as if  he
        were dialing in by modem.   After pressing F1,  press <ENTER>  to
        get the systems attention.   It will then display the WELCOME.TXT
        file,  then  prompt  the user to login.   As a default,  type  in
        "SYSOP" (without the quotes) for the User ID,  and "ROOT" as  the
        password.   While  in  this  mode,  all other function  keys  are
        disabled  until  the user has  logged  off.   Obviously,  do  not
        attempt to use the Xmodem protocol while in this mode,  as it may
        send control codes to your monitor, causing unpredictable results
        (system hangs, screen slop, or who knows).



        F2 - SNOOP        F2 - SNOOP        F2 - SNOOP

           This  function allows the user at the main console to "spy" on
        any active port.
           When invoked,  the program will prompt for which port to snoop
        on.  Enter the number (1-4) of the port to snoop.  If the port is
        inactive,  the system will display a message to that effect,  and
        return  to COMMAND mode.   If the port is active,  then all  data
        that  is being transmitted to and received from the selected port
        will be echoed on the main console.
           If the port being snooped is getting ready to send or  receive
        a  file via Xmodem,  be sure to terminate the snoop mode,  as the
        system  will also attempt to display the binary  data  associated
        with the file transfer on the console screen.  Binary files being
        displayed on the main console could hang the system, or result in
        some other unpredictable manner.
           SNOOP stays active until another function key is pressed.

        F3 - MESSAGE        F3 - MESSAGE        F3 - MESSAGE

           This  function  allows  the user at the main console  to  send
        messages directly to a single user or to all users at once.
           When invoked,  the system will ask the port number to send the
        message to,  or 0 for all.   If 0 or an active port is  selected,
        the program will prompt for the message to send.   Enter one line
        of  text  up  to 60 or 70 characters,  then  press  <ENTER>  when
        finished  and  ready  to send.   The message  will  be  displayed
        immediately to the active port(s).
           One  instance in which this function may be useful is when you
        need  all  users  to  log  off  the  system.    Instead  of  just
        terminating  their connections,  you can give them a few  minutes
        warning.


        F4 - SETUP        F4 - SETUP        F4 - SETUP

           This  is where the local Sysop defines hardware  and  software
        setup information.
           When invoked,  the system will display a 3 option menu.  These
        options  are 1) General Setup,  2) Modem  Configuration,  and  3)
        Exit.

        General Setup

        Number of Ports:  This option defines the number of modems hooked
        up  to your system.   Enter a number from 0 to 4.   Entering a  0
        will disable all ports on the system.   Entering a number greater
        than the actual number of ports on your system will unnecessarily
        slow  down  the  speed  of  the  system,  and  could  also  cause
        mysterious things to happen.

        Connection Type:  Normally,  this option should always be set for
        Modem, however, it is possible to hook up a terminal (or computer
        using  a  terminal program) directly to the serial ports  of  the
        machine  running  the  MicroServe.    If  this  configuration  is
        desirable,  enter a D.  To select modem again, enter M.

        New User Access:  If a private BBS is desired,  then enter N  for
        this option.   Then, only users who already exist within the user
        file are allowed access.

        New  User  Access Level:  If new users are allowed access to  the
        system,  this  option  sets the access level that new  users  are
        given.  Enter a number from 1 to 255.  Note that access levels of
        200  or more are reserved for Co-Sysops,  so avoid making  access
        levels that high.

        Maximum Message Length:  Enter a number from 1-50.  This sets the
        maximum  # of lines users may enter into any one  message.   This
        number may be increased or decreased as needed.

        Auto Exit Time (HH:MM): A valid hour/minute entry (military time)
        will cause MicroServe to automatically terminate at the designat-

        ed time.  Useful for performing automatic backups or other house-
        keeping chores.  MicroServe will fail if it is initialized at the
        same time this function is set for; in other words, wait at least
        a  minute after an automatic exit before  restarting  MicroServe.
        Note that users are given no warning when the system exits, so be
        sure  to give ample warning in your system  files  (BULLETIN.TXT,
        HELP.TXT, etc).
        Daily  Time  Limit:  If  Zero,  allows unlimited usage  per  day,
        otherwise,  denotes the maximum number of minutes a user may  use
        the  system  each  day.    NOTE:  This  function  not  yet  fully
        implemented.

        Baud  Rate  Charge  Factors:   These options allow the  Sysop  to
        charge users based on the number of minutes they use,  plus  what
        baud  rate  the user is using.   As a default,  a credit  is  one
        minute  of  usage  at 300 baud.   Since 1200 baud is  four  times
        faster than 300 baud, thus allowing a user to get 4 times as much
        information per minute,  a user connected at 1200 baud is charged
        4 credits a minute.  The same formula is used to compute 2400 and
        9400  baud  connections.   Currently,  MicroServe  does  properly
        compute  user credit,  but the Sysop must manually reset  credits
        and bill users.   Future versions of MicroServe may automate this
        process.

        Modem Configuration

           Up  to 4 modems may be connected to  MicroServe.   All  modems
        and/or  serial  ports MUST be set up with unique IRQ's  and  port
        addresses.   MicroServe  defaults to MS-DOS standard COM1 &  COM2
        settings  if  no  CONFIG.DAT  file  exist.   Future  versions  of
        MicroServe may allow the sharing of IRQ's.
           When  setting  up  modem ports,  keep in mind  that  you  must
        configure  the ports consecutively.   If you have one port,  then
        the first line MUST be configured,  if you have two  ports,  then
        the  first  two ports must be configured,  etc.   You can't  skip
        lines, or start from the bottom.
           If  automatic  baud rate detection is desired for  a  specific
        port,  enter zero for the baud rate.   If you wish to dedicate  a
        specific  baud  rate  for a port,  enter the desired  baud  rate.
        Users  who connect to a port reserved for a baud rate other  than
        that  to  which they connected will still connect,  however,  all
        they  will receive is the contents of the BADBAUD.TXT file,  then
        be automatically logged off.
           The default "Modem Initialization Command" should suffice  for
        those  of  you  using  Hayes  compatible  modems.   Most  of  the
        parameters  are  mandatory,  but  some like "S0=1"  (auto  answer
        register  setting) may be changed to suit your  needs.   See  you
        modem manual for more detail on specific modem commands.
           Here  are  the default settings in case you  accidentally  zap
        yours:

           On  some BBS's,  this function is also known as a "nerd"  key.
        This  function allows the user at the main console to  disconnect
        any active port.
           When  invoked,  the system will prompt for the port number  to
        terminate.   Enter  a number from 1-4,  and press ENTER.   If the
        selected port is an active port, the system will drop the carrier
        detect signal momentarily, thus causing the modems to disconnect,
        and, in effect, terminating the user.



        F6 - RE-NDX        F6 - RE-NDX        F6 - RE-NDX

           This  function re-indexes the USER.DAT file.   Whenever  users
        are  deleted  via the C direct command,  this function should  be
        performed afterwards to maintain integrity of the index file.
           If you never delete users,  perform this function about once a
        week anyways to prevent your index from getting corrupted.


        F7 - REPORTS        F7 - REPORTS        F7 - REPORTS

           Two  reports  are available from the system.   One is  a  User
        list, and the other is a Menu Structure report.  Both reports are
        written to a disk file instead of the printer port.   This allows
        for  other programs to access the data.   Simply use DOS commands
        to send the contents of the files generated to your printer.
           Reports can be printed at any time.  If the report you wish to
        generate  contains lots of data,  you may wish to wait until  all
        users have logged off the system, otherwise, system response time
        may be extremely slow.

           User  List  Report  - This  report  generates  a  file  called           User  List  Report           User  List  Report
        USER.RPT.   There  are 13 fields printed for each user within the
        system.   These field names are not printed in the report, but in
        most cases,  the data is self explanatory.   Each user record  is
        printed in 4 lines, which are basically split into 3 columns.
           Here is the field format of the report:

        User Name     Access         Phone #            Last Date Called
        Real Name                    Computer           Times Called
        Address                      Interest           # of Uploads
        City, State Zip              Password           # of Downloads

        See Appendix B for a report sample.

           Menu  Structure Report - This report generates a  file  called           Menu  Structure Report           Menu  Structure Report
        MENU.RPT.   There  are  up to 50 fields displayed for  each  menu
        within  the  system.   Some  field names are not printed  in  the
        reports,  and  each field will be described here  instead.   Each
        menu  record  is printed in 15 lines,  and most of this  info  is
        printed in 5 columns.
           The main purpose of this report is to help the main Sysop keep

        easier  control  of the system.   Small systems shouldn't be  too
        hard  to handle,  but if you wish to make your system as  big  as
        commercial  on-line  services,  then this report should  come  in
        handy.   Maybe one of you Sysop programmers could write a program
        to  display  the contents of this report in a tree  structure  or
        some  kind  of flow chart,  as that would make it much easier  to
        read.  In any case...
           Here is the field format of this report:

        Menu #                                (sequential record number)
        Name
        Access                 (minimum access level required to access)
        Directory        (the DOS directory all associated files are in)
        Called From                       (menu # that called this menu)
        Co-Sysop            (Name of the Co-Sysop in charge of the menu)
        1  Option 1 Description        Access  Function  Filename  Menu#
        (..)
        9

           After the Co-Sysop information,  9 lines of data corresponding
        with  each possible menu option,  is displayed.   The first field
        displayed is the option description (what the user sees when  the
        menu is displayed).
           The  second field is the minimum access level required for the
        user before the option is available.
           The third field is the letter corresponding to the function of
        the option.  These functions are described in detail later.
           If the function requires a filename (such as message bases and
        text file),  it will be displayed in the third column.   Remember
        that  all files displayed in this column will be in the directory
        identified by the directory field from above.   If nothing is  in
        the  directory  field,  then  all  the files are  simply  in  the
        "current" directory.
           Finally,  the  last field is the Menu # field.   If  the  menu
        option  is  a menu,  this field points to the  sequential  record
        number of the menu.  See the sample report in Appendix B, as this
        may help clarify the overall picture.


        F8 - EXIT        F8 - EXIT        F8 - EXIT

           Obviously,  this option terminates execution of the MicroServe, and
        returns back to DOS.  If users are still on-line when this option
        is  selected,  the  system will display a  warning  message,  and
        prompt the user if it is still OK to exit.


        F9 - CALLERS HOTKEY        F9 - CALLERS HOTKEY        F9 - CALLERS HOTKEY

           This  function  key simply displays the last few  callers  who
        have called the system.  This makes it easier to see if you  have
        had any new callers recently rather than having to login to  view
        the callers file or view the CALLERS.TXT file from DOS.

           Direct  commands are performed while on-line (logged into  via
        F1  or  by calling in).   These commands can be performed at  any
        time  on  any  menu prompt by any user:


        ? - Display Help        ? - Display Help        ? - Display Help

           This  function  displays  the contents of the  HELP.TXT  file,
        which  contains  the  help  information  for  the  other   direct
        commands.   Obviously,  the  contents of the HELP.TXT file may be
        changed  to  include  more  or  less  information,   and  can  be
        customized to your liking.


        C - Change User Information        C - Change User Information        C - Change User Information

           Enter "C" from any menu to display your vital statistics.  The
        system will display all personal and system information about the
        user.   Users may also change any of the first 13 items by simply
        entering  the  field number of the field to change.   The  system
        will prompt "Enter new value:".  Enter the new field contents and
        press RETURN.
           The  fields above 13 are displayed for user  convenience,  and
        may be changed only by the Sysop.
           Note  that when users change their password,  the system  will
        NOT  hide  user keystrokes,  nor prompt users to  re-enter  their
        password.   The  program is using a generic input  routine  here.
        Future  versions  of  MicroServe will provide for a  little  more
        security here.   In the meantime,  users should be sure no one is
        looking  over  their  shoulder if they  decide  to  change  their
        password.

        Being a Public User

           If users select to be a public user, they allow other users to
        view their user information.   Nothing there should be classified
        information,  thus,  encourage all users to be public users.  For
        users who are spies,  anti-social,  or just plain shy,  they  may
        select  to  be a private user,  thus preventing other users  from
        viewing their user information.


        D - Display Date and Time        D - Display Date and Time        D - Display Date and Time

           This options needs no further explanation.

        E - Examine  User Information        E - Examine  User Information        E - Examine  User Information

           Enter "E username" from any menu where "username" is the  name
        of  the user to examine.   If "username" is a  public  user,  the
        system will display all the user's vital statistics.
           Of course, the Sysop may Examine any user, public or private.

           Each  menu  is assigned a sequential record number,  which  is
        displayed in the upper right hand corner of the menu.   All menus
        may be accessed directly using the G command, i.e. entering "G 6"
        (without the quotes) would take the user directly to the menu #6.
        This  is  a shortcut that users will begin to use once  they  get
        tired of waiting on the menu screens.


        I - View Index of Menus        I - View Index of Menus        I - View Index of Menus

           This  command  will display the Menu # and name  of  all  user
        accessible  menus  in the system.   This command should  come  in
        handy if there are a large number of menus in your system.  Users
        can  use  information from this function to better utilize the  G
        command.


        L - Logoff        L - Logoff        L - Logoff

           This command will display the GOODBYE.TXT file,  then log  the
        user  off the system and disconnect the modem.   If logged in via
        F1,  obviously,  no modem disconnection will take place, however,
        the program will return to COMMAND mode,  where use of any of the
        other function keys is allowed.



        P - Goto the Previous menu        P - Goto the Previous menu        P - Goto the Previous menu

           Entering P at the menu prompt will return the user back to the
        previous menu (unless the user is already at the TOP menu).  If a
        menu  is accessed via the G command,  entering P will not  return
        the user to "actual" previous menu,  but rather, to the parent of
        the menu in use.
           Pressing  a  RETURN  only at a menu prompt will  do  the  same
        thing.


        T - Goto the TOP Menu        T - Goto the TOP Menu        T - Goto the TOP Menu

           This  command  will return the user directly to the TOP  menu.
        The  same  thing can be accomplished using the  G  command,  i.e.
        entering "G 0" would also return the user back to the TOP menu.

           Being  a multi-user BBS,  this is a nifty command that  allows
        the  user  to see who else is on the system,  where they  are  at
        (menu #), and what exactly they are doing.  Also displayed is the
        comm  port  number being used by each user.  This number  can  be
        used to send messages directly to on-line users.

           One line messages can be sent directly to other on-line  users
        by  entering the comm port number of the user you wish to send  a
        message to,  followed by your message,  i.e. if JOE BLOW is using
        port 2, then entering "2 Hello Joe, how u go today?" (without the
        quotes)  directly from the menu prompt will immediately send  the
        message  to Joe's screen.   If the intended receiver is uploading
        or downloading, the message is discarded.

        Section 4                                   Sysop Direct Commands        Section 4                                   Sysop Direct Commands        Section 4                                   Sysop Direct Commands



           Sysop direct commands are performed while on-line (logged into
        via F1 or by calling in).  These commands can be performed at any
        time  on any menu prompt by any user with an access level of  200
        or greater:


        A - Assign Co-Sysop to Menu        A - Assign Co-Sysop to Menu        A - Assign Co-Sysop to Menu

           If  you wish to set up a large system with many message bases,
        you, the head Sysop, may wish to delegate some authority to other
        users,  or Co-Sysop's.   These co-sysops can then read all public
        and private messages in all message bases in their menu, kill any
        message,  and,  if the head Sysops desires, perform purges on the
        message  bases.   Also,  all messages addressed to "Sysop"  in  a
        message  base are automatically redirect to the  Co-sysop's  user
        name.
           As  a  default,  all menus automatically set the  Co-Sysop  as
        "SYSOP",  which  is the user name for the head Sysop.   To change
        this setting,  enter "A SPUDS" (where SPUDS can be any user  name
        of  a user you wish to assign as co-sysop) from the menu you wish
        to give to SPUDS.   The menu from which this command is performed
        is then reassigned as the co-sysop.


        M - Modify Menu        M - Modify Menu        M - Modify Menu

           This is perhaps the most important,  and most powerful command
        in the system.  It is from this command that allows you to design
        and set up your system menus and their respective options.
           As you have probably already noticed,  whenever you are logged
        in  as Sysop (or any user whose access level is 200 or  greater),
        to  the  right of each menu option is a  number  in  parenthesis.
        This is the absolute line number of the menu option,  and this is
        the  number  that  should be referenced  whenever  modifying  the
        menus.   Do not use the menu option (first) number, as it may not
        reflect the absolute menu line number.
           Each menu can have no more than 9 menu items.  If a menu needs
        more  items,  simply make the last menu item access another  sub-
        menu from which the remainder of your functions may be called.

          When  the "M" direct command is invoked,  the program will  ask
        for the menu item # to change.  Enter the absolute line number of
        the  menu  option  you wish to create/change.   To create  a  new
        option, select a number (1-9) not yet used in the menu.
           Next,  the  program will ask which "function" the menu item is
        to perform.  Functions are entered as a single capital letter, of
        which  are listed below,  and described in more detail in section
        5.
           Now  the  program will prompt for a description  of  the  menu
        function.   Enter  anything up to 40 characters long to  describe
        the  menu option.   This description is what will appear when the
        menu is displayed.

           The  program  will now ask the access level of  the  function.

        Enter a number from 0 to 255.   Entering a zero will disable  the
        function.   A  user must have an access level equal to or greater
        than  the  menu item access level to be  granted  access.   Users
        who's  access  levels are less than the menu items  access  level
        simply won't see the item displayed on the menu.
           Depending on the function selected,  the system may prompt for
        a filename and a directory name for the function.   If a filename
        is  required,  do not enter any drive  letters,  directories,  or
        extensions  of the file.  File extensions are  automatically  as-
        sumed depending on the function selected.
           Here is a list of functions and what they do:

           Function     Description

           C            Conference mode.
           D            Download mode.

           U            Upload mode.

        See  section five for more detailed information  on  implementing
        and using these functions.


        R - Reset Bulletin Flags        R - Reset Bulletin Flags        R - Reset Bulletin Flags

           Most BBS programs force users to always read the bulletin file
        each  time  they log in,  and for frequent  users,  this  can  be
        extremely  annoying  when the bulletin file always  contains  the
        same  old information;  and when the Sysop does post a new notice
        in the file,  it will usually be overlooked by the user since  he
        is so used to ignoring it (or aborting, if allowed).
           For  each user record there is a flag which determines if  the
        bulletin file is to be displayed to the user when he logs on.  If
        the flag is true,  the file is displayed and the flag is set back
        to false so that subsequent logins do not display the file.
           The R command is thus used to set all user flags back to true.
        This  command should be performed only when some new  information
        has been posted in your BULLETIN.TXT file.

        C - Change User Access/Delete User        C - Change User Access/Delete User        C - Change User Access/Delete User

           This  command  allows  the  Sysop to  delete  users  from  the
        USER.DAT file, or to change user information.
           To invoke, simply enter "C SPUDS" where SPUDS is the user name
        of  the  user  you wish to change.   The program will  prompt  to
        "<D>elete or <C>hange Info?".
           It's  a good idea to re-index the user file after  users  have
        been deleted or user names have been changed.
           If "Change Info" is selected,  the program will display  the
        user's information and prompt for which fields to change.

        C - Conference        C - Conference        C - Conference

           This  is  a  chat  mode,  where all users of  the  system  may
        converge and "chat" with one another.  When invoked, simply enter
        a line of text you wish to transmit.  Transmission of the text is
        not  performed  until ENTER is pressed at the end  of  the  line.
        Enter "/WHO" to see who else is in the Conference mode,  or enter
        "/EXIT" to exit the conference and return to the calling menu.
           The  conference  mode will also notify conference  users  when
        someone new joins the conference, and when someone leaves.
           All  messages transmitted in conference mode are automatically
        prefixed with the user name of the user sending the message.
           This  mode  works  the best when  the  callers  communications
        program  supports  a  "chat"  mode of it's  own  (Procomm  is  an
        excellent  communications program that supports such a  feature).
        This keeps users screens from getting messed up when other  users
        send messages while you are in the middle of typing one yourself.


        D - Download        D - Download        D - Download

           MicroServe currently supports 4 upload and download protocols;
        ASCII, XMODEM, XMODEM CRC, and YMODEM.
           ASCII  is for pure text files only,  and is almost never  used
        anymore  because most files are not ASCII files,  and because  it
        performs no error checking.
           XMODEM, AKA Christensen Protocol (named after its creator), is
        the  very first public domain error checking protocol.   Although
        it is light years ahead of ASCII transfers, it is one of the most
        primitive  of  the  "error checking"  protocols.   Most  terminal
        communication programs support XMODEM.
           XMODEM  CRC is almost exactly the same as XMODEM  except  this
        version performs more robust error checking.  Instead of using  a
        1 byte checksum to validate data, CRC implements a 2 byte valida-
        tion which greatly increases data integrity.
           YMODEM is the next generation after XMODEM CRC.  Again, YMODEM
        is   structured  almost  identical  to  XMODEM  CRC,   with   the
        significant  exception  that  YMODEM uses a 1024  byte  block  in
        contrast  to XMODEM's 128 byte block.   Whereas XMODEM must  wait
        for  an  acknowledgement approximately every  128  bytes,  YMODEM
        transfers just over 1024 bytes before waiting for an ACK.   Since
        there  is 7 times less handshaking and waiting with  YMODEM,  you
        get much higher thru-put of data especially at higher baud  rates
        (2400 or higher).
           Once  a user has determined the file to download,   MicroServe
        will  ask  the  name  of the file  to  download.   Once  entered,
        MicroServe  will look at the first few hundred bytes of the  file
        to see if it is an ASCII file.   If it is, MicroServe will prompt
        to select one of all available download protocols.   If it is not
        an  ASCII  file,  the  program will prompt for  one  of  all  the
        available protocols except ASCII.
           Selections  are  case sensitive.   Enter a lower  case  x  for
        regular  XMODEM,  and  an upper case X for XMODEM  CRC.   Once  a

        E - Enter a Message        E - Enter a Message        E - Enter a Message

           This  function  is  one of a set of 5 related  functions  that
        allows  the  SYSOP to build message bases.   When selected  by  a
        user, this function allows the user to enter a message, public or
        private,  to  the  message base filename entered  when  the  menu
        option  was  created.  All message bases contain two  files,  the
        header  file (extension of .HDR) contain the survey  information,
        and  the  .MSG  files contain  the  actual  messages.   When  the
        function  prompts to whom the message is for,   enter the user ID
        of the user you wish to send the message to or enter ALL if  it's
        a  general  message  to be read by everyone.  If the  message  is
        address to SYSOP, the message is automatically redirected to  the
        co-sysop  of  the message base (if one is assigned  via  the  "A"
        direct command).
           Message  lengths may vary from 1 to 50 lines.   This option is
        configured in "General Setup".   This option may be increased  or
        decreased without scratching your files.


        F - Display File        F - Display File        F - Display File

          This  function allows the filename specified when creating  the
        option  to  be displayed.   All filenames specified must have  an
        extension  of  TXT or CLR.   TXT files should be pure ASCII  text
        with no special graphic codes or otherwise.
           If users select ANSI graphics when they initially log in, then
        this function first attempts to display files with CLR (short for
        color) extensions.   If that file is not found,  then it will re-
        try looking for an extension of TXT.  This allows you to dress up
        your system with graphics and colors for users who support  ANSI,
        yet  allows  non-ANSI users to enjoy your system without  getting
        garbage.
           The best way to accomplish this is to always start by creating
        pure TXT files.   When the TXT file is completed,  make a copy of
        it with the CLR extension, then put your ANSI codes in that file.


        K - Kill a Message        K - Kill a Message        K - Kill a Message

           This function allows a user to kill any messages created by or
        addressed to him.   Messages are simply marked deleted,  and  are
        not physically removed until a Purge is performed.


        L - Logoff        L - Logoff        L - Logoff

           Logs  the user off and disconnects the modem.   This does  the
        same thing as the "L" direct command.

           Creates  a new sub-menu from which even more functions may  be
        utilized.   When  creating,  the system ask for a directory  name
        also.   All files (.TXT,  .MSG,  file uploads and downloads) will
        then  have  to be in the directory (if one  is  specified).   All
        directory names MUST be suffixed with a backslash (\).  Directory
        names  may also be prefixed with other drive  designators.   This
        will allow you to use other drives on your system.  Sub-menus may
        be nested as deeply as you wish,  as long as no more than  32,767
        menus exist in your system!


        P - Purge Messages        P - Purge Messages        P - Purge Messages

           This  is  a utility for any message bases  you  have  created.
        This  function  will physically remove all deleted messages  from
        the message base,  and will renumber all messages  consecutively.
        This function should only be used if nobody else is accessing the
        message base being purged,  otherwise, the system may crash (this
        may be fixed in later versions if proven to be a problem).
           Note  that a purge requires that the disk free space be  equal
        to  or  greater than the size of the message file to  be  purged,
        otherwise,  the program will surely crash,  complaining about the
        disk being full.


        Q - Questionnaire        Q - Questionnaire        Q - Questionnaire

           This  function  allows you to poll your users on any  kind  of
        questions you may have.
           You must first create a question file.   This file must have a
        ".Q"  (for question) extension for MicroServe to acknowledge  it.
        This  file may be written free form,  as MicroServe requires very
        few  "hard set rules" on how you must format your question  file.
        Using your text editor, simply write your questions, then display
        the  possible  user responses.   Each question can have only  one
        answer, and only one character per answer.  You may use any ASCII
        character  (except  for the *) for any of the  possible  answers.
        After  you  have  typed in your question  and  list  of  possible
        answers,  the  next  line MUST contain all the possible  answers,
        prefixed with an *.  MicroServe uses this line to verify that the
        user has typed in a valid answer.
           Each  questionnaire  may have up to 245 questions,  with  each
        question limited to 20 possible responses.
            All questionnaire output is stored in the corresponding  ".A"
        (answer)  file.   Each line of this file contains one  users  an-
        swers.   The first 10 characters of the file contain  the  user's
        name;  the  rest of the data is the users responses in  the  same
        order as the questions.
           MicroServe  does not test if a user answers any  questionnaire
        more  than once, primarily because of the time it could  take  to
        examine the answer file if hundreds of entries were to exist.  If
        you wish to weed out multiple entries, one easy solution would be
        to  use the DOS SORT command to sort the file, then  examine  the
        file manually and delete the duplicate entries.

           When  you create a "Q" function via the Modify  Menu  command,
        MicroServe  will  prompt for the normal  questions  (Description,
        access, etc).  When prompted for filename, enter the name of your
        question   file  WITHOUT  the  ".A"  extension,   as   MicroServe
        automatically assumes this.
           See section 6 on generating questionnaire results and see  the
        appendix for a sample questionnaire.


        R - Read Messages        R - Read Messages        R - Read Messages

           This  function allows users to read messages entered from  the
        "E" function.  Deleted and private messages will not be displayed
        (unless  the private message is address to you).   Each time  any
        message  is  read,  the message read counter for the  message  is
        incremented by one.
           Whenever a menu is entered,  if the menu contains any  options
        with  the R  function,  the program will automatically  scan  the
        message  file (defined in the R function) to see if there is  any
        messages for the user.   If there are messages,  the program will
        inform  the user that he has mail,  and will display all  message
        numbers of the messages pending.
           Considering the above feature,  it is advisable to allow  only
        one R function per menu.


        S - Survey Messages        S - Survey Messages        S - Survey Messages

           Allows  users to survey messages from a  message  base.   When
        using  this or the "R" function,  message numbers may be suffixed
        with  +  or  - to  direct either  forward  or  reverse  retrieval
        respectively,  i.e.  if  a  message base  contains  10  messages,
        entering "5+" at the message # prompt would display messages 5 to
        10; entering "5-" would display messages 5 to 1.
           The  Survey  mode automatically transfers to the Read  Message
        mode after surveying the messages.


        U - Upload Files        U - Upload Files        U - Upload Files

           When  invoked,  MicroServe will ask what the name of the  file
        to  uploading is.   Enter a standard filename.   If the  filename
        syntax  is  correct,  and  if the file does  not  already  exist,
        MicroServe  will  prompt  for  which  protocol  to  use.   Again,
        protocol  selection  IS  case  sensitive  (See  Downloading   for
        details).  When MicroServe says it's ready to receive, initialize
        the same protocol from your terminal program.
           If  ASCII  uploading is selected,  as with most  ASCII  upload
        program,  the  program  has no idea when the upload is  complete.
        Thus,  the  user must manually type /EXIT to turn off the  upload
        mode after the upload is complete.

           If  you  have  a printer,  and if you leave it  on-line  while
        MicroServe is running,  it will log a hard copy of all users  who
        have  logged in,  logged off,  and also print all file upload and
        download activity.   Note that this is a "smart" function,  which
        means  the  program  won't  hang if  your  printer  is  "off"  or
        "offline".   If you don't want the log, simply leave your printer
        turned off.
          Obviously, all output is directed to LPT1:


        E-Mail        E-Mail        E-Mail

           E-Mail  is basically the same as any other message base  setup
        with  the  following exceptions:  1) Messages are forced  private
        messages,  2)  Users are informed of E-Mail when they  login,  3)
        messages cannot be addressed to ALL,  4) The <N>ext &  <P>revious
        options are not available in the Read mode.
           To create an E-Mail section,  from the TOP menu, create a menu
        option  called "E-MAIL".   If you call it ANYTHING other than  E-
        MAIL,  your  message  base functions will NOT inherit the  E-Mail
        traits.   Then,  go  to your new E-MAIL area,  and to conform  to
        other E-Mail systems,  create options to 1) Read Mail,  2)  Enter
        Mail,  3) Browse Mail 4) Trash Mail.  Also, create a Sysop option
        to purge the E-Mail.

           Anywhere  the string $NAME$ is entered into  the  system,  the
        system will automatically replace the string with the user's user
        name.   Be careful where you use this feature.   Do not put it in
        TXT  files  where  the  variable may be undefined  (such  as  the
        WELCOME.TXT file).  This variable may also be entered in messages
        and subject fields.

           If a port is inactive for 5 minutes, MicroServe will display a
        warning  message  to  the dormant port to the effect  that  auto-
        logout will take place in one minute unless the user resumes.  If
        the  user  remains  inactive for  another  minute,  the  port  is
        terminated automatically.

           The  MicroServe  distribution disk should  contain  a  program
        called  RESULTS.EXE which can be used to tabulate your  question-
        naire results.
           Both  the ".A" and the ".Q" files must be present for  RESULTS
        to work.  RESULTS will display the questions and possible answers
        as they appear in your ".Q" file, and after each question it will
        display  the number totals of each possible response.   The  next
        line  will  contain  the  percentage  totals  of  each   possible
        response.
           Output  is  directed  to stdout,  which  normally  means  your
        screen.   Simply  use  DOS  redirection to send the output  to  a
        printer or a file, i.e. if you have a survey called "COMPUTER.A",
        simply enter "RESULTS COMPUTER > COMPUTER.R" (without the  quotes
        of course) to write the results of the questionnaire COMPUTER  to
        a  file  called COMPUTER.R.  Do not include any  file  extensions
        when  invoking RESULTS.EXE, as the file extensions ".A" and  ".Q"
        are always assumed.

        My modem won't answer!

           This  is by far the largest complaint users have had when they
        first  attempt  to setup MicroServe.   Here is  a  list  possible
        causes:

        1) Not using a true 100% Hayes compatible modem.
        2) If using an external modem,  pin 8 MUST be connected (this is
           the DTR line, and MicroServe can't work without it).
        3) Invalid port address and/or IRQ.
        4) Modem Initialization String has been corrupted.
        5) Trying to share IRQ's or port addresses.  No two modems may
           share the same IRQ or port address.  However, future versions
           of MicroServe may allow the sharing of IRQ's.
        6) If you are not using a Hayes 1200 or 100% compatible 1200 baud
           modem, then you probably need to add some modem specific
           commands in the "Modem Initialization" string in the Setup.
           See your modem manual.


        Additional notes:

           Your  modem  must have local echo DISABLED and verbal  command
        recognition ENABLED.  Your modem must respond "CONNECT", "CONNECT
        1200",  "CONNECT 2400" and "CONNECT 9600" respectively when  300,
        1200,   2400  or  9600  baud  connections  are  made.   Actually,
        MicroServe  only  looks  for "CONNECT" if it does  not  find  the
        strings  "1200",  "2400",  or  "9600".   If your modem returns  a
        partial  string containing the connected  baud  rate,  MicroServe
        will  connect  at  the  appropriate  baud  rate.   If  MicroServe
        receives only "CONNECT", then 300 baud connection is assumed.
           Be sure to insert the appropriate modem commands in your modem
        initialization  string to echo CONNECT baud rates.   The  default
        settings will work for a Hayes 1200 or 100% compatible.

==============================================================================

   As a new user, you must answer a few questions about yourself.  When the
system ask if you want to be a public user, answer Yes if you would like
others to view your vital statistics, otherwise answer No if you want to
be a private user.

IMPORTANT!  Once you are at the TOP menu (or any menu), be sure to enter
the '?' (without quotes) command so you can see all other functions
available on the system.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Other Functions >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

All of the following commands are entered directly from any menu prompt.

Q. What else can I do?
A. Enter a ? to display a screenful of help.  This help screen serves as
   a summary of commands you may use from any menu prompt.

Q. What year is it?
A. Enter a D to display the current <D>ate and time.

Q. How do I get out of here?
A. Enter an L to immediately <L>og off the system.

Q. Who else uses this thing?
A. Enter a U to display a list of all <U>sers who have used the system.
   Information displayed includes the user name, their city & state, type
   of computer and the users interest.  If you find a user who you would
   like more info on, use the E command to Examine the user's information.
   For your convienance, the new users are displayed first.

Q. What version of the program is this?
A. Enter V to display the program <V>ersion number.

Q. Is there anybody else in here?
A. Enter W to display <W>ho else is on the system.  This command displays
   the active ports, name of the user on that port, what menu # that user
   is on, and the specific function the user is doing.  Note that if you
   see port 0, that is the local keyboard and the Sysop is probably snooping.

Q. How can I get another user's attention?
A. Send a message to that user.  Use the <W>ho command to find what port
   your buddy is on.  For the sake of example, we'll say your buddy is on
   port 2, and your user name is Fred.  Then, from any menu prompt, enter
   "2 Hello Joe!" (without the quotes) and the message "FRED: Hello Joe!"
   is displayed on Joe's screen.  If Joe is uploading or downloading, your
   message will be intercepted by the system (to prevent disrupting a file
   transfer) and you will be informed that the user is busy.

Q. How can I abort a function or screen display?
A. Under most normal situations, simply enter a CTRL-C to abort.  The system
   will then take you back to the menu.

Q. Files scroll past to fast for me to read.  How can I prevent this?
A. MicroServe fully supports XON/XOFF.  For you novices, that means to press
   CTRL-S to pause the system, then press CTRL-Q to resume.

===========================
THE THIRTY BBS COMMANDMENTS
  Author Unknown
===========================

It has finally happened. Some very intelligent SysOp gave some
great thought to how a BBS should be operated and came up with
the 30 BBS Commandments. We would be very remiss if We kept these
from you, so here they are:

1.  Thou shall love thy BBS with all thy heart and all thy bytes.
2.  Thou shalt remember thy name and password.
3.  Thou shalt not POST IN ALL CAPS!
4.  Thou shalt use thy real name.
5.  Thou shalt only call a BBS two times a day.
6.  Honor thy SysOp.
7.  Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's password, nor his or her
    real name, computer, software, nor any other thing belonging
    to him or her.
8.  Thou shalt not post messages that are stupid, worthless, or
    have no meaning.
9.  Thou shalt use the English language properly.
10. Thou shalt spell thy words correctly.
11. Thou shalt not use a "handle" unless thine computer is made
    by Commodore (or allowed by thine SysOp).
12. Thou shalt delete thine olden messages.
13. Thou shalt help other users.
14. Thou shalt not post anonymously when offering criticism.
15. Thou shalt keep thy foul language to thyself.
16. Thou shalt not occupy thy BBS with thine arguments, for
    Verily, I say unto thee that thou shalt maketh a fool of
    thyself.
17. Woe be unto the user who attempt to crash thy BBS, for he
    shalt be cast out from the sanctuary of thy hobby and
    must repent by doing 40 days and 40 nights of penance of
    voice-only communications.
18. Thou shalt first dial BBS numbers during the day by way of
    voice line to assure correct numbers.
19. Thou shalt not beg for E-Mail.
20. Thou shalt not post messages while drunk.
21. Thou shalt confine thy messages to those of friendship,
    requests for assistance, aid to the needy, advice, and
    advancement of thy hobby; and thou art obligated to repel any
    who wouldst transgress upon those commandments.
22. If thou doth promise to reply to a message and thou doth not,
    then surely thou shalt spill coffee into thy keyboard and
    burn out thy central processing chip.
23. Thou shalt not giveth any false information when applying for
    membership to a BBS, for verily it is written that
    whosoever shall do so will surely be found out and thy
    welcome on all boards will be thus denied forever and ever.
24. Thou shalt log on properly and in accordance with the SysOp's
    rules.
25. Thou shalt observe BBS time limits.
26. Thou shalt not upload "worm" programs.
27. Thou shalt not ask stupid questions that are already fully
    explained in the BBS instructions.
28. Thou shalt not exchange copy protected software thru the BBS.
29. Thou shalt not violate applicable state/federal/local laws
    and regulations affecting BBS telecommunications, or thy will
    feel the wrath of thy judicial system.
30. Thou shalt not hack.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< System Software >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

This system is running MicroServe, a multi-user bulletin board system
(formerly MUBBS).  The program supports up to 5 users at a time
(including the sysop) if the system is equipped with the necessary
hardware, such as modems and serial ports.  The user interface is a
menu structure that is totally definable by the head sysop.  Other
features include message bases (including private mail), file
transfers via XMODEM and ASCII, co-sysops, and a Conference mode
where all users may simutaneouslty "chat" with one another.

How is it possible to support multiple users on a single user, PC
compatible machine?

Simple, actually.  Since most modems can accept data only at
relatively low speeds, the host system is always way ahead of the modem.
By supporting multiple users, the host system can take advantage of
it's maximum potential since it has to service multiple users at the
same time.

Also, a good percentage of on-line time is wasted (as far as the computer
is concerned) while it has to wait at user prompts to accept user data.
While the computer is waiting, why not service other users instead of
wasting time waiting for some slowpoke to read a screen and enter
a response?


Specifications           Maximum

Users                    32000
User access levels       255
Menus                    32000
Menu options             294000
Simutaneous users        5

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Change / Examine User Information >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Changing your Vital Statistics

   Enter "C" from any menu to display your vital statistics.  The system will
display all personal and system information about you.  You may also change
any of the first 13 items by simply entering the field number you want to
change.  The system will prompt "Enter new value:".  Enter the new field
contents and press RETURN.
   The fields above 13 are displayed for your convienance, and may be changed
only by the Sysop.
   Note that when changing your password, the system will NOT hide your
keystrokes, nor prompt you to re-enter your password.  The program is using
a generic input routine here.  Future versions of MicroServe will provide for
a little more security here.  In the meantime, be sure no one is looking over
your shoulder if you decide to change your password.

Being a Public User

   If you select to be a public user, you allow other users to view your
user information.  Nothing there should be classified information, thus I
encourage all users to be public users.  For those of you who are spies,
anti-social, or just plain shy, you may select to be a private user, thus
preventing other users from viewing your user information.

Viewing Other User Info

   Use the "U" command to display a brief summary of system users.  If anyone
in this list looks like someone you would like to contact by non-bbs means,
or if you are just being snoopy, take note the users user name, then enter
"E username" from any menu where "username" is the name of the user to
examine.  If the username is a public user, the system will display all the
user's vital statistics.
