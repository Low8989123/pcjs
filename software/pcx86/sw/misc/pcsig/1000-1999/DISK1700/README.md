## Information about "GOLF SOLITAIRE"

    Here is yet another outstanding solitaire game from United Innovations
    Plus.  GOLF SOLITAIRE is played with a standard deck of fifty-two cards.
    The layout is made by dealing out five rows of seven cards each,
    overlapping face up.  A total of thirty-five cards form the layout.  One
    more card is dealt below the layout, face up to form your base.  The
    object is to clear away all the layout cards by building onto the base
    card.  Building is done in sequence, in either direction, regardless of
    suit, and if you make a wrong move your computer will certainly keep you
    honest.
    
    This top-notch software package comes with outstanding graphics plus all
    the features that make this a top-notch program.  You can control the
    speed of dealing and elect to view the shuffling of the cards.  You also
    choose the number of holes and which variation of the game you wish to
    play.  The graphics are impressive, clear and easy to follow.

                                  GOLF RULES

       The  solitaire  game of Golf is played with a standard  deck  of 
       fifty-two cards.  The layout is made by dealing out five rows of 
       seven  cards each, overlapping face up.  A total of  thirty-five 
       cards form the layout.  One more card is dealt below the layout, 
       face up to form your base.

       The bottom cards of the layout columns are available for play on 
       your  base  card.  The object is to clear away  all  the  layout 
       cards by building onto the base card.

       Building is done in sequence, in either direction, regardless of 
       suit.  The sequence is not circular.  Only a two may be build on 
       an Ace (always treated as low), and only a Queen may be build on 
       a King.

       When  the player has run out of moves, a card is dealt from  the 
       deck and placed face up on the base stack.  Play continues until 
       all  the cards have been removed from the layout and  placed  on 
       the  base stack, or until the remaining cards in the  deck  have 
       been depleted and the player has run out of moves.


                                GOLF VARIANTS

       Some players do not allow a Queen to be played on a King.   When 
       the game is played in this fashion, once a King is placed on the 
       base stack, another card must be dealt from the deck.

       Golf  may be played one hole (game) at a time or any  amount  of 
       holes up to nine.


                                   SCORING

       The  player starts off with a score of thirty-five points.   One 
       point  is  deducted each time a card is placed from  the  layout 
       onto the base.  The best score is zero (a hole in one).  This is 
       known as the Standard scoring method.


                               SCORING VARIANTS

       In  the  Advanced  scoring  method, once  the  layout  has  been 
       depleted,  one point is deducted for each card remaining in  the 
       unused portion of the deck.  Therefore, the best score could  be 
       less than zero.  In addition to this, one point is added to your 
       score each time two cards have been dealt off the deck.


                                STARTING GOLF

       From   your  DOS  prompt, type GOLF  and  press   ENTER.    Your

                     LEFT/RIGHT ARROW KEYS - Move Pointer

       Your  screen will show a double up arrow pointing to a  card  in 
       the  layout.  This pointer may be moved left or right using  the 
       LEFT/RIGHT Arrow keys.  The pointer must be pointing to the card 
       you are about to move to the base stack.


                           UP ARROW KEY - Move Card

       After  you have moved the pointer to the card you wish  to  move 
       to the base stack, press the UP Arrow and if the move is  valid, 
       the card will be place onto the base stack.

       These  are the default settings that come with  Golf  Solitaire.  
       All   of   these  options  may be changed to suit  your  playing 
       style.  These are saved to disk when you quit playing Golf.   It 
       is  required  that  GOLF.EXE  reside on  the  current  drive  or 
       directory from where you started the game.

                            1 - Display Shuffling      

       You have the option to display the shuffling of the cards or you 
       may  wish  to play a faster game by not viewing  the  shuffling.  
       This may be changed with this option.

                                  2 - Sound

       Use this key to turn your sound either On of Off.

                             3 - Save High Games

       If  you  want to save your high scores to disk,  be  sure   this 
       option is On.  When saving high scores to disk, there will be up 
       to nine files created with the extension .HIS.

                             4 - Scoring Method

       The  default scoring method is set at Standard.  The best  score 
       you  could  achieve  per hole would be a score  of  zero.   When 
       changing  this  to  Advanced, you will lose a  point  for  every 
       second card dealt off the deck and place onto the waste or  base 
       stack.   In addition to this, if you have removed all the  cards 
       from the layout, you will be given an extra point for each  card 
       remaining  in the unused portion of the deck.  In  the  Advanced 
       scoring method, you could have a final score of less than zero.

                            5 - Show Card Movement

       The  cards  are displaying while they are being dealt  to  their 
       respective positions.  If you would rather not see this, you may 
       set this option to Off.

                             6 - Sliding Screens

       While  going  from one screen  to  another, the   screens   will 
       slide open.  If this causes snow or you would rather not see  it 
       happen, you may turn it off with this option.

                               7 - Snow Removal

       Use this option if you are experiencing snow.

                         8 - Allow Queen's on King's

       Queen's  are  not allowed to be played on King's  as  a  default 
       setting.   If  you wish to allow this as a variant on  Golf,  be 
       sure this option is set to On.









                                    - 5 -








                           9 - Card Movement Speed

       If option 5 above is On, your cards will be dealt and  moved 
       around the table at the default speed setting of 20.  This means 
       nothing  until  you actually see the cards in  motion.   If  you 
       press  this  option  9, you will be able  to  change  the  speed 
       setting for the card movement speed.  The bottom of your  screen 
       will display the following options:

                    LEFT/RIGHT Arrows      ENTER      F10

       Use your LEFT/RIGHT Arrow keys to decrease or increase the speed 
       setting.  Press the ENTER key if you want to see the effect  the 
       speed setting has on the card movement.  When you are  satisfied 
       with the setting, press the Function 10 key to quit.

                            0 - Type of Game Play

       Each time you press the number 0, you will change the amount  of 
       holes you will be playing.  The default setting is set to a  one 
       hole game.  You may set this to any amount of holes up to nine.

                            A - Changing Card Colors

       Pressing  the letter "A" will bring you to a screen which   will  
       allow  you  to change the card colors.   The   top  portion   of 
       your  screen  will display a row of  cards, face  down.    Below  
       that  row will be another row, face  up.   The lower portion  of 
       your screen will display the following:

                    Card Back                       Card Face
       
           F1  Border Foreground Color     F4  Border Foreground Color
           F2  Border Background Color     F5  Border Background Color
           F3  Pattern Color               F6  Face Color

                         ALT-D  Restore Default Colors

           Pressing  the Function keys, F1 through F6 will  change  the 
           two  card  rows to the available colors  allowed  with  each 
           function key pressed.  Pressing ALT-D will restore the  card 
           colors to their default colors.  When you are satisfied with 
           the  color  changes,  press the ENTER key and  you will   be 
           returned to the Setup Screen.  These changes are saved  when     
           you  quit  playing Golf.  Be sure Golf.Exe  resides  in  the 
           drive  or  directory  from  where  you  first  started   the     
           game.


                                 HIGH SCORES

       This  screen is viewed by pressing the Function 8 key from   the 
       Main Options.  If you have option 3 in the Setup Menu set to On, 
       you  will be able to view the top fifteen players.   The  screen 
       will  display the players name, par (score), hole or game number 
       and date  the score was recorded.

                                    - 6 -








       On  the right side of the players name will be either a "-S"  or 
       "-A".   These  symbols stand for Standard scoring  and  Advanced 
       scoring.

       When  you  view the high scores, you will be  viewing  the  high 
       scores  for  the type of game your are  currently  playing  (See 
       option  0 in the Setup Menu).  You may toggle between  all  high 
       score   screens  by pressing a number key from 1  to   9.   Each 
       screen  will will display the top 15 scores for each  game.   If 
       you press the letter "A", the high scores will display the  best 
       score  from  each game.  Pressing the  ENTER key will  exit  the 
       high scores and return you  to  the game.

                                  GOLF RULES

       The  solitaire  game of Golf is played with a standard  deck  of 
       fifty-two cards.  The layout is made by dealing out five rows of 
       seven  cards each, overlapping face up.  A total of  thirty-five 
       cards form the layout.  One more card is dealt below the layout, 
       face up to form your base.

       The bottom cards of the layout columns are available for play on 
       your  base  card.  The object is to clear away  all  the  layout 
       cards by building onto the base card.

       Building is done in sequence, in either direction, regardless of 
       suit.  The sequence is not circular.  Only a two may be build on 
       an Ace (always treated as low), and only a Queen may be build on 
       a King.

       When  the player has run out of moves, a card is dealt from  the 
       deck and placed face up on the base stack.  Play continues until 
       all  the cards have been removed from the layout and  placed  on 
       the  base stack, or until the remaining cards in the  deck  have 
       been depleted and the player has run out of moves.


                                GOLF VARIANTS

       Some players do not allow a Queen to be played on a King.   When 
       the game is played in this fashion, once a King is placed on the 
       base stack, another card must be dealt from the deck.

       Golf  may be played one hole (game) at a time or any  amount  of 
       holes up to nine.


                                   SCORING

       The  player starts off with a score of thirty-five points.   One 
       point  is  deducted each time a card is placed from  the  layout 
       onto the base.  The best score is zero (a hole in one).  This is 
       known as the Standard scoring method.


                               SCORING VARIANTS

       In  the  Advanced  scoring  method, once  the  layout  has  been 
       depleted,  one point is deducted for each card remaining in  the 
       unused portion of the deck.  Therefore, the best score could  be 
       less than zero.  In addition to this, one point is added to your 
       score each time two cards have been dealt off the deck.

                     LEFT/RIGHT ARROW KEYS - Move Pointer

       Your  screen will show a double up arrow pointing to a  card  in 
       the  layout.  This pointer may be moved left or right using  the 
       LEFT/RIGHT Arrow keys.  The pointer must be pointing to the card 
       you are about to move to the base stack.


                           UP ARROW KEY - Move Card

       After  you have moved the pointer to the card you wish  to  move 
       to the base stack, press the UP Arrow and if the move is  valid, 
       the card will be place onto the base stack.

       Press the Function 10 key when you want to quit playing or  when 
       you  have run out of moves.  You may quit playing at  any  time.

               A     Change Card Colors                  

       These  are the default settings that come with  Golf  Solitaire.  
       All   of   these  options  may be changed to suit  your  playing 
       style.  These are saved to disk when you quit playing Golf.   It 
       is  required  that  GOLF.EXE  reside on  the  current  drive  or 
       directory from where you started the game.

                            1 - Display Shuffling      

       You have the option to display the shuffling of the cards or you 
       may  wish  to play a faster game by not viewing  the  shuffling.  
       This may be changed with this option.

                                  2 - Sound

       Use this key to turn your sound either On of Off.

                             3 - Save High Games

       If  you  want to save your high scores to disk,  be  sure   this 
       option is On.  When saving high scores to disk, there will be up 
       to nine files created with the extension .HIS.

                             4 - Scoring Method

       The  default scoring method is set at Standard.  The best  score 
       you  could  achieve  per hole would be a score  of  zero.   When 
       changing  this  to  Advanced, you will lose a  point  for  every 
       second card dealt off the deck and place onto the waste or  base 
       stack.   In addition to this, if you have removed all the  cards 
       from the layout, you will be given an extra point for each  card 
       remaining  in the unused portion of the deck.  In  the  Advanced 
       scoring method, you could have a final score of less than zero.

                            5 - Show Card Movement

       The  cards  are displaying while they are being dealt  to  their 
       respective positions.  If you would rather not see this, you may 
       set this option to Off.

                             6 - Sliding Screens

       While  going  from one screen  to  another, the   screens   will 
       slide open.  If this causes snow or you would rather not see  it 
       happen, you may turn it off with this option.

                               7 - Snow Removal

       Use this option if you are experiencing snow.

                         8 - Allow Queen's on King's

       Queen's  are  not allowed to be played on King's  as  a  default 
       setting.   If  you wish to allow this as a variant on  Golf,  be 
       sure this option is set to On.









                                    - 5 -








                           9 - Card Movement Speed

       If option 5 above is On, your cards will be dealt and  moved 
       around the table at the default speed setting of 20.  This means 
       nothing  until  you actually see the cards in  motion.   If  you 
       press  this  option  9, you will be able  to  change  the  speed 
       setting for the card movement speed.  The bottom of your  screen 
       will display the following options:

                    LEFT/RIGHT Arrows      ENTER      F10

       Use your LEFT/RIGHT Arrow keys to decrease or increase the speed 
       setting.  Press the ENTER key if you want to see the effect  the 
       speed setting has on the card movement.  When you are  satisfied 
       with the setting, press the Function 10 key to quit.

                            0 - Type of Game Play

       Each time you press the number 0, you will change the amount  of 
       holes you will be playing.  The default setting is set to a  one 
       hole game.  You may set this to any amount of holes up to nine.

                            A - Changing Card Colors

       Pressing  the letter "A" will bring you to a screen which   will  
       allow  you  to change the card colors.   The   top  portion   of 
       your  screen  will display a row of  cards, face  down.    Below  
       that  row will be another row, face  up.   The lower portion  of 
       your screen will display the following:

                    Card Back                       Card Face
       
           F1  Border Foreground Color     F4  Border Foreground Color
           F2  Border Background Color     F5  Border Background Color
           F3  Pattern Color               F6  Face Color

                         ALT-D  Restore Default Colors

           Pressing  the Function keys, F1 through F6 will  change  the 
           two  card  rows to the available colors  allowed  with  each 
           function key pressed.  Pressing ALT-D will restore the  card 
           colors to their default colors.  When you are satisfied with 
           the  color  changes,  press the ENTER key and  you will   be 
           returned to the Setup Screen.  These changes are saved  when     
           you  quit  playing Golf.  Be sure Golf.Exe  resides  in  the 
           drive  or  directory  from  where  you  first  started   the     
           game.


                                 HIGH SCORES

       This  screen is viewed by pressing the Function 8 key from   the 
       Main Options.  If you have option 3 in the Setup Menu set to On, 
       you  will be able to view the top fifteen players.   The  screen 
       will  display the players name, par (score), hole or game number 
       and date  the score was recorded.

                                    - 6 -








       On  the right side of the players name will be either a "-S"  or 
       "-A".   These  symbols stand for Standard scoring  and  Advanced 
       scoring.

       When  you  view the high scores, you will be  viewing  the  high 
       scores  for  the type of game your are  currently  playing  (See 
       option  0 in the Setup Menu).  You may toggle between  all  high 
       score   screens  by pressing a number key from 1  to   9.   Each 
       screen  will will display the top 15 scores for each  game.   If 
       you press the letter "A", the high scores will display the  best 
       score  from  each game.  Pressing the  ENTER key will  exit  the 
       high scores and return you  to  the game.
