## Information about "PROBLEMS"

    What does the Bible have to say about abortion?  Alcoholism?  Humility?
    Or vengeance? These and 55 other topic areas are instantly accessed
    through PROBLEMS. Pick your topic or problem of concern, such as
    "pride," and the relevant Bible verses pop up on your screen and/or
    printer. For example: PROVERBS 16:18 "Pride goeth before destruction,
    and an haughty spirit before a fall." Verses can be added or deleted,
    thus you may customize this program according to your interests.

#
If you have an older version of this program and you have added verses to
it, you need a program to convert the old data files to the new version.
Signify that you need the Converter when you register this Copy and I'll
send it to you.

Place the disk in the Drive and type PROBLEMS or Copy all files on a
hard drive. The program is user friendly.

THE FIRST  THING YOU SHOULD DO IS TO MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF THE DISK.

THE SECOND THING YOU SHOULD DO IS REGISTER YOUR COPY WITH ME.
    (More on this later)

FLOPPY DISK OPERATION:
If you want to add your favorite verse for any particular problem
then you should copy half of the data files to a new disk and erase
them from this one to give yourself room. If you transfer files to
another disk, be sure to copy FILEDATA.DAT & FRNTPAGE.DAT also.


# YOU CAN USE YOUR WORD PROCESSOR to Add, Delete or Print Verses.
Two things to remember.
1. Be sure to save the file in ASCII mode (Readable English)
2. Look at the files that I have put together. You will notice that
   the First Line of a new Verse has a <Pound Sign> at the beginning and the
   line before the References has a <At Sign>. Continue to use these in
   your entry. The program uses them to split pages. If you don't use
   them, you'll scroll through your entire file. Unless you can speed
   read at an incredible rate, you'll miss alot.

I PURPOSELY SET THE PROGRAM UP SO YOU CAN LIST A DIFFERENT SET OF PROBLEMS.

   There are a few things you need to remember.

   1. FILEDATA.DAT has a list of 59 files in it. They correspond to the
      headings listed in FRNTPAGE.DAT. Be sure that your new file name in
      FILEDATA.DAT matches the location of your display title in FRNTPAGE.DAT

   2. Be sure your new title isn't to long to fit in the display.

   3. Don't change Number 60. It's set up to Exit the program.

#    WHY BOTHER TO REGISTER.
     1. Shareware Houses don't supply authors with a list of people
        who have ordered their programs. Without your registration
        the programmer doesn't get any `feed back' at all.

     2. You get a quality program at a reasonable price. The shareware
        house makes money on the volume they distribute but the Author
        doesn't even know if the program is being used!

     3. In the two years this Program has been available, the response
        has been Seven letters  (1988-90).  If that's the total number
        of people using it then my time should be spent doing something else.

     4. If this is a program that you use often, then you should
        register it for ten dollars.
