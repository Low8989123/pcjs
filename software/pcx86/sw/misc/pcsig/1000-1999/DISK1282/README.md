## Information about "TOMMY'S SAUCER"

    Climb into a flying saucer cockpit to battle enemy saucers.  Your
    mission is to destroy invading ships with the help of your ray beam.  A
    point is scored every time you destroy an enemy saucer but the score
    reduces by one for every 30 clock ticks.  The mission terminates when
    your shields are blasted and your ship is destroyed.
    
    TOMMY'S SAUCER has various exotic alien display panels to show the
    energy and shield level, range, target crosshairs lock-in status, and
    aiming coordinates.  You use a command panel at the bottom of the
    screen.  The program has a sound effect toggle, a demo mode, function
    key control, an optional expanded view screen, and nine levels of
    difficulty.  The sound and color show is nonstop and akin to a sci-fi
    movie.  Runs on mono or color.

TOMMY'S SAUCER (C) COPYRIGHT 1986 BY TOMMY'S TOYS
P. O. BOX 11261, DENVER, CO 80211 USA.  ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
CATALOG #86-018-1A

INSTRUCTIONS:

ONE DAY AN ALIEN SAUCER CRASH-LANDED IN TOMMY'S BACKYARD.  WHILE HELPING THEM
REPAIR IT, TOMMY SECRETLY MADE A COPY OF THE COCKPIT OPERATOR'S MANUAL. AFTER
THEY LEFT, HE WAS PLAYING AROUND AND CONSTRUCTED THIS MOCKUP OF THE SHIP.

DISPLAYS:
THE COCKPIT DISPLAY HAS MANY FEATURES THAT TOMMY CAN'T TRANSLATE INTO EARTH
TONGUES, BUT IN THE UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER HE HAS FOUND OUT HOW TO DISPLAY IN
ENGLISH SOME CRUCIAL SHIP PARAMETERS SUCH AS SHIELD AND ENERGY STORES. WHEN AN
ENEMY SAUCER COMES WITHIN DETECTION RANGE (1000 ALIEN RANGE UNITS), THE UPPER
LEFT HAND TARGET DISPLAY POPS UP GIVING RANGE AND TARGET LOCK-IN STATUS, ALONG
WITH COMPUTER AIMING COORDINATES, IF YOU SPEAK HAL 9000.

THE BOTTOM LEFT HAND DISPLAY IS THE SAUCER'S COMM PANEL.

THE LOWER RIGHT HAND DISPLAY IS A MULTI-PURPOSE GLINCHING SYSTEM THAT CANNOT
BE ADEQUATELY EXPLAINED IN EARTHLING TONGUES.

THE UPPER RIGHT HAND SKULL DISPLAY IS ONLY FOR THE USE OF THOSE WITH HYPER
INTELLIGENCE, SO IT WILL NOT BE DISCUSSED HERE.

THE LOWER DISPLAY PANEL IS A BATTLE MANAGEMENT UNIT FOR THOSE FLUENT IN ALIEN
AND WELL-TRAINED IN GLINCH PENTING; PERHAPS SOME EXPERIENCE CAN HELP YOU HERE.

OPERATION OF THE SAUCER:

SPEED CONTROL:
THE SHIP'S SPEED IS CONTROLLED VIA THE NUMERICAL KEYS 1 THRU 9 ON THE UPPER
ROW OF THE KEYBOARD.  1 IS THE SLOWEST AND 9 IS THE FASTEST.

CROSSHAIRS CONTROL:
THE 4 ARROW KEYS ON THE NUMERICAL KEYPAD MOVE THE CROSSHAIRS.

RAYBEAM CONTROL:
TO FIRE YOUR RAY BEAM, PRESS FUNCTION KEY F9 OR F10.  YOUR CROSSHAIRS MUST BE
LOCKED IN TO SCORE A HIT (TARGET LOCK IS INDICATED IN THE UPPER LEFT CORNER
DATA DISPLAY).  SUCCESSIVE FIRINGS ON THE SAME ENEMY SAUCER ACCUMULATE THE
ENERGY AND INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF DESTRUCTION, BUT ONCE YOU BREAK LOCK YOU
MUST START OVER.

GLINCH PENTING:
FUNCTION KEYS F7 AND F8 CONTROL THE GLINCH PENTING SUBSYSTEM.  GOOD LUCK
FIGURING OUT HOW TO USE IT!

ENERGY STORES:
THE SHIP'S ENERGY SOURCE IS UNFATHOMABLE, HENCE ITS VALUE IS NOT DISPLAYED
NUMERICALLY.  INSTEAD, THE ENERGY STORES IN THE SHIELDS AND RAY BEAM UNITS
ARE DISPLAYED.  NOTE THAT THESE STORES HAVE A MAXIMUM VALUE OF 1000 ALIEN
ENERGY UNITS, AND THAT THEY AUTOMATICALLY BUILD UP FROM THE SHIP'S PRIMARY
ENERGY SOURCE AT AN EXPONENTIAL RATE.  THUS, IF YOU PERMIT THEM TO FALL TO
A LOW VALUE, SAY, LESS THAN 100, IT WILL BE A VERY LONG TIME BEFORE THEY
BUILD BACK UP TO MAXIMUM.

SPLIT COMMAND:
HITTING FUNCTION KEY F6 WILL CAUSE THE ENERGY STORES IN THE SHIELDS AND RAY
BEAM UNITS TO BE SHORTED TOGETHER, WITH A RESULTING UNPREDICTABLE SHARING OF
ENERGY AND POTENTIAL FOR CIRCUIT LOSS.

ENEMY SAUCERS:
ENEMY SAUCER FORMATIONS ALWAYS PLAY 'CHICKEN' WITH YOUR SAUCER.  THAT IS, THEY
COME AT YOU HEAD ON AND TRY TO GET YOU IN THEIR RAY BEAMS.  BECAUSE OF TIME
WARP FACTORS, ONCE THEY PASS YOU THEY ZIP INTO THE FUTURE AND OFTEN REAPPEAR
BACK IN FRONT OF YOU, READY TO CHARGE AGAIN!  THIS IS THESE ALIENS' SENSE OF
SPORT AND FAIRPLAY.

SCORE:
YOUR SCORE IS THE NUMBER OF ENEMY SAUCERS YOU DESTROY, REDUCED BY ONE FOR
EVERY 30 CLOCK TICKS.

MISSION TERMINATION:
THE MISSION TERMINATES WHEN YOUR SHIELDS ARE BLASTED AWAY AND YOU ARE
DESTROYED.

OTHER CONTROLS:

AUTOPILOT: FUNCTION KEY F1 TOGGLES THE AUTOPILOT, WHICH ALSO SERVES AS A
DEMO MODE.  *WARNING* PRESSING F1 RESETS THE SCORE TO 0!

TO QUIT: HIT FUNCTION KEY F2, THE ESC KEY, OR THE "Q" KEY; THEN HIT THE "Y"
KEY.

TO DISPLAY THESE INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PROGRAM: HIT FUNCTION KEY F3.

GLINT ORGAN: FOR APARTMENT HUNTING, USE FUNCTION KEY F4.

SOUND EFFECTS: FUNCTION KEY F5 TOGGLES THE SOUND EFFECTS.

EXPANDED VIEWSCREEN: THE "DEL" KEY ON THE BOTTOM OF THE NUMERIC KEY PAD
TOGGLES THE EXPANDED VIEWSCREEN MODE.

STARTUP SHOW: TO BYPASS THE STARTUP SHOW, HIT THE <ENTER> KEY TWICE INSTEAD
OF ONCE WHEN CALLING THE PROGRAM FROM DOS.

COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS:
   S    START UP WITH SOUND OFF
   M    FORCE MONO DISPLAY MODE
   C    FORCE COLOR DISPLAY MODE
