       The  documentation for Draw Poker is intended to show  the  user 
       how  this computer version is played.  It has not  been  written 
       for  the complete novice at Draw Poker.  Those that  have  never 
       played Draw Poker should purchase one of the many books  written 
       on  the subject for a better understanding of the game.  If  you 
       are  a beginner at Draw Poker, hopefully this game will  improve 
       your playing.

       This game was written to be played as a $20 limit game.   Future 
       versions  may  have  a table stakes option.   This  will  depend 
       largely on registrations and user comments.

                               DRAW POKER RULES

       Each  player is dealt five cards, face down.  Each  player  will 
       take  a turn dealing the cards.  Cards are dealt in a  clockwise 
       manner  starting with the player to the dealers immediate  left.  
       The cards are dealt one at a time until each player has a  total 
       of  five cards.  The undealt cards are set aside for later  use.  
       These are usually placed in front of the dealer.

       A betting interval then takes place. Then each active player, in 
       turn,  may discard from one to five cards or stay with  what  he 
       has.   The dealer will then give each active player  replacement 
       cards  from the top of the unused portion of the deck.   Another 
       betting interval takes place followed by a showdown in which the 
       highest hand among the active players wins the pot.

                                  DRAW GAMES

       Draw can be played in a few different variations.  Not all forms  
       of   Draw  are  supported in this game.   The  following  is   a 
       description  of the types of Draw Poker games allowed with  this 
       version.

                                Straight Ante

       All  players  ante  $2 and may either bet or  check  their  hand 
       before the draw.  The first player to the dealers left is  first 
       to act.

                                    Blind     

       All  players ante $2 and must either bet, raise or  fold  before 
       the  draw.  The  first player to the dealers left places  a  bet 
       ($20)  in   the  pot  before  the  cards  are  dealt.   This  is 
       considered a blind bet, meaning  the  player is opening the  pot 
       without looking  at  his cards.  A marker will be place by  that 
       player  indicating he  has the blind.  The first player  to  the 


                                    - 2 -








       blinds  left is first to act. This  makes the blind last to  act 
       before the draw but first to act after the draw.

       The  blind  game is intended to create a little  action.   After 
       all,  wouldn't  you  want to call a  player  that  bets  without 
       looking at his cards?

       Before  the draw, starting with the first player to  the  blinds 
       left,  the player must either call the blind bet, raise or fold.  
       When   its  the blinds turn to play and the pot  has  only  been 
       called, he has no  further  action because he is already in  the  
       pot. On the other hand, if the pot was raised, he may call,  re-
       raise  or fold.  Not supported in this version is what as  known 
       as a  "live blind".   A  live  blind means that if the pot   was  
       not  raised before  the  draw,  then the blind has  the   option  
       of  raising himself by placing an addition bet in the pot.  

                                   Straddle

       In   this form of Draw, none of the players ante.   Instead,   3 
       players put in a straddle bet.  The first player to the  dealers 
       left puts in $5, the next player puts in $5, and the next player 
       puts  in  $10.  This amount adds up to the minimum  bet  of  the 
       limit  game  you are playing.  A $4 limit game  would  have  the 
       straddle at $1, $1 & $2; a $10 limit game would be $2, $3 &  $5; 
       a  $200 limit game would be $50, $50 & $100.  The  players  that 
       have placed the straddle bets will have markers placed in  front 
       of their playing positions.

       This game also creates action.  You have 3 players with  partial 
       bets in the pot already.  This makes it a little easier for them 
       to call.  If they don't call, they lose the straddle.

       The  first player to act before the draw is the first player  to 
       the  left  of  the big straddle and  play  continues  clockwise.  
       After  the  draw,  action starts with the first  player  to  the 
       dealers left.


                                STARTING DRAW

       From   your  DOS  prompt, type Draw  and  press   ENTER.    Your 
       monitor  will display the opening screen.  After a few  seconds, 
       or  until you hit a key, you will be asked for your  name.   You 
       must  enter something when asked.  If you don't like your  name, 
       enter   anything  you  want.   Draw  will  save   your   playing 
       statistics  to  a file associated with what you enter.   If  you 
       answered  "Cool  Joe",  then  a  file  will  be  created  called 
       COOLJOE.DPH.   Each time you play Draw, that file will  be  read 
       and your past history will be available for you to cry over.

       Once  you have entered your name, the screen will clear and  you 
       will  be  placed in the playing screen, ready to show  the  dumb 
       computer players your stuff.  

       NOTE:  After you have enter your name, you will not be  required 

                                    - 3 -








       to do so in the future.  If a player, other than yourself wishes 
       to play, you may change players names by pressing ALT-N from the 
       main playing screen.  You will be allowed to enter from 1 to  21 
       characters  for your name.  The first 8 characters will be  used 
       to create a file containing your playing statistics.


                                PLAYING SCREEN

       The  playing  screen will display the playing positions  of  the 
       players.  These are positioned in a circle to represent a  poker 
       table.   The top center of your screen will show a card  labeled 
       P1,  representing player #1.  The player positions are  numbered 
       from P1 to P8 in a clockwise manner starting at the P1 position.

       The   center  of  the screen displays the  pot.   As   Draw   is 
       played, the pot will naturally increase as bets are made.

       The  upper  left  part  of the screen  will  show  your  current 
       standings during the course of play.  The upper right side  will 
       show your total standings.  The total standings are saved  after 
       each game in the file created when you entered your name at  the 
       start of Draw.

       The  left  side  of the screen will show  the  requirements  for 
       opening the pot.  This will be either "Anything Opens" or "Jacks 
       or Better".  The right side will show the form of Draw  your are  
       currently playing.  The game limit may not be changed  with this  
       version.   It  is  possible that a future  version  will   allow 
       various limits or a table stakes game.

       Near the bottom of the screen, the following will be displayed:

                 F1 Deal          F3 Setup           F5 Stats   
                 F8 High Scores   ALT-N New Player   F10 Quit

       These are the main options you currently have available.   These 
       options   are displayed when you first start Draw and   at   the 
       end of each hand.


                                 MAIN OPTIONS

       F1 Deal

       To  start playing Draw, you may either press the F1 key  or  the 
       ENTER  key.   Before  the cards are dealt to  each  player,  all 
       players must either ante, place the blind or place the  straddle 
       bets   depending  on  what form of Draw you  are   playing.    A 
       marker  will  be  placed by the dealer along with  the  deck  of 
       cards.   The  dealer  will deal out five cards  to  each  player 
       starting with the first player to his left.





                                    - 4 -








       F3 Setup Menu

       Pressing the F3 key will display the Draw Setup Menu.  This will 
       allow  you  to change many of the options  available  with  this 
       version  of Draw.  When you quit playing, any changes made  will  
       be  saved so they are available to you the next  time  you play.

       F5 Stats

       Pressing the F5 key will display each players current standings.  
       This  screen  is  displayed in the same  order  as  the  playing 
       screen.  The profit, pots won, and pots each player was involved 
       in  will  be  shown below each players  number.   These  figures 
       represent the current game only.

       The  center  of this screen will show the current  hands  dealt, 
       total  hands  dealt,  house  take, total  house  take,  and  any 
       carryover from the pot. 

           Current Hands

       The current hands are the amount of hands dealt during each game 
       you play.

           Total Hands

       The  total  hands will show all the Draw hands that  have   been 
       played.

           House Take

       The  house take is the amount of money collected by  the  house.  
       The house will collect money from each player for the  privilege 
       of  playing at their club or casino.  This is usually done  each 
       half  hour  by a pit boss or club employee.  In this  $20  limit 
       game,  you  are charged $2 at the end of every 15  hands.   Some 
       clubs rake a percentage from each pot rather than collect  time.  
       This form of collection is not supported in this version.

           Total House Take

       This  will display the total amount of money taken in  from  all 
       the hands played.

           Carryover To Next Pot

       This  will always show a zero amount unless the hand  previously 
       played  could not be split amount the winners.  This could  also 
       show  the size of the pot if you are playing "Jacks  or  Better" 
       and the pot was not opened.

       The last line of this screen will display your complete  history 
       taken from your file on disk.

       the ENTER key.

       Draw players.  The following will be shown on this screen:

              Rank    Players Name    Winnings    Hands    Date

       The first column will show the numbers 1 to 15 which  represents 
       the top players winnings to the 15th. highest players winnings.

       The players name will accept from 1 to 21 characters.

       The winnings is the amount of money you have won for one session 
       of Draw.  This is not a total of all your winnings.

       The  hands that are displayed will also be for the same  session 
       of Draw played.  This is not a total of all your hands played.

       The date displayed will be the date you achieved your  winnings.  
       Draw will not ask you for the date.  You must have set the  date 
       from DOS when you first booted up your computer.

       When  you  are finished looking at this screen, press  ENTER  to 
       return to the main screen.

       ALT-N New Player

       Pressing  the  ALT and N key together will allow you  to  change 
       a  players  name.  This should be used when a  friend  wants  to 
       play.   Rather  than  having  your friend  screw  up  your  high 
       winnings  with  his  bad playing habits, press  ALT-N  and  your 
       statistics  will be saved, then your friend can enter his  name.  
       This would be the same thing as quitting the game then  starting 
       over again.

       F10 Quit

       When you press  the  F10 key, you will  quit  Draw Poker and  be 
       returned   to  your  DOS  prompt.   All  high   scores,   player 
       statistics, and necessary files are then saved.


                                 PLAY OPTIONS

       Once you have pressed either F1 or the ENTER key to deal a hand, 
       your  playing options will appear below your  playing  position.  
       These  options  will  vary slightly depending on  the  round  of 
       betting you are currently in.  The options will be:

                  Bet    Fold    Call    Raise    Pass/Check

       Press  the first letter of one of the options that appear  below 
       your  playing position.  These options will only appear when  it 
       is your turn to act.

       Bet

       Pressing B will place the minimum bet in the pot for you.

       Fold

       Pressing F will fold your hand.  This will erase your hand  from 
       the screen and you will forfeit and further action in the pot.

       Call

       Pressing C will call any bets or raises previously made by other 
       players.  The correct amount of money will be placed in the pot.

       Raise

       Pressing  R  will raise the pot the maximum limit of  the  game.  
       A  raise  simply  means  you are calling  all  bets  and  adding 
       another bet into the pot.

       Pass/Check

       Pressing the P key will pass or check your hand.  Passing a hand 
       means you do not want to bet at this time.  You still remain  in 
       the pot and have the option to later call if a bet or raise  has 
       been  made by any other players.  You will not be able to  raise 
       after  you pass or check unless this option has been set in  the 
       SetUp Menu.

       NOTE:   Please  do  not write me telling  me  that  passing  and 
       checking  are different.  Normally, pass means you  are  tossing 
       your hand away.  To check would mean you plan an sticking around 
       a while to see what the other players are doing.  Who cares what 
       it means, as long you hold onto your cards, you can say anything 
       you  want.   You  can even say "I think I'll  fold".   When  the 
       player  to  your left throws his hand away, you  then  can  say, 
       "Nah...  I think I'll raise".  I am assuming the player to  your 
       left is smaller than you.


                                   DISCARDS

       When it's your turn to discard, a pointer (arrow) will point  to 
       the first card in your hand.  The last line on your screen  will 
       show the following options:

                L/R Arrows Move Cursor      U Arrow Mark Card    
                Alt-O Show Odds           END Discard

       Move the pointer using the Left and Right arrow keys until  it's 
       under the card you wish to discard, then press the Up arrow key.  
       The card will be marked with an "x".  Continue marking the cards 
       you wish to discard then press the END key.  When you press  the 
       END  key,  the marked cards will be discarded  from  your  hand. 
       Pressing the Up arrow on a previously marked card will erase the

       "x"  and  the card will not be discarded.  If you wish  to  play 
       your hand pat, just press the END key without marking any cards.

           Alt-O Show Odds
 
       Pressing   Alt-O   will   clear your screen  and   display  your 
       chances of being dealt, and drawing to various hands.   To  exit 
       this screen, press any key and you will be returned to the  same

       2 - Sliding Screens

       While  going  from one screen  to  another, the   screens   will

       option toggles to ON, you will be asked the following question:

                Do you want to pause to view discards (Y/N)?

       This is useful if you are playing at a fast speed without  using 
       Pause  For Player Action (Option F) above.  When answering  Yes, 
       before  the  dealer deals your replacement  cards,  action  will 
       pause until you press the SpaceBar.  If you have answered Yes to 
       this question, a final following question will be displayed

                   Pause when your not in the pot (Y/N)?

       If  you  have  folded  and do not care  to  pause  to  view  the 
       discards,  answer No.  Answering Yes will pause even though  you 
       have folded.

       The  documentation for Draw Poker is intended to show  the  user 
       how  this computer version is played.  It has not  been  written 
       for  the complete novice at Draw Poker.  Those that  have  never 
       played Draw Poker should purchase one of the many books  written 
       on  the subject for a better understanding of the game.  If  you 
       are  a beginner at Draw Poker, hopefully this game will  improve 
       your playing.

       This game was written to be played as a $20 limit game.   Future 
       versions  may  have  a table stakes option.   This  will  depend 
       largely on registrations and user comments.

                               DRAW POKER RULES

       Each  player is dealt five cards, face down.  Each  player  will 
       take  a turn dealing the cards.  Cards are dealt in a  clockwise 
       manner  starting with the player to the dealers immediate  left.  
       The cards are dealt one at a time until each player has a  total 
       of  five cards.  The undealt cards are set aside for later  use.  
       These are usually placed in front of the dealer.

       A betting interval then takes place. Then each active player, in 
       turn,  may discard from one to five cards or stay with  what  he 
       has.   The dealer will then give each active player  replacement 
       cards  from the top of the unused portion of the deck.   Another 
       betting interval takes place followed by a showdown in which the 
       highest hand among the active players wins the pot.

                                  DRAW GAMES

       Draw can be played in a few different variations.  Not all forms  
       of   Draw  are  supported in this game.   The  following  is   a 
       description  of the types of Draw Poker games allowed with  this 
       version.

                                Straight Ante

       All  players  ante  $2 and may either bet or  check  their  hand 
       before the draw.  The first player to the dealers left is  first 
       to act.

                                    Blind     

       All  players ante $2 and must either bet, raise or  fold  before 
       the  draw.  The  first player to the dealers left places  a  bet 
       ($20)  in   the  pot  before  the  cards  are  dealt.   This  is 
       considered a blind bet, meaning  the  player is opening the  pot 
       without looking  at  his cards.  A marker will be place by  that 
       player  indicating he  has the blind.  The first player  to  the 


                                    - 2 -








       blinds  left is first to act. This  makes the blind last to  act 
       before the draw but first to act after the draw.

       The  blind  game is intended to create a little  action.   After 
       all,  wouldn't  you  want to call a  player  that  bets  without 
       looking at his cards?

       Before  the draw, starting with the first player to  the  blinds 
       left,  the player must either call the blind bet, raise or fold.  
       When   its  the blinds turn to play and the pot  has  only  been 
       called, he has no  further  action because he is already in  the  
       pot. On the other hand, if the pot was raised, he may call,  re-
       raise  or fold.  Not supported in this version is what as  known 
       as a  "live blind".   A  live  blind means that if the pot   was  
       not  raised before  the  draw,  then the blind has  the   option  
       of  raising himself by placing an addition bet in the pot.  

                                   Straddle

       In   this form of Draw, none of the players ante.   Instead,   3 
       players put in a straddle bet.  The first player to the  dealers 
       left puts in $5, the next player puts in $5, and the next player 
       puts  in  $10.  This amount adds up to the minimum  bet  of  the 
       limit  game  you are playing.  A $4 limit game  would  have  the 
       straddle at $1, $1 & $2; a $10 limit game would be $2, $3 &  $5; 
       a  $200 limit game would be $50, $50 & $100.  The  players  that 
       have placed the straddle bets will have markers placed in  front 
       of their playing positions.

       This game also creates action.  You have 3 players with  partial 
       bets in the pot already.  This makes it a little easier for them 
       to call.  If they don't call, they lose the straddle.

       The  first player to act before the draw is the first player  to 
       the  left  of  the big straddle and  play  continues  clockwise.  
       After  the  draw,  action starts with the first  player  to  the 
       dealers left.


                                STARTING DRAW

       From   your  DOS  prompt, type Draw  and  press   ENTER.    Your 
       monitor  will display the opening screen.  After a few  seconds, 
       or  until you hit a key, you will be asked for your  name.   You 
       must  enter something when asked.  If you don't like your  name, 
       enter   anything  you  want.   Draw  will  save   your   playing 
       statistics  to  a file associated with what you enter.   If  you 
       answered  "Cool  Joe",  then  a  file  will  be  created  called 
       COOLJOE.DPH.   Each time you play Draw, that file will  be  read 
       and your past history will be available for you to cry over.

       Once  you have entered your name, the screen will clear and  you 
       will  be  placed in the playing screen, ready to show  the  dumb 
       computer players your stuff.  

       NOTE:  After you have enter your name, you will not be  required 

                                    - 3 -








       to do so in the future.  If a player, other than yourself wishes 
       to play, you may change players names by pressing ALT-N from the 
       main playing screen.  You will be allowed to enter from 1 to  21 
       characters  for your name.  The first 8 characters will be  used 
       to create a file containing your playing statistics.


                                PLAYING SCREEN

       The  playing  screen will display the playing positions  of  the 
       players.  These are positioned in a circle to represent a  poker 
       table.   The top center of your screen will show a card  labeled 
       P1,  representing player #1.  The player positions are  numbered 
       from P1 to P8 in a clockwise manner starting at the P1 position.

       The   center  of  the screen displays the  pot.   As   Draw   is 
       played, the pot will naturally increase as bets are made.

       The  upper  left  part  of the screen  will  show  your  current 
       standings during the course of play.  The upper right side  will 
       show your total standings.  The total standings are saved  after 
       each game in the file created when you entered your name at  the 
       start of Draw.

       The  left  side  of the screen will show  the  requirements  for 
       opening the pot.  This will be either "Anything Opens" or "Jacks 
       or Better".  The right side will show the form of Draw  your are  
       currently playing.  The game limit may not be changed  with this  
       version.   It  is  possible that a future  version  will   allow 
       various limits or a table stakes game.

       Near the bottom of the screen, the following will be displayed:

                 F1 Deal          F3 Setup           F5 Stats   
                 F8 High Scores   ALT-N New Player   F10 Quit

       These are the main options you currently have available.   These 
       options   are displayed when you first start Draw and   at   the 
       end of each hand.


                                 MAIN OPTIONS

       F1 Deal

       To  start playing Draw, you may either press the F1 key  or  the 
       ENTER  key.   Before  the cards are dealt to  each  player,  all 
       players must either ante, place the blind or place the  straddle 
       bets   depending  on  what form of Draw you  are   playing.    A 
       marker  will  be  placed by the dealer along with  the  deck  of 
       cards.   The  dealer  will deal out five cards  to  each  player 
       starting with the first player to his left.

       F3 Setup Menu

       Pressing the F3 key will display the Draw Setup Menu.  This will 
       allow  you  to change many of the options  available  with  this 
       version  of Draw.  When you quit playing, any changes made  will  
       be  saved so they are available to you the next  time  you play.

       F5 Stats

       Pressing the F5 key will display each players current standings.  
       This  screen  is  displayed in the same  order  as  the  playing 
       screen.  The profit, pots won, and pots each player was involved 
       in  will  be  shown below each players  number.   These  figures 
       represent the current game only.

       The  center  of this screen will show the current  hands  dealt, 
       total  hands  dealt,  house  take, total  house  take,  and  any 
       carryover from the pot. 

           Current Hands

       The current hands are the amount of hands dealt during each game 
       you play.

           Total Hands

       The  total  hands will show all the Draw hands that  have   been 
       played.

           House Take

       The  house take is the amount of money collected by  the  house.  
       The house will collect money from each player for the  privilege 
       of  playing at their club or casino.  This is usually done  each 
       half  hour  by a pit boss or club employee.  In this  $20  limit 
       game,  you  are charged $2 at the end of every 15  hands.   Some 
       clubs rake a percentage from each pot rather than collect  time.  
       This form of collection is not supported in this version.

           Total House Take

       This  will display the total amount of money taken in  from  all 
       the hands played.

           Carryover To Next Pot

       This  will always show a zero amount unless the hand  previously 
       played  could not be split amount the winners.  This could  also 
       show  the size of the pot if you are playing "Jacks  or  Better" 
       and the pot was not opened.

       The last line of this screen will display your complete  history 
       taken from your file on disk.

       the ENTER key.

       Draw players.  The following will be shown on this screen:

              Rank    Players Name    Winnings    Hands    Date

       The first column will show the numbers 1 to 15 which  represents 
       the top players winnings to the 15th. highest players winnings.

       The players name will accept from 1 to 21 characters.

       The winnings is the amount of money you have won for one session 
       of Draw.  This is not a total of all your winnings.

       The  hands that are displayed will also be for the same  session 
       of Draw played.  This is not a total of all your hands played.

       The date displayed will be the date you achieved your  winnings.  
       Draw will not ask you for the date.  You must have set the  date 
       from DOS when you first booted up your computer.

       When  you  are finished looking at this screen, press  ENTER  to 
       return to the main screen.

       ALT-N New Player

       Pressing  the  ALT and N key together will allow you  to  change 
       a  players  name.  This should be used when a  friend  wants  to 
       play.   Rather  than  having  your friend  screw  up  your  high 
       winnings  with  his  bad playing habits, press  ALT-N  and  your 
       statistics  will be saved, then your friend can enter his  name.  
       This would be the same thing as quitting the game then  starting 
       over again.

       F10 Quit

       When you press  the  F10 key, you will  quit  Draw Poker and  be 
       returned   to  your  DOS  prompt.   All  high   scores,   player 
       statistics, and necessary files are then saved.


                                 PLAY OPTIONS

       Once you have pressed either F1 or the ENTER key to deal a hand, 
       your  playing options will appear below your  playing  position.  
       These  options  will  vary slightly depending on  the  round  of 
       betting you are currently in.  The options will be:

                  Bet    Fold    Call    Raise    Pass/Check

       Press  the first letter of one of the options that appear  below 
       your  playing position.  These options will only appear when  it 
       is your turn to act.

       Bet

       Pressing B will place the minimum bet in the pot for you.

       Fold

       Pressing F will fold your hand.  This will erase your hand  from 
       the screen and you will forfeit and further action in the pot.

       Call

       Pressing C will call any bets or raises previously made by other 
       players.  The correct amount of money will be placed in the pot.

       Raise

       Pressing  R  will raise the pot the maximum limit of  the  game.  
       A  raise  simply  means  you are calling  all  bets  and  adding 
       another bet into the pot.

       Pass/Check

       Pressing the P key will pass or check your hand.  Passing a hand 
       means you do not want to bet at this time.  You still remain  in 
       the pot and have the option to later call if a bet or raise  has 
       been  made by any other players.  You will not be able to  raise 
       after  you pass or check unless this option has been set in  the 
       SetUp Menu.

       NOTE:   Please  do  not write me telling  me  that  passing  and 
       checking  are different.  Normally, pass means you  are  tossing 
       your hand away.  To check would mean you plan an sticking around 
       a while to see what the other players are doing.  Who cares what 
       it means, as long you hold onto your cards, you can say anything 
       you  want.   You  can even say "I think I'll  fold".   When  the 
       player  to  your left throws his hand away, you  then  can  say, 
       "Nah...  I think I'll raise".  I am assuming the player to  your 
       left is smaller than you.


                                   DISCARDS

       When it's your turn to discard, a pointer (arrow) will point  to 
       the first card in your hand.  The last line on your screen  will 
       show the following options:

                L/R Arrows Move Cursor      U Arrow Mark Card    
                Alt-O Show Odds           END Discard

       Move the pointer using the Left and Right arrow keys until  it's 
       under the card you wish to discard, then press the Up arrow key.  
       The card will be marked with an "x".  Continue marking the cards 
       you wish to discard then press the END key.  When you press  the 
       END  key,  the marked cards will be discarded  from  your  hand. 
       Pressing the Up arrow on a previously marked card will erase the

       "x"  and  the card will not be discarded.  If you wish  to  play 
       your hand pat, just press the END key without marking any cards.

           Alt-O Show Odds
 
       Pressing   Alt-O   will   clear your screen  and   display  your 
       chances of being dealt, and drawing to various hands.   To  exit 
       this screen, press any key and you will be returned to the  same

       2 - Sliding Screens

       While  going  from one screen  to  another, the   screens   will

       option toggles to ON, you will be asked the following question:

                Do you want to pause to view discards (Y/N)?

       This is useful if you are playing at a fast speed without  using 
       Pause  For Player Action (Option F) above.  When answering  Yes, 
       before  the  dealer deals your replacement  cards,  action  will 
       pause until you press the SpaceBar.  If you have answered Yes to 
       this question, a final following question will be displayed

                   Pause when your not in the pot (Y/N)?

       If  you  have  folded  and do not care  to  pause  to  view  the 
       discards,  answer No.  Answering Yes will pause even though  you 
       have folded.
