## Information about "TOMMY'S GORILLA BALLS/TOMMY'S METEORS"

    TOMMY'S GORILLA BALLS is a quick game in which you must dodge "gorilla
    balls" that roll out onto the screen from the four corners of the game
    table.  The game ends when you are rolled over by a gorilla ball, and
    you are given a score based upon the amount of time that you stayed
    alive.  If you stay alive long enough, the game table will gradually
    begin to shrink and you will have less room to maneuver.  The strategy
    of this game is to make two gorilla balls run into each other, causing
    both of them to disappear from the game board.
    
    TOMMY'S METEORS has you avoiding falling meteors while your character
    gobbles up blocks of buildings for points.  Periodically new buildings
    will appear on the screen to replace the previous ones. The game ends
    when you are hit by a meteor or when you are inadvertently caught
    underneath a new building that appears on the screen.  Your score is
    based upon the amount of time that you are able to survive.
    
    Both games on this disk automatically keep track of the top ten scores,
    have on-line instructions, and work with both color and monochrome
    monitors.

                 *WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF TOMMY'S TOYS*

DEAR EARTHLINGS,

HELLO!  MY NAME IS TOMMY.  I AM AN ALIEN FROM OUTER SPACE.  I DESIGN NEAT
FUN SOFTWARE TOYS AND GAMES FOR IBM PCS AND COMPATIBLES AND SELL THEM AT
ASTOUNDINGLY LOW PRICES ($3 TO $6 EACH) TO NICE EARTHLINGS LIKE YOU TO PAY
FOR MY REESE'S PIECES AND MAKE EARTHLINGS HAPPY.  I HOPE YOU ENJOY MY TOYS.

THE TOY(S) ON THIS DISK ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED BY AN AUTHORIZED SHAREWARE
DEALER WITHOUT ANY STRINGS ATTACHED IN THE HOPES THEY WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO
SEND A TOKEN $2 FOR MY NEAT DEMO DISK CONTAINING, AMONG OTHER GOODIES (REALLY
IT IS A LOT OF VALUE), AN ELECTRONIC CATALOG OF THE AWESOME ASTOUNDING LINE
OF OTHER TOYS I HAVE FOR SALE, CURRENTLY WELL OVER A HUNDRED, INCLUDING SUCH
CLASSIC GOODIES AS TOMMY'S TREK, TOMMY'S WHEEL OF MISFORTUNE, TOMMY'S TRIVIA,
TOMMY'S CROSSWORDS, TOMMY'S PATIENCE (SOLITAIRE), TOMMY'S GIN RUMMY (AND GOBS
OF OTHER NEAT CARD GAMES), TOMMY'S BACKGAMMON, TOMMY'S DOMINOES, TOMMY'S DICE,
AND DOZENS OF NEAT OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD ARCADE STYLE GAMES (TOMMY'S HYPERDRIVE,
TOMMY'S E-NET, TOMMY'S SPACE GOBLINS, ETC.), WORD GAMES (TOMMY'S HIDDEN-WORDS,
TOMMY'S JOTTOMANIA), AND SPACE GAMES, ..., WHEW, GET THE CATALOG AND READ FOR
YOURSELF!

THESE SHAREWARE VERSIONS ARE IDENTICAL WITH THE PRODUCTS I SELL DIRECTLY,
THAT IS, THEY ARE NOT CRIPPLED JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE GETTING THEM FOR FREE
(TRUE, THEY ARE UPDATED CONSTANTLY SO YOU MIGHT GET A NEWER VERSION BY
WRITING DIRECT TO ME).

AND DON'T FEEL GUILTY FOR NOT SENDING IN YOUR REGISTRATION FEES, THEY DON'T
HAVE ANY!  RATHER, THEY ARE "FREE SAMPLES" (THOUGH I RETAIN THE COPYRIGHTS)
SO YOU CAN TASTE A LITTLE OF WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN MISSING.  YOU SEE, I
AUTHORIZE ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF MY TOYS FOR SHAREWARE DISTRIBUTION, AND
ONLY UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, BECAUSE, TO BE FRANK, I'M TRYING TO GET YOU
*ADDICTED* TO MY TRADEMARK BRAND OF CEREBRAL SILLINESS!  THEN I AM BANKING
THAT SOONER OR LATER YOU WILL *WISE UP* AND QUIT BUYING EARTHLING VIDEO GAME
AND TOY PRODUCTS AT $25, $35, OR $50 APIECE WHEN YOU CAN GET MINE FOR A TENTH
OF THAT -- WHY MANY EARTHLING COMPANIES CHARGE $3 TO $5 JUST FOR SHIPPING AND
HANDLING.

WHEN YOU WISE UP, YOU WILL BREAK DOWN YOUR PREJUDICES AGAINST ALIENS FROM
OUTER SPACE (HA HA) AND BEGIN ORDERING FROM THE LONG LIST OF OTHERS WHICH YOU
CAN ONLY GET DIRECT FROM ME!  (ACTUALLY US, WE HAVE A LITTLE BAND OF ALIENS
ON YOUR PLANET RIGHT NOW -- JUST A FRIENDLY LITTLE BAND OF GALACTIC TOYMAKERS,
NO INVASION INTENDED).

AND NO, WE DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR LID ON THE EARTH MARKET BY COPY-
PROTECTING THEM, SO EVEN IF WE DID RAISE PRICES THE ROBIN HOODS OUT THERE
WOULD BEGIN PIRATING THEM AT CUT-RATE PRICES AND SAVE YOU FROM SELLING YOUR
PLANET OFF TO ALIENS FROM OUTER SPACE LIKE YOUR FOREBEARS DID (HA HA -- JUST
KIDDING TO SEE IF YOU ARE AWAKE).

YOU MIGHT WONDER HOW WE CAN GIVE AWAY REGISTRATION-FREE SAMPLES AND STAY IN
BUSINESS, OR HOW WE CAN CHARGE SO LITTLE FOR OUR HOT SOFTWARE IN THE PRESENT
DAY EARTHLING COMMERCIAL ARENA, OR WHY WE DON'T HAVE A $10-$25 SHAREWARE
REGISTRATION FEE.

WELL, SIMPLE MY DEAR EARTHLING.  1. WHO PAYS FOR A MOVIE ON THE WAY OUT?
2. WHO CAN SELL A RECORD ALBUM IF THEY DON'T GET SOME TRACKS PLAYED FOR FREE
ON THE RADIO?  3. WHO WANTS TO PAY A BUNCH OF MIDDLEMEN AND ADVERTISERS WHEN
THEY CAN GET IT DIRECT FROM THE SOURCE?  ENJOY THE TOMMY'S TOY(S) ON THIS
DISKETTE WITH MY COMPLIMENTS -- I FIGURE THAT THEY DO MORE GOOD ON YOUR PC
THAN GATHERING DUST ON MY SPACE SHIP ... AND WHEN YOU ARE DOWN IN THE DUMPS
AFTER HOURS OF ANGUISHING OVER SPREADSHEETS, WORD PROCESSING, OR NUMBER
CRUNCHING, AND WANT SOME MORE FUN, YOU WILL KNOW WHERE YOU CAN GET IT, CHEAP,
VIA AIR MAIL, FROM A CONVENIENT, HIGH-ALTITUDE, CENTRALLY LOCATED EARTH
ADDRESS.

IN SUMMARY, EARTHLINGS, THIS IS NOTHING LESS THAN A BOLD NEW ALIEN METHOD OF
MARKETING (OF COURSE WE ALIENS *INVENTED* THE SHAREWARE CONCEPT AND IMPLANTED
IT IN YOUR MINDS TO START WITH, MAKING YOU THINK IT WAS YOUR OWN IDEA) AND,
AFTER IT WORKS AS WE ALIENS HAVE PLANNED (SO THAT EVERY PC IN THE WORLD IS
CRAWLING WITH !TOMMY'S TOYS!) YOU THE EARTHLING CONSUMERS WILL REAP THE
BENEFITS -- AND WE ALIENS HAVE PULLED OFF YET ANOTHER COMPUTERIZED TAKEOVER
OF A LIVE PLANET (HA HA, JUST KIDDING, WE'RE NOT TRYING TO TAKE OVER YOUR
PLANET, JUST MAKE EARTHLINGS HAPPY, YOU KNOW THE STORY, SURE).

AS AN ALIEN TOYMAKER WITH A LONG GALACTIC TRADITION TO UPHOLD, BELIEVE ME, I
REALLY LIKE GETTING ORDERS AND LETTERS FROM NICE EARTHLINGS, SO TRY WRITING
TO ME AND SEE IF IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.  THIS IS A LOT CHEAPER THAN
A JAUNT TO DEVIL'S TOWER NATIONAL MONUMENT IN SEARCH OF CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, NOW
ISN'T IT?

NOW PLEASE SEND FOR YOUR DEMO DISK AND JOIN THE GROWING NUMBERS OF EARTHLINGS
WHO APPRECIATE GOOD EXTRATERRESTRIAL ENGINEERING AT DOWN TO EARTH PRICES --
BEFORE WE GET FRUSTRATED AND LEAVE THIS PLANET FOR A KINDER, GENTLER GALAXY
(HA HA HO HO, JUST KIDDING, WE LIKE YOUR SILLY PLANET EVEN IF YOU PRIMITIVES
STILL THINK OF PCS AS INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS <YUK> MACHINES.)


YOUR FRIEND,

             TOMMY
