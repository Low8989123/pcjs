## Information about "SECURITY ANALYSIS & PORTFOLIO MANAGER"

    The serious investor with a portfolio will find a thoughtful pal in
    SECURITY ANALYSIS AND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT.  Developed by a financial
    consulting company, SAPM lets you enter your stock transactions
    quickly and easily.  Then it gives you all
    the reports you need to know what's going on with your portfolio.  A
    highly sophisticated securities analysis system is added, along with a
    number of tools to help you manage your money and deal with loans.
    
    The analysis of individual stocks uses principles developed by the

    primary tool to estimate future growth rates.  Reports include present
    value and book price, market value, current gain/loss, percent return,
    and percent of holdings a security represents.  SAPM creates
    amortization tables, calculates loan payoffs, determines future
    investment values, calculates current amount required for a desired
    amount (present value), calculates loan amortizations, and determines
    future value of regular additions to an investment plan (annuity).

                                       PREFACE

          Do I really need to read  the SAPM  manual?  No  - SAPM  is self-
          contained, self-explanatory, and menu-driven.  But to get started
          correctly, and to obtain an  overview  of  SAPM  you  should read
          through this short manual.


                                HOW TO START-UP SAPM

          SAPM will  work on any IBM compatible computer with at least 128K
          of memory and a DOS system disk.  To run the program follow these
          steps:

               1. Turn on your computer.

               2. Insert your  DOS System disk into Drive A and close the
               drive door.  The disk should then boot-up, displaying  the
               normal starting information.

               3. Answer the DATE and TIME prompts.

               4. Remove the DOS System disk from Drive A.

               5. Insert your SAPM disk into Drive A and close the door.

               6. At the DOS prompt, type: SAPM.

               7. Press ENTER.


                                     DATA INPUT

          The following data input procedures are adhered to:

               1. Data displayed  will be kept if the ENTER key is pressed
           without making changes.

               2. The RIGHT ARROW key is used to allow the user  to use
          characters from the current data displayed.

               3. The length  of the input is highlighted to let the user
          know how many characters can be entered.

               4. The  BACK  ARROW  key  deletes  an  entered  character or
          number.

               5. Toggle inputs  are selected  by using the ARROW keys to
          highlight a selection then pressing the ENTER key.

                                   SAPM MAIN MENU

          From this menu you  can select  the option  you want  to perform.
          You have the choice of disk and file utilities, money management,
          exiting, portfolio management, or security analysis.   Just press
          the number  of the option you want or use the arrow keys to go to
          that option and press enter.

          If you choose to go to the Portfolio Manager section, you will be
          prompted for  the name of the portfolio you plan to use.  Type in
          that name but DO  NOT  use  a  filename  extension  (*.xxx).  All
          portfolio files  are stored  on the  disk with  the same filename
          extension, '<filename>.SPM'.


                                  SECURITY ANALYSIS

          This section performs an analysis of a particular stock using the
          principals  developed  by  the  National Association of Investors
          Corporation (1515  East 11  Mile Rd,  Royal Oak,  MI 48067).  For
          help  in  understanding  the  analysis output you should obtain a
          copy of The Investors Manual for $12 from NAIC.

          The data must be initially entered manually.  Several  test files
          are included  on the  disk to  demonstrate typical output.  These
          files have  the  filename  extension  '<filename>.DAT'  where the
          filename is the corporation's stock symbol.

          To start  entering data  choose option  2.  If you are using data
          previously saved (a file directory option allows you  to view the
          files on  the logged  drive), you  can do  'What If?' analysis by
          going directly to either the 5  year  table  or  to  the earnings
          growth  entry  area  by  entering  the  appropriate letter at the
          prompt.

          Corrections to input errors can be made when you are  prompted to
          change entered values.  An entry of 'T' (table) or 'E' (earnings)
          will keep the entered  values and  position the  cursor at either
          the 5 year table or the earnings growth entry area.  A 'Q' (quit)
          entry will return you to the Security Analysis Menu.

          To enter data or make corrections  in  the  5  year  table, first
          highlight the entry with the arrow key and Press ENTER.  Make the
          appropriate correction or entry.  Then press ENTER again to leave
          that particular  cell. You  may exit from the table at anytime by
          pressing either the 'Q' (quit)  or 'D'  (done) key.   Pressing an
          'I' in  the first  cell will  insert a  new row  for imputing the
          latest year of data.  This comes in handy when you wish to update
          an old analysis with recently published data.

          The program prompts the user for the following data in the 5 year

                                          5



          table:
               1.  Year
               2.  Price (high and low)
               3.  Earning per Share
               4.  Dividend per Share
               5.  Book Value per Share
               6.  Sales
               7.  % Net Profit Margin (profit divided by sales)
               8.  Long Term Debt

          The input data can be obtained from financial reporting companies
          such as  Value Line  or Standard & Poors.  However, some corpora-
          tions provide enough historical data in  their annual  reports to
          perform the  analysis.  The  Long Term Debt data and % Net Profit
          Margin data should be used in  conjunction with  the %  Earned on
          Investment Capital data (calculated) to evaluate management.  See
          The Investor's  Manual  on  how  to  do  this.   Although,  it is
          possible to  conduct the analysis without this data.  You are not
          restricted to entering Long  Term  Debt  data  and  %  Net Profit
          Margin  data  into  their  respective  columns.  If you have some
          other yearly data that you would rather have  displayed, enter it
          in one  of those columns.  However, you should rename the columns
          on the output to the appropriate data name.

          The program  uses  regression  analysis  to  estimate  the future
          growth rate.  To assist the user in determining the usefulness of
          the estimated rate, the percentage  of  past  earnings  data that
          correlates  is   provided  (known  statistically  as  r-squared).
          Generally, a 60% correlation is considered  good.   Anything less
          should strongly suggest that a different estimator be used.

          Once you are through entering data, the analysis can be conducted
          by choosing the first menu  option.   The  output  can  be either
          directed to the screen, printer, or a file.  You should also save
          your data for future stock analysis.  There is  no restriction on
          the filename or extension which may be used.


                                  PORTFOLIO MANAGER

          To start  adding transactions  select the first menu option.  The
          first entry will be for the portfolio type.  Enter any two letter
          combination which  describes the  portfolio type (eg, 'MF'-Mutual
          Fund, 'SK'-Stock, 'BD'-Bond, etc).  The  next  entry  is  for the
          transaction type.  One of the following codes must be entered:

               1. 'B'  - Bought

               2. 'S'  - Sold

               3. 'RD' - Reinvestment Dividend


                                          6





               4. 'SD' - Stock Dividend

               5. 'IC' - Income Dividend

               6. 'SS' - Stock Split

               7. 'CG' - Capital Gains Distribution Reinvested

               8. 'CI' - Capital Gains Distribution Taken as Income


          After entry of the appropriate code, you will be prompted for the
          information necessary for that particular transaction.   You will
          be given  an opportunity  to make entry changes at the end of the
          required input.

          To change or delete a specific transaction select the second menu
          option.   You  will  be  prompted  for the symbol and transaction
          date.  Enter them and the first record found matching the entries
          will be displayed for deletion or changes.

          To view  the portfolio transactions select the third menu option.
          The records will be  individually  displayed  beginning  with the
          first  one.   You  can  stop  viewing  records  and return to the
          portfolio menu at any time by pressing the ESC key.


                                  PORTFOLIO REPORTS

                                  ARCHIVE/RETRIEVE

          A special utility is included with the program to remove
          (archive) securities from the transaction file.   This may become
          necessary when  a closed  position no longer needs to be analyzed
          with the rest of the  portfolio.   To  access  the  utility, type
          ARCHIVE at the DOS prompt.  The utility is menu driven and should
          not present any problems to the user.  Additionally, the user may
          use any  filename extension  desired when  naming the output file
          (the program will not accept an  extension when  prompted for the
          active  portfolio  filename).   To  analyze  an archived position
          without first retrieving it, the user must rename the file (under
          DOS) such that the extension becomes '<filename>.SPM'.
