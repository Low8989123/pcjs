## Information about "NCRISK"

    This colorful strategy game, a clone of the Parker Brothers' game Risk,
    pits you and your army against the armies of up to five other players
    in a worldwide conflict.
    
    Strategy involves trying to pick up extra armies by occupying whole
    continents.  At the same time, you must protect yourself against
    unexpected moves by your opponents.  Do not expect a short game if your
    foes are skilled.  Conquering the world can be difficult!
