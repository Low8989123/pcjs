                    P U R S U I T    DOCUMENTATION

                    Copyright Circle Software 1988


           PURSUIT is a MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTION program.

	It can be used for many types of applications.  In one case it has
been used by the National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) to
poll members on their knowledge of NACE.

	Statistics on the answers given is kept in a DAT file.

	The form to run the program is:	

	  pursuit filename [switches with a space between each]

	One needs to make a QUESTION file, an OPTIONS file (a list of 
multiple choice answers), an EXPLANATION file (explains the correct 
answer - optional), and a TITLE file (which gives a title or NAME to 
the question set, also optional.)

	PURSUIT documentation can be listed by running the program with NO 
file name given, Type: pursuit (RETURN)

	Registration + shipping + Md Tax (5% - if needed) covers the next 
update.  Next update version will be 1.3.0 (Shareware Version is 1.2.0).

	Version 1.3.0 is planned to be out by 6/30/88.

  ----------------------  Pmenu  Information ---------------------------

      Pmenu was designed to be a comprehensive DOS level menu system.  It
    requires only one other file to operate, a BATCH file.
          
      In its default mode both the number keys & the Function-keys 
    (F-keys), when pressed, will pass codes to the batch function
    ERRORLEVEL (EL), from 0 to 9 for the number keys & from 1 to 10 for
    the F-keys.  All other keys generate EL's equal to their ASCII code
    - 48.

      Special key assignments may be entered to send the EL's from 1 to 
    10 (or up to 72) if desired.  These settings will supersede the
    numeric & F-keys.  However, both the numeric & F-keys are still
    functional.

      Additional settings can be made for screen colors, screen mode
    (40 or 80 character wide), line spacing, cursor position & a beep
    after display of the menu.

      There is even a screen that displays: "Working,  Please wait..." 
    upon exit, for use when the batch process to follow is long.

      There are two more options. One turns off the copyright notice 
    delay, normally 2 seconds, & the last prints out the ERRORLEVEL
    that will be passed to DOS upon exit.  This last helps in the
    debugging of the batch file being written to use these ERRORLEVELS.

    Switches:

      /4s   - Screen set to 40 character mode, s = save this mode, option.

      /b    - Beep switch to turn beep on. Beep after menu printed.

      /c#,# - Print with colors: #-foreground, #-background

      /e    - Errorlevel display. Shows EL of key pressed.

      /fAB  - Find Char 'A' then start printing text, end at 'B'

      /klLaA- Keys, in pairs, for EL's. EL 0 = l or L, EL 1 = a or A.

      /n    - Never mind, Do Not wait for key input.

      /o    - Turn off the Copyright notice 2 second delay.

      /p#,# - Position cursor at: #-line, #-column. Turns cursor ON,
              it is normally OFF.

      /s    - Print an extra line feed between each line printed.

      /w    - Working, Please wait... displayed.


                      Advanced  BATCH System  Documentation

                 Copyright Circle Software/Philip Karras 1989

	This menu program is a BATCH file menu program.  It has a point and
	shoot menu menu system like the Advanced Menu System, along with the 
	small help area for each menu item.



                      Advanced  Menu  System  Documentation

               Copyright Circle Software/Philip Karras 1987,88,89


	   The Advanced Menu System uses less than 36K of disk space and
   less than 100K of RAM when in memory resident mode or only 80 BYTES
   of RAM in DOS BATCH mode.  (See: Ram Requirements.)

	   This Advanced Menu System can run programs that end in the
   following extensions: COM, EXE, and BAT.  It can also run DOS
   COMMAND.COM programs such as COPY, ERASE, CHDIR, and TYPE.  It can
   even return to DOS on a temporary basis so that DOS commands can be
   run and then return to the menu by typing: exit (RETURN).  (See:
   Getting Programs to Run and Entering Commands.)

	   The amount of RAM needed is decided by the amount of RAM the
   Advanced Menu System requires, the amount of RAM the program to be
   run needs, and the amount of RAM the COMMAND.COM requires.  (See:
   Ram Information.)

	   It is now possible to place all programs in a menu-driven
   format, that are not used often enough to make their use "second
   nature" for example, utilities that are accumulated but are not used
   often enough to make their commands well known.  The Advanced Menu
   System has three levels of user made help: help lines (one line of
   78 characters), help screens (24 lines by 80 characters), and
   small-help screens (11 lines by 48 characters.) (See: Creating a
   HELP file)

	   With the ability to pass commands to a program (called a command
   line input) the Advanced Menu System can help take the place of the
   DOS prompt while giving context-sensitive help information that YOU
   create! The command line input section has a line editor and a
   20-line command buffer.  (See: AMS General Use Information
   (Editor).)

	   Command Line Inputs can be passed between programs and default
   file extensions can be built in.  Also, at initialization time of
   the Advanced Menu System, a default /path and an initializing
   command line input can be set.  (See: AMS command codes, and AMS
   General Use Information - switches.)

	   The Advanced Menu System also has color or monochrome settings. 
   Monochrome is the starting default, but once color is set, the
   Advanced Menu System will start in color.

      EOF:      Places DOS EOF char (dec 26) at the end of a file.

      FE:       Front end, finds files like findf & passes these to any 
                other program.

      FIND_:    Will find lines that have the searched-for string & print
      FINDL:    them as they are in the file. The case ignore mode is the
                default mode. (FINDL is the interactive version of FIND_.)

      FINDA:    This is a combination of FINDF & PFIND. It will first

                the string of interest.

      FINDF:    This program finds files on a disk. It finds all files
                whose names contain the string of interest, irrespective 
                of their location in the file name. It has a BATCH
                switch to help in backing up sub-dirs.

      FK:       Allows changing repeat rate and delay for pressed keys.

      LOG:      Will keep a log of the times you log onto your system,

                printer fonts.

      PRTLBL:   Will print address lines on labels. It uses the same data
                file as Pfind. 

      PSND:     Sounds a tone.

      PSORT:    Sorts blocks of data, like the Pfind data block files.

## BEGINNER.DOC

-------------------------- BEGINNERS'  CORNER --------------------------

	Welcome, and thanks for buying the Pfind Utilities. In this file I 
will try to explain the how and why of using a few of the more
powerful programs on the Pfind Utilities disk.

	First, let me say that I tried to follow a form for all of the 
programs. The general form is:

    PRGM_NAME (Drive:\Path\FILE_NAME) (string) (switches or codes)

PRGM_NAME is the name of the program you want to run (execute).
          Always needed.

(Drive:\Path\ is the drive and path where the file can be found, if 
              needed.

FILE_NAME) is the name of the file to search, if needed.

(string) is the part of a word, a word or several words to search
         for, if needed.

(switches or codes) are the switches to control options in the
                    program, if needed or the codes to send to a
                    printer, if needed.

	Let's go over the example(s) given on the printed sheet that 
came with the Pfind Utilities. If you remember, Joe needed to send a 
letter about "wedgable widgets" to all of his New York clients.
Here is what he typed to find the "lost" file:

	finda ww*.* wedgable widgets /o >ww.lst

	The program FINDA is "run - executed" by first typing "FINDA" on 
the DOS command line.  (This is the line on the screen that starts
with a disk drive letter, like A> or C>, etc.)

	Joe did NOT type a disk drive name or a path because he didn't know
where he should start the search. He assumed that he should start on
the current drive and at the root directory.  (The current drive is the
one the DOS command line displays,"A>".  The root directory is the MAIN
or lowest directory on a disk. All other directories are called "sub
directories".)

	Joe did enter a name for the file.  It was "ww*.*" which tells
DOS to locate all of the files on the disk that start with the
letters "ww".

	Next comes a space and then the string Joe wanted to search for.
In this case, it was "wedgable widgets".  This means that each file
found by FINDA whose name starts with "ww" will be opened and every
line of that file will be looked at to see if it contains "wedgable
widgets".  For a large file, the search can take quite some time to
complete.  When a match is found, the file name, path, file creation
data, and five lines of text will be printed on the screen and a beep
will sound.

	Since Joe did not know how long this might take, he left a space
and he used the "/o" switch.  This switch tells FINDA to NOT beep
when it finds the string.

	The last entry typed by Joe was a space and the DOS command
">ww.lst" which tells DOS to make a file called "ww.lst" that will
contain all of the outputs of the FINDA program.  So, what would
normally go to the screen, instead went into the file "ww.lst".  In
this way Joe could do other things and come back later to check the
ww.lst file using his word processor.  He could then locate the file
he needed with the information saved in the ww.lst file.

	Before I go on, let me say a few things. First, the amount of time 
that FINDA (and FINDF) takes to find files is inversely proportional
to the amount of information known about the file.  This means that
the more that is known about a file, the shorter the search time to
find that file will be.  An Example of this is: Joe used "ww*.*" to
find the "lost" file .  This was because his boss had said that the
file name "started with WW".  This told Joe that he did NOT have to
search for "ww" through out a file name, but only at the beginning. 
If Joe had simply used "finda ww wedg..." the search would have taken
longer because FINDA would have had to search the entire file name for
a letter combination of "ww".  Then, if found, the entire file would
have to be searched to find a match with "wedgable widgets".  The
worst possible thing (for short search time) would have been if Joe's
boss had said that he didn't know the name of the file or any part
there of.  In this case Joe would have had to use just "*.*" for the
file name and then EVERY file on the disk would have been searched
for a match with "wedgable widgets".  Second Example: Joe wanted to
search the file(s) for the terms "wedgable widgets".  If Joe had only
known that the word "widgets" was in the file the search would have
taken longer.  This is because each word would have to be checked to
see if it matched the one word given, with two words given only word
pairs need to be searched.  So again, the more that is known (the
more words in a distinguishing sentence) about a file, the shorter
the search time will be to find the file(s).

	As a last added piece of information let me say that using FINDF
is exactly like used FINDA except that FINDF does not need a string
to search for.  It only searches for file name matches, so if you now
understand how to use FINDA you also understand most of how to use
FINDF.


	Joe's next job was to find the N.Y. clients and to make a NY.LST 
file that would contain the list of these clients. He did this by 
typing:

	pfind mailall.lst N.Y. /o /d >NY.LST

	
	Here Joe started with the name of the program to use, which was 
"PFIND".

	Then he typed a space and the name of the file to use.  This means
that the program "PFIND" will open the file "MAILALL.LST" and search it.

	A space and the string to search for were entered next, in this case
"N.Y.".   The program PFIND now searches "MAILALL.LST" for the string
"N.Y.".   It then prints all of the found information on the screen.

	Joe left another space and used the beep off switch, another space,
and then the "/d" (delimiter switch.) This means that all of the
information groups printed out will have a "*" between them.  So each
address, as it is printed out, has a "*" above it and a "*" below it. 
These are start and end indicators needed by the PRTLBL program.

	The last entry was a space, the DOS pipe command and a file name, 
">NY.LST". This tells DOS to make a file called "NY.LST" and to
put all of the information that comes from PFIND into it.  What this
means is that a new mailing list called "NY.LST" will have all of the
New York addresses in it when PFIND is done.

	The last program that Joe ran was the PRTLBL program. He typed:

	prtlbl ny.lst 29

	This tells DOS to run the PRTLBL program, read the NY.LST file, and
print out all of its information.  The 29 at the end tells the printer
to switch to its small print mode.  (Joe was using an Okidata 82a
printer).  Other printer codes can be sent or the printer can be set up
by hand before running PRTLBL.

	The Following are explanations for some of the problems that the
PFIND UTILITIES were designed to overcome.

PFIND: I found that DOS had a find filter, but that it would only find 
       one line of information at a time and it would print it out in
       capital letters.  I created PFIND to find many lines of
       information that are related, a group of information,
       addresses, client information, etc.  It will find up to 9
       lines above the matched line and as many lines below as there
       are before a "*" is found at the start of a line.  I chose the
       "*" character to tell PFIND to start and stop.  Thus, the use
       of the "*" is a delimiter, a group separator.

FIND_: This program is very similar to the DOS FIND filter, except
       that it is in the Case Ignore Mode to start.  This means that
       as the search is done on the string, it doesn't matter whether
       the letters are upper case or lower case, unless the case
       dependent switch is turned on - "/i".  The information found
       is not changed to all capital letters when printed.

PRTCODE: Was written to send printer codes to printers. There is also 
       a demonstration batch file called "SETP.BAT" which shows how to
       write a batch file to set up a printer.  It calls up PRTCODE and
       is set up to change the fonts on a NEC pinwriter P3-3 printer.

PRTLBL: This program will use the same type of data files as PFIND. 
       The addresses need to be separated by "*".  It prints the
       addresses onto address labels.  Printer codes can be sent using
       this program so that one need not use PRTCODE first.  Addresses
       must have 3 or 4 lines.  These can be blank lines.

PPRINT: I found that the two dot matrix printers that I use print DOS 
       TEXT files differently.  One of them ignores TABs and the other
       sends four TABs for ever two TABs.  This program replaces all
       TABs with 3 spaces unless the Send TABs Switch "/t" is used. This 
       program can also be used to address envelopes.

FINDF: I wrote this program to solve the problem of not knowing the 
       exact spelling of a file name.  With this program, one only
       needs to know a few letters of the file name.  The program
       will then find all file names that have these letters in them,
       irrespective of the position of these letters in the file
       name.  The only condition is that the letters must be
       contiguous.

FINDA: This program was written to find a file whose name is not known 
       but the file contains some information (a string) which IS
       known.  The program opens files which meet the criteria given
       (as in our example above "ww*.*"), and searches through them
       for the string.  If a match is found, the program beeps and
       prints the file name, directory information, and five lines of
       the text, the middle line of which contains the string wanted.

PSND:  This program was written to help notify a person that a batch 
       file is done. It can make any sound from 50 to 13000 cycles per 
       second. (/l - about 2 seconds).

PMENU: Helps to set up DOS level menus in 80 or 40 character mode.

MODE80: Rsets the screen mode to 80 if Pmenu set it to 40.

PSORT: Was written to sort blocks of data. Like the Pfind data blocks.

	Now that you have a basic understanding of these programs you should 
print out the other documentation manuals, manual.doc & manualnb.doc. 
These manuals will tell about the kinds of switches that can be used
with each program.

	NOTE: Pfind can be used to find my address in the LST file on the 
	      Pfind Utilities disk:

	           pfind LST phil (RETURN)

	Good luck.  I sincerely hope that these Utilities help you as
much as they help me in my day-to-day information-finding operations.

   File Attributes program.  This program allows
   one to view the set file attributes and to
   change them.  The four file attributes are:
   Archive, System, Hidden, and Read Only.


   FORM:  ats drive:\path\file-name [switch(es)]


   SWITCHES: 

    /a  - Search ALL paths.
    /all- Set ALL the attributes.
    /a? - Archive attribute is set or cleared when
          ? ==  +  =  Set Archive attribute
                -  =  Clear Archive attribute
    /c  - Clear ALL the attributes.
    /d  - Allow changing attributes of directories.

    /d?YYMMDD - date switch ? = a/b after/before.

    /h? - Hidden attribute is set or cleared on ?.
    /r? - Read Only attribute set or cleared on ?.
    /s? - System attribute is set or cleared on ?.
    /w  - Wait for key-press if 20 lines on screen.



   If none of the attribute switches are set,
   then a listing will be made of the files and
   an indication of which attributes are set will
   be displayed beside each file name.

    ------------- CDD - Documentation -----------


   Change Drive and Directory.  This program will
   change both in one operation.

   Also, it will do its best to find the path
   given, even if only a partial path was given.

   It first searches the present path, and moves
   down one path at a time attempting to change
   to the desired path until the ROOT directory
   is reached.  Then it initiates a complete
   search for the unfound path.

   EXAMPLE:   to switch to \WP\MY\DOC  

              from:  \WP\MY\LETTERS\WORK


              type:  CDD doc (RETURN)


   This assumes that a path \WP\MY\LETTERS\DOC
   does not exist.  If it did then the above 
   command would switch to it.


   SWITCH:

   /a - search and make a list of all matching
        paths found.  Allow movement to path
        selected.

    1.  Will delete all files in all
        sub-directories below \tmp and \tmp
        itself.  It will then remove add
        sub-directoies starting with \tmp.  (This
        will remove \tmp from the disk.)

    2.  Will delete all files on the D-drive
        ending with the extension .mss in all
        sub-dirs below \tmp and in \tmp.  It will
        question each file to be deleted.

    3.  Will delete all files on the D-drive
        ending with the extension .mss and were
        created BEFORE 5/25/89 in all sub-dirs

    DSPTXT  will display a text file on the screen 
            and allow movement within that file by 
            using the Home/End, PgUp/PgDn, and 
            up/down arrow keys.

            Home: moves to the beginning of the 
                  text file.

            End:  Moves to the end of the text 
                  file.

            PgUp: Moves up one screen of text.

            PgDn: Moves down one screen of text.

       ------------- DT - Documentation ----------


   Date Time Stamp Changing program.  This
   program allows one to correct an incorrect
   data and time stamp on any file.

   SWITCHES: 
       /a  - Search ALL paths.

       /w - Wait for key-press after 20 lines on
            screen.


   FORM:  

 dt drv:\pth\fl-name [MM/DD/YY] [HH:MM:SS] [switch]

   [switch] == any switches are place here, no 
               "[]" around them.

   NOTE: File-name: the file-name follows the
         same form as with all the other Pfind
         Utilities.  That is, all files will be
         found that have the contiguous letters
         specified as "file-name".  For example,
         specifying ADE as the file-name will
         cause files such as: ADEme.exe,
         coolADE.doc, and help.ADE to all be
         found.  One can use the characters * and
         ? as with normal DOS type commands.

   HH: The hours must be given in 24-hour clock
       mode.  Thus, 6 PM would need to be entered
       as: 18.

       ------------ EOF - Documentation ----------


       This program places the DOS EOF character
     (dec.  26) at the end of a file.  The
     complete drive, path & file name MUST be
     given!

     Example:
                 eof \utils\bak\filename.bas

     This will place the EOF character at the end
     of the file: "FILENAME.BAS" located in the
     sub-sub-dir "\UTILS\BAK" located off of the
     ROOT-dir.

                 eof bak\filename.bas

     This will place the EOF character at the end
     of the file: "FILENAME.BAS" located in the
     sub-dir "BAK" located off of the present
     sub-dir.  (which in this case could be
     "\utils".)






















                       - 1 -

       ------------ FE  - Documentation ----------


   FE - Front End.  Use this to add Circle
        Software file finding methods to any
        other program.

   Switches: 

    /a - ALL PATHS SEARCHED!

    /d - Date switch, form: /d?YYMMDD for 
         July 14, 1987 and above it would 
         be: /da870714
         ? == a (above) - b (below) indicator. 
         If two dates are given (above = & below
         =) then only files with dates between &
         = to these dates will be found.

    /e - Extension name search/match only.

    /p - Program to pass this stuff to switch.

    /q - Question each operation to be performed.

    /s - Switch to path if match found there.

         FORM: /p prgm-name [[any switches]]

               EVERYTHING after /p is passed to
               the program to be run by FE.

     Example:

        fe txt /a /da890901 /db890930 /p[dsptxt


   The above example would search prom the present 
   path to all sub-paths for any file with "TXT" 
   in the file name that also has a date between 
   and equal to 9/1/89 to 9/30/89 and pass the 
   found file name to the "DSPTXT" program to be 
   displayed.


                       - 1 -

        -----  FIND_ & FINDL Documentation  -----
     
     
      FIND_: This program is functionally like the 
             DOS FIND program, it finds a line that 
             has the searched for string in it. It 
             then prints this line to the CRT. 
             
      The differences are:
     
      1. This find doesn't change the case of the
         found line when it prints it to the screen.
     
      2. The case independent mode is the default.
     
      3. There is a beep to indicate a find.
     
      4. The order of DOS line inputs is switched
     
      5. No quote marks are needed around the search
         string.
     
      The first input is the file name & the second
      is the string to match up. The third + 
      positions are for the optional switches:
     
      /c - Count lines that have a match - NO print.

      /i - Case  NOT Ignored  switch.

      /k - Sequential KEYWORD search.

      /n - Number of line precedes printed line.

      /o - Beep Off.

      /r - Send RETURN after line printed.

      /v - Prints lines that do NOT match string.

      /w - Wait after every 20 lines printed to CRT.

      /z - Send DOS EoF to screen.


                       - 1 -

        -----  FIND_ & FINDL Documentation  -----

     

            Some examples of use are:

          1.    find_  file.ext  string  /i  /n  /v
          2.    find_  file.ext  string  /c
          3.    find_  file.ext  string

       The first example uses the case NOT ignore
     switch (/i), the line number switch (/n), & the
     non-match switch (/v). Thus only lines that
     have no match with the string are printed &
     they are printed with the line number.

       The second example has the count switch (/c)
     on. Thus it will only count the number of lines
     that have a match with the given string & only
     print "Number of lines matched: ##".

       The last example will match the given string
     in case ignore (default) mode & print the lines
     that match to the screen.

     /k - Keyword search allows more than one
          space between or even other words 
          between the words of interest. These 
          words MUST be in the correct sequence.

     /r - This switch is needed if the word 
          processor file has lines greater than 80 
          characters long.

     /z - This switch will send the DOS End of 
          File marker (character 26) at the end of 
          the program. Some word processors need 
          this marker to know when the end of the 
          file has been reached.

     FINDA is a combination of FINDF & PFIND. It 
     first locates a file whose name matches the
     given search name & then searches the files
     for the sting of interest. If a match is found
     five (5) lines are printed.

     There are a number of switches, they are:

       /a - search for ALL matches in a file
            (not just one)
       /b - Beep off, a beep normally sounds when
            a match is found.
       /d - Date search (/dYYMMDD), 6 digit date.
       /e - Extensions (on the file name) checked
            ONLY.
       /f - List out files\paths searched.
       /h - hi-light line with match.
       /i - case NOT Ignore - string search is
            case dependent.
       /k - Sequential KEYWORD search.
       /l - Relative Line number of matched line
            printed (###).
       /m - Print more lines - 17 lines.
       /n - No string compare, print first lines.
       /o - Bytes, date time information Off - not
            printed.
       /s - Print delimeter Spacer "*" between blocks.
       /t - List ALL files & their set ATTRIBUTES.
       /w - Wait for key-press if 20 lines on screen.
       /z - Send DOS EoF to screen.
       /1 - Search only ONE path.

     Example: 
        finda d:MSS The Congress Passed /e /a /b /l

     In the above example, all files on drive D:
     of the form *.MSS (extensions only /e) will be
     searched for All (/a) occurrences of "The
     Congress Passed" & when found the Beep will
     NOT sound (/b). Also, the relative line number
     of the matched line will be printed above the
     5 printed lines (/l).

      This Find Files program will find files on a
    disk which match the string given. 

      The difference between this program and many
    others is that one need not enter any globals
    or wild cards to find EVERYTHING that matches!

    Example: findf d:\path\FI

       The above example will find all files on
       drive D:\path\ that have FI in the name:

       from:   FI??????.???
          
       to:     ????????.?FI          

       There are also a number of switches:

       /a - puts paths in front of ALL found files
       /b - copy BATCH file creation switch.
       /d? - Check DATE >= in form: /d870714  == 
             July 14, 1987.
             ? = a (date >= ), or b (date <= ).
       /e - check EXTENSIONS only
       /f - List FREE bytes only.
       /k - KILL/erase batch file creation switch.
       /m - More lines on screen switch EGA 43
            /mv  VGA 50   and  /m## any number. 
       /o - turns bytes/date/time stamp OFF,
            they are not printed.
       /p - PATHs only listed
       /s - Show sub-directories too.
       /t - List ALL files & attribute settings.
       /w - WAIT! after 20 lines printed to screen 
            for key-press.
       /y - YES auto KILL/erase files. (KILL-batch)
       /z - Send DOS EoF to screen.
       /1 - Search ONLY sub-dir named!
       /5 - add space after every FIVE files found.

       To use the /b switch type:         
                      findf d:fat /b >tmp.bat

     The batch file will have the following in it:

     md %3\SUB1
     %1 %2\SUB1\FATSO.FLE%4 %3\SUB1 %5
     md %3\SUB1\SUB2
     %1 %2\SUB1\SUB2\XYZFATGH.EXT%4 %3\SUB1\SUB2 %5

    Then by typing:  tmp copy a: b: ? /v

    you can copy the file from the A: drive to the
    B: drive in the correct sub-directory with the
    verify switch on (/v).

       If the sub-directory can not be created the
    file will not be copied. (Unless the sub-dir
    already exists on the target drive.)

    NOTE: It should be noted that, if one uses the
          /p & /b switches together, one can use
          the created BATCH file to copy EVERY-
          THING from all directories from one disk 
          to another.

    Example: findf *.* /p /b >Dupdisk.bat

    /k - this switch will help create a BATCH file
         to help ERASE files & REMOVE sub-dirs.

    /y - YES auto erase of files with file: "Y".

             display back to the normal color mode
             of 80 characters x 25 lines.

     This program was written because Pmenu has a 
     "/4s" switch that switches to the 40 character 
     wide screen mode & saves it.

    If you use the /4s switch of Pmenu then one of 
    the options in your mainmenu should be 
    something like: X - Exit

     Where X.BAT would simply be: mode80

     In this way when you are done using the 40x25
     mode the X option will use Mode80 to switch 
     the screen back to color 80x25 mode.

     To switch back to monochrome 80x25 mode use:
     mode80 /m.

         a key to be pressed to continue its search.

      Esc - /w: When the /w switch is used & the 
        "To continue, press a key" statement is on 
        the screen then the Esc key can be pressed 
        to stop the program. In this case the rest 
        of the present data-block will be printed to 
        the screen.

     Pfind also sets the BATCH file ERRORLEVEL as
     follows:

         0-250 = The number of files found that
                 match the given criteria.

           251 = 251 or more items found.

     Pmenu was designed to be a comprehensive DOS
     level menu system.  It requires only one
     other file to operate, a BATCH file.


     There are a number of switches, they are:

     /4s - Screen set to 40 character mode, s =
           save this mode, option.

     /b - Beep switch to turn beep on.  Beep
          after menu printed.

     /c#,# - Print with colors: #-forgeround,
             #-background

     /e - Errorlevel display.  Shows EL of key
          pressed.

     /fAB - Find Char 'A' then start printing
            text, end at 'B'

     /klLaA- Keys, in pairs, for EL's.  EL 0 = l
             or L, EL 1 = a or A.

     /n - Never mind, Do Not wait for key input.

     /o - Turn off the Copyright notice 2 second
          delay.

     /p#,# - Position cursor at: #-line,
             #-column. Turns cursor ON.

     /s - Print an extra line feed between each
          line printed.

     /w    - Working, Please wait... displayed.

     NOTE: the /f - find switch does not need to
           be used.  However, if it is not used,
           the pmenu does NOT clear the screen
           (it leaves what was placed on the 
           screen there) and simply awaits a key
           press and passes the errorlevel to the
           controlling BATCH file.

     This program prints ASCII text files. It will
     print a header that contains the following:

     file_name      date     time           page #

     The program switches are:

          /af- Print a regular address, F-FormFeed
               option.
          /b - Begin printing other than page 1.
          /c#- # of lines to print per page.
        /chp - Chop long lines to /m# length.
        /cnt - COUNT the pages and #lines on last 
               page, NO printing!
      /cpy## - Print ## copies of this file.
          /h - High order ASCII bit turned off.
          /l - Replace all Low codes with SPACE.
     /lr,#,# - print to #, skip to # - 20 pairs.
         /m# - More chars per line - 128. # - 
               option, designate number of chars.
          /n - Numbering of each Line on.
         /nss- No Starting Spaces
         /nff- No Last Form-Feed sent to printer.
          /o - Turns the header printing Off. No
               header will be printed.
          /p - Bottom Page numbering on.
     /prt#.# - Text print code, Header print code.
          /r - Print a return address.
        /scn - Title lines to screen, positioning.
          /t - Prints tabs as is, no space replace.
      /tls## - ## lines = titls print on each page.
          /w - Wait after each page printed.

     To use the program type:

                pprint file_name.ext
                pprint file_name.ext /o /p

     The switches can be in any order.  In the
     above examples the first call will print the
     file "file_name.ext" with a header.


                       - 1 -

            -----  PPRINT Documentation  -----

     The second call will print the file with NO
     header & with page numbering at the bottom.

                pprint file_name.ext /t

     The above call will print the file with a
     header but with all TAB's sent to the
     printer as TAB's.

       To print the return address & then the 
     regular address on an envelope do the 
     following:

              pprint file.name1 /r
              pprint file.name2 /a

       Where file.name1 is the name of the file 
     that is composed of ONLY the RETURN address 
     to be printed on an envelope. 
     
       File.name2 is then the file containing
     ONLY the address to send the letter to.

       A batch file could be created to print
     both address. One way to do it would be to 
     but the following into a batch file called 
     "envelope.bat":
                        pprint my.id /r
                        pprint %1 /a

       This would always use the "my.id" file for 
     the return address & would allow an input for 
     the regular address. 

     By typing:   envelope your.add 

     The batch file would print the address
     contained in the "your.add" file as the
     regular address.

                 it simply type:
     
                            prtcode c1 c2 c3 ... c9
     
      As many codes can be sent as needed - up to 
      the DOS command line limit.
     
                 Example: prtcode 27 63 55
     
      This example sends the condensed code to an

     PRTLBL:    To use the print label program type:
     
            prtlbl filename.ext [codes] [switches]

      In place of "filename.ext" use the file name
      that you want to print. In place of the 
      "codes" you can put printer codes. These 
      might be used to change the printer fonts.

      In place of "switches" you can set the
      following:
                                           Default
      /b## - Beginning Label number.           1

      Codes & switch settings are optional & need
      NOT be used.
     
           Example: prtlbl lst 29
     
      This example will print out the entire "lst"
      file on labels on an OKIDATA 82a printer in
      its small print mode.
     
      Example: prtlbl lst 29 /b25 /e35 /l7 /c25
     
      This example does the same thing, except it 

      Begins printing with label  25 .

      It ends printing after label 35.

      There are 7 lines between the top of one 
      label to the top of the next.
      
      And last, it only prints 25 characters per 
      line.

          -----  PRTLBL  Documentation  -----

     

     There are two things that will stop the
     printing, they are:


        1. the end of the file, the last character
           should be a '*' as in:
                        *
                        line
                        line
                        line
                        *


        2. the word "end" as the next word after
           an '*', as in:
                        *
                        end
                        *


         If you put this end at the end of your 
         label list, then the program will print:



         end

         ## labels printed



         on the last label printed & space it up 
         for the next label.

            -----  PSND   Documentation  -----



       Psnd will sound a tone.  This could be
     helpful when writing BATCH files.  By
     putting psnd at the end of a batch file it
     will sound a tone to indicate that it is
     done.


     Switches:  /l# - will sound the tone longer.
                      for #-seconds, if no #
                      given then 2 seconds will
                      be used.  
                      
                /o - turns off the printing to
                     the screen of the psnd
                     information.

               
               
               
               
               

     Use:  psnd 500 /l


       In the above example a tone of 500 Hz will 
     sound for about 2 seconds.


       Tones may be from 50 to 13000 Hz.


    NOTE: Max time allowed is 32676.9 seconds.



    Tone 600 is a good input question type tone and 
    tone 60 is a good ERROR tone on all computers.

       ----------- PSORT - Documentation ---------


       Psort was written in order to sort blocks
       of data.  A "block" of data is a set of
       ASCII lines located between two "*"
       markers.  One above the block & one below
       it.  For an example see the Pfind
       documentation page #2.

    NOTE: Pfind, Finda & Psort can create the
          above type of "block" oriented data
          files.  Pfind & Psort will only operate
          on this type of a file.  Finda will
          work on any Mostly ASCII file from most
          any word processor.

    To Use: psort filename (switches) ( >newfile )

    Switches:
              /c## - ## is the character to start
                     sorting at (1-80).  

              /d - Delimiter "*" sent between blocks of data. 

              /l# - # of line to sort against (1-9). 

              /o - Beep On.  Beeps sound when
              file opened, lines sorted &
              last when blocks are sorted. 
              (default is OFF).  

              /r - Reverse Sort.  (z --> A).  

              /s## - Sort the
              Selected Section of 600 data
              blocks.  

              /z - Send DOS End Of File
              marker at end of data blocks.

       ----------- PSORT - Documentation ---------


     Limits: 

     1.  Only 600 blocks of data can be sorted at
         a time.

     2.  Only one of the first nine (9) lines in
         a data block can be used to for the
         sorting.

     3.  If a data block has fewer lines than
         called to sort on then the last line of
         the block is used.

     4.  If two lines to sort are identical, only
         the first block containing that line
         will ever be found.  Add a space to one
         of the lines.

AS  OF  RELEASE 3.40

     -------------------  Changes / Additions  -------------------

New programs:

	DSD - This program uses DELE and deletes all files and removes all
	      empty sub-directories from the named sub-directory down. 
	      (File name or part, date and question switches can be used.)

	LOG:  This program keeps a log file (called: "LOG") of every time it 
	      is run.  It will normally request a password from the user and 
	      if it is not correct it will lock up the computer so that it 
	      must be re-booted.  It can also be used in BATCH files (like 
	      AUTOEXEC.BAT) and along with the Advanced Menu System (also by 
	      Circle Software) to allow only qualified persons access to 
	      various sections of the hard disk.

	CHKFILE:  This program (in conjunction with DSPTXT also on your 
	          Pfind Utilities disk) and the DOS program: CHKDSK will
	          allow you to check your disk for unlinked files/clusters
	          view the files found & created by CHKDSK (these files are
	          named: FILE0000.CHK - FILE9999.CHK), delete them and/or
	          rename them for later use.

additions:

	FINDA/PFIND - both of these program now have a /h - hi-light 
	              switch.  When used, the line that has a match with
	              the given word(s) is hi-lighted in inverse video
	              (blabk letters on white.)

	PSND: /l#.# - The long switch can now time a tone (or sequecne 
	              of tones) to a 10TH of a second.  More than one tone
	              may be listed on the psnd command line.  Tones are 
	              no longer set by a tone number but are the actual
	              frequency in Hz. Tones may be from 50 to 13000 Hz.

          EXAMPLE: psnd 700 /l1.5 would play a tone of 700 Hz for about
                   1.5 seconds.  Fractions of seconds are approximately
                   1/10 second.  (max time allowed: 32767.9 sec or
                   about 9 hrs.)  (NOTE: the computer is locked-up while
                   a tone is playing!)


	FINDF: /1 - new switch to force a search of only the driv and 
	            sub-directory named.

	       /t - new switch to find ALL files even SYSTEM or HIDDEN
	            files and list out their set ATTRIBUTES.

	       /f - Find the FREE bytes on a disk only.


	PCOMP: /l - List to disk all non-matches found. (This list can then 
	            be viewed later from file: "NOMATCH")

	       /n - No pause when non-match found. (Good to use in 
	            conjunction with /l above.)


Changes: 

	FINDF - no longer searches from the ROOT directory down unless told
	        to do so.  Now it searches from the present directory down
	        if no directory was given. (This is now true of all the
	        seaching programs: FINDF, FINDA...)

     ----------------------  NEW  Additions  ---------------------

*** NEW PROGRAM(S) ***

FE - Front End.  Use this to add Circle Software file finding methods 
     to any other program.

   Switches:  /q  - Question each operation to be performed. 
              /a  - ALL PATHS SEARCHED!
              /d  - Date switch, form: /d?YYMMDD  for July 14, 1987 and
                    above it would be: /da870714
                    ? == a (above) - b (below) indicator. 
                    If two dates are given (above = & below =) then only files
                    with dates between & = to these dates will be found.
              /e  - Extension name search/match only.
              /p  - Program to pass this stuff to switch.
                    FORM: /p prgm-name [[any switches]]  EVERYTHING after /p
                    is passed to the program to be run be FE.

     -------------------  Changes / Additions  -------------------



CHANGE: All date matching routines in all the finding programs now match
        between dates, dates are inclusive.

                           ATS      
                           DELE     
                           DT       
                           FE       
                           FINDA    
                           FINDF    
                           PCOMP    
                           PCOPY    

CHANGE: All programs that use to sound a tone to get your attention have
        been changed to use the same tone independent of the computer they
        are run on.  Tones have been standardized as well for "finding" or
        errors.  A find generates Tone(500,1). An error beep is Tone(150,5)
        and closing a file is a "click".   These programs are:

                             file     date   version
                            COUNT.C   9/15    1.02
                           DSPTXT.C   9/15    2.33
                            FIND_.C   9/15    5.01
                            FINDA.C   9/12    5.20
                            FINDL.C   9/15    1.11
                              LOG.C   9/16    1.11
                            PFIND.C   9/15    9.02
                            PMENU.C   9/18    
                           PRTLBL.C   9/15    4.12
                            PSORT.C   9/15    1.41
                           RUN_IT.C   9/15    1.21



   Also added /a (search ALL paths) or /1 (search only this path) switches
   to the following:

                           ATS      C * /a ALL paths (or /p)
                           DELE     C * /a ALL paths
                           DT       C * /a ALL paths
                           FE       C * /a ALL paths
                           FINDA    C * /1 this path only switch
                           FINDF    C * /1 this path only switch
                           PCOMP    C * /a ALL paths
                           PCOPY    C * /a ALL paths

   /a - The ALL paths switch will continue searching from the present
        path (if no path was specified) or from the specified path to
        all sub- directories of this path.

   /1 - The ONE path switch will cause the present search to end after
        the present path has been searched (if no path was specified)
        or after the specified path was searched.

New Switch:

   PCOPY & PCOMP: /f - Force file switch.  This switch forces the search
                       to look for files and ignor the possibility that the
                  drive:\path\name entered was in fact a valid sub-directory
                  path.  (This was needed because PCOPY and PCOMP now look 
                  first for the source being a valid path.)


*** BUGS FIXED ***

   FINDF:   Fixed bug in version 6.50.  Every now and then findf 6.50
            would NOT find correctly something like:

     findf c:\code\abc     (this would only find abc*.* files!)


   Added  /m (more lines on screen)
          /mv   and
          /m##  switches 
   where: /m = 43 line EGA mode, /mv = 50 line VGA mode and
          /m## is for any future ##-number of lines.

   Added the /5 switch to print a blank line between every 5 files found.

   Added the BETWEEN dates searching ability.  To find all files in 
   September of 1989 use:  

                     findf *.* /da890901 /db890930  

   Dates are inclusive.



   PCOPY:   Fixed bug in version 3.70.  Pcopy no longer would allow
            formatting a disk.  Corrected in version 3.71.



AS  OF  RELEASE 3.60

     ----------------------  NEW  Additions  ---------------------

*** NEW PROGRAM(S) ***

CDD - Change Drive and directory in one operation.

      Also, it will do its best to find the path given, even if only a
      partial path was given.

      It first attempts to change to the desired directory from where 
      you presently are.  If it can not do this, it moves down one path 
      at a time and tries at each path to switch to the desired path.
      If the desired path id NOT found, CDD will reaches the ROOT 
      directory.  Now, CDD will initiate a complete search for the 
      unfound path.

      EXAMPLE:   to switch to \WP\MY\DOC  from \WP\MY\LETTERS\WORK

                 type:  CDD doc (RETURN)

      (This assumes that a sub-directory : \WP\MY\LETTERS\DOC does NOT
       exist.)

      SWITCH: /a - search and make a list of all matching paths found.


FK -  Fast Key. Allows one to change the delay and repatition rate when
      a key is help down. 
                           FORM: fk rep-rate delay

      The rep-rate is one of: 5/10/15/20/25/30  repatations per second.

      The delay is one of: 1/2/3/4  which are quarter second intervals.



*** BUGS FIXED ***

PFIND - the /a - display only the address lines switch was disfunctional.

DELE -  would ignor the last character of a contiguous character set sent 
        to search for.

*** ADDITIONS *** 

ats: Version 1.40

    Will now display any sub-directory that has special attributes set
    and will allow changing these attributes if the /d - directory
    switch is used.


dsptxt: Version 2.40

    New switch /b - banner.  This hi-lights the first line of the displayed
    text file IF the /a# above protect switch is also in use.


fe:  Version 1.10

    New switch: /s - switch to each sub-directory where a match was found.

 
findf: Version 6.60

	Fixed bug in version 5.60.  Every now and then findf 5.60 would
	NOT find correctly something like: 

	  findf c:\code\abc     (this would only find abc*.* files!)

	Added  /m (more lines on screen)
	       /mv   and
	       /m##  switches 
	where: /m = 43 line EGA mode, /mv = 50 line VGA mode and
	       /m## is for any future ##-number of lines.

	Added the /5 switch to print a blank line between every 5 files found.

	Added the BETWEEN dates searching ability.  To find all files in 
	September of 1989 use:  

	                  findf *.* /da890901 /db890930  

	Dates are inclusive.


pcopy: Version 2.80
pcomp: Version 1.80

           /b - beep: Pcopy and pcomp now have a beep switch which will
                      sound when they are done with their jobs, /b.

           /h - here: Copy (compare) from source to here (target) do NOT
                      make paths if /a-all switch used, do not compare to
                      all paths, only to the target given.
