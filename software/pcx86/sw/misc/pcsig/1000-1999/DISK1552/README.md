## Information about "LOTTO MAGIC WHEEL"

    One of the most effective ways to play the lottery is to "wheel" a set
    of numbers.  Wheeling numbers involves playing a large selection of
    numbers and combining them into bets to cover all or most of the
    possible combinations of numbers.  This produces the widest possibility
    of having some kind of a winning ticket.  Serious lotto players have
    known about this for years.  Unfortunately, setting up your own
    wheeling
    system can be very tedious work, especially if you play several
    lotteries.
    
    That's where LOTTO MAGIC WHEEL and your computer come to the rescue.
    They will take the drudgery and guesswork out of wheeling numbers and
    provide sophisticated selection techniques such as balanced sets,
    odd/even distribution, number range selection and Key number usage.
    These selections are appropriate for any PICK-5, -6 or -7 lottery.
    
    Now you can concentrate on the important things -- such as how to spend
    your winnings.
