## Information about "BIG THREE  DISK 2 OF 2 (1925 ALSO)"

    In this WWII strategy game you control all the action from the desolate
    fjords of Norway to the scorching sands of Egypt, from the strategic
    Rock of Gibraltar to the frozen streets of Moscow.  Recreate the epic
    and fiercely fought battles of Tobruk and Stalingrad.  Decide to open
    your second front in Normandy or the "soft underbelly" of Europe
    (Italy).  Build bombers to hit your opponent's cities or build tanks and
    fighters to encircle and destroy his armies at the front.
    
    Detailed maps done in excellent graphics help you track your progress
    and plan strategy.  Each player assumes supreme command of the Axis,
    Allied or Soviet forces in Europe during 1939-1945.  Players who
    perform better than their historical counterparts will normally win, and
    those who under-perform will normally lose.  Mouse and/or joystick(s)
    are recommended but not required.

	     BIG THREE copyright (c) 1989 by SDJ Enterprises, Inc.

				Version 1.02
	I. GETTING STARTED

           Printing the Rules:

              The complete BIG THREE rules (v.102) are included in the
              file RULES102.DOC. They are in standard ASCII format and
              may be printed out using any word processing program  or
              with the following directions:

              1) Boot up DOS version 2.0 or higher.
              2) Put Start-Up Disk into default drive.
	      3) Turn on printer and align paper to top of page.
              4) Press the Ctrl and Print Screen keys simultaneously
                 to activate printer.
              5) Key in TYPE RULES102.DOC at the DOS prompt.
              6) Press Enter.

	      The rules fit nicely onto standard 8.5 by 11 inch paper.

           Reading the Rules:

	      The rules are 28 pages  long  but  experienced  wargamers
              shouldn't  have any trouble reading through them quickly.
              For less experienced players,   I  suggest  skimming  the
              rules first then playing the game, then reading the rules
              more carefully.   Keep  in  mind  that  you don't have to
              remember all the rules, the computer will.  The rules are
              more or less for documentation and reference purposes.

           Single and Double Disk Drive Users:

              1) Boot up DOS version 2.0 or higher.
              2) Put Start-Up Disk into default drive.
              3) Type BIGTHREE. Press Enter.
              4) See RULES102.DOC, section 1.2 to continue.

           Hard Disk Users:

              1) Boot up DOS version 2.0 or higher.
              2) Copy Start-Up and Game Disk onto hard disk.
              3) Make sure hard disk is the default drive.
              4) Type BIGTHREE. Press Enter.
              5) See RULES102.DOC, section 1.2 to continue.

        II. HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

           IBM(tm) PC and 100% Compatibles
           CGA, EGA or VGA graphics card
           512K memory
           Mouse and/or Joystick(s) are recommended but not required.

        III. REGISTRATION

           For your convenience, a blank registration form is included
           in the file REGISTER.DOC.    It is in standard ASCII format
           and may be printed out using any word processing program or
           with the following directions:

              1) Boot up DOS version 2.0 or higher.
              2) Put Start-Up Disk into default drive.
              3) Turn On Printer.  Align paper.
              4) Press the Ctrl and Print Screen keys simultaneously
