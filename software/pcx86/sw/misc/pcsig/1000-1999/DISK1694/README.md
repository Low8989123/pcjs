## Information about "FORMGEN'S DISK DUPLICATOR"

    Need to make many copies of the same diskette and serialize them at the
    same time?  DISK DUPLICATOR is the program that can do it.
    
    With DISK DUPLICATOR, format, write, and verify can be done in one
    pass.  Both format and verify can be turned off if needed, for
    preformatted disks and for maximum speed.  An audible alarm even
    signals for disk change.
    
    DISK DUPLICATOR is excellent for making distribution copies of
    diskettes.  Serial numbers can be added to the disks for registration
    purposes.  DISK DUPLICATOR supports both high and low density 5.25" and
    3.5" diskettes.

                                   =========
    |
    | "Shareware" is a term used to describe a system for distribution
    | of software.  Under the shareware concept, software may be freely
    | copied and passed along to others, or distributed through bulletin
    | board systems, etc.
    |
    | As a recipient of a shareware program, you may use the software
    | for a short trial period to determine if it meets your needs.  If
    | it does, you pay the registration fee.  By paying the fee, you are
    | granted the right to retain the software for your use.  If the
    | software is not suitable, then you may discard it.
    |
    | The shareware system provides substantial benefits the computing
    | community (of which YOU are a member):
    |
    | 1) You get to try out the software BEFORE you buy it so you know
    |    exactly what you're buying.
    |
    | 2) Shareware is substantially less expensive than most commercial
    |    programs.  You don't pay for costly marketing programs and
    |    fancy packaging.
    |
    | 3) You get access to a MUCH broader base of available programs.
    |    Thousands of excellent programs have been written by expert
    |    programmers who would never consider marketing commercially.
    |    Through the concept of shareware, these people make their
    |    programs available to the community.  Usually, all they ask in
    |    return is a small fee to reward them for the time and effort
    |    they've put into the program.
    |
    | The system is based entirely on the honor system, and generally
    | works quite well.  (Most people are honest and wouldn't violate
    | the trust placed in them by the author of the software.)
    |
    | Shareware is NOT free software - the author counts on your integrity.
    | Please register using the form the end of this manual.
    |
    | You are encouraged to copy this software and pass it along to
    | others who may be interested in using it.
    |
    | This program is produced by a member of the Association of Shareware
    | Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure that the shareware
    | principle works for you.  If you are unable to resolve a shareware
    | related problem with an ASP member by contacting the member directly,
    | ASP may be able to help.  The ASP Ombudsman can help you resolve a

     DUP 5.1                 Disk Duplication Utility                 Quick Doc
                             ========================
                             (C)1988-90 - R.MacLean
    |
    |
    |  DUP is a duplication utility intended for use by small firms for
    |  the creation of distribution disks for their software.
    |
    |  It features a simple and informative user interface, and a number of
    |  unique and valuable features:
    |
    |        - audible signal for disk change
    |        - format, write and verify in one pass
    |        - format may turned off for pre-formatted disks
    |        - verify may be turned off for maximum speed
    |        - option to increment serial numbers during production
    |        - ability to read an entire master disk into a compressed
    |          image file, eliminating the need to read the master disk
    |          at the beginning of each duplicating session
    |        - multi-disk copying & autoloader control
    |
    |
    |                                  Setup
    |                                  =====
    |
    |  Before you can use DUP for the first time you MUST set it up for
    |  your particular system configuration.  If you have a 286 or 386
    |  machine, you may simply delete the supplied configuration file
    |  DUP.DRV.  DUP will automatically determine the number and type
    |  of drives in your system.  If you have a PC or XT class machine,
    |  or if you want to override the automatic configuration, will have
    |  to edit DUP.DRV to match your system configuration.
    |
    |  DUP.DRV contains a series of numbers separated by commas.  The first
    |  number represents the number of the last floppy drive in the system.
    |  (ie. A:=1, B:=2, C:=3, D:=4, E:=5, etc.)  Following this, there is
    |  a number representing the type of each drive (regardless of whether
    |  there is actually a corresponding drive in the system) from A: up to
    |  the last floppy.  The drive type numbers should be set as follows:
    |
    |        0 - hard drive or drive not present
    |        1 - 360K 5 1/4" floppy
    |        2 - 1.2M 5 1/4" floppy
    |        3 - 720K 3 1/2" floppy
    |        4 - 1.4M 3 1/2" floppy
    |  ie.
    |    if your system has a 360K 5 1/4" floppy as A:,a 360K 5 1/4" floppy
    |    as B:, C: is a hard disk, and a 720K 3 1/2" as D:, then your
    |    DUP.DRV file should contain:
    |
    |           4,1,1,0,3    (4 drives,360K,360K,hard disk,720K)
    |
    |  The file can be modified using your favorite text editor.
    |

    |
    |  READ (an original disk)
    |
    |    Prompts for the source drive, and then displays a list of disk
    |    images previously read.  If the disk has not previously been
    |    read into the system, select NEW FILE and enter an appropriate
    |    filename.  If a previous version of the disk is already present,
    |    simply highlight the name of the older image, and press return.
    |    The older image will be updated from the diskette.
    |
    |
    |  DISPLAY (serial number on a disk)
    |
    |    Prompts for the source drive, and then displays a list of disk
    |    images previously read.  It will then read and display the
    |    serial number stored on the disk in the selected drive.  This
    |    allows you to check the serial number on a produced disk.
    |
    |
    |  OPTIONS (set general disk options)
    |
    |    Allows the setting of the various system options.
    |
    |    Format... When ON will format each track prior to writing it,
    |              allowing the use of blank diskettes without the
    |              need to process them prior to software duplication.
    |
    |    Verify... When ON verifies the CRC for the track after each
    |              write.  This is a good check for media flaws but
    |              takes a little more time.
    |
    |    Serial #. When ON will a serial number in each disk that is
    |              produced.
    |              Several parameters must be set before this will
    |              work properly:
    |
    |    Data..... Retrieves the standard options that are stored with
    |              each master image, allowing you to modify them.
    |
    |    Mode..... Switches serial number mode between Automatic
    |              (where the system assigns an incremental serial
    |              number to each disk produced), and Manual (where
    |              the operator is prompted to enter each serial number
    |              as the disks are produced).

    |              modify them.
    |
    |    Get S/N.. Searches a master disk for the location of a
    |              particular serial number string.
    |
    |    Track.... Allows you to set the track where the serial number
    |              is to be placed
    |
    |    Cyl...... Allows you to set the side where the serial number
    |              is to be placed
    |
    |    Sector... Allows you to set the sector where the serial number
    |              is to be placed
    |
    |    Position. Allows you to set the position where the serial number
    |              is to be placed
    |
    |    Last #... Allows you to set the last recorded serial number.
    |              The serial number of the next disk produced will have
    |              a serial number one higher than this.
    |
    |
    |  COMPRESSION (enable/disable data compression)
    |
    |    This option allows you to disable the data compression used
    |    when storing master images on the hard disk.

     DUP 5.1                     Serial Numbers                       Quick Doc
                                 ==============
    |
    |  The serial number is a 10 character ASCII string imbedded in one of
    |  the larger files of the production software system.
    |
    |  The steps for imbedding a serial number are as follows:
    |
    |      1) Write a 10 character dummy serial number string into your
    |         main program or other disk file.  I recommend using
    |         "12345600A0" as this is the default that DUP searches for.
    |      2) Set the Compression option ON now - once the master is
    |         read, changing it will have no effect for this particular
    |         image.
    |      3) Read the master disk into an image file.
    |      4) Set the Serial Number Option ON.  (Options menu)
    |      5) Use the search function to scan the master disk and locate
    |         the position where the serial number is stored.  (Serial menu)
    |      6) Use the Last function to set the serial number to the last
    |         number copied (one less than the number you desire to be
    |         embedded in the NEXT copy to be produced).
    |
    |  The serial number routines are intended for use by KNOWLEDGEABLE
    |  PC users.  These routines expect accurate data and no attempt
    |  is made to verify input validity.  Inserting a serial number
    |  indiscriminately WILL make duplicated disks unusable.
    |
    |
    |                             RAM Buffer Option
    |                             =================
    |
    |  To speed the duplication of 360K disks (especially when the data
    |  compression option is used), you can set DUP to retain an image of
    |  the master disk in RAM.  This means that instead of reading the
    |  image track by track for every copy, DUP will read it only once
    |  and then make as many copies as you want without delay.
    |
    |  Your system will need to have 640K of RAM with at least 500K
    |  available to use this option.
    |
    |  To activate it, start DUP by typing:
    |
    |          DUP /R
    |
    |
    |                          Special Acknowledgement
    |                          =======================
    |
    |   Many thanks to Chip Rabinowitz at Innovative Data Concepts
    |   for both the idea and the assembly code for the data compression.
    |   Thanks to his contribution and assistance, we can enjoy a
    |   substantial reduction in the hard drive space used by our master
    |   images.

Author Registration: $25.00                                             
Special Requirements: None.                                             
                                                                        
Need to make many copies of the same diskette, and serialize them at    
the same time?  DISK DUPLICATOR is the program that can do it.          
                                                                        
With DISK DUPLICATOR, format, write, and verify can be done in one pass.
Both format and verify can be turned off if needed, for preformatted    
disks and for maximum speed.  An audible alarm even signals for disk    
change.                                                                 
                                                                        
DISK DUPLICATOR is excellent for the person, or business, that needs to 
make distribution copies of diskettes.  Serial numbers can be added to  
the disks for registration purposes.  DISK DUPLICATOR supports both high
and low density 5 1/4" and 3 1/2" diskettes.

DUP - Disk Duplication Utility
==============================

Category: Utilities / Disk Copying

DUP is a package which considerably speeds the duplication of disks.
Master images are stored on your hard drive, but data compession saves
valuable space.  After this, copies can be produced at lightning speed.
Multi-disk option lets you use up to ten drives at once!  Produced disks
can be serialized at your option.  Many options, excellent user interface,
full status screen.  Very powerful, yet easy to use!  If you ever need
to make multiple copies of disks, DUP will make it quick and easy.
Shareware [ASP MEMBER]  Auth/Upl: R.MacLean

Unique features:
 - stores master images on hard drive
 - image compression option for master images
 - full screen status/information display
 - compatible with all disk capacities (360K, 720K, 1.2M, 1.44M)
 - multi-drive mode uses up to ten floppy drives
 - built in autoloader support
 - fast copy times
 - disk serialization option
 - Lotus style menus

No other system has all these features, or is as easy to use!
