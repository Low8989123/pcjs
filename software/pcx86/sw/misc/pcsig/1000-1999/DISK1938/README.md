## Information about "GAMES FOR EGA"

    If you like computer games, you'll like EGA GAMES, with arcade quality
    graphics and playing style.  EGA GAMES includes BlackJack, Poker, pac-
    man style Squasher, and a 3D version of TicTacToe.
    
    Choose BlackJack and play with realistic looking cards.  This version
    can improve your playing skills before your next trip to the casinos.
    Poker Square is a new variation of the traditional 5 card stud game.
    Each player has 5 hands and must place each card carefully in order to
    win this one.  Squasher is a pac-man style game that combines action and
    strategy to retrieve the pots of gold before the monsters squash you.
    3D TicTacToe is a variation of the original TicTacToe which opens up
    many more winning strategies.
