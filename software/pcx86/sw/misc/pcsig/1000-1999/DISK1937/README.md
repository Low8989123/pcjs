## Information about "XTAB"

    If you're using dBase and compatible database systems but require
    advanced analytical reports and graphs, XTAB can help. XTAB is a
    statistical package to directly access dBase III-compatible files.
    
    XTAB features multiple regression and correlation, frequency analysis
    and crosstabulation, descriptive statistics, and graphics. XTAB also
    features on-line Help and pop-up menus as part of an interface
    designed for the dBase user. It is compatible with data files created
    by dBase III, dBase IV, Foxbase+, Clipper, dbXL, and other programs
    using .DBF files.
    
    Since the interface is based on dBase, a dBase user can meet his/her
    statistical analysis needs without having to learn how to use a new
    program. Analytical variables can be fields, or they may be complex
    dBase expressions. Note that keyboard entry is not possible. .DBF data
    files are needed to operate the program.
