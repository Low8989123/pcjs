## Information about "CONSTRUCTION ESTIMATOR AND MORE"

    At last! An easy to use construction estimation program. This program
    is unlike all others, it actually calculates the cost and the quantities
    that are needed to order materials.
    
    For the home handyman and amateur builder who likes to tackle major
    projects, CONSTRUCTION ESTIMATOR provides a menu-driven aid for
    estimating building project costs.
    
    There are 12 common estimation calculations to choose from: concrete
    footings, stem walls, and floor slabs; block and wood walls; ceiling and
    floor joists; roof sheeting; rafters; sheetrock and wallsiding.
    Hardcopy of cost totals can be obtained by using the print command.
    Estimates can be converted to spreadsheet or ASCII files.
    
    BANKER is a financial program that computes just about anything
    involving loans, savings, bonds, securities, and credit.  Surpassing the
    needs of most laymen, BANKER meets the majority of computational needs
    of the finance professional.  It computes commercial and installment
    loans, savings, etc., and provides information and definitions of
    various financial instruments.
    
    Under commercial and installment loans, you find the payment per
    period,
    compute the principal, annual percentage rate, and find early payoff
    amounts (rule of 78's).  Savings information includes the time required
    to save a given amount, nominal-to-effective rates, and interest on
    savings.  General applications are present value (simple interest),
    present value (compound interest), and the present value of an annuity
    in advance.
    
    Bonds and securities calculations offered are:  the yield of
    discounted securities, yield-periodic interest payments, yield-interest
    at maturity, future value (compound interest), future value of an
    annuity, and a comparison of interest to discount rate.
    
    STOCK tracks an unlimited number of stock portfolio files with up to 200
    entries each.  You fill out basic information, and the program generates
    loss or gain figures and annual and total percent value changes.  Record
    keeping and evaluation meets most personal information needs, including
    tracking data required for income tax filing.
