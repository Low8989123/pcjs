## Information about "BSR"

    Transfer files back and forth between computers using different sizes
    of disk drives; e.g., between laptop 3.5" disk drives and desktop 5.25"
    drives.  BSR is particularly handy in situations where you don't have
    copies of the .EXE program on both 3.5" and 5.25" media.  BASIC versions
    of the Send and Receive programs are included and can be typed into both
    computers relatively quickly.  Then all that's needed is a version of
    BASIC to run the Send and Receive programs.

## BSBR.DOC

```
After purchasing a laptop computer (NEC Multispeed EL - I love it), I
wanted a quick and easy way to send files from the laptop to another
PC using the null-modem cable included with the laptop. I happen to have
a 3 1/2 inch drive on my 'main' PC, but I wanted to be prepared for those
times when I am visiting a client or friend, and he doesn't.

There are a number of 'bridge' products out there, but they all assume
that you carry a 5 1/4" disk as well as a 3 1/2" everywhere you go. What
I wanted was a simple BASIC program that could be typed in to the 'host'
computer in five minutes or less, that would allow multiple file transfer
with error correction.

It must be easy to run, and designed for direct connection between the PC
and the laptop (no modems). The programs must also be short, so they don't
take up too much room on the laptop's system disk.

The following two programs are the result of these design criteria. They
work together to send data from the laptop to the host PC. (To send data
back the other way, send the 'BS.BAS' program to the host and run it there.)

If you don't have a way to copy media from 5 1/4" to 3 1/2" floppies,
these programs may do the trick for you. They can be a lifesaver in those
special situations where you need file transfer fast. They are extremely
simple to set up and run. They don't cost a dime, as long as you have
BASICA or GWBASIC on each PC.

You can transfer any file or program with this utility, including COM,
EXE, and DBF files, as well as word processing files.

If you need to do daily file transfer of large files, or you need to
call in over a modem, get yourself a professional 'bridging' product.
But for occasional or short file transfers, these programs should do
the trick.

The limitations of these programs are obvious and straightforward. You
can't do MS-DOS commands from one PC to the other, like some software
does. Transferred files do not retain the original file date and time.
All control is from the sending PC side. The software runs at 38400
baud, but since BASIC only uses strings up to 255 characters, it isn't
real fast.

Since you will probably be running this software with the PCs side
by side, these limitations should not be irksome.

These programs may also be a helpful 'first step' in connecting your
laptop to a host PC, so you can see how feasible the process itself is.
Once you have decided whether to use a 'bridging' product or add a
3 1/2" disk drive to your host, you can forget these programs (until
you are out on the road somewhere and need them at a client's office).

Keep in mid also that professional 'bridging' programs run at up to
38,400 baud (some even faster). This is four times as fast as the effective
throughput of these programs.

At the current speed, direct connect, you will probably never see a trans-
mission error. If you do, you may need to slow down your turbo processor,
or even check out your COM port.  The software will retry error transmiss-
ions up to 10 times (change the IF statement in the sending program if you
want to alter this number).

These programs are set up for COM port 1. If one or the other PC needs to
be COM2, change just that program. Change the line near the beginning of
the program that says CML=1 to CML=2.

If you like the idea of these programs but hate to type, send me $20
(cash or check) and I will send you both programs on BOTH a 3 1/2" and
a 5 1/4" disk. I will also include printed documentation and a layout
for the null-modem cable (both 9 pin and 25-pin versions). I'll also
include our shareware BSR.EXE that transfers files at 115,200 baud.

If you haven't bought a laptop yet, you should strongly consider it.
Even if you only work at home 3 hours a week, the availability of the
laptop will pay for itself in less than a year. I would strongly urge
you to find a laptop with at least 2 720k disks (or one and a hard
drive), plus a parallel and serial port (even if it has an internal
modem). It also helps to have a video output port. If you have to pay
extra for these items, it can drive the cost way up.

To use these programs, type GWBASIC or BASICA at the MS-DOS prompt.
Type the BS.BAS program in on the computer you want to send data from.
Type the BR.BAS program in on the computer you want to receive data on.
Connect the serial port of the sending computer to the serial port of the
receiving computer with a null-modem cable (usually available from the
manufacturer of the laptop, or you can purchase one at any computer
store).

When you are typing in the programs, you don't have to type in the
comments (anything after a single-quote character on a line).

Be sure to SAVE "BS",A on the sending computer, and SAVE "BR",A on
the receiving computer, so you don't have to type the programs in
again. Then type RUN on each computer.

On the sending computer, type the file name of each file you want to send.
You can't use wildcards, but if you type in '=' instead of a file name,
the sending program will list the files in the current directory. When
you are through sending files, type a carriage-return (enter key), and
the program will terminate.

When you are done sending files, type SYSTEM at the GWBASIC prompt "Ok".
This will return you to MS-DOS on each system. The next time you want
to run each program, type GWBASIC BS on the sending computer, and
GWBASIC BR on the receiving computer.

Keep these programs on your laptop disk, and you will always have a way
to transfer files no matter where you are. This "low-tech" solution works
just fine for occasional file transfers and emergency situations.

Brad's Send/Receive Program (BSR.EXE, BS.BAS, BR.BAS)  Version 1.2

2-21-89

The only other thing your laptop needs is a bellybutton. (I haven't
seen mine in years!)

Do you need to transfer files between two PC's with different diskette
types? The programs in BSR.ARC make this process simple and fast. This
is great if you have a laptop with a 3-1/2" disk and a desktop with
5-1/4" - or any other two PCs.

To do this you need:

        1) a COM1 or COM2 port on each PC

        2) either

           a) a standard RS-232 cable with a null modem
              (a null modem is a little connector you can buy
               at most computer stores, Radio Shack, or INMAC)

           b) a null-modem cable (my laptop came with one - you can
              also buy these at computer stores or by mail).

Part of the problem with commercial "bridge" programs is that you have
to remember to take a 5-1/4" copy of the software with you everywhere
you go, or you will be sure to need it when you don't have it.

This system includes a small but powerful "bootstrap" program written in
GWBASIC or BASICA (the BASIC that comes with MS-DOS/PC-DOS). If you find
it necessary to do file transfer and you don't have your bridge program
with you, you can type in the receive program in 2 minutes , and send
any kind of data between PCs.

Complete documentation of these programs is in BSBR.DOC. The sending
program is BS.BAS, the receiving program is BR.BAS. They work on any
PC with a COM 1 or 2 serial port.

You can then transfer the faster BSR.EXE program to the receiving PC,
and transfer multiple files with wildcards at baud rates to 115200. It's
just as fast as most commercial bridge programs, using error correction,
automatic retransmit, variable packet sizes, and it copies the source
file date and time to the destination file.

BSR.EXE will transfer a mostly full (600K) diskette to a receiving PC's
hard drive in as little as 4 minutes, 30 seconds. Transfer time is de-
pendent on number of files and whether retransmit occurs. The clock speed
of your PC also matters, but not as much as you might think.

The BSR.EXE program is written in QuickBasic 4.0 (plus assembly for the
communications - BASIC communications are SLOOOOOOOOW!). This means you
must be using DOS 2.1 or later. We do not suggest using DOS 3.1 - it
seems to have BUGS in it.

You can speed up transfer time by copying the files to your laptop's
ramdisk, and transferring them from there.

The simplest use of BSR is to type

BSR R

on the receiving PC. (The HOST).

Then type

BSR S

on the sending PC (The REMOTE).

You can then upload files to the host by typing in the filename. MS-DOS
wildcard characters * and ? are also okay. When you have transferred all
the files, just press the Enter key at the file name prompt to end the
programs.

You can also send in batch mode by typing

BSR S <filename>

on the sending computer. You can use wildcards here also. For example

BSR S *.WKS

to send your worksheets to the host PC. BSR will stop itself after sending
files in batch mode (so it's easy to set up a .BAT file to do the transfer).

You can use disk drives (B:,C:,etc.) or subdirectories (B:\LOTUS\) on
the sending PC only. It will open the proper file, strip off the path,
and send the file to the receiving PC. The receiving PC always puts the
files into the current directory.

If you need to upload files into a directory (such as \WP) that does not
contain BSR.EXE, do a CD \WP, then start BSR.EXE by typing in its full
pathname (for example, if it is in the root directory, \BSR.EXE).

If you use this software, please send us $20 for it. We'll send you the
latest version of all three programs, plus PD utilities that we like
best. Send Cash, Check, MO, VISA, MC, or Amex. The address is below.
Yes, we send them on both 3-1/2" and 5-1/4" diskettes.

The following is the display screen that you get when you type

BSR is a utility for transferring files back and forth between computers
using different types of disk drives, e.g. between laptops using 3.5"   
disk drives and desktop models with 5.25" drives.  BSR is particularly  
handy in unexpected situations, when you don't have at hand copies of   
the .EXE program on both 3.5" and 5.25" media, because it includes      
BASIC versions of the "Send" and "Receive" programs which can be typed  
in a relatively short time.  Although the author's claim that the BASIC 
listings can be typed in 2 minutes each is an exaggeration, they are    
short enough to type in manually in a pinch.  Then, you simply need     
BASICA or GW-BASIC to run the BASIC listing.                            
                                                                        
BSR will be most useful to those who must occasionally transfer files   
between computers using different types of disk drives.  Although the   
transfer rates achieved by BSR are comparable to the best that          
commercially available programs offer, individuals or businesses        
frequently needing to transfer files probably should invest in an       
additional diskette drive in order to avoid the awkwardness of          
constantly connecting and disconnecting computers, or in a commercial   
program, which provides more facilities for transferring large numbers  
of files at the same time.                                              
                                                                        
BSR does seem to contain either a "bug" or an error checking deficiency.
While the program worked flawlessly transferring files from my laptop (a
DataVue Spark running DOS 2.1, with a 9-pin RS-232 port addressed as    
COM1) to my desktop (an AT clone running DOS 3.3 with a 23-pin RS-232   
port addressed as COM2), I was unable to effect transfers in the other  
direction.  As the desktop computer indicated that it was executing     
"retries", the laptop would indicate that it was receiving a file and   
indicate that it was receiving bytes far in excess of the size of the   
file being sent.  After 20 retries the desktop would abort the transfer;
the laptop had written the correct filename to disk, but the file       
invariably contained 0 bytes.  I encountered the same problem with both 
the .EXE and .BAS versions of the program.  Using the same hardware and 
DOS versions, ZIP.COM transferred files in both directions without      
difficulty.  I am quite prepared to believe that the problem was due to 
an error on my part rather than to a "bug" in the programming.  However,
there were no error messages to give me a clue as to what the problem   
might be.
