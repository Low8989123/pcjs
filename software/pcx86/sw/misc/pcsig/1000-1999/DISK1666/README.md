## Information about "GOVERN - U.S."

    GOVERN - U.S. helps make your voice heard in Washington,
    D.C.  If you belong to any organization lobbying or dealing with
    federal lawmakers, courts and executive agencies, or if you are the
    sort of citizen who writes his federal representatives, GOVERN -
    U.S. will prove an incredibly useful program.
    
    You get a database of members of the House of Representatives and
    Senate along with key executive officers and members of the U.S.
    Supreme Court.  Add to this a great search program to pick your
    targets by political party or otherwise.  You also get templates
    for letters and envelopes that you can edit on your wordprocessor.
    A mail merge program makes sending out your letters a snap.
    
    GOVERN - U.S. is a big program but it takes only about 45 minutes
    to learn.  Suddenly you can extend your reach to everyone who
    counts in the U.S. capitol.
