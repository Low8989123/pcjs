## Information about "VIBRATING, ROTATING, AND COOLING"

    VIBRATING, ROTATING, and COOLING is a program that allows you to view
    and manipulate surfaces that are created according to a mathematical
    function.  This should be of interest to the math and engineering
    student and teacher.
    
    The main program, SURFACE.EXE, has six predefined functions plus an
    option to create a mathematical function of your own.  Once a function
    is chosen, the program graphically demonstrates the results of the
    function on a plane surface.  During the graphic mode you can change the
    speed, the axis of rotation, and the magnification of the image.  The
    program also has the option to include a trace of the image on the
    screen and a help window.
    
    VIBRATING, ROTATING, and COOLING is a versatile program that is
    compatible with CGA, EGA, CGA with a monochrome monitor, and VGA.  In
    addition to the main program, this disk has two demonstration programs
    for computers that have smaller memory.  An MS-Windows version is
    available to registered users.

Disk No  1182
Program Title:  VIBRATING, ROTATING, and CO0LING version 2
PC-SIG version 1

View and manipulate surfaces created by a mathematical function
through three and four dimensional space by pressing a key on your PC.
Graph x and/or y calculus functions and stand in awe at your new
insight as you test the limits of your EGA.  Ogle at wave and stable
state movements like heat flow.  Then, you will be venturing into the
world of VIBRATING, ROTATING AND COOLING.

User friendly, SURFACE describes surfaces moving in 3-D and 4-D spaces
as you speed up, slow down and change the magnitude and axis of
movement. 2DWAVE and LAPLACE bring you two dimensional movements, the
first involving waves, the second heat flow.  The latter programs are
substantially less user friendly.

You have the option of using predefined functions or creating your
own.  Once a function is chosen, the program graphically demonstrates
the results of the function on a plane surface.  During the graphic
mode you may change the speed, the axis of rotation, and the
magnification of the image.  The program also has the option to
include a trace of the image on the screen and a help window.

Usage:  Mathematics.

Special Requirements: CGA, EGA, or VGA graphics, depending on program.
Math coprocessor recommended.


How to Start:  Type GO (press enter).

Suggested Registration:  $30.00

File Descriptions:

2DWAVE   EXE  2D wave simulation.
