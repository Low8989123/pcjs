## Information about "HORSES"

    So simple to use that it makes reaching for a computer manual
    unthinkable, HORSES is a fast-out-of-the-gates, thoroughbred
    handicapping program.  It was designed for the parimutuel player who
    loves both horses and betting at the track.  Because it is objective and
    data oriented, HORSES offers you a leg up on touts and intuition.
    Taking up to eight entries per race on a dirt or turf track, HORSES
    lists projected race results numerically, according to odds and with a
    graphic bar chart.
    
    Users should read the Daily Racing Form and know how to understand the
    past performance charts printed in it.  The program asks for names of
    horses, type of race, distance, and whether the sexes or ages are mixed.
    Then it asks specific questions about the history of each horse.  In a
    flick of a horse's tail, the screen is filled with hard data.  The
    percentages are especially valuable: the greater the percentage
    difference between horses, the more certain the outcome.
