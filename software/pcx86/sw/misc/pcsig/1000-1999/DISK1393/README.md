## Information about "DISKETTE MANAGER CUDM"

    How would you like to catalog your hundreds of shareware disks by
    volume and program, and be able to locate any file or program in
    seconds? DISKETTE MANAGER can do the job. Simply slip your disks
    one-by-one into a drive, press a key and all the files on it are
    instantly listed in your catalog.
    
    You can alter volume names, delete or add files, and search and find
    them instantly. Don't worry about archives. DISKETTE MANAGER reads
    archived files and records both the archive file name and its
    contents. You can even add a 40-character description to any record.
    File sizes are listed along with dates and attributes.
    
    The program includes a 27-page user guide on-disk, and context-
    sensitive on-line help.
