## Information about "COGOWARE AND PLOT"

    COGOWARE is a coordinate geometry surveying program for plat designers.
    Calculate coordinates of each point in the plane of the survey and of
    each point calculated by the plat designer. Each pair of coordinates is
    assigned a point number by the designer as the calculations progress.
    These designated coordinates are saved in batches of 100 points to a
    file. Any designated point can be recalled, and the survey extended as
    the design progresses. All calculations are carried out in double
    precision.
    
    PLOT is a set of quick, easy-to-use tools for technical plotting.  It
    can handle rectilinear, polar and vector plotting.  After plotting, you
    can review a tabulation of all plotted points (except for the vector
    program).

                              CoOrdinate GeOmetry
                               Surveying Program
                                      for
                                 Plat Designers

              This  program,  which  I  call `COGO', is the product of my
       spare time over the span of some years. I began some time in 1971,
       when I first became familiar with  a  desk-top  programmable  cal-
       culator.  I  had  long  been  fascinated  with adding machines and
       mechanical calculators,  but  the  first  time  I  came  across  a
       programmable  electronic  calculator  that  calculated the natural
       functions without resort to tables, I was hooked.
            For  the  plat  designer,  I  have  endeavored  to  make COGO
       operate just the way he thinks, just the way the survey crew works
       in the field and just the way the draftsman works on  the  drawing
       board, with his straight edge, protractor and compass.
            COGO is a relatively compact program that  will  run  in  any
       PC/XT  compatible  computer,  running on MS-DOS and having 128K or
       more of  RAM  memory.   I  have  endeavored  to  make  COGO  self-
       ocumenting  in  so  far  as  possible,  and in this COGO.DOC file
       herewith I will explain its many features as  far  as  space  will
       allow.
            I am a Florida registered professional engineer, PE 7180, now
       retired.  The development of COGO has been a process of revise and
       edit, revise and edit; each time  adding  some  new  and  improved
       procedure,  until  now I can think of no new improvements to make.
       It is now my decision to entrust COGO to  a  wider  clientele,  as
       USER SUPPORTED software.
            You  may  freely  copy  COGO.EXE,  COGO.DOC  & README.1ST and

         INTRODUCTION:
         Anyone interested in this program needs to  be  familiar  with
         surveying  terminology.  If I use any words or terms which are
         not clear to you, I respectfully direct your  attention  to  a
         standard text book, such as :

                         SURVEYING THEORY AND PRACTICE
                                      by
                      Raymond E  Davis, M.S., C.E., D.Eng.
                              Fancis S. Foot, E.M.
                               Joe W. Kelly, B.S.

                            McGraw-Hill Book Company

              BALANCING THE SURVEY: Is a  special  topic,  and  is
              treated  in  a separate text file (BALANCE.DOC) that
              should be found on this same disk.

         PROGRAM  DESIGN:  The  calculations in this (COGO) program are
         carried out in double precision (16  digits).   However,  when
         coordinates  are  listed  with  the  LIST  command,  they  are
         displayed only to the nearest 1/1000 th unit.

         COORDINATES:  A  principal  product  of  the  program  is  the
         calculation of coordinates, NORTHINGS and  EASTINGS,  of  each
         point  in the plane of the survey that you calculate.  To each
         pair  of  coordinates  YOU  assign  a  point  number,  as  the
         calculations  progress.  These designated pairs of coordinates
         are saved in memory in batches of 100 points,  and  each  such
         batch becomes a FILE when saved to the disk.

         CURVE  PARTS:   In  addition  to  coordinates  (northings  and
         eastings) COGO computes `curve parts'  (radius,  delta  angle,
         tangent,  arc  and  chord)  of  each curve encountered.  Curve
         parts are displayed and may be printed  at  your  option,  but
         curve  parts  do  not  become  a permanent part of the record.
         Only coordinates are saved to the disk.  Curve  parts  may  be
         recalculated at any time with the INVERSE CURVE routine.

         FILES:  Points  0 to 99 are saved as file COGO.000; points 100
         to 199 are saved as file COGO.001; points 200 to 299 are saved
         as file COGO.002; and so on. The number of points in each file
         constitutes a century,  and  the  file  number  in  each  case
         corresponds  to  the  century.  In  this  fashion thousands of
         points may be saved on a single disk. Any designated point may
         be recalled, and the survey extended therefrom as  the  design
         progresses.  The  files are automatically created and recalled
         by the program each time a new century is  created,  e.g.,  if
         you pass from file COGO.000 to COGO.001.

         Each  full  data  file  requires 4096 bytes of disk space, and
         COGO.EXE itself requires about 77K, so one diskette can  hold,
         in  addition to the program, about 69 files, or the equivalent
         of 7000 pairs of coordinates.

         Any time you wish to abandon a batch of points you may  do  so
         by  erasing  the  said  file from the disk directory, but this
         isn't necessary, because every time you assign a point  number
         the old coordinates are overwritten.

                                    C O G O                     page 3.

         GETTING STARTED:

         COGO.EXE  is  an executable program.  You should copy COGO.EXE
         onto a disk that you will use in the "current drive", that  is
         the  drive  in  which  you will load COGO.EXE, and this is the
         disk on which COGO will save all the data that  is  generated.
         If  you  wish  to  change  the current drive, you should do so
         before you load COGO.EXE.  When you call it from DOS, it  will
         start running immediately.  At first there will probably be no
         data  files  on  the disk, but COGO will create and manage the
         files automatically.   COGO  recognizes  an  empty  file,  and
         advises you that you ought to enter a pair of coordinates as a
         `local  origin'.   This  is  a  precaution to maintain greater
         precision in the area calculations that will be carried  along
         with  every  traverse.   (COGO calculates the area under every
         line and curve that is calculated.)  If  you  format  a  fresh
         disk, and copy COGO.EXE onto it alone, there will remain space
         on  the disk for at least 68 data files, each accomodating 100
         coordinate pairs. You can have a permanent record of points #0
         to #6799 on a single diskette.  You should never lack for data
         storage space, since you will soon grow tired  of  using  four
         digit point numbers.

         Your best bet is to gain some `hands on' experience with COGO.
         Practice  with  a  subdivision  record  plat  with examples of
         curvilinear  streets  and  cul-de-sacs.   COGO  will  ask  the
         questions, and you will supply the responses.

         TRAVERSE: The calculations proceed in much the same fashion as
         the measurements are made in the field.  At each point we  can
         imagine  a transit to be set up, and from thence a SIGHTING is
         made for a measured distance to the next  point.   A  SIGHTING
         then  consists  of  a  direction  and  a  distance,  and  COGO
         calculates the `latitude' and  `departure',  and  derives  the
         coordinates of the next point.

         INVERSE: Normal surveying procedure moves from point to  point
         using input data consisting of heading angle and measured for-
         ward  distance.   However,  using  the computer, we frequently
         want to make calculations in reverse order.  I.e., we wish  to
         reconstruct  or calculate the heading and distance between two
         points which have been established by other means,  and  whose
         coordinates  are already on file in the computer memory.  Such
         a calculation we call an `inverse'.  You do this with COGO  by
         merely  entering the desired point number at the (SIGHTING: ?)
         prompt.

         AZIMUTH: The operative angle is Azimuth (A), which is measured
         clockwise from the North, from 0 to 360 degrees positive angle
         or counter clockwise from 0 to 360 degrees negative angle.





                                    C O G O                     page 4.

         The fundamental relationships are as follows:

                               latitude = D cos A
                              departure = D sin A

                       where:         A = Azimuth angle
                                      D = Distance of traverse


         NORTHINGS  and  EASTINGS  are respectively the accumulation of
         latitudes and departures  from  a  chosen  (P.O.B.)  point  of
         beginning.

         A  NE  quadrant  "Bearing" is an angle measured clockwise from
         the North, hence it is the only Bearing that is identical with
         Azimuth, and may be used interchangeably with Azimuth.


         MENUS:  There are three menus, which may be called up whenever
         you see the prompt: * SIGHTING: ? This is  the  point  in  the
         program  where  you  enter commands. (You press the <ENTER> or
         <RETURN> key for whatever commands you  choose.)  <I>  is  the
         command for the first menu. <II> is the command for the second
         menu, and <III> is the command for the third menu.

         COMMANDS:   From  the  menus you will learn the following com-
         mands:

         I - 1st MENU (Introduction)     CL - CLEAR AREA
        II - 2nd MENU (Commands)          C - ENTER COORDINATES
       III - 3rd MENU (Curves, etc.)      L - LIST  COORDINATES
      SAVE - SAVE DATA FILE              EX - EXIT or use <SHELL>
                      <Ctrl+PrtSc> = Printer Toggle

         NE,  NW,  SW,  and  SE  are  the  compass quadrants, and their
         meanings should be obvious.

         N, S, E and W are the cardinal points of the compass and these
         represent absolute Bearings. They assume azimuths of exactly 0
         or 90 degrees.

         DF - deflection angle           BK - backsight
         GO - zero deflection            BT - backtrack
         SA - slope angle                ZD - zenith `distance'
         SS - side-shot                  XS - cancel side-shot
         AZ - Azimuth Heading            RV - revise a call

         TR - traverse curve             BB - bearing/bearing inters'n
         SC - inscribe curve             BD - bearing/distance   "
         IN - inverse  curve             DD - distance/distance  "
         CU - cul-de-sac  "

         The above list of alphabetical commands comprises  the  entire
         list  of  such  commands  employed  by  COGO,  except  for  an
         occasional (R)ight, (L)eft, (Y)es or (N)o choice that you  may
         be called upon to make.

                                    C O G O                     page 5.

   <ENTER> Incidently, at boot-up,  when you tap a key to continue, and
         later in the program, when you may make a  (R)ight  or  (L)eft
         choice,  the program is designed to branch immediately, and it
         doesn't wait for you to press <ENTER>. In these cases don't be
         too quick to  press  <ENTER>;  if  you  do,  you  are  apt  to
         inadvertently  skip  a  step in the program, and inadvertently
         enter a zero (0). JUST BE SURE EACH TIME  YOU  PRESS  <ENTER>,
         THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

         LOCAL ORIGIN:  You should plan ahead, and consider how wide an
         area you anticipate that you will cover with your surveys. You
         should select a pair of coordinates, NORTHINGS  and  EASTINGS,
         for  point  No.  0,  such  that any future point falling south
         westerly of that point will still have  positive  coordinates.
         (Although  it is mathematically permissible to work with nega-
         tive coordinates, it is not convenient to do so.)


   <C>   ENTER COORDINATES: To enter  the  coordinates  for  the  LOCAL
         ORIGIN  or  any  other P.O.B., you start this routine with the
         command  <C>.  Then  COGO tells you what to do next. To escape
         from this routine, press <I><ENTER>.

   <L>   LIST COORDINATES: you start this routine with the command <L>.
         Then  COGO tells you what to do next. You can make a hard copy
         if you enable your printer with the keys <Ctrl>+<PrtSc>.

         PROMPTS:  COGO is largely self documenting. When it stops  and
         gives  you  an  opportunity  to  enter a command, you will see
         something like this:

                         * SIGHTING: ?

         The asterisk, * , is to identify this as the  primary  command
         entry  point  in  the program. When you see this star, you can
         branch with any of the commands listed above.  You  will  also
         see  this  star  when entering P.O.B. coordinates, so that you
         can branch from that routine too.


         TRAVERSE: In the simplest traverse, you are given the  Azimuth
         or  Quadrant  and  Bearing (angle) and the distance.  Go ahead
         and run it. The program will stop and request  the  data,  and
         finally the point number.

         ANGLE  DATA:  Surveying instruments are calibrated in degrees,
         minutes and seconds  (our  heritage  from  the  ancient  Baby-
         lonians),  so  that  is  how  COGO is designed to receive this
         information. If you enter degrees or minutes as integers, COGO
         then requests the next smaller units, but if you enter numbers
         with decimal fractions, COGO  accepts  that  in  lieu  of  any
         further fractions.


                                    C O G O                     page 6.

         Enter angle data thus:

         ENTER ANGLE: deg ?       { NOTE: If you need a negative angle,
                      min ?       { place a negative (-) sign before
                      sec ?       { any of these quantities.  The whole
                                  { angle will be negative.

         NOTE:  COGO  subsequently  reports Azimuth as well as Bearings
         with   quadrants.   The  computed  results  are  displayed  as
         follows:

    THENCE CW      314.4911111111111 deg
       "           314 deg  29 min  28.00 sec  { AZIMUTH
       or    NORTH  45 deg  30 min  32.00 sec  WEST,        1000.000 units

    POINT NO. 0      TO      POINT NO. 1        NORTH'GS:  700.7986019211062
                                                EASTINGS: -713.3591798984737

         NOTE: In the above typical display, the heading is first given
         in decimal degrees Azimuth, then deg/min/sec Azimuth, and then
         as  a  Bearing  angle in deg/min/sec.  The linear dimension is
         shown in unspecified "units".



         POINT  NUMBERS:   Initially  you will  be  starting  with  low
         point  numbers,  from  1  to  99.  This  will  constitute file
         `COGO.000', when you SAVE it onto the disk. (You must remember
         to SAVE your current file whenever you are about to  turn  off
         the  computer. In fact it would be wise to SAVE your data from
         time to time. A power interuption could lose a portion of your
         work, but once it is on the disk, you are safe.)

         INVERSE TRAVERSE: Each time COGO stops for a new * SIGHTING: ?
         you will see that you are set up over a point. (The point num-
         ber  `where  you are' will be seen on the line above.) Now, if
         you want to move to another established and numbered point  in
         the survey, you merely enter that point number as the SIGHTING
         and  COGO  will calculate and report the traverse data to that
         further point. NOTE: You may INVERSE between any two  numbered
         points; they do not have to be members of the same file.

         AREA  ACCUMULATION:   For  every  line  and curve routine that
         carries  you  from point to point, COGO calculates and accumu-
         lates the area under the line or curve. When you  arrive  back
         at  the  P.O.B.,  COGO  prints  out the enclosed area and per-
         imeter. (Initially, at the P.O.B., you must first have cleared
         the accumulator registers with  the  <CL>  command.)  You  may
         `inverse'  around  the area, from point to point, and when you
         inverse to the P.O.B., the area display will be produced.

         NOTE: The enclosed area is  displayed  as  "square  units"  of
         whatever  system of linear units you are using in your survey.
         If you are using feet, the quantity labeled  "acres"  will  be
         correct, otherwise it should be ignored.


                                    C O G O                     page 7.

   <DF>  DEFLECTION  ANGLE  TRAVERSE:  This together with the backsight
         are probably the two most useful  routines  to  the  surveyor,
         since  they  more  nearly  simulate  the  sort  of  operations
         regularly performed by surveyors in the field. Enter  <DF>  to
         initiate  this  routine. At the point `where you are' you have
         arrived with a certain known heading. Thence you want to  pro-
         ceed  on  a new heading. You want to turn through a deflection
         angle. This `deflection angle' is the datum that you enter, as
         requested by the program. A clockwise angle  is  positive.   A
         counter-clockwise  angle  must  be given a negative sign. (You
         only need to attach the negative sign to one  entry,  and  the
         whole angle will be negative.)

   <GO>  ZERO DEFLECTION:  This is a traverse similar to the <DF>,  ex-
         cept you are going to continue on the same heading, (zero  de-
         flection  angle).   This  saves  you several key strokes, and
         you only have to key in the distance.

   <BK>  BACKSIGHT:  This is a traverse similar  to  the  <DF>,  except
         this time the telescope is sighted on the previous point, i.e.
         the point from which you arrived at the point `where you are'.
         Enter <BK> to initiate this routine. This means that  you  are
         starting from  a heading exactly 180 degrees from your current
         heading. As in <DF>, you turn whatever angle you wish for  the
         new  heading. Again the same convention applies as regards the
         sign of the angle.

   <BT>  BACKTRACK: This is a "backsight" with  zero  deflection,  and,
         like <GO>, requires only a distance datum.

   <TR>  TRAVERSE OF CURVE:  A routine initiated with the command <TR>.
         This  curve  begins  at  a  `PC' and terminates at a `PT', and
         finds a `PI' on the way. You have arrived at the `PC' with  an
         established  HEADING.  You  will arrive at the `PT' with a new
         HEADING. The program will ask you for the BEARING at  the  PT.
         The  answer  to  this  will  depend upon what is known. If the
         delta angle of the curve is given, you may enter it as  a  de-
         flection  angle.  One more piece of data is needed; COGO gives
         you the option of providing RADIUS, TAN  or  CHD.  It  depends
         on your design objectives as to which one you want to specify.
         COGO will then carry you through the calculations,  requesting
         the  assignment  of  point  numbers for the PI and the PT, and
         calculating and displaying the CURVE PARTS.

   <SC>  INSCRIBE CURVE:     A routine initiated with the command <SC>.
         This is similar to the preceding routine, except this time the
         point `where you are' is at the PI. This routine  is  probably
         more useful to the subdivision designer, since  he  will  most
         likely lay out  the  street  centerlines  first,  finding  the
         intersection  points,  and  then  fit in the curves later. The
         steps are much the same as before, but this  time  the  PC  is
         calculated for you.


                                      COGO                      page 8.

   <IN>  INVERSE CURVE:      A routine initiated with the command <IN>.
         This  computes  a curve between two points, the PC and the PT,
         both  of which are known. The PC is `where you are'; The PT is
         where you are going. If the curve is to be tangent to the line
         of  the  previous  heading,  no  further data is required; you
         merely answer `No' for RADIUS or TAN input.  The  calculations
         proceed the same as for the other curve routines.

   <CU>  CUL-DE-SAC:         A routine initiated with the command <CU>.
         This is essentially an INVERSE CURVE routine, except  that  it
         is  the  long curve through the two chosen points. You proceed
         the same as for <IN>.

         CONTROL POINT: Intersections involve two  lines:  one  through
         the  point `where you are' and one through another point. This
         OTHER point, in each case, I call the CONTROL POINT.

   <BB>  BEARING-BEARING INTERSECTION: initiated with the command <BB>.
         Here you enter BEARING #1, then you are going to  continue  on
         the  same  heading  an unknown distance. Then you are going to
         turn onto BEARING #2, passing through the CONTROL  POINT.  The
         CONTROL  POINT  must  be  a known point with a known Point No.
         Optionally, the BEARINGS  can  be  supplied  either  as  given
         BEARINGS, DEFLECTION ANGLES or BACKSIGHTS.

   <BD>  BEARING-DISTANCE INTERSECTION:   start using the command <BD>.
         This  routine proceeds pretty much like <BB>, except this time
         there exists the possibility of  two  different  answers.  The
         distance  in  this  case is the distance from the intersection
         point to the CONTROL POINT which is on  a  radius  that  could
         swing  around  and intersect our bearing in two places. There-
         fore you must be prepared to decide on the longer distance  or
         the  shorter one. You also have the DEFLECTION ANGLE and BACK-
         SIGHT options as before.

   <DD>  DISTANCE-DISTANCE INTERSECTION:  start using the command <DD>.
         This time all the BEARINGS  are  unknown.  You  are  asked  to
         supply  DISTANCE  #1, DISTANCE #2 and the CONTROL POINT.  Here
         again there is  the  possibility  of  two  different  answers,
         depending  upon  whether  the desired intersection lies to the
         RIGHT or LEFT of your line of sight toward the CONTROL  POINT.
         Caution!  Don't  press  <ENTER> until after you have selected
         the PI point number.

   <SS>  SIDE-SHOT: initiate this series with the  command  <SS>.  This
         permits  you to make a series of shots from the same point and
         the same current heading, without losing  your  place  in  the
         main  traverse.  The side-shot condition will remain in effect
         until you cancel it.

   <XS>  CANCELS the side-shot condition.




   <SA>  SLOPE ANGLE:      initiate this routine with the command <SA>.
         This is an infrequently used  routine.  All  maps  and  survey
         plats  are  drawn depicting the land reduced to a single level
         plane. When steep grades are encountered, then  the  distances
         can  be  measured  on  the  slope, and the slope angle also is
         measured. When the plat is drawn, however, the horizontal dis-
         tance must be calculated. This is what  is  accomplished  with
         the  <SA>  routine, to be completed when HORIZONTAL bearing is
         requested.

   <ZD>  ZENITH DISTANCE:  initiate this routine with the command <ZD>.
         This  is  just  another  form  of  the slope angle. In certain
         theodolites the vertical circles are calibrated to measure the
         angle  from  the  zenith  rather than from the horizontal, and
         then  they call it ZENITH DISTANCE rather than SLOPE ANGLE. If
         you are using such an instrument, then use the <ZD> command.

   <RV>  REVISE A CALL:    initiate this routine with the command <RV>.
         If you discover that you mistakenly entered  the  wrong  datum
         at some point in a long series of traverses, and if the effect
         has  been  to  translate  a  series of later points, then this
         routine may help you to correct for the  error  without  going
         back and repeating the later points. However the error must be
         one  of only translation. We cannot correct for rotation. COGO
         tells you how to do it.


                                    C O G O                    page 10.

                   * * * * NOTES & TIME SAVING TIPS: * * * *

     1.- The text file  BALANCE.DOC  on  this  same  disk  describes  a
         convenient  method for using the power of COGO to balance your
         survey.

     2.- FUNCTION  KEYS:  The  `key bar' displayed at the bottom of the
         screen shows 10 command codes:

     F1=NW  F2=AZ  F3=SW  F4=SE  F5=BK  F6=DF  F7=BT  F8=GO  F9=CL  F10=SAVE

         which it will be convenient to use as single stroke  commands.
         There  are only 10 spaces available; the ones selected are the
         ones you will probably use most frequently.  However, you have
         the  option  of entering any of them from the keyboard just as
         well.  (AZ is equivalent to NE.)

     3.- ESC  KEY:   The `ESC' key is handy for canceling mistaken data
         entries. Try it!

     4.- In  the <BB>, <BD>, <SC>, <SA> and <ZD> command routines, when
         COGO asks for a 1st BEARING ANGLE, and if  there  is  a  known
         established point in the right direction from the point `where
         you  are',  you may enter the known point number, instead of a
         bearing. COGO then makes the calculation as it  would  for  an
         inverse  traverse, and uses the calculated bearing to complete
         the commanded traverse. This utilizes a portion of the INVERSE
         TRAVERSE routine; it turns to  the  indicated  heading,  while
         remaining at the starting point.

     5.- You may occasionally see a flashing warning: [ INDETERMINATE ]
         when  running an intersection calculation or an inverse curve.
         This means that the data you have entered will not produce  an
         intersection,  or will not connect up with the points that you
         have specified.

     6.- Should  you wish to temporarily revert to  the  DOS  operating
         system without losing COGO, use the <SHELL> command.  Try  it;
         COGO will make it plain.  (COMMAND.COM must be available.)

     7.- With  your  printer  turned  on and loaded with paper, you can
         make a hard copy of your work by toggling the printer on  with
         the <Ctrl+PrtSc> key command.  This same command turns it off.

                                   DISCLAIMER

         I'm  sure  you  understand; COGO.EXE is provided on an "as is"
         basis. Any damages arising from the use of  this  program  are
         entirely the responsibility of the user; i.e. the author, Carl
         M. King, cannot be held responsible for any damages.

         THIS HAS BEEN A LABOR OF LOVE. I HOPE YOU WILL RECIPROCATE AND
         LET ME HAVE SOME INDICATION OF YOUR APPROVAL.

                                       Sincerely,

                                                   Carl M. King

Program Title:  COGOWARE version 5.3b and PLOT version 3.0
PC-SIG version:  1.6

Here are two hot programs for engineers, drafters, or anyone who is
interested in technical drawing on their computer.

COGOWARE is a coordinate geometry surveying program for plat designers.
The main use of the program is to calculate coordinates of each point in
the plane of the survey and of each point calculated by the plat
designer.  Each pair of coordinates is assigned a point number by the
designer as the calculations progress.  These designated coordinates are
saved in batches of 100 points to a disk file.  Any designated point may
be recalled, and the survey extended as the design progresses.  All
calculations are carried out in double precision.

PLOT is a set of quick, easy-to-use tools for technical plotting.  It
can handle rectilinear, polar, and vector plotting.  After plotting, you
can review a tabulation of all plotted points (except for the vector
program).

Usage:  Surveying and Math.

Special Requirements:  CGA card, and a version of BASIC for PLOT.

How to Start:  Type GO (press enter).

Suggested Registration:  $10.00 for COGO, $25.00 for PLOT.

                                  INTRODUCTION

 This program set is designed to provide a quick, easy to use, set of tools
 for technical plotting. It will handle rectilinear, polar and vector
 plotting. After plotting, you may review a tabulation of all plotted points
 (except for the vector program).

 These programs were written in BASICA to take advantage of a unique BASICA
 capability - the CHAIN MERGE feature. When you enter an equation to be
 plotted, you may enter it just as you would write it on paper. The
 program accepts your equation as a string variable, appends your equation
 to a string that defines a line number then writes the whole string to a
 file (FCT1.BAS for example). This file is then CHAIN MERGED with the
 program itself and your equation becomes an executable line of code,
 complete with a line number in the program. Unfortunately, existing
 compilers can not compile the CHAIN MERGE statement.

 We felt that being able to enter the equation in standard equation format was
 so important that we have released these programs in BASICA.  No other
 language that we know of allows a chain-merge-like function and writing the
 function in another language would be a formidable task. Chalk one up for
 BASIC! Although not extremely fast, we think that you will find the plotting
 speed of these programs satisfactory.

 SPECIAL NOTE: Because of the technique mentioned above, you will render
               these programs INOPERATIVE IF YOU RENUMBER THE LINES !!!

 There is a master help file accessable from the main menu (HLP3.BAS). It is
 a separate program that describes each program in detail. It is your best
 source of information about program specifics.

 In addition to HLP3.BAS, each program contains a brief help (or
 instruction) section for quick reference.

                  -----------------------------------------------

                            MAKE A WORKING DISKETTE

 Protect your investment; make a working copy of your PLOT product diskette
 now!

		1. Format a new diskette

		   Example:  FORMAT B:

                   (Assumes system diskette in drive A and new diskette in
                   drive B.)








		2. Copy your BASICA.COM to the working diskette.

			       COPY BASICA.COM B:

                   If your system uses a different advanced BASIC,  you will
		   need to copy it to the working disk.

		   Example:    COPY GW-BASIC.EXE B:

                3. Copy all files from your product diskette to the newly
                   formatted diskette.

		   Example:    COPY *.*  B:

                   (Assumes product diskette in drive A and formatted diskette
                   in drive B.)


                4. Label your working diskette PLOT.

                5. Put your PLOT product diskette in a safe place.


          NOTE: If you are using a hard disk, set up a separate directory
                for PLOT and start with step #2 above, substituting C: for
                B:.

            ------------------------------------------------------------

                     LOADING AND RUNNING THE PLOT PROGRAMS

 Put your working diskette in drive A (or get into the PLOT directory if
 you are using a hard disk). Enter:

			   BASICA PLOG	<return>

		   or	   GW-BASIC PLOG <return> (if your system uses
						   GW-BASIC)



 Pressing any key from the logo screen will display the Prowess, Inc.
 license statement. Pressing any key at this point will call the main menu.

 From the main menu, you may select any of the plotting programs. We strongly
 suggest that you review the main help file (accessable from the main menu)
 before operating the programs.

 NOTE: If your DOS operating system contains a utility called GRAPHICS.COM
 (DOS 2.1 and greater), you may want to load it prior to running the PLOT
 programs. With GRAPHICS.COM memory resident, you can print the graphs
 produced by the PLOT package on most wire dot printers by simply pressing
 <shift-prtSc>. You can load GRAPHICS.COM by entering: GRAPHICS <return> from
 your system disk.

                 -------------------------------------------------










                              GENERAL INFORMATION

 BASIC is rather unforgiving about comma errors; if you enter a period
 instead of a comma or fail to put a comma where the program is expecting
 one, you will see a 'REDO FROM START' error message. If this occurs, you
 can usually recover by re-entering the data correctly AT THE CURRENT
 CURSOR POSITION. If you try to move the cursor before correcting your
 entry, you'll make things worse! In most cases the messy screen will be
 redrawn when the function is plotted. Specifying the range of X over
 which to plot, the range of X over which to integrate, and inputting
 vectors (in both rectangular and polar formats) require entries in the
 form of M,N. The comma is a requirement!!

 BASICA does not allow error trapping 'division by zero' and 'overflow'
 (a floating point overflow). Some BASICA equivalents do allow trapping
 these errors. Error trapping statements exist in the programs to detect
 these errors; however, they won't operate on the IBM-PC. They will work
 properly on some clones that use a different advanced BASIC. If you get
 either of these error messages, from the system, you will have to restart
 the program. Most syntax errors are trapped and the error traps should
 work.

 Entering a single 'Q' (for 'quit') and pressing return, at most user inputs,
 will halt the current operation and display the exit screen.

                          EXPLANATION OF FILES ON DISK

       The  family  of  files to be distributed as SHAREWARE on this disk
       should be distributed as a package.  A good name for  the  package
       would  be:   COGOWARE,  and  I would be pleased if this convention
       were followed.  The files that should go together are as follows:

       COGO.EXE (version 5.3) is the  executable  program  that  performs
       surveying  calculations.   The  name COGO is taken from CoOrdinate
       GeOmetry.   This latest version is dated 12/24/88 in the disk dir-
       ectory, hence there should be no reason to  confuse  it  with  any
       earlier version.

       COGO.DOC  and  BALANCE.DOC  are ASCII files comprising the user's
       manual documentation (version 5.3b), and  instructions  for  `bal-
       ancing the survey', of interest to land surveyors.

       README.1ST is an ASCII file being a short starting instruction.

       WHATS.NEW  is  an  ASCII file telling what is new in this up-date.
       This is an optional file, and you may include it at your option.
