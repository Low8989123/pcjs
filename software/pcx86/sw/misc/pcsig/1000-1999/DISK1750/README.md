## Information about "LOTTERY ANALYZER AND PICKER"

    LOTTERY ANALYZER AND PICKER is a program that analyzes statistics on
    previous winning lottery numbers and randomly chooses lottery numbers
    for you.  The winning lottery numbers can be updated and changed at any
    time.
    
    Display a listing of the last 48 winning numbers, showing the number of
    repeats from the previous drawing, the total odd and even numbers, the
    sum of all six numbers, and the difference and average between the
    numbers drawn.  Find out how many times each number was picked in
    previous drawings.  Display a graph of the previous winning numbers and
    a graph of the frequency of each winning number.
    
    Besides giving statistics on previous winning lottery numbers, LOTTERY
    ANALYZER AND PICKER can randomly select lottery numbers for you.  Set
    limitations on the random selection to include or exclude certain
    numbers, set the average frequency, set the total sum of all six
    numbers, have consecutive or double numbers, include previous winning
    numbers and more.  After you pick numbers from the random selection,
    LOTTERY ANALYZER can display a graph of all the numbers that were
    chosen.
