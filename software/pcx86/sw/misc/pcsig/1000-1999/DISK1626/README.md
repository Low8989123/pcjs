## Information about "YEAR PLANNER"

    YEAR PLANNER will help you and your staff organize your personal and
    business time month to month, or throughout the year. It lets you create
    your own wall planners which are laid out like the familiar "write-on,
    wipe-off" wall planner calender system. The system allows you to write
    deadlines and appointments and other important information in the "day
    blocks" of monthly calendars of your choice.
    
    The large standard calendar format lets you quickly update and erase
    appointments.  Moving from date to date takes only seconds. You can list
    your appointments by the hour, or use a special wrap-around feature to
    put major task descriptions and deadlines within each day block.
    
    An overlay template lets you enter similar messages in multiple day
    blocks.  You can even get an on-screen year summary to see the whole
    year at a glance.  The large calendar printouts already have major
    holidays built into each month.  Your own important dates may be stored
    in a file for automatic insertion into next year's file.

1.1  Program Description


Year  Planner is an organizing tool which mimics the familiar  "write-
on,  wipe-off"  wall planner calendar system most  businesses  use  to 
schedule  important  events.  You  are  allowed  to  write  deadlines, 
appointments, and other important information into "day blocks"  which 
can  later  be  printed  out in  a  large  standard  calendar  format. 
Information can be easily updated or erased altogether and  reprinted. 
Features include an overlay template to apply similar messages in many 
"day  blocks",  a  pop-up notepad, a month at  a  glance  feature,  an 
onscreen year summary so you can see the whole year at a glance, large 
calendar printouts, and all major holidays already built in.



>>>> System Requirements:

*    512K of main memory.
*    One 5 1/4 "  floppy drive.
*    One hard disk drive. (optional)
*    IBM PC or compatible.
*    files=40 and buffers=40 in CONFIG.SYS file.

2.1  System Installation

Floppy Drive System:

To  install  the year planner program on a floppy drive  system,  just 
copy  the CALENDAR.EXE, UTILITY.EXE, SETUP.EXE, and  BRUN30.EXE  files 
over  to a blank, formatted floppy diskette. You will have  more  than 
enough  space on the floppy diskette to hold the program,  the  yearly 
data files, and the printer control codes setup file.


Hard Drive System:

To  install the year planner program on a hard disk, you should  first 
create  a  new  subdirectory  on  the hard  disk  and  then  copy  the  
CALENDAR.EXE,  UTILITY.EXE,  SETUP.EXE, and BRUN30.EXE  files  to  the 
newly   created   subdirectory.  The  commands  to  create   the   new 
subdirectory are:


     C>cd \                   goes to the root directory
     C>md calendar            makes a new subdirectory called calendar
     C>cd \calendar           goes to the calendar subdirectory

     (C> is the DOS prompt and is not part of the command)


Once  you  have  created the new subdirectory,  you  should  copy  the 
calendar.exe and setup.exe program files to the subdirectory. Use  the 
DOS  copy  command  to  do this. Make sure you  are  in  the  calendar 
subdirectory  before  issuing  this  command.  The  command  has   the 
following format:

     C>copy d:\path\calendar

Where  d:\path\  is the pathname for the location of the  calendar.exe 
file.  For example,  if the file was in the root directory on drive  A 
then the copy commands would look like this: 

     C>copy A:calendar.exe
     C>copy A:utility.exe
     C>copy A:setup.exe
     C>copy A:brun30.exe

As  another example,  if the calendar.exe file were in a  subdirectory 
called XTALK on drive C then the commands would look like this:

     C>copy C:\xtalk\calendar.exe
     C>copy C:\xtalk\utility.exe
     C>copy C:\xtalk\setup.exe
     C>copy C:\xtalk\brun30.exe





                                                   Page 2





2.2  Starting the Program



Floppy Drive System:

1) Insert the floppy diskette created in section 2.1 into drive A.

2) Make sure you have the A> prompt.

3) Type CALENDAR and then press 'enter'.

4) The main menu will appear.






Hard Drive System:

1) Go to the subdirectory created is section 2.1: C>cd \calendar

2) Type CALENDAR and then press 'enter'.

3) The main menu will appear.




Note: In the current version, you have the ability to create more than 
one calendar file. You can enter the calendar file name on the command 
line  when you start the program (CALENDAR filename) or, if you  don't 
enter  it on the command line, you will be prompted by the program  to 
enter a calendar file name.

2.4  Initializing a New Year


Before  doing  anything such as entering appointments  or  printing  a 
calendar, you must first initialize the calendar file for the year you 
would like to work with. To do this, choose option U on the main  menu 
to go to the utility menu:

              ---------------------------------------------------
              |    Wall Planner v2.90 Utility Menu              |
              |                                                 |
              |       O) Onscreen Summary.                      |
              |       P) Print Wall Planner.                    |
              |       I) Initialize file for a New Year.        |
              |       A) Add/Update Important Dates.            |
              |       D) Insert Important Dates into Year.      |
              |       S) Color & Printer Control Codes Setup.   |
              |       M) Main Menu.                             |
              |                                                 |
              |       Enter Option...                           |
              |                                                 |
              ---------------------------------------------------


Then  choose option I on the utility menu. After entering the name  of 
the  file  that  you want to initialize, you will  get  the  following 
prompt:

         Enter year (YY): ..

         Esc to Exit.


After  you enter the year, the calendar file will be initialized.  All 
"day  blocks"  will be set equal to spaces. After the  file  has  been 
initialized, you will get the following prompt:



         Do you want to insert Holidays in calendar ? (Y/N)...


If  you  answer  Y  to  the  prompt,   all  major  holidays  will   be 
automatically  inserted  in  the  last line of  the  appropriate  "day 
block".  If you answer N to the prompt,  all "day blocks" will  remain 
blank.


Note  that all year's are supported up to year 1999. And holidays  are 
included only for years 1987 thru 1990. Future holidays and years will 
be updated on a yearly basis or as needed.

2.5  Setup - Printer, Color, Pause Time.


The  setup  routine  is option S on the utility  menu.  The  following 
printer setup menu will appear:


                  ----------------------------------------
                  |                                      |

                  |   T) Toshiba.                        |
                  |   R) Radio Shack.                    |
                  |   I) IBM.                            |
                  |   C) Custom Printer Setup.           |
                  |   M) Return to Menu (without saving).|
                  |                                      |
                  |                                      |
                  |   Enter Option...                    |
                  |                                      |
                  ----------------------------------------


If  your  printer is listed on the menu above, then simply  press  the 
letter  corresponding to your printer. Otherwise, press C  for  custom 
printer setup. Whether you choose a specific printer or custom  setup, 
the next screen you get will be the custom printer setup screen:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
|      Enter the following control codes for your printer. There        |
|      are 10 spaces available for each set of codes. Usually,          |
|      just 1 or 2 codes are needed for each printer mode, so just      |
|      enter the values necessary starting from the left, leaving       |
|      the unused values blank (or 0). All numbers are in decimal:      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                       |
| 8 lines per inch    :  27,  48, ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ...|
|                                                                       |

|                                                                       |
| Is everything correct ? (Y/N)...                                      |
|                                              Press F10 when finished. |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.5  (continued)

If you chose a specific printer on the first menu, then the codes  for 
that  printer  will appear on the screen above; otherwise,  the  codes 
will be blank. If you need to enter codes for your printer, look  them 
up  in your printer manual and enter them on the screen  above.  Press 
F10  when you have entered the last code. The codes will be stored  on 
disk  and you will proceed to the next screen. The decimal  codes  can 
usually be found in a table in the back of your printer manual or in a 
section that describes the different printer modes and tells you  what 
codes to send from software to put your printer into that mode.


Color Setup:

After  you are finished entering the printer control codes,  you  will 
get the following color setup screen:

                  ----------------------------------------
                  |   Color Setup Screen.                |
                  |                                      |
                  |   M) Monochrome Mode.                |
                  |   F) Change Foreground Color.        |
                  |   B) Change Background Color.        |
                  |   D) Change Border Color.            |
                  |   S) Save Colors.                    |
                  |                                      |
                  |   Enter Option...                    |
                  |                                      |
                  ----------------------------------------

To  change  the  screen  colors,  simply  press  the  appropriate  key 
corresponding  to the area that you want to change. Eight  colors  are 
available  for each area of the screen. As you press F,  for  example, 
the foreground color will change each time the F key is pressed.  Note 
that the foreground color cannot be the same as the background  color. 
If you are using a monochrome monitor, just press M on the menu above. 
When  the  colors are set the way you want them, press S to  save  the 
color setup. 


Error Message Pause Time:

The next screen you will get is:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
|    Enter the number of seconds you would like error messages    |

3.1  Working on the Calendar


This  option  allows you to enter appointments,  schedules,  important 
dates,  etc into "day blocks". It will also allow you to  enter  notes 
that are associated with each day block. Eight "day blocks" at a  time 
will be displayed on the screen. The screen window looks like this:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1  (continued)


Use the PgUp and PgDn keys to move up and down between months and  use 
the Ctrl Left Arrow and Ctrl Right Arrow cursor movement keys to  move 
left  and right between days of a month. With all movement keys,  make 
sure you are moving to a valid day. For example, you cannot move up to 
the 30th day in February.





Entering Appointments:


To enter an appointment or other information just type the information 
into  the appropriate "day block" and then save it.  A "day block"  is 
saved by pressing the F10 function key or by moving on to another "day 
block".  Make  sure  all "day blocks" are saved before  pressing  Esc. 
Pressing  Esc  just returns back to the main menu  without  doing  any 
saving first.



Refer  to sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.9 for more  information  about 
working on a calendar.

3.2  The Overlay Template

The overlay template is used to apply the same information into several
"day  blocks"  without having to retype it every time.  There are  two 
functions  involved:  Ctrl E will allow you to edit the  template  and 
Ctrl  A  will  allow  you to apply the template to  the  current  "day 
block".

Editing the template:

While  working on a calendar,  press Ctrl E and the  following  screen 
will appear:

                   --------------------
                   |T ............... |
                   |E ............... |
                   |M --Vacation--... |
                   |P ............... |
                   |L ............... |
                   |A ............... |
                   |T ............... |
                   |E ............... |
                   |  ............... |
                   |  ............... |
                   --------------------


                   Press F10 when finished editing template.


Just  type  in the information you want the template to hold  for  you 
until you apply the template. For example you could put "--Vacation--"
in  the template and then apply the template to the days that you will 
be on vacation.




Applying the template:

To apply the template, you should first go to the day that you want to 
apply the template to and then simply press Ctrl A.  The template will 
be applied to the current day.  Note that lines which were not entered 
in the template will not erase information that was in the "day block" 
before you applied the template.  To apply the template to another day 
just move to another day and press Ctrl A again.

3.3  Jumping to a Specified Day


While  working  on  the calendar,  you may want to move quickly  to  a 
specific day of the year.  To do so press the F2 function key and  you 
will be prompted to enter a day in the form MMDD:




         Enter Date to Jump to (MMDD): ....

         Esc to Exit.




After  a valid month and day are entered,  you will return back to the 
main  working  screen.  The  day that you jumped to will  now  be  the 
current day. Make sure days are entered in the form MMDD. For example, 
March 2 should be entered like this: 0302.

              ---------------------------------------------------


Just enter the range of months you want to print calendars for.  After 
the  month ranges have been entered, you will be asked whether or  not 
you want to print in condensed mode, whether or not you want to  print 
using  graphics  characters,  whether or not you  want  to  print  the 
notepad  text, and you will be asked how many times you want to  print 
the calendar.

Please  be sure you have entered your printer control  codes  (section 
2.5)  correctly  before  executing  this  routine.  If  you  print  in 
condensed  mode,  the  calendar will be printed in 8.5  x  11  format, 
otherwise  it will be printed in 14 x 11 format. Both  formats  should 
print in 8 lines per inch mode.

Note (8 lpi): If your printout is longer than one 11" page, then  your 
8 lines per inch control codes are not working or you reset or  turned 
off your printer after the codes were sent to the printer.

Note (graphics): In order to print graphics, your printer must be able 
to accept graphics characters. Refer to the DOS manual and look  under 
the "graphics" command.

YEAR PLANNER will help you and your staff organize your personal and    
business time month to month, or throughout the year. It lets you create
your own wall planners which are laid out like the familiar "write-on,  
wipe-off" wall planner calender system. The system allows you to write  
deadlines and appointments and other important information in the "day  
blocks" of monthly calendars of your choice.                            
                                                                        
The large standard calendar format lets you quickly update and erase    
appointments.  Moving from date to date takes only seconds. You can list
your appointments by the hour, or use a special wrap-around feature to  
put major task descriptions and deadlines within each day block.        
                                                                        
An overlay template lets you enter similar messages in multiple day     
blocks.  You can even get an on-screen year summary to see the whole    
year at a glance.  The large calendar printouts already have major      
holidays built into each month.  Your own important dates may be stored 
in a file for automatic insertion into next year's file.
