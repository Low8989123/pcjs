## Information about "PSQUARES"

    POKER SQUARES is a computerized card game for one to 10 players in which
    each player tries to obtain the best poker hands possible.  Cards are
    displayed on a five-by-five grid and poker hands can be formed going
    both across and down.  In multiple player games, you may choose to have
    the same deck of cards dealt to each player for each round.
    
    POKER SQUARES also gives you the options to make dueces wild, to have
    three peeks at the next card for each round, to use an alternate scoring
    table, to have bonus points, to have one to three extra cards dealt to
    replace previous cards, and to undo the placement of your last card
    before dealing the next card.
    
    POKER SQUARES requires a bit of strategy and a bit of guessing, and is
    fun to play both alone and with others.  POKER SQUARES has a tournament
    option, in which you may play three, five or seven rounds, where the
    program chooses the game setup for each round.  The program also allows
    you to save up to 15 games on disk for later use.
