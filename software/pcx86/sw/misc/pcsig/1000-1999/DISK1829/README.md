## Information about "MINIMAX AND EXECUTIVE EDITOR"

    MINIMAX is a full featured text editor for use with database, desktop
    publishing, and spreadsheet programs.  It is simple and fast, just what
    you need when making quick corrections your main program doesn't do well
    This text editor was created as a quick and easy alternative to bulky,
    complex programs.
    
    Install MINIMAX and you can easily create ASCII text files of up to 64K
    length for inclusion in your database reports, spreadsheets, desktop
    publishing files, etc.  MINIMAX can also create and edit batch files.
    MINIMAX includes multiple window editing (the number of windows is
    limited only by available memory) and file/block copying/importing.
    
    EXECUTIVE EDITOR is a text editor/freeform database that will handle as
    many 64K files within the database as disk space allows.  EXECUTIVE
    EDITOR is perfect for the laptop user to retain key information, draft
    and store notes and memos, or maintain a diary of contacts.
    
    EXECUTIVE EDITOR allows keyword search (exact and fuzzy search), multi-
    window editing, import-export (in ASCII), and supports over 50 keyboard
    editor commands -- though only six or seven are needed for most uses.
    On-line help prompts you through all operations, making a manual
    redundant for all but extreme power users.
    
    EXECUTIVE EDITOR is not intended as a replacement for your word processo
    (though it has more text handling capabilities than some), nor is it
    intended as a replacement for your database (though many databases would
    like to handle 64K fields!).  EXECUTIVE EDITOR was written for it's
    programmer's own use, that is as a front end to a desktop publisher, and
    as a convenient storage facility for drafts and notes. Along the way to
    completing the program it was discovered that it is an ideal batch file
    editor, a handy researcher's notebook, and a perfect add-on to most
    laptop computers.
