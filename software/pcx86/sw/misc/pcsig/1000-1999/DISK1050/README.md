## Information about "MAGIC, HANDWRITING, & MENU"

    If you are a single-finger hunt-and-peck typist, or even a fast touch-
    typist, MAGIC FINGERS will help you run most programs for the IBM-PC and
    compatible computers.
    
    A RAM-resident macro program, it has several features that improve the
    rate and accuracy of your typing by reducing the amount of repetitive
    typing you do in your favorite programs -- such as wordprocessors,
    database programs, accounting packages, and programming languages.
    Substitute single keystrokes for long and repetitive text strings or
    commands.  Get done faster with greater accuracy.

    MFSETUP  DAT  Data file.
    README        Documentation file.
    
    HANDWRITING ANALYST asks you several questions about a person's
    signature, and then produces a summary or detailed report on that
    person based on your responses.
    
    Each report includes information on physical and material drives,
    intellectual style, personality traits, social behavior, and vocational
    implications.  You can display on- screen, print, or write the report
    to a disk file.  Save the answers to the questions for up to 20
    signatures on the disk.  The signature report of this program can be
    either a direct description of the person, or it can describe how that
    person wants others to see him.

    Do you have problems in properly executing a DOS command, or getting
    immediate access to various programs and utilities on your computer?
    Are you tired of staring at a screen with no instructions to guide you?
    If this is so, you should take a look at ADVANCED MENU.
    
    Most menu control programs use regular batch files to execute programs
    and DOS commands, but ADVANCED MENU also uses special command files that
    have more options.
    
    Among these options are:
    
    ~ Password protection for any menu selection, including DOS access
    
    ~ Complete DOS commands entered
    
    ~ Uncompleted commands finished
    
    ~ Conditional command execution
    
    A command file is created with the menu selections for the
    program.  Each command file can have up to 32 menu selections with
    custom titles, and a menu command can load another command file.
    Command files can execute most DOS commands and work faster than
    regular batch files.  ADVANCED MENU can handle an unlimited number of
    command files.
