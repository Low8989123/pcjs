## Information about "ACM VOL 1-5 3 OF 4 (ALSO 1008,1009,1011)"

    Here is a collection of Fortran routines/procedures for solving
    various problems in the areas of science, engineering, and numerical
    analysis.
    
    Some of the many routines covered:
    
    ~ Solution of zeros of polynomials
    
    ~ Various partial differential equation solvers
    
    ~ Linear equation solvers for over/under-determined problems (L1, L2
    and Chebyshev norms)
    
    ~ Eigenvalue solvers
    
    ~ Function integration
    
    ~ Minimization of unconstrained multivariate functions
    
    ~ Curve-fitting in Chebyshev norm
    
    ~ Dependence of solution of nonlinear systems on its parameters
    
    ~ Sorting
    
    ~ Global error estimation for ordinary differential equations
    
    ~ Matrix bandwidth and profile reduction
    
    ~ Spline interpolation
    
    ~ Solution of linear systems for special matrices
    
    ~ Cubic curve-fitting using local data
    
    ~ Computation of condition numbers of a matrix without computing
    eigenvectors
    
    ~ Bessel functions
    
    ~ Statistical functions
    
    ~ Revised simplex method for constrained resource network scheduling
    
    ~ Exact solution of integer systems of linear equations
    
    ~ Convex hull algorithm for planar sets
    
    ~ A multiple-precision arithmetic package
    
    ~ Adaptive smooth curve-fitting
    
    ~ Basic linear algebra subprograms (BLAS)

solvers, function integration, minimization of unconstrained multivariate
functions, curve fitting in Chebyshev norm, dependence of solution of
nonlinear systems on its parameters, sorting, global error estimation for
ordinary differential equations, matrix bandwidth and profile reduction,
spline interpolation, solution of linear systems for special matrices,
cubic curve fitting using local data, computation of condition numbers of a
matrix without computing eigenvectors, bessel functions, statistical
functions, revised simplex method for constrained resource network
scheduling, exact solution of integer systems of linear equations, convex
hull algorithm for planar sets, a multiple-precision arithmetic package,
adaptive smooth curve fitting, basic linear algebra subprograms (BLAS),
