## Information about "SCIENTIFIC & ENGINEERING TOOLS FOR LOTUS"

    This is a template for people who are already well-versed in Lotus 1-2-3
    and are interested in applying it to solving more advanced statistical
    problems.  Among other things it simplifies the use of simple
    arithmetic, facilitates statistical macro programming, calculates
    frequency distribution and normal distribution of data, and does four
    types of curve-fitting.  The template taps Lotus' mathematical abilities
    to solve complicated problems and to permit the user to customize it to
    his or her particular needs.
    
    It is similar in concept to other spreadsheet templates in that it makes
    the macro language and advanced formula functions more accessible to the
    user. However, it is specialized in the area of engineering-type
    statistics.
