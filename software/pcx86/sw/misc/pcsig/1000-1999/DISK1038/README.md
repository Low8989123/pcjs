## Information about "EAMON:  ASSAULT ON THE CLONE MASTER"

    Become a character in a land of adventure and do great and marvelous
    deeds!  In this fantasy role-playing game, your first goal is to stay
    alive while getting rich during your questing.
    
    When you enter these different universes, you are no longer John (or
    Jane) Smith -- a quiet, mild-mannered computer hobbyist.  Instead, you
    are, ta-dah!, in the center of a tale of adventure -- fighting orcs,
    trolls, dragons, knights, and mages with an arsenal of weapons and
    terrible magic.
    
    An entire series of adventures await you, starting with The Main Hall
    and including Ice Cave -- sagas with all the appropriate monsters and
    traps.  The challenges are difficult, but not impossible to survive,
    and will keep you on the edge of your chair.  The monsters are very
    mean and give up their lives to stop you from getting any further in
    your quest!

Disk No  1038
Program Title: EAMON ADVENTURE, ASSAULT on the CLONE MASTER (Disk 3 OF 4)
PC-SIG version 1

    That last adventure of yours was a little scary. Fighting all those
monsters made you more expereinced, but at what price? You were nearly
killed! As you lay back on your bed tring to rest from the excitement
of the past few days, you start to feel strange. You hear a high
pitched buzzing and then see a bright light--then everything goes dark.

    You open your eyes and the surroundings have changed. Not again, you
say to yourself. As you are walking along a strange path, you come across a
group of people. Being friendly, you decide to speak with them. They
sympathize with your position and agree to help you get back to where you
came from--but only after you do them a small, insignificant favor. They
tell you that you must kill the evil Clone Master and destroy The
Cloneatorium or they will kill you. Hearing this, you think for a few
minutes and, since they have such a way with words, you decide to help.
