## Information about "WORTHY OPPONENT"

    WORTHY OPPONENT is a competitive, challenging, and entertaining game
    package that actually allows you to play games over your modem with
    other opponents.
    
    What makes WORTHY OPPONENT unique are the sophisticated communications
    capabilities.  Game competition occurs with an opponent miles away.  You
    can still taunt and jeer at your opponent with every move.  Discuss
    anything you like; strategy, good/bad moves, etc. with the specialized
    "talk" capabilities.
    
    With excellent graphics, WORTHY OPPONENT is completely menu-driven and
    has on-line help screens to explain all functions.  Four games are on
    the disk: Snake Pit, CornerStone, Checkers, and CannonBall.
    
    Tournament play is also available where you can play against remote
    opponents using the on-screen clock.
