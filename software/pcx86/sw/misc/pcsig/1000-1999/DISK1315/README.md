## Information about "ERB, MINIMUF, HIGH POINT (DIVERSLOG 2050"

    EXTERIOR RIFLE BALLISTICS (ERB) is an aid for those sportsmen who reload
    their own ammunition.
    
    Determine expected bullet rise if the target is before the adjusted ZERO
    point, and bullet drop downrange beyond the adjusted ZERO point.  It
    saves deciphering of ballistic tables to estimate the correct
    combination of powder and primer for a bullet.
    
    A MUF calculator for the amateur radio operator.
    
    MINIMUF computes the Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF) for specified paths
    for a 24-hour period given in GMT (UTC).  The program gives the MUF for
    one path and draws a graph.  You can select from 15 pre-programmed
    paths or you can enter the latitude and longitude coordinates for any
    path in a setup data file.  The graph is displayed in the text mode so
    it can be printed on all IBM compatible printers.
    
    HIGH POINTS belongs at your next meet or sporting event.  Designed to
    assist in judging competitive events, it calculates and provides judges
    (and journalists) with tallies and standings, instantly.
    
    The program handles events of one to 10 rounds with up to 400
    participants grouped by one to 10 classes.  The data entry screen is
    self explanatory and the documentation contains many useful hints and
    precautions for the actual events.
    
    Save data to a file or print results of a round or current standings at
    any time.  There is even a supplementary program to help resolve ties
    when the judges are required to include secondary criteria.

                             MINIMUF PROGRAM OPERATION
                                    Version 1.00
                         by Keith Seabourn, 5N6SKD & KD5NZ
            
            These program calculates the Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF)
            for specified paths for a 24 hour period given in GMT (UTC).
            The program gives the MUF for 1 path and draws a graph.  The
            user can select from 15 pre-programmed paths or can enter
            the latitude and longitude coordinates for any path desired.
            The program can customized for any QTH by putting the
            necesary information in a setup file.
            
            The program operates the screen in the text mode as opposed
            to the graphics mode.  The text mode is common to all IBM-
            compatible equipment whereas the graphics mode is not.  By
            using the text mode, all access is provided to greater
            numbers of amateur radio operators.  Also, the text mode
            allows any printer to be used to obtain a printed copy of
            the screen graph.  The printers use widely different
            standards for their graphics mode of operation.
            
            SETUP FILE
            
            A SETUP FILE called MUFSETUP.DAT customizes MINIMUF to your
            exact callsign and QTH.  It also contains 15 path choices.
            This disk is originally supplied with MUFSETUP.DAT
            containing information for a QTH in Dallas, Texas.  You
            should use any ASCII text file editor or a word processor
            that can read/write ASCII text files to create a
            MUFSETUP.DAT for your exact QTH.
            
            The MUFSETUP.DAT file should be created as follows:
            
            Line 1 would contain your callsign; your station latitude;
            your station longitude (all separated by semicolons)
            
            Line 2 to Line 16 would contain paths in the format path
            name; destination latitude; destination longitude (again
            separated by semicolons)
            
            NOTE:  MINIMUF expects Choices 16 and 17 to always be
            exactly as they are written.  The user must only enter 15
            path options in MUFSETUP.DAT.  The program requests
            additional data if Option 16 or 17 are chosen.  The user may
            freely change path options 1-15.  The latitude and longitude
            conventions used in this program are:
                      Latitude North is positive (+)
                      Latitude South is negative (-)
                      Longitude West is positive (+)
                      Longitude East is negative (-)
            




            MINIMUF DOCUMENTATION                     Page 1










            An example is:
                      KD5NZ;33.0;97.0
                      To USA-W.Coast(San Fran);38.0;122.0
                      To USA-E.Coast (Wash DC);39.0;73.0
                      To USA-Hawaii;21.0;158.0
                      To AFRICA-Zambia;-15.0;-28.0
                             |
                             |
                             v
                      To ASIA-Japan;36.0;-140.0
                      To EUROPE-London;51.0;0.0
            
            The maximum lengths of the various items are:
            Station Callsign              11 characters

            Station Latitude,             7 characters maximum (-xxx.xx)
                 Longitude

            Path Name                     24 characters

            Destination Lat, Lon          7 characters (same as Station
                                               Lat, Lon)

            The best way to customize the MUFSETUP.DAT is to use your
            word processor/text editor to read the MUFSETUP.DAT supplied
            with the program disk, called MUFSETUP.DAT.  Then modify the
            station call, station latitude/longitude and any path names
            and latitude/longitude.
            
            PROGRAM OPERATION
              The user works through the requested information.
              1. Choice.  The user must enter a choice from 1 to 17.
                 Press RETURN when ready to proceed.
              2. Day and month.  Enter the day and month as day <space>
                 month.  The <space> separates the 2 entries.  Enter
                 RETURN to proceed.
              3. Source of solar activity.  Enter either 's' for Sunspot
                 data or 'f' for Solar flux data.  RETURN to proceed.
              4. Sunspot number or Solar Flux.  Enter the correct value.
                 RETURN to proceed.
              5. Flag on MUF.  A 'y' will cause the graph to show a
                 special character when the MUF exceeds the frequency
                 entered.   A 'n' to omit flag.  RETURN to proceed. If
                 'y' selected, the user is asked to enter frequency in
                 MHz.  All points which exceed this frequency are
                 plotted with a different character.
            
            The MUF is calculated for all times from 0000z to 2300z at
            this time.  The screen shows the MUF information both
            graphically and tabular.
              




            MINIMUF DOCUMENTATION                     Page 2










              6. Want Printout (Y/N)?  Enter 'y' to print a hard copy of
                 this screen data.  Make sure the printer is turned on
                 and paper inserted before proceeding. Type an 'n' to
                 omit hard copy.  RETURN to proceed.
              7. Plot another (Y/N)?  Enter 'y' to calculate the MUF for
                 another path.  If 'y' is chosen, the 17 path choices
                 will appear again.  However, the items 2-5 are omitted
                 and the previous values are repeated for the new path.
                 Type an 'n' to cancel program.  RETURN to proceed.
            
            PROGRAM OUTPUT
            
            The program presents the MUF for the chosen path on the
            screen both graphically and in tabular form.  By pressing
            'y' when the question Want Printout (Y/N)? is asked, the
            program will print a copy of the screen.  The program sends
            no special printer control characters so any printer that
            can print 80 columns will work satisfactorily.  The program
            will use the default state of the printer (the normal,
            power-up state).
