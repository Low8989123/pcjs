## Information about "STORM"

    STORM is a hurricane-tracking program which lets you enter data on new
    storms and track up to four storms at a time on a map of the Atlantic,
    Gulf, or Caribbean in either CGA, EGA, or VGA resolution.
    
    STORM is menu-driven and uses beautiful graphics to display the maps and
