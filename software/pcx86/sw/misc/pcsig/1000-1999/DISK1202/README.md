## Information about "EZ-FORMS LITE"

    EZ-FORMS LITE solves the major problem for the business which needs a
    multitude of forms. EZ-FORMS LITE is a powerful forms generation and
    management system that helps you create forms on your screen, print and
    store them, edit them later, and, if you choose, use your PC to fill
    them out. The program allows you to use your PC to fill out other pre-
    printed forms and lets you preview the output on your screen to prevent
    errors. The person who currently spends too much to get a few thousand
    forms from a printer will find this program financially and
    aesthetically appealing.
    
    With context-sensitive help screens, the program handles any IBM
    compatible printer, including the 24-pin and lasers. Extra fonts are
    available from the author (EZX) for lasers. Color controls are
    excellent and forms may be sized up to 88 lines by 132 columns. When
    this program is used, you can be prevented from typing in the wrong
    part of a form. Form numbering is available and time and date can be
    generated at time of execution, vital ways to prevent employee theft at
    the order desk. You can make up all your own forms -- the time needed
    is brief -- or order disks full of additional forms from EZX and alter
    them to fit your needs. The program allows you to print up to 255 forms
    at a time. The on-disk manual gives you extensive, well-presented
    documentation.
    
    Features include:
    
    ~ Solid borders, lines, shades, combs and numerous graphics with
    just a few key strokes
    
    ~ Auto-time/date/sequence numbering
    
    ~ Block cut/paste/copy, import/export
    
    ~ Forms up to 130 columns by 86 lines
    
    ~ Complete printer drivers included. Supports most printers including
    Epson(tm)/IBM and compatible printers; also the HP-LaserJet(tm) and
    compatibles ("Y" cartridge; other fonts may vary -- see soft font pack
    below). Over 90 user modifiable forms also included
    
    ~ Bolding and underlining
    
    ~ 90+ basic forms template/style sheet pack included.
