                               INTRODUCTION


   SARAH'S DIARY organizes your diary entries in a easy to use electronic
database.   With the date locator, you can instantly  find  the diary entry
for that date. Help is available by pressing  <F1>.   Two report  functions
are  available.   One  just  prints the diary entry you have chosen and the
other prints all diary entries.  Diary entries may be up to 10  pages  long
(over  11,900  characters),  enough  for  even  the  most  ambitious  diary
enthusiast!   SARAH'S DIARY  will allow  unlimited  number  of  records.
You  may  enter thousands of entries and locate the one you want almost
instantly.
   SARAH'S DIARY is a fast program  using sophisticated state of the art
database and information processing techniques.  One of my goals was to
include an easy to understand user-interface.  This program has a short
learning curve and is fun to use.  You will be up and running in no
time.
If you have a question first press F1 to activate the help facility.  If
you are still confused refer to this document.  For those that are really
stuck in the mud you may contact my by mail for technical assistance.
Note: you must be registered to receive technical assistance!
  SARAH'S DIARY was written for the beginner to advanced computer user.
It provides a low cost alternative to powerful diary management
and organization.  You don't have to know any programming or be a computer
whiz with a PhD.  That is not who this program has been written for.  It is
meant for the computer user who uses the computer as a tool or aid.
  SARAH'S DIARY requires an IBM PC or compatible with at least 512k memory,
DOS 2.0 or higher, any monitor, a hard disk and graphics printer is
recommended.  Before using this program, you should be familiar with your
computer and DOS.

                              GETTING STARTED

   Your program diskette should contain at least the following 3 files:

                                 DIARY.EXE
                                 DIARY.HLP
                                 DIARY.DOC

If these files are not on your distribution diskette this program will not
operate correctly.  Contact your distributor from whom you purchased the
program.


INSTRUCTIONS

1.  install the distribution diskette in floppy drive a and close the door
2.  copy all files to the subdirectory you want or onto another floppy disk
    (eg. COPY A:*.* C:\DIARY
3.  make a backup copy of the original distribution diskette
    (who ever does?)
4.  put in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file the following commands:
                  FILES=40
                  BUFFERS=40
5.  to run, type DIARY <enter>

That's all there is to it!  The rest of this manual is optional reference
material.  Most of your questions can be answered by the on-line help in
the program.  GOOD LUCK AND HAVE A NICE DAY!

                                DATE TABLE

   You will be in the DATE TABLE when you start the program.   If  you  are
new  to the program the UPDATE FORM will automatically open so you can type
in  a  diary entry.  The first field on the DATE TABLE is the DATE LOCATOR.
Here you can enter in a date in the form JAN 22,1989 and when you  press
<Enter>  the  program  will position the highlite bar in the scrolling date
table on that date and retrieve that record.  Pressing <Enter>  again  will
allow  you  to  CHANGE  or  VIEW  that record in the UPDATE FORM.  To add a
record press <Ins>. To delete a record press <Del>.  To print  all  records
press <F7>.  <Esc> will take you back to the DATE LOCATOR if you are in the
scrolling  table.   <Ctrl  Esc>  will  exit  the program and return to DOS.
Press <F1> for help.

                                UPDATE FORM

    You  will  be  in  the UPDATE FORM when you want to edit, view, add, or
delete  a diary entry or record.  The blinking message field just below the
title "UPDATE FORM" tells you which action you have  selected  (eg.  Record
will be added"). The cursor is first  placed  on  the  date field.  Today's
date  will  be in this field.  You may change it but it is required.  After
entering the date press <Enter>.  You are then in  the  diary  entry  field
where  you  may  type  in  your diary entry.  Diary entries may be up to 10
pages long.  When you have finished press <Ctrl Enter> which will take  you
back  to  the  DATE TABLE.  <Ctrl Esc> from the UPDATE FORM will cancel the
diary entry and return you to the DATE TABLE.  <F5> will  print  just  that
record or diary entry.  A graphics printer is recommended.  <Esc> will take
you  back  one  field.   For example, if you are in the diary entry and you
press <Esc> then you will be taken to the DATE field.

    OVERALL, I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE A VERY COMPLICATED PROGRAM  AN  EASY  AND
USEFUL  TOOL  TO HAVE AROUND THE OFFICE OR HOME.   GETTING YOUR FEET WET BY
TRYING THE PROGRAM IS THE BEST WAY TO LEARN IT.
