## Information about "MODULA-2 COMPILER 2 OF 2 (ALSO 1080)"

    The MODULA-2 COMPILER (M2C) proves you don't have to buy a
    commercial package to get a full-featured compiler!  M2C features the
    compiler combined with an integrated editor and ``make'' facility, a
    program linker, an execution profiler, and a makefile generator.
    
    Code generated by the M2C suits either the Intel 8086 ``huge'' or
    ``large'' memory models.  More restrictive memory models are not
    supported.  For the ``huge'' model, each module has its own data and
    code segment.  Each of the segments can be up to 64K in size.  For the
    ``large'' memory model, static data from all the modules is combined
    into a single data segment.  For either model, pointers are four bytes
    long and all remaining memory is available for the ``heap''.
    
    The package includes 37 pages of well-written and indexed
    documentation.

Disk No: 1081
Program Title:  MODULA-2 COMPILER version 2.0a (Disk 2 of 2)
PC-SIG version:  2

The MODULA-2 COMPILER (M2C) proves that you don't have to buy a
commercial package to get a full-featured compiler!  M2C features the
compiler combined with an integrated editor, "make" facility, a program
linker, an execution profiler, and a makefile generator.

Code generated by the M2C suits either the Intel 8086 "huge" or "large"
memory model.  More restrictive memory models are not supported.  For
the "huge" model, each module has its own data and code segment.  Each
of the segments can be up to 64K in size.  For the "large" memory model,
static data from all the modules is combined into a single data segment.
For either model, pointers are 4 bytes long and all remaining memory is
available for the "heap."  The package includes 37 pages of indexed
documentation which are well written and understandable.  This is the
second disk in the set, the first is #1080.

Usage:  Modula Programming Utilities.

Special Requirements:  512K memory and the Modula programming language.

How to Start:  Type GO (press enter).
