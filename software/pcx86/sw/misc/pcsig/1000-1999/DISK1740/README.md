## Information about "A2Z"

    A2Z is a multi-link fixed-structure database. Dynamically link to any
    number of files under macro control. It is best suited to handle
    complex database operations where text-based or home data-filers dare
    not tread.
    
    A2Z is an unusual database manager with simple relational capabilities
    linking files with a common record number. Its structure also enables
    very quick database operations. The power of this database can be used
    best by someone with a knowledge of Boolean logic or programming
    experience. Autocode, A2Z's macro compiler, uses editor-created
    external macro files to create very powerful and complex Boolean
    structures, including nested IFs, substring handling, and conditional
    access to link file data.
