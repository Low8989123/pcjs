## Information about "THE MANAGER'S TOOLBOX"

    If you know your business, you know you need these strong business
    management tools for financial statistical analysis.  Included are
    menu-driven applications for breakeven analysis, predicting bankruptcy,
    inventory analysis, make or buy decision, queuing theory, financial
    analysis, forecasting, and sampling for defects.
    
    Most of the methods are very versatile in that they will offer you
    several ways of working the same problem.  This allows you to solve for
    the exact information you need.  If you wish to obtain a printout of any
    screen, press the shift key and the print screen key at the same time.
    This program does not store any data; when you move to the next screen
    all data is lost.
    
    On-line instructions provide basic information on how to use the tools.
    A documentation file that explains the application of tools is included.
    A prior understanding of finance and statistics is helpful, but not
    necessary.
