       1.  INTRODUCTION

       Stock Charts is for the investor with an eye toward
       technical analysis of stocks or mutual funds.  Stock Charts
       graphically displays the price and volume action of stocks
       or mutual funds by producing charts similar to those found
       in books on technical analysis of the stock market.  The
       program charts high, low, close, volume, and moving averages
       of stocks, mutual funds, or stock averages such as the Dow
       Jones Industrial Average.

       A function key provides graph printing capabilities and a
       menuing interface provides easy data management (inputting,
       reviewing, and deleting information).

       Stock Charts produces high resolution black and white CGA
       graphics and full color EGA graphics on IBM personal
       computers and compatibles.


       2.  HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

       In order to run the Stock Charts software, you must have an
       IBM personal computer or a strict compatible and a CGA or
       EGA graphics card.

       MS-DOS version 2.0 or higher is also required.


       3.  A QUICK DEMONSTRATION OF STOCK CHARTS

       To begin working with Stock Charts, make a directory and
       copy the following files to it.

            stkcht.exe
            stock.lst

                                  - 5 -



       4.  COLLECTING STOCK PRICE AND VOLUME DATA

       Stock Charts is designed for the small investor who keeps
       track of day-to-day stock price and volume movements through
       sources such as the Wall Street Journal or some other
       financial publication.  At present, there is no capability
       to download data from online databases.

       However, if there is sufficient feedback showing an interest
       in this feature, it may be considered in a future release of
       Stock Charts.


       5.  FORMAT FOR ENTERING DATA

       The following guidelines must be adhered to when entering
       data or responding to some of the prompts within Stock
       Charts' menus.  Failure to do so will result in corrupted
       stock data files.

       5.1  THE STOCK SYMBOL PROMPT

       Use stock symbols when responding to the "Enter stock
       symbol:" prompt.  The "stock symbol" is the stock exchange
       trading symbol that is assigned to a particular issue (e.g.,
       the AT&T stock symbol is T).

       5.2  ENTERING DATES AND RESPONDING TO DATE PROMPTS

       When entering dates and responding to date prompts, the date
       entered must be in the following format:

            01/12/89

            or

            12/21/89

       5.3  ENTERING PRICE DATA

       When entering price data, all prices must be in decimal
       notation.  For example, to enter 24 1/4, as the high price
       for a particular day, you must type 24.25 in response to the
       "High:" prompt.


















                                  - 6 -



       6.  NAVIGATING WITHIN STOCK CHART MENUS

       To navigate to a particular menu within Stock Charts, simply
       strike the key number shown to the left of the menu.  To
       leave a menu or chart screen, strike the <Esc> key.


       7.  AN OVERVIEW OF STOCK CHART MENUS

       After entering Stock Charts, the main menu appears with the
       following entries:

            1 - Draw charts
            2 - List stocks
            3 - Add data
            4 - Delete/Insert data
            5 - View data
            6 - Exit program

       A discussion of each of these entries follows.

       7.1  DRAW CHARTS

       The "Draw charts" selection charts the price and volume
       movement of stocks.  Charts are scaled based on the high and
       low prices for a particular time frame.  Therefore when the
       first set of data for a stock is entered, the high and low
       prices will span the entire y axis.  The chart will assume a
       more natural scaled appearance after a month or two of
       entering data.

       Three different charts may be drawn - they are:

            High, Low, Close, and Volume
            Close and Volume only
            Close, Moving average, and Volume

       Sub-menus to the "Draw charts" selection display the
       following prompts:

            Enter stock symbol:
            Enter starting date:
            Enter ending date:

       Read section 5 before responding to any of the prompts.

       At the "Enter starting date:" prompt, enter a starting date
       from which the chart will be drawn and strike <Enter>.

       At the "Enter ending date:" prompt, enter an ending date at
       which the chart will stop and strike <Enter>.  Simply











                                  - 7 -



       striking <Enter> in response to this prompt will draw the
       chart from the starting date to the most current data that
       has been entered or to the end of the x axis.

       If "Chart moving average" is selected, a "Enter number of
       days:" prompt appears.  The number of days is used in
       calculating a moving average.  For example, to chart a 30
       day moving average enter 30 in response to the prompt and
       strike <Enter>.

       Stock charts may be printed on a dot matrix printer by
       striking the <F1> function key after the charts are
       displayed on the screen.  To print charts, the Stock Charts
       program requires the presence of the MS-DOS graphics.com
       program.  The graphics.com program must be accessible either
       from the current directory or through the PATH environment
       variable in your autoexec.bat file.

       7.2  LIST STOCKS

       The "List stocks" selection displays all stock symbols that
       are currently in the database.  The stock symbols are
       presented in a window which can be scrolled upward by
       striking the <Enter> key.  When all symbols have been
       displayed, an "End of List" message is issued.

       7.3  ADD DATA

       The "Add data" selection is used to enter date, high, low,
       close, and volume information for a particular stock.  When
       selected, the following prompts are displayed:

            Enter stock symbol:
            Enter date:
            Enter high:
            Enter low:
            Enter close:
            Enter volume:

       Read section 5 before responding to any of the prompts.

       At the "Enter stock symbol:" prompt, enter the stock trading
       symbol and strike <Enter>.  When responding to this prompt,
       if the stock is not in the working directory, you will be
       prompted to add it to your list of stocks.  After entering
       the stock trading symbol, the last date previously entered
       for the particular issue is displayed in the lower left
       corner.

       At the "Enter date:" prompt, enter the date that will be
       added to the stock's data file and strike <Enter>.  Continue











                                  - 8 -



       responding to the prompts with high, low, close, and volume
       information.

       After responding to the "Enter volume:" prompt, you are
       asked if there is more data that you wish to add to the
       stocks data file.  If the answer is yes, the cycle is
       started again at the "Enter date:"  prompt.

       NOTE: No data is added to the stock's data file until a
       response is entered to the last prompt.  This prompt appears
       as

            Add more data [y or n]:

       Thus, at any point before answering this question, the <Esc>
       key may be depressed and all previously entered data that is
       currently displayed on the screen is erased.

       7.4  DELETE/INSERT DATA

       By selecting "Delete/Insert data" you may remove high, low,
       close, and volume information for a single date, a range of
       dates, or an entire issue.  You may also insert data into an
       existing stock's data file.  The following menu is displayed
       when selecting "Delete/Insert data":

            1 - Remove a single date
            2 - Remove a range of dates
            3 - Remove entire issue
            4 - Insert data

       "Remove a single date" removes one set of data from a
       stock's data file.  A set of data is considered to be the
       high price, low price, closing price, and volume for a
       particular date.  "Remove a range of dates" removes multiple
       sets of data from a stock's data file.  You are prompted to
       enter a starting and ending date for the range.  "Remove
       entire issue" erases the stock data file from the disk.
       "Insert data" will insert one set of data after the date
       that you enter in response to the "Insert after what date:"
       prompt.

       7.5  VIEW DATA

       "View data" allows you to review data that has been entered
       into a stock's data file.  The following menu is displayed
       when "View data" is selected.















                                  - 9 -



            1 - Scroll entire file
            2 - Scroll from specific date
            3 - View specific date

       "Scroll entire file" will scroll through an entire stock's
       data file from beginning to end.  "Scroll from specific
       date" scrolls from the date entered to the end of the
       stock's data file.  "View specific date" displays
       information on the specific date entered.

       The data is presented in a window which can be scrolled
       upward by striking the <Enter> key.  When all the data for a
       particular stock has been displayed, an "End of Data"
       message is issued.

       7.6  EXIT PROGRAM

       Selecting "Exit program" will exit the program and return
       you to the DOS environment.


       8.  SUPPORT AND DISTRIBUTION OF STOCK CHARTS

       Plans are now underway to provide Stock Charts with a better
       menuing interface and additional charting capabilities.
