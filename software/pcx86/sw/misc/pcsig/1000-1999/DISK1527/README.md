## Information about "BULKMAIL"

    Made for businesses and nonprofit organizations, BULKMAIL is a
    heavyweight mailing list manager designed to make the job of preparing
    U.S. domestic bulk mail as fast and easy as possible.
    
    Written in C language for maximum speed, BULKMAIL is a work horse able
    to handle the management, sorting, and printing of up to 32,767
    address and name records.  And it has well thought out features to help
    you churn through the tiresome process of getting 3rd class mail out the
    door.
    
    Filters allow you to select records by a starting name or an ending
    name, a starting zip code or an ending zip code, a starting date or an
    ending date, two flags, and an alphanumeric category field.  Add to
    this sixteen switches in each record that can be used in any
    combination to select or reject records.  All records are maintained in
    both name and zip code sequence.  You can re-sequence at any time to
    refilter records to include those only of interest.  You can sort by
    telephone number.
    
    Well crafted templates speed record updating.  Template changes can be
    made on the fly.  When you print using zip code order, BULKMAIL marks
    labels so you'll know when to tie off bundles without counting.
    BULKMAIL lets you protect your data disks with passwords.
    
    If you use form letters, BULKMAIL data files can be created to be
    compatible with Micropro International's MailMerge form letter feature
    along with a number of other word processors.
    
    The program allows you to configure your printer output to a specific
    label output.  It will also transfer a subset of one mailing list to
    another.  It imports ASCII files and allows you to purge subsets of
    records from a mailing list.

Program Title:  BULKMAIL 3.6
PC-SIG version 1

Made for businesses and nonprofit organizations, BULKMAIL is a
heavyweight mailing list manager designed to make the job of preparing
U.S. domestic bulk mail as fast and easy as possible.

Written in C language for maximum speed, BULKMAIL is a work horse able
to handle the management, sorting and printing of up to 32,767 address
and name records.  And it has well thought out features to help you
churn through the tiresome process of getting 3rd Class mail out the
door.

Filters allow you select records by a starting name or an ending name, a
starting zip code or an ending zip code, a starting date or an ending
date, two flags, and an alphanumeric category field.  Add to this
sixteen switches in each record that can be used in any combination to
select or reject records.  All records are maintained in both name and
zip code sequence.  You can re-sequence at any time to refilter records
to include those only of interest.  You can sort by telephone number.

A touch of a function key takes you to the first record, last record,
previous record or next record.  You can find specific records in an
instant.  The program is so sensitive you can isolate records by first
or last name in separate fields and may enter records in either first or
last name order.  They are reversed when labels are printed.

Well crafted templates speed record updating.  Template changes can be
made on the fly.  When you print using zip code order, BULKMAIL marks
labels so you'll know when to tie off bundles without counting.
BULKMAIL lets you protect your data disks with passwords.

If you use form letters, BULKMAIL datafiles can be created to be
compatible with Micropro International's MailMerge form letter feature
along with a number of other word processors.

The program allows you to configure your printer output to a specific
label output.  It will also transfer a subset of one mailing list to
another.  It imports ASCII files and allows you to purge subsets of
records from a mailing list.  Alphanumeric context searches can be made
within all fields, marking records which contain the search object.  It
checks lists for duplicates and configures lists for particular
printers.
