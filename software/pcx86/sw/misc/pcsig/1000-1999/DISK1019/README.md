PC-PAYROLL is a complete, menu driven payroll system for moderate sized
companies, up to 40 employees for floppy based systems, up to 200 employees 
on hard disk systems.  PC-PAYROLL accepts hourly, salary and tips as well as
bonuses and commissions.  A variety of pay period options, overtime, and
after-the-fact conditions can be accommodated.

Federal, state and local taxes, FICA, withholding and user defined
deductions, 401(K) Plans and Cafeteria Plans are internally
computed.  The authors have included necessary tax computations
in the program, and an appendix accommodates taxes of several
states which have special, additional requirements.

Paychecks are printed in several standard formats.

A full range of reports are included; monthly, quarterly and
year-to-date summaries, Federal Tax reports (W2, W3, 941) and a pay
period detail.

PC-PAYROLL is well organized, and appears to have as complete a list of
facilities as commercial, remote batch processing payroll systems which
many small firms commonly use.

PC-PAYROLL requires periodic updates for internal tax tables.  A
subscription to PC-PAYROLL is available, and includes a printed manual
and periodic updates for each year.

NOTE:  A companion program, PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, is available to handle
departments, vacation or sick leave, and personnel management.  
Information on the PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT program is available on request.

                          INTRODUCTION

OVERVIEW

    PC-PAYROLL, an automated payroll system, is most effective
when used with a payroll of 100 employees or less. The program
handles a weekly payroll of up to 40 full-time employees and one
year of payroll data on one floppy disk or approximately 200
employees on a hard drive.

    PC-PAYROLL provides--

    . Two user-defined incomes and wages, overtime, salary
      and tips.  You can combine or use separately.

    . Automatic federal, state, local and social security
      tax computations from internal tax tables.

    . Automatic federal and state unemployment and State
      Disability Insurance (SDI) computations.

    . Weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly and monthly payroll
      frequencies.

    . You can also select after-the-fact payroll.

    . Thirty company files for accountants, bookkeepers and
      payroll services.

    . User-defined deductions, both fixed and variable, as
      well as deductions for 401(K) plans, cafeteria plans
      and advance wages.

    . Fringe benefits.

    . Federal, state, period, monthly, quarterly, and
      year-to-date reports and standard check formats.


SUBSCRIPTIONS

     Subscriptions to PC-PAYROLL are for one year and must be
paid annually by the anniversary date of the subscription.  An
invoice will be mailed to all subscribers two months before
expiration of the subscription.  In order to receive updates
and/or support, please keep your subscription current.


GENERAL INFORMATION

    PC-PAYROLL requires an IBM-PC, XT, AT, PS-2 or any one of
most IBM-compatible computers with two double-sided disk drives
or one hard disk.  The program also requires a memory of 384K,
DOS of 2.0 or greater and a printer.

    PC-PAYROLL is easy to use, with well-defined menu selections
on each screen.  You should, however, be familiar with the
computer keyboard, the Disk Operating System (DOS) and disk
commands (such as FORMAT and COPY) and the difference between
system and non-system disks.  Refer to your DOS manual for this
information.

                                2

                         GETTING STARTED

OVERVIEW

    Use the original PC-PAYROLL program diskettes ONLY to copy
your working diskette.  Write-protect tabs are normally placed on
the original copy to prevent accidental erasure and to prohibit
configuration data files on the original disk.  Instructions on
how to make copies of PC-PAYROLL for your own personal use follow
in Installing PC-PAYROLL.


USING THE MANUAL

    Manual Design.  The PC-PAYROLL Manual is designed for easy
use.  The manual discusses all menus and screens, with steps
given for each program process.  The tables, in particular, will
either aid you in entering the correct data for each prompt on a
given screen and will give you the purpose for each function key
on a screen.

    Many of the functions and screens are identified throughout
the manual, as in the following example:


             System Configuration (X) (Screen X.3.0)


    System Configuration is the menu selection, X is the key you
need to press to access the System Configuration and Screen X.3.0
is the screen number.

    The screen number, Screen X.3.0, is significant, as X
indicates the program module, 3 represents the function selected
(function key 3 on the module menu) and 0 is the number of
screens deep within the function.


USING PC-PAYROLL

     To select a menu item, press either the function key, letter
associated with another module, or Esc.  It is not necessary to
press the RETURN/ENTER key (hereafter called RETURN) for
PC-PAYROLL to take action.

    Module menu selections are found at the bottom of each module
menu.  All selections are active although they may not appear in
the menu.  Select, for instance, the System Configuration Menu by
pressing X from any module menu, even though it is not displayed.
Select from the following:

    X  System Configuration
    C  Compute Payroll
    Y  Summary and Federal Reports
    R  Period Reports
    S  State Quarterly Reports
    W  Write Checks/Check Stubs
    D  Tax Deposit        (available only from Main Menu)
    G  PC-GENERAL LEDGER Interface (available on request)


Dot Prompts.  Within each function there are dot prompts, which
when selected, provide you with a description of the expected
entry followed by one or more dots (.....).  These dots are
expecting you to enter data by typing over the dots, after which
you must press the RETURN key.  Most dot prompts will only accept
appropriate information, ie., if a number is required, you will
not be able to enter a letter.  The number of dots represent the
length of the data element.


Date Prompts.  The Date prompt will not have the dots displayed,
but will require entry of the date in the proper format followed
by pressing the RETURN key.  Refer to the Glossary for the proper
date format.


Toggles.  There are several prompts called Toggles.  Toggles
contain specific predefined information such as selecting one of
two local tax rates, plus OFF.  To operate a toggle press the key
indicated.  Pressing the key will change the data element to the
next assigned.  If the toggle contains more than tow elements,
pressing the key again will display the next selection.
Default Prompts.  Several reports contain default entries at a
prompt.  To select the default entry press RETURN.  To select the
alternate entry press the appropriate key.


Printing.  Many reports can be displayed on the screen as well as
printed.  The menu at the bottom of the displayed reports provide
you with ability to print the report or create a disk file that
can be imported by other software, such as word processors or
spreadsheets.  The federal reports also contain the ability to
print directly on the tax form.  Select the option by pressing
the appropriate key.

       Print most reports by press the F10 key when the report is
displayed.  Other reports may be defaulted to the printer without
displaying on the screen.  The federal reports have the option to
print directly on the form.  Except for the W-2's, press F8 to
print on the tax form when the report is displayed on the screen.
INSTALLING PC-PAYROLL

    On a Hard Drive.  Install the enclosed copy of PC-PAYROLL and
any future updates on your hard drive, using the listed steps.

    . Type MD\PAYxx and press RETURN to make a payroll
      subdirectory. (xx is the last two digits of the
      current calendar year, ie., 90.)

      Perform the first step above only when you first install
      PC-PAYROLL.  You will perform all other steps below
      whenever you install updates.

      When installing updates for a new year, remember that the
      previous years data is required for the W-2s and 4the
      quarter returns.  Never install a new edition over the
      previous years edition.

      We recommend you use the year in the name of the payroll
      subdirectory.  Backup and delete a previous years system
      after you complete your required reports.

    . Type CD\PAYxx and press RETURN to change to the
      payroll subdirectory.

    . Insert the original PC-PAYROLL diskette in your floppy
      drive (usually drive A).

    . Type C:COPY a:*.*c: and press RETURN to copy all files
      to your hard disk (a: is your floppy disk; c: is your
      hard drive).

      * After your files have been copied the message
        "10 files copied" will display (the number of
        files may vary).

    . At the C> prompt, type PAY and press RETURN.
    On Floppy Disks.  The original PC-PAYROLL diskette does not
have the Disk Operating System (DOS) installed, nor will the
working disk have room for the disk operating system, making it a
bootable disk.  Use your DOS system diskette, 2.0 or greater, to
set up your copy of PC-PAYROLL and to prepare it for use.  Follow
these steps:

    . Format at least two blank disks WITHOUT THE SYSTEM
      (refer to your DOS manual for information on formatting
      diskettes).  You will need additional disks for backups.

    . Label one formatted disk PROGRAM and the remainder
      label DATA.

      You will perform the first two steps above ONLY the first
      time you install PC-PAYROLL.  You will perform all other
      steps below whenever you install updates.

    . Place the original copy of PC-PAYROLL in drive A, and
      place the PROGRAM disk in drive B.

    . At the A> prompt, type A>COPY *.EXE B: and press
      RETURN.

      * All program files will copy to your working disk.

    . Remove the original disk (drive A) and store it in a
      safe place.

    . Remove the PROGRAM disk from drive B and place it in
      drive A.

    . Insert the DATA disk in drive B.

    . At the A> prompt, type PAY and press RETURN.

      * Make additional DATA disks for periodic back up.

      In order to use PC-PAYROLL, you must first boot your
      computer using your DOS disk.  When you exit PC-PAYROLL you
      must then insert your DOS disk when prompted.

                                3

                      SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

OVERVIEW

    To use the functions available in PC-PAYROLL, you must first
use the System Configuration (X) to configure PC-PAYROLL for your
company.  You can access the System Configuration Menu at any
module menu by pressing X.  The System Configuration assigns
locations for data files and company information and loads it
into memory when you start PC-PAYROLL.

    The System Configuration contains company-unique data. You
can install up to 30 companies on PC-PAYROLL.  Each company must
be configured individually.  The System Configuration consists of
a series of menus that you can select from a central menu by
pressing the appropriate function key for each selection.

    When you first install a new company, the system default
values are automatically inserted.  Change the default data for
your company before adding any employee or payroll information.

    Data files PCPBxx.Dxx and PCPCxx.DAT contain the System
Configuration data.  In the filenames, the "xx" in "PCPBxx"
indicates the year (such as 90) and the "xx" in "Dxx" indicates a
number from 01 to 30 that relates to the code for the company.
Figure 3-1 illustrates the System Configuration Menu.

SETTING UP THE COMPANY DATA FILE (PCPBxx.Dxx)

    The first time you use PC-PAYROLL, after the opening banner,
the System Configuration Menu will display.

    Before continuing with any other part of the program, you
must use the System Configuration to set up the company data file
by using the following steps.

    . Enter a code from 1 to 30 to add or modify a company
      (up to 30 different companies can be entered into one
      copy of the program).

    . Enter the company name.

    . Enter the state where your company is located using
      the two-letter postal abbreviation.

    . Enter the disk drive you want the company data located
      on (normally C for a hard drive or B for two floppies).

      * PC-PAYROLL now loads default information into  memory and
        Screen X.0.0 displays with defaults.  You can now review
        the default data to ensure it satisfies your needs.  At
        Screen X.0.0, you can also add or delete companies or Esc
        to the previous menu.


              Code:        ..
              Company Name:
              Your State:
              Data Drive:


                           figure 3-2


    . To go to the Main Menu, press Esc.

    . To enter your company data or add additional companies in
      PC-PAYROLL, press the appropriate function keys.

    . Select the function key from the System Configuration
      central menu for each menu or action you want to
      review and update.

      * F1 Add/Modify Company File - use to add another
        company or modify a company name (When you modify,
        the previous company data file is destroyed and new
        defaults are inserted. The employee and payroll data
        files remain intact.).

      * F2 Delete Company File - use to delete a company
        file (only the company data will be deleted; the
        employee and payroll data files remain intact.).
        You cannot delete a company you have highlighted.

      PC-PAYROLL will only delete the company and payroll data
      files.  If it is necessary, use DOS to delete the employee
      and tax files (PCPE.Dxx and PCPTxx.Dxx).

      * Use the cursor up-down keys or the home and end
        keys to select a different company data file after
        you have used F1 to set up two or more companies.

      * F4 Company Information (Screen X.4.0)- enter the
        following company information, used for Forms W-2
        addresses, city, county, state (this entry is required

        the company is located), zip code, federal employer
        identification number and state employer identification
        number.  Select the appropriate function key to enter
        the required data.

      * F5 User Defined Tax Rates (Screen X.5.0) - enter the
        following user-defined rates and cutoffs.

      Enter all percentage rates as follows: 7.1 for 7.1%,
      NOT .071.  Standard rates for FICA and UI default for the
      current year.

        - F1 and F2 Local Tax Rate 1 and 2 - displays
          up to two unique local tax rates.  Enter actual
          amounts using Add Employee Data.  See Chapter 4
          (Main Menu), Table 4-1 for detailed instructions
          on entering data.
      
        - F3 Employer Contribution to FICA - enter the
          current rate.

        - F4 Employee Contribution to FICA - enter the

     * F7 User Defined Income/Deductions (Screen X.7.0) -
       use to identify user-defined income and deduction
       descriptions.

      Descriptions are used on all reports and should not be
      modified or deleted during the year.  Additional
      descriptions can be added.  Enter actual amounts to be
      deducted in Add Employee Data.  See Chapter 4, Table 4-1
      for detailed instructions.

     * F8 Payroll Frequency (Screen X.8.0) - use to select
       the payroll frequency and to select the computation
       of taxes based on the employer's business location
       or the employee's home address.

       - F1 - toggle to set the default of the payroll
         frequency in the employee data.  Press F1 to
         select one of eight different payroll frequencies,
         including weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly,
         monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually and
         after-the-fact.

       - F2 - toggle for tax computation based on the
         employer's business location (state) or the
         employee's home address (state).

      This function is used primarily when an employer has
      employees living in two or more states and reciprocal
      agreements for collection of state taxes exist between
      those states.

    * F9 Select Color or Printer Format (Screen X.9.0) -   use to
      select the color option or to select a printer format.

      - F1 - Toggle Color On/Off.  Turns color on.

      - F2 - 80 column format (for any printer).  This
        report format provides greater detail than the
        compressed or 132-column formats below.  Four to
        five records are printed per page depending on
        the report.

      - F3 - 132-column format (requires 132-column
        printer).  This format, as well as the compressed
        format below, provides less detail, but prints 20
        or more records per page.

      - F4 - Compressed format (requires dot-matrix or
        laser printer).

      - F5 - Printer compress code: 15

      - F6 - Printer compress code: 18

      Most dot matrix printers use a compress code of 15 and an
      uncompress code of 18.  PC-PAYROLL defaults to those
      values.  Determine from your printer manual if those codes
      are different, and make the appropriate changes if
      necessary, by selecting the F-key and entering the correct
      numeric code.

USING PASSWORD PROTECTION

    If you want your records accessible to only certain employees
you can activate password protection by following these steps.

From the System Configuration Menu (Screen X.0.0).

    . Press $ (Shift 4).

    . Enter your password.  For example, if you want to use

                            MAIN MENU

OVERVIEW

    The Main Menu (Screen M.0.0) consists of two submenus--
Employee Data and Housekeeping and contains information
concerning the capacity and free space on the data disk.  You can
use the functions in Employee Data to keep your files up to date
by adding and modifying employee data.  Through Housekeeping you
can delete payroll data and back up data.  Figure 4-1 illustrates
the Main Menu.

    The box to the right of screen contains information about the
data disk in use, such as total capacity, available free space
and the sizes of the current payroll data files for the active
company.  If you back up the file to this disk, determine if
enough disk space remains. Ensure at least as much free space as
the largest data file is available.  Data files over 320K cannot
be backed up to a floppy disk, therefore, it is important that
you check this box before backing up you data.

UPDATE EMPLOYEE DATA (Screen M.0.0)

    Add Employee Data (F1) (Screen M.1.0).  By selecting F1 from
the Main Menu you can enter approximately 200 employees into your
payroll system, though floppy disks may be limited to 40 active
employees.  The program assigns the first vacant Employee # to
the employee you enter.  Respond to all prompts (see Table 4-1)
and enter all data before you return to the Main Menu.  To
correct errors or update at a later date, use the modify mode
(see Modify Employee Data).

NOTE: PC-PAYROLL standardizes as many state income taxes as
possible.  Modifications have been made to the program for those
states with unusual withholding formulas, for correct entries in
Exemptions and Marital Status. See Appendix A for variations in
the basic program.

                        allowed.  If no withholding, enter
                        number greater than 30 to force
                        zero taxes.  See Appendix A.
    Modify Employee Data (F2) (Screen M.2.0).  Use this function
to review, modify and delete employee data.  You can update and
review the employee data file any time without affecting payroll
history.  To select--

    . Press F2 (Modify Employee Data) at the Main Menu.

    . Enter the Employee number to display all data you
      entered in Add Employee Data (see Table 4-1).

    . Scroll through the employee data file by pressing N
      for the next record, P for the previous record, A for
      another employee, or M or Esc for the menu.

    . To make changes, press the function key, Shift + F-key
      or Ctrl + F-key for the items you want to modify.  See
      Table 4-1 for descriptions.

    . To delete an employee from Modify Employee Data, use
      the following steps.

      * Press D to delete.  You will be asked: Are you sure?
        Type YES to delete.  Press RETURN if you do NOT want
        to delete the employee displayed.

        -- If no payroll records are present, the employee
           is deleted and the screen returns to the
           Employee # prompt.

        -- You will be notified if payroll records exist,
           and deleting will NOT proceed.  Press RETURN for
           Employee # prompt.

      * Tag the employee for future delete by toggling the
        Ctrl + F7 keys to Employee Inactive.  Inactive
        employees will be deleted at the beginning of the
        year using the Rollover Employee Data procedure.

    Deleting a record adversely affects the printing of all
year-to-date, federal and state reports; thus, you CANNOT
delete an employee with payroll data.

    When a record number becomes vacant through your use of
this function, the next employee added is assigned the
lowest vacant record number.  Deleted employees are denoted
by the word DELETED displayed in the first seven characters
of the employee name and a social security number of
000-00-0000.  It is normal for the remainder of the employee
information may remain in the file until another new
employee is added.

HOUSEKEEPING

    Delete Payroll File (F7) (Screen M.7.0).  Select key F7 from
the Main Menu to delete any existing payroll data file and to
prepare the program to accept a new data file.  Use this process
only to set up the data file before entering new data for the
year. You will be warned that all data will be destroyed.  Press
key F10 to delete records or press RETURN to return to the menu.

    This option is most often used when a new user is practicing
with PC-PAYROLL before actually putting it to use.  You can enter
all the practice data you want and when you are comfortable with
the operation of the program, you can delete the payroll data
file.  The employee data file is NOT affected.


    Date for Report Header (F8) (Screen M.0.0).  The date printed
on printed reports is normally the computer system date, which is
displayed on the Main Menu.  If you set the time before running
PC-PAYROLL, or have an internal clock, the date will be set
correctly.  If the date displayed is incorrect, press F8 on the
Main Menu to set the date.


    Backup Data (F9) (Screen M.9.0).  Use the Backup Data Module
(F9 on the Main Menu) to backup and to restore employee, payroll
and tax deposit data and to sort payroll data by date. This
function does NOT backup the company data file. Backup files are
created with the extension .Bxx and cannot be used without
restoring the files before use.

    NOTE: Use a SEPARATE floppy disk to backup EACH payroll you
maintain.  DO NOT backup on the same floppy or hard drive you use
for your primary data.  A hard disk crash or destruction of the
floppy will destroy all of your valuable data.

    Backing Up Data Using PC-PAYROLL.  You should make backups
after completing each payroll. Use any method that works best for
you to control backup disks.  It is recommended that you use two
different backup disks for each payroll account and that you
alternate between the disks when backing up (sometimes called the
son-father-grandfather method).  Many computer users have lost
many hours of time and valuable data by not making adequate
backups.

    NOTE:  DO NOT use this method to backup data files in excess
of 360K on a floppy disk.  Use a tape backup, the DOS BACKUP
utility, or another commercially available program.  Refer to the
Data Disk Information on the Main Menu to check the data file
size.

   To backup data use the following--

    . Press F9 from the Main Menu.

    . On Screen M.9.0 press the function key for the data to
      be backed up.

              F1  Backup Employee Data
              F2  Backup Payroll Data
              F3  Backup Tax Deposit Data


    . Enter the target drive (the drive you want the data
      stored on) when prompted.

      * Ensure the original data disk is in its normal
        drive.

      * To backup from drive B to drive A when using
        floppies, remove the program disk temporarily and
        insert the backup disk, but replace the program
        before you return to the previous menu or an error
        message will display.

    . Press Esc to return to the Backup Data Menu.

    NOTE:  You will be informed if there is not sufficient disk
space on the target drive.


    Alternate Backup Method.  If you are familiar with DOS, you
can use the DOS commands COPY and RENAME to backup or restore
payroll files. To backup using DOS, ensure you are in the correct
subdirectory and at the C> prompt type--

                          COPY *.D01 A:

    This copies all Company #1 data files from drive C to
drive A.  Continue with your other companies by entering
D02, D03, etc..
    Restoring Data Using PC-PAYROLL.  When you restore data
files, the original data file is written over and destroyed;
therefore, if you must restore a file, ensure you use the latest
backup file.

    To restore data, use the following steps.

    . Press F9 from the Main Menu.

    . Press the function key for the data to be restored:

              F4  Restore Backup Employee Data
              F5  Restore Backup Payroll Data
              F6  Restore Backup Tax Deposit Data


    . Enter the source drive (the drive containing the
      backup data) when prompted.

      * To restore from drive A (source) to drive B (normal
        data drive), remove the program disk temporarily
        while restoring data, but replace it before you
        return to the previous menu or an error message will
        display.



    Sorting Payroll Data.  This function sorts the payroll data
file by payroll date.  Though sorting this file isn't necessary,
doing so can be advantageous, especially if you add payroll data
for a previous payroll or enter current data.  Sorting this file
eliminates duplicate dates listed on the List Payroll Date report
and correctly displays records in Payroll Details by Employee.
To use this function, press F9 from the Main Menu, any then press
F7 from the Backup Menu.  Ensure you have a backup before you
sort.  A power failure at this time WILL destroy the file if it
occurs during a sort.

OVERVIEW

    Use this module to compute paychecks, print one copy of each
check stub (on plain paper) and modify previously computed
payrolls.   To obtain additional copies of check stubs, enter
Write Checks/Check Stubs (W) and use the batch mode.  Figure 5-1
illustrates the Compute Payroll Menu.

    NOTE:  Tax rate withholding formulas are available in this
module for all 50 states,  plus the District of Columbia, and are
base on either the state you enter for your company address or
your employee state of residence, based on your selections in the
System Configuration.  If the state has a state tax, the active
state 9for the company) will display on the menu.  Ensure the
correct state is showing.  If not, you can change the state in
the System Configuration.

PC-PAYROLL METHOD

    PC-PAYROLL differs from other programs that require end
of month and quarter or year-end processing.  In several
payroll systems, the normal computing process entails
summarizing employee records for the period, writing the
records to a data file made for summaries and reports and
then deleting individual records.

    PC-PAYROLL, on the other hand, retains all employee records
for each pay period in the data file for the entire year.  This
method, of course, uses precious disk space; however, it has the
advantage in allowing more flexibility in obtaining reports, ie.,
you can run any report any time without affecting the data base.
In addition, you can easily modify a payroll record if you make a
mistake. The disadvantage is a complete audit trail of
transactions is not given, and as the year progresses, the length
of time to process reports increase (especially using floppy
drives.)

    As you enter payroll data into PC-PAYROLL, a new record is
added for each employee for each period.  Record numbers begin
with 1 and continue throughout the year.  For example, an
employer with 10 employees and a weekly payroll will have 520
(10 x 52) total payroll records for the year.  The records will
be numbered 1 through 520.  Remember this concept when you modify
a payroll.  You will need to enter a record number (which will be
displayed on the screen).  See Modify Previous Paychecks.
COMPUTE PAYCHECKS (F1) (Screen C.1.0)

    Entering the Data.  Compute paychecks with PC-PAYROLL using
the following steps.  See After-the-Fact later.

    . Press F1 Compute Paychecks.

    . When prompted for the date (Screen C.1.1), enter the
      date of the paycheck and press RETURN to continue.

    NOTE:  The date required is the PAYROLL DATE, which is the
date you write the paycheck, NOT the payroll ending date.  The
IRS is  concerned when you pay your employees.  As an example, if
your payroll ending date is December 31, and you write the check
on January 1, you must report that payroll in the new year, not
when they worked.

    . When prompted for the Employee #,  you can--

      * Press F1 to access the Change Default Menu.

      * Press RETURN to exit.  Exit only before you select
        an employee.  Once an employee is selected you must
        compute that payroll record before you exit.

      * Enter the Employee # to complete that employee's
        paycheck.  Ensure you also select and compute
        employees with salary.  A list of active employees
        is displayed, with an * beside each number that a
        payroll has been completed for this period.

    NOTE:  PC-PAYROLL checks for employee records already entered
for this date, notifies your if one is found, and gives you a
chance to reselect an Employee # by pressing the Esc key.  You
can, however, add more than one payroll record for a pay date.

    NOTE:  PC-PAYROLL also check for employees codes as Inactive
in the employee data file and will not allow a payroll to be
computed for the inactive employee.

        -- If you enter an invalid Employee #, the
           Employee # prompt displays again.
    . After selecting an employee, make the appropriate
      entries given in Table 5-1 (Screen C.1.3).  You select
      the active prompts in the System Configuration using
      the Prompt Selection/Options (F6).

    NOTE:  If you are using the After-the Fact payroll frequency,
refer to that section later.

    . Make your entry and press RETURN.  For a zero, press
      RETURN.  To speed entry do not enter trailing zeroes.
      PC-PAYROLL automatically provides the correct
      dollar-and-cent format.

    . If you make errors on previous prompts, press the
      semicolon key (;) and RETURN to back up to the
      previous prompt.

                        compute overtime for salaried
                        employees unless they receive both
                        wages and salary.  To compute
                        overtime, you must enter an amount
                        in Wages in the employee data file.

Advance Wages Paid      Taxable pay advances given to
                        employee, to be included in gross
                        income and treated as a deduction
                        from gross pay before net pay is
                        computed.  See Table 5-2, NOTE on

                        treated as a deduction from gross
                        pay.  Taxes and FICA are computed
                        based on TOTAL tips.  If an employee
                        keeps all tips when received, the
                        tips and advance tips paid MUST be
                        equal.  See Table 5-2.

      delete the data from memory and return to the
      Employee # prompt without saving.

Table 5-2 shows the formulas used to compute the payroll.

    NOTE:  Federal and state computer formulas never exactly
match the withholding tables.  When comparing PC-PAYROLL computed
withholding and the tables, expect a difference of up to $5.00 on
federal and state taxes.

    The withholding formulas used in PC-PAYROLL are found in IRS
Circular E and your state's Employer's Withholding Guide.  In
must cases, PC-PAYROLL calculates the taxes more accurately.

                        NET PAY


    NOTE:  If you do not allow negative net pay, PC-PAYROLL first
reduces the deductions to zero, beginning with deduction 4, 3,
etc.; then reduces the taxes, beginning with SDI, local tax,
state tax, federal tax and FICA.  Reductions stop when positive
net pay is reached.  Since most computations of negative net pay
are as a result of advance wages or tips, these deductions are
not reduced.



MODIFY PREVIOUS PAY STUBS (F2) (Screen C.2.0)

    Overview.  Use this function to change the employee's payroll
data or to delete the record.  You can save the data as you enter
it or you can compute the new taxes based on the changes to
wages.  To modify records, follow the steps listed below:

    . Press F2 Modify Previous Paychecks.

    . When the date prompt displays (Screen C.2.0) enter the
      Payroll Date.

      * Press RETURN to return to the Compute Payroll Menu.

    . Select the record number (Screen C.2.1) from the box
      on the screen's left and press RETURN for more records
      or to exit if the last record is displayed.  You can
      enter a record number not displayed in the box.  (See
      PC-PAYROLL Method).

    . Select the number keys (Screen C.2.2) that correspond
      to the items you want to modify and press RETURN.

      * The display consists of all fields that you can
        update in the record.

      * Changes are not computed or saved until all
        changes are made.

    . To move quickly from record to record--

      * Press N for the next record.
      * Press P for the previous record.
      * Press RETURN to exit without saving.


    . To save changed records at any time, press S and then
      press RETURN.

      * The stub will display.
      * Press F10 to print or RETURN to save.

    NOTE:  Saving the payroll using the values displayed omits
any default values and saves only the values actually entered or
displayed on the screen.


    . To compute taxes based on tax formulas--

      * Press C and then press RETURN.

      * Review and then press S to save.

    NOTE:  Computing the payroll using the employee default
values are based on the data entered in the employee data file,
federal and state withholding formulas, hours worked, tips, and
other compensation.

    If you change salary, wages, tips or other income, you must
adjust the FICA withheld to the rate times the TOTAL gross pay.
If you neglect to do so, Form 941, W-2s and W-3s will be out of
balance at the end of the year.


    . To delete a record--

      * Press D and then press RETURN.

      * Press S to save.

    NOTE:  The date 13-13-90 now appears.  The date is
significant because it is invalid, can be easily trapped
toexclude when computing totals, and it cannot be entered by the
user EXCEPT when you are deleting a record.  The record is not
actually removed from the system, but coded as inactive by the
date.

    When you delete the record, you will notice all fields now
contain zeros, except the employee number is converted to #1.
This does not affect employee #1 totals and prevents error
messages when processing reports.


CHANGE DEFAULTS (F3) (Screen C.3.0)

    Overview.  Use this feature to temporarily override the
defaults for SDI, payroll frequency, overtime rate, federal tax,
FICA and state tax and to run year-to-date adjustments. As
changes are temporary, the overrides will revert to the defaults
when you exit the Compute Paycheck Module.

    These values, however, remain when you compute the payroll
for subsequent employees during the current session, unless you
change them.  If you make a change for one employee be sure to
doublecheck for correct values before continuing to the next
employee.  Screen C.1.0 displays a reminder of the payroll
frequency.


AFTER-THE-FACT PAYROLLS

    PC-PAYROLL offers the capability to enter payrolls after the
fact for accountants use or to begin using this payroll system
mid-year.  Differences between the accountants use and
year-to-date adjustments are discussed, then the functions which
are common to both areas.

    Accountants.  Select the After-the-Fact in the System
Configuration (Screen X.8.0) before entering employee data, or
toggle all after the fact employee's payroll frequency to
"After-the-Fact" in the employee data file (Main Menu).

    Year-to-date Adjustments.  To begin using PC-PAYROLL in
mid-year or to update your year-to-date payroll to accurately
compute Forms W-2, W-3 and 940, enter your previous payroll using
the after-the-fact option.

    With this short cut, you can enter the quarterly totals
without entering all previous payrolls.  Instead of entering the
period totals, enter the quarterly totals for each employee.
Follow the steps listed below:

    . From the Compute Payroll Menu, press F3 to access the
      Change Default Menu (Screen C.3.0).

    . Press F2 to change the payroll frequency to
      after-the-fact payroll.

    . Press Esc to return to the Compute Paycheck Menu.

      * Note that the Compute Paycheck Menu displays after-
        the-fact payroll.  This remains only until you exit
        the module.
    Common Procedure.  Compute payrolls as described in Compute
Paychecks in this chapter, pressing F1 Compute Paychecks,

               SUMMARY AND FEDERAL REPORTS MODULE

OVERVIEW

    The Summary and Federal Reports (Y) (Screen Y.0.0) provides
the required federal tax reports and year-to-date, quarterly and
monthly summaries.  Figure 6-1 illustrates the Summary and
Federal Reports Menu.  For specific information on IRS
requirements and the use of forms covered in this module, see
Appendix B.

    With all reports, you have the option to either export report
data to a disk file or other programs (spreadsheets, word
processors, etc.) or print the report on paper.

    To export report data to a print file, press F9.  When you
select this function and are prompted, enter a file name up to
eight characters.  All data your export with a user-defined file
name will have the extension ".PRN" and will be written to an
ASCII data file on the data drive.  You must transfer this file
to the other application program.  Refer to Importing Data in
your other software.

    For a printed report, press F10.  Your printer must be on.

    You may print the FEDERAL reports directly on the form by
pressing F8.  There will be instructions on the screen for an
alignment test.  This function may not work with all printers.

FEDERAL TAX REPORTS (Screen Y.0.0)

    Quarterly Returns (F1).  This function computes the federal
tax liability and social security payments that you report to the
IRS on Form 941 (Employer's Quarterly Return).  All of the data
you need to prepare quarterly returns is computed and displayed,
except for Total Employees Employed during the pay period
covering March 12 and any adjustments you might need due to
changes in your payroll that affect quarterly returns.  Figure
6-2 illustrates the information provided on quarterly returns.

    NOTE:  Substitute reports are not IRS approved.  You must
transfer the information to the actual form.

    To use Quarterly Returns (F1), follow the steps listed below:

    . Press Y from any module menu to access Summary and
      Federal Reports Menu.

    . Press F1 from the Summary and Federal Reports Menu.

    . When prompted to select the quarter (Screen Y.1.0),
      press 1, 2, 3 or 4, relating to quarters beginning
      January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1.

    . A two page report, a substitute Form 941, is displayed
      and may be printed at Screens Y.1.3 and Y.1.4.

    . To obtain the number of employees employed March 12
      (for the first quarter return)--

      * Press R from any module menu to access Period
        Reports Menu.

      * Press F3 from the Period Reports Menu for the Totals
        by Pay Period reports.

      * You can transfer the number of employees working
        that pay period to the Form 941.

    NOTE:  The number of employees working on March 12 must be
added regardless which method is used to print Form 941.


    Form W-2 (F2) (Screen Y.2.1).  This function allows you to
view and print Forms W-2 with flexibility.  PC-PAYROLL also
prints subtotals on the 42nd Form W-2, according to IRS
requirements.  Figure 6-2 illustrates the W-2 Menu and figure 6-3
illustrates Form W-2.  Press Esc to abort any report and return
to the W-2 Menu.  Press P to pause during printing, then press
any key to continue.

    From the W-2 Menu, you can--

    . Press F1 to display W-2s on the screen so you can
      review each employee's Form W-2 individually.

    . Press F2 to print continuous Forms W-2.

What W-2s To Purchase

    PC-PAYROLL uses two of the IRS approved formats.  The
standard format in PC-PAYROLL is the Form W-2 which the IRS
furnishes and the format IRS used several years ago, called the
alternate format (The boxes for the local taxes are different.).
The standard format is recommended.

    Dot matrix printers do not handle six or eight-part Forms W-2
because of the paper's thickness.  We recommend using carbonless
continuous W-2 Twin Sets, designed especially for dot matrix
printers.  Twin Sets are two sets of W-2s, one set consisting of
the copies required for the government and the other set
consisting of all forms to be given to the employee.  You make
two printing passes using PC-PAYROLL.  Twin Sets ensure clear,
legible printing and a quality image on all copies.


Where To Purchase W-2s

    Many companies specialize in printing and selling tax forms,
however, they may use different terms in describing their W-2s.
Before purchasing, most will send you sample copies.  Print
sample W-2s as described in Tips On Printing W-2s to determine
which forms to purchase.

    If you must use another W-2 format, and we must customize
PC-PAYROLL, we will do so for $50.  This will be an annual charge
for customizing.  The custom version will be shipped usually
within 3 weeks of receipt.  We cannot guarantee delivery if
ordered after December 1.


Tips On Printing W-2s

    W-2s are usually printed once a year, therefore, you do not
get the experience in aligning the W-2s that you do with your
paychecks.  Before committing the W-2s to the printer, we suggest
you take the time to experiment aligning the forms using plain
paper (there are no restrictions to the number of times you print
any report). After printing several W-2s, press Esc to abort,
remove the paper, hold the paper against the forms and check the
alignment.  This will indicate the proper position for the final
forms.    Form W-3 (F3) (Screen Y.3.0).  The Form W-3 (Figure 6-4)
summarizes all Forms W-2.  You can print a replica of the
Form W-3 or print directly on the Form W-3. To use this
function--

    . Press Y from any module menu to access Summary and
      Federal Reports Menu.

    . Press F3 from the Summary and Federal Reports Menu.

                      PERIOD REPORTS MODULE

OVERVIEW

    The Period Reports Module (R) (Screen R.0.0) contains various
reports that provide information on employees, payroll dates, pay
period totals and payroll details.  This data will aid you in
determining upcoming deposit and tax requirements and will
provide you detailed employee data.  All reports require standard
paper.  One report is available in alternate formats using a 132
column printer or condensed print.

    Since several of the reports require you to enter the payroll
date, PC-PAYROLL remembers the last payroll date.  To select the
displayed payroll date, press F10 when prompted, then press
RETURN to continue.

    With all reports you can either export report data to a disk
file or other programs or print the report on paper.  Refer to
the discussion on exporting reports to a print file in Chapter 6.
To print the report on paper, press F10.

                 STATE QUARTERLY REPORTS MODULE

OVERVIEW

    The State Quarterly Reports Module (S) (Screen S.0.0) is used
to prepare state quarterly returns.  The report is a typical
state quarterly return, but it might not match your particular
state's return exactly; thus, you should review the
computer-generated report before the end of the first quarter to
become familiar with its contents.

    The SDI and Unemployment Insurance (UI) tax rates and cutoffs
are taken from the System Configuration.  The Personal Income Tax
(PIT) (State Income Tax) previously paid is taken from the Tax
Deposit data file (see Chapter 11 (Tax Deposit Module). (The
Employee Training Tax (ETT) for California is substituted for
employee UI on this report.) The report's second page lists each
employee's social security number, wages and tips.  Total wages
and tips are at the bottom.

    To obtain this report--

    . Press S at any module menu for State Quarterly Reports.

    . Press 1, 2, 3 or 4 to select the quarter then when the
      report displays, press F10 to print.

CUSTOM CHECK FORMATS

    We have included the four most popular check formats for your
use in PC-PAYROLL.  This is three more check formats than most
other software companies offer.  We cannot add additional formats
to our normal distribution disk because of limited disk space and
future software enhancements.

    If you must use a custom check, a supplemental disk with
additional check formats is available at $25 additional per year
to cover special handling.  If a custom format is not in our
library, a one time customizing fee of $50 is required in
addition to the annual fee.  A hard disk is required to use the
supplemental disk.

local tax deposits are tracked and the unpaid balance displays;
however, you are not informed as to when the next state and local
deposits are due because of the many state variations.  Figure
11-1 illustrates the Tax Deposit Menu.

    You can obtain information on the actual deposit you should
make from several reports:

    . Pay Period Totals
    . Form 941

ALABAMA uses the 0 marital status for single employees claiming
no exemptions.

ARIZONA state withholding requires a flat 10%, 17%, 22%, or 25%
of federal withholding.  This feature is incorporated by using
the State Marital Status and entering the appropriate letter from
the following chart:

                    A = 10% withholding
                    B = 17% withholding
                    C = 22% withholding
                    D = 25% withholding

GEORGIA requires using the State Marital Status to incorporate
five categories of marital status in the employee data.  Make
your entries based on Georgia Form G-4.  Enter A, B, C, D or E
from Form G-4.  Definitions display in PC-PAYROLL when you select
Georgia and are also in the state Employer Withholding Guide.

MARYLAND uses the Form W-4 for the state withholding exemptions.
Several counties and Baltimore have local taxes included in the
state withholding.  To incorporate this feature, enter the
appropriate percentage of state withholding for the employee's
county of residence as a whole number (for example, 20% = 20, 50%
= 50) in the State Withholding Exemption Allowance.  This
automatically computes the appropriate state withholding.  DO NOT
ENTER the flat local tax rate in the System Configuration.
Entering a number greater than 30 does NOT disable state tax
withholding.  Refer to Maryland Income Tax Employer Withholding
Guide.

MISSISSIPPI uses a dollar amount for state exemptions.  You must
take the dollar amount from the employee's Form 62-420, divide
the amount by 1000 and round to the next lowest whole number.
Enter this number in the State Withholding Exemption for the
Employee in the employee data section of the program.  The
program does not handle the decimals that result when dividing
the exemptions by 1000.  The result of rounding will be minor
differences in program calculations and state withholding tables.
Entering a number greater than 30 does NOT disable state tax
withholding.  Refer to Mississippi Income Tax Employer
Withholding Guide.
NEW YORK CITY resident and nonresident local income taxes are
included in this program.  DO NOT enter a local tax rate for New
York in the System Configuration.  If your business is and/or the
employee lives in New York City, enter the cities NEW YORK,
BROOKLYN, QUEENS, BRONX, STATEN ISLAND, or YONKERS in ALL CAPITAL
LETTERS in your company and employee data.  If you do not enter
this exactly, the local taxes will not compute.  For a discussion
on State Disability Insurance for New York, see the Glossary.

NORTH CAROLINA uses a dollar amount for state exemptions.  You
must take the dollar amount from the employee's Form NC-4, divide
the amount by 100, and round to the nearest whole number.  Enter
this number in the State Withholding Exemption for the Employee
in the employee data section of the program.  If no exemption is
entered, the program will default to an exemption of $1100.  An
error message is displayed if no exemptions are entered or if
exemptions exceed $8500.  Entering a number greater than 30 does
NOT disable state tax withholding.  Refer to NC State Withholding
Guide for the allowable deductions.  Entering a number greater
than 30 does NOT disable state tax withholding.  Refer to North
Carolina Income Tax Employer Withholding Guide.

OREGON State Disability Insurance (SDI) is $.14 per day.  This
amount, based on an eight-hour day, is automatically computed for
Oregon.  SDI is based on a five-day week for salaried employees.
It is suggested you activate the SDI override and let PC-PAYROLL
estimate SDI.

WASHINGTON requires withholding of industrial insurance, which is
based on RATE x HOURS, where the rate is a dollar amount.  Enter
the SDI rate in the System Configuration.

              INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE REQUIREMENTS

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires employers to provide
certain information on their employees and to make payments
periodically.  The list of various forms that follows is meant to
enlighten a novice employer of certain requirements; however, it
is not an interpretation of the law or court decisions.  You will
find more detailed information in the publications listed.

                        federal tax withholding, FICA
                        withheld from employees and the
                        employer portion of FICA) exceeds
                        $500, you must also complete a
                        record showing your liability based
                        on the date the wages are paid.  The
                        balance due is payable with the
                        Form 941 and should be less than
                        $500 (if over $500, you should make
                        deposits during the quarter).

                        at the end of the quarter, pay your
                        taxes with Form 941.  Form 8109-B is
                        not required.

                        Rule 2 - If you owe less than $500
                        at the end of any month, you do not
                        have to make a deposit, as you can
                        carry the taxes over to the
                        following month within the quarter.

                        Rule 3 - If you owe $500 or more,
                        but less than $3000, at the end of
                        the month, deposit with Form 8109-B
                        within 15 days after the end of the
                        month.  Circular E carries an
                        exception to this rule.

                        Rule 4 - If you owe $3000 or more at
                        the end of an eight-month period,
                        divide each month into eight deposit
                        periods (about every three days).
                        If at the end of any eight-month
                        period your undeposited taxes exceed
                        $3000, deposit the taxes due within
                        three banking days after the end of
                        that eight-month period. Circular E
                        carries an exception to this rule.


Form W-4                The employee completes this form and
Withholding Allowance   gives it to the employer to show the
Certificate             number of withholding allowances the
                        employee is claiming.  It should be
                        completed the first day of work.  If
                        the employee does not furnish the
                        employer a W-4, the employer must
                        withhold tax as if the employee is
                        single with no withholding
                        allowances.

PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT

    We are always interested in improving PC-PAYROLL, however, we
are now somewhat limited to available disk space.  If there is
something you would like to see added, please do not call.  We
need to see your suggestions in writing with a complete
descriptions and why you believe it should be added to PC-PAYROLL
(or Personnel Management).


CHECK FORMATS

    Because of the limited disk space, additional check formats
will not be added.  We have included the four most popular
formats, which are three more than most other software offer.  If
you use a custom check, please discontinue its use as soon as
possible and select one of the standard formats.  Custom formats
may be eliminated without notice.  See Chapter 10 concerning
custom check formats.

                   ERROR CODES FOR PC-PAYROLL

PC-PAYROLL can recover from most errors, therefore, most error
codes are messages relating to the user.  The most common codes
are listed below.  If an error message appears which is not
listed, refer to the error codes in your BASIC Manual, or call
Peninsula Software, Inc. for help.

Error
Code  Message

 0    UNKNOWN ERROR - Contact Peninsula Software, Inc.
      for assistance.  Usually it is a STRING error relating
      to memory.

 7    OUT OF MEMORY -  The program is too large for your
      system. See your dealer to add more memory before
      using PC-PAYROLL.

24    DEVICE TIMEOUT -  Check your printer and disk drive
      before continuing.

25    DEVICE FAULT - Hardware error.

27    OUT OF PAPER - The printer is out of paper or it is
      not on. Correct and continue with the program.

52    FILE NOT FOUND - Exit PC-PAYROLL, then begin again.
      Check the System Configuration to make sure all
      information is accurate.

57    DEVICE I/O ERROR - An error occurred on a device I/O
      operation. DOS cannot recover from the error.  Check

      extension Dxx (example: PCPE.D01), on the disk.  xx is
      a number from 01 to 30. Any Bxx files are backup data
      and should be copied to another disk and then erased
      from this disk. In addition, there should be only one
      series of Dxx files on the disk, that is, all D01
      files, or D02,....

68    DEVICE UNAVAILABLE - Check your printer or disk drive
      before continuing.

70    DISK WRITE PROTECT - The diskette you are using is

Compress code      Printer codes used to format printer
                   output.  The codes can vary among
                   printers, but the majority of printers
                   use code (or character) 15 to set the
                   compress mode and code 18 to reset the
                   printer.  Check your printer manual for
                   the proper code.

Dates              Throughout the program you are asked to
                   enter dates, which you must enter in a
                   specific format.  The proper format of
                   MM-DD-YY, for entering a date, follows:
                   2/27/89 or 2-27-89. If the month or the
                   day are only single digits, you need not
                   enter proceeding zeros (0).  No other
                   date format is accepted.

State Disability   Can be paid by employee/employer,
Insurance (SDI)    depending on the individual state
                   requirements.  Contact your SDI office
                   for details for your state.  The SDI
                   defaults to 0.  The typical SDI is
                   handled as the FICA (the rate is entered
                   then the wage cutoff is entered).

                   In California, for example, the wage
                   cutoff is $21,900; the dollar amount
                   actually withheld (approximately $197.10)
                   isn't entered.

                   New York is SDI is computed with the
                   maximum of $.60 per week (1989 rate),
                   New York residents must enter $31.20 as
                   the cutoff.

                   Washington state (Industrial Insurance)
                   is computed based on a dollar rate per
                   hour rather than a percent of gross.
                   Enter 25 cents per hour as .25.

Toggle             Press the function key and the menu
                   selection will change to the next
                   preassigned default setting.  Continue to
                   press the key until your selection
                   appears.

Unemployment       Can be paid by employee/employer,
Insurance (UI)     depending on the individual state
                   requirements.  Contact your state
                   unemployment office for further
                   information for your state.  The UI
