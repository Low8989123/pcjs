## Information about "PC-DRAFT II"

    A high-resolution, pixel-oriented utility for drawing and drafting.
    Built-in functions draw circles, lines and boxes; load and edit fonts;
    create bar, line and pie graphs; create patterns to fill areas; cut and
    paste objects; save objects to files for later use. Record graphic
    keyboard macros in files for playback and animation effects.
    
    Maximum resolution is 1280 by 700 dots, which covers several screens
    and fills an 8.5" x 11" paper at 150 dots-per-inch resolution.
    
    Capture screen images from other programs, save them in separate files
    and load them into PC-DRAFT II. Export portions of the screen, full
    screens, and/or full-sized drawings in GEM.IMG file format. Include
    graphics created with, or captured by, PC-DRAFT II directly into
    desktop publishing documents such as those created with Ventura
    Publisher.

   This file provides information for shareware disk vendors and user
   groups on the disribution of PC-Draft II.

   PC-Draft II is copyright 1990 by Natural Software, 19 South Fifth Street,
   St. Charles, IL 60174, (708) 377-7320, Compuserve ID: 70047,744.


   Our sending this disk to you and the letter that accompanies it constitues
   the approval of Natural Software for your distribution of PC-Draft II as
   part of your shareware libarary. If you have obtained this from another 
   source, (not directly from Natural Software), please write or call for 
   our explicit permission. 

   We further ask that you send us a copy of your standard written
   materials (catalogs or flyers) which clearly explain the shareware
   concept, the need for users to register products they use, and the
   fact that the price of your disks is a copying fee only and does not
   constitute payment for the product. The material must also differentiate
   between shareware and public domain software.


   If you are not already a member, we strongly recommend that you consider
   becoming an Approved Vendor of the Association of Shareware Professionals
   (ASP). For more information on the ASP vendor program, contact the ASP at:

               Association of Shareware Professionals
               Vendor Certification Committee
               P.O. Box 5786
               Bellevue, WA  98006

   The ASP vendor program reduces the workload for both authors and vendors,
   and helps give customers confidence that reasonable standards are met in
   the distribution of shareware products.

  

   You may distribute the disk as is. That is, with the three self-extracting
   LHARC files together. Or, if you wish, you may distribute the third
   file (PCD2-3.EXE) as a separate disk. It is additional clip art. It was
   formerly sent on a separate disk labeled: PC-Draft Library.
