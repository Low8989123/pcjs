## Information about "THE NUTRITIONIST 2 OF 2 (1148 ALSO)"

    Put down that Twinkie and pick up THE NUTRITIONIST: a high-powered
    package for health-conscious hackers!
    
    THE NUTRITIONIST has just about everything you could possibly want to
    know about bringing health and nutritional balance into your daily
    diet.
    
    Massive amounts of useful data are provided.  Some topics covered are:
    food items, caloric content, ideal body weight, minimum daily
    requirements (MDR's), meal planning, calorie consumption calculations
    for various types of physical activity, portion planning, and recipe
    creation.  A handy printer routine uses condensed type to print on
    tractor-feed 4x6-inch file cards for easy kitchen counter reference.
    Give THE NUTRITIONIST a look if you want a full-featured package for
    improving dietary habits.
    
    If you're not going to eat that Twinkie...
