## Information about "PARENTS HOME COMPANION: MANAGING COLIC"

    This installment from the multi-part PARENTS HOME COMPANION (PHC) series
    is based on managing colic problems in infants.  The PHC series provides
    parents and those responsible for childcare with expert assistance in a
    range of commonly-encountered problems.
    
    The need for documentation has been eliminated in the PHC series through
    the program's structure.  This is similar to the "expert systems" seen
    in artificial intelligence applications, in which you are guided from
    screen to screen by your answers to questions.

The cause of colic is not known.                ';
                                                ';
 COLIC IS PROBABLY CAUSED BY A NUMBER OF THINGS.';
                                                ';
Colic is a symptom that comes from discomfort.  ';
                                                ';
  Many things going on in a young child can be  ';
the source of discomfort that results in colic. ';
Causes (page 1 of 10)

              What causes Colic?                ';
                                                ';
Even medical research has failed to reveal a    ';
  single cause for colic.                       ';
                                                ';
Everyone agrees that something causes it in     ';
  a child but no one knows for sure which of    ';
  many causes are responsible for colic in a    ';
  particular child.                             ';
                                                ';
Causes (page 2 of 10)

               What causes Colic?               ';
                                                ';
The problems that result in COLIC are usually   ';
  NOT serious and the child will outgrow them.  ';
                                                ';
Therefore, many pediatricians do not get overly ';
upset about a child that has colic.  They may   ';
offer some support and suggestions but say there';
is little that can be done about it.            ';
                                                ';
Causes (page 3 of 10)

              What causes Colic?                ';
                                                ';
Since it appears to be associated with eating   ';
and with the process of digesting food, most    ';
research has focused on things that interfere   ';
with this process.                              ';
                                                ';
Many physicians feel that the problem rests with';
what and how a child eats and that colic is     ';
cured by changing the diet or how a child eats. ';
Causes (page 4 of 10)

              What causes Colic?                ';
                                                ';
Other physicians believe that colic results     ';
from the immature digestive systems of some     ';
children.                                       ';
                                                ';
   They believe that with more research, a      ';
   medicine may be developed that will make up  ';
   for what the child lacks in the system.      ';
                                                ';
Causes (page 5 of 10)

              What causes Colic?                ';
                                                ';
A few doctors believe that some children are    ';
      born with a predisposition to colic.      ';
                                                ';
That the parents pass it on to the child thru   ';
  the genes and the result is a high-strung     ';
     child born to high-strung parents.         ';
                                                ';
The result is a combination resulting in Colic. ';
Causes (page 6 of 10)

              What causes Colic?                ';
                                                ';
Still others believe that the environment that  ';
a child lives in may be too much for to handle  ';
and the system can be over stimulated resulting ';
                  in Colic.                     ';
                                                ';
They feel that the best way to handle it would  ';
     be to insure a stable, calm environment.   ';
                                                ';

                                                ';
Almost everyone agrees that colic can not be    ';
    cured but that it can be managed.           ';
                                                ';
   Things can be done to enable a child to      ';
     be more comfortable until the child        ';
     outgrows the stage when colic occurs.      ';
                                                ';
Most are things parents can do with support.    ';

                                                ';
The medical treatments available treat only the ';
               symptoms.                        ';
                                                ';
They do not cure anything but help a child to   ';
digest food and make it less likely to cry.     ';
                                                ';
Many of these medicines are used only as a last ';
 resort or for particularly serious cases.      ';

Colic is likely to have a number of causes, in  ';

    Your strength, patience and inner           ';
resources are your child's primary sources of   ';
      strength as well.  Taking care            ';
of yourself is the best way to take care of your';
                 baby.                          ';
                                                ';
Find out the time that you need away from your  ';
baby to renew your strength.  Schedule the time ';
you need, arrange for responsible child care and';
recharge yourself-- your baby will thank you.   ';
    Rearing children is the responsibility      ';
  of the entire community, in a certain sense.  ';
                                                ';
Those who care for you and those who will bene- ';
fit from having your child grow and develop are ';
involved in the raising of your child as well.  ';
                                                ';
Look at those who actually care, find out who   ';
you trust and then ask for their help when you  ';
need it.  Most will respond when you need help. ';
Your doctor is a primary source of wisdom, know-';
   ledge and support for you and your child.    ';
                                                ';
The key to getting this support is sharing with ';
your physician, not only what is happening, but ';
also what your are feeling.  Share as much as   ';
you can and then listen carefully to what advice';
is given you.  There may not be an answer but   ';
may be support.  This can be as important as any';
pill. Be sure and follow your doctor's advice.  ';
        Like your child, you might at times     ';
need to regain your balance and composure to    ';
           have things work right.              ';
                                                ';
When things start getting to you you might feel ';
like getting away from it all.  Your child cry- ';
ing may be more than you can handle in the house';
and you might want to find a refuge.  Be sure   ';
your child is safe and then go sit in the car   ';
for a while.  It will be quiet and should help. ';
    All those involved with you and your        ';
child are potential assistants to help you pro- ';
vide what your child needs to grow and develop. ';
                                                ';
Get organized.  Decide who will do what when.   ';
Look for ways to support each other, to step in ';
when others get weary.  Talk it out when things ';
get to you.  Share ideas and particularly share ';
what works for you even if it only works for a  ';
short time.  Working as a team can really help. ';
    Your internal feelings and state of         ';
mind can be communicated to your child and make ';
things better or worse for a child with colic.  ';
                                                ';
Seek out and learn a way to relax yourself.  It ';
is best to do this before you really need it.   ';
Practice these techniques so that relaxing be-  ';
comes a habit.  Use it often throughout the day ';
and get to the point that you can recognize when';
you are getting uptight and then relax, relax.  ';
      Both calm and discomfort are in a         ';
             sense, contagious.                 ';
                                                ';
While it may be difficult to do, try approaching';
your child when you have the inner resources to ';
best communicate that inner sense of calm.      ';
                                                ';
If this is not possible, do not leave your child';
alone but rather pull yourself together as best ';
you can before approaching your child.          ';
      Taking care of yourself is the best       ';
    basis for taking good care of your child.   ';
                                                ';
Pushing yourself to exhaustion is not the best  ';
way to take care of anyone.  If you need rest,  ';
get it when you can.                            ';
                                                ';
Taking care of a child with colic may be a full ';
time job and you may have to let other responsi-';
bilities go to get the job done.                ';
     A child with colic is a strain on          ';
everyone involved.  It is never the result of a ';
personal or a family failure.  Admit that you   ';
are taking on a formidable task and then line up';
all the resources you have available in case    ';
they are needed.                                ';
                                                ';
When you need the help, ask for it.  Many will  ';
respond with assistance.  This is not weakness  ';
but wisdom-- a source of strength.              ';
                                                ';

Everytime that medical science sets out to find '
    the cause of colic, it runs into a          '
                problem.                        '
                                                '
The same cause of colic is not found in every   '
child that has colic.  Some children with colic '
have gas in their intestines, others do not.    '
                                                '
Some children have tense parents or tension in  '
the home, others do not.                        '
                                                '
Some children appear to be allergic to milk,    '
others are not.                                 '
                                                '
To qualify as a disease, it must have one cause.'
                                                '
This is not to say that a number of doctors do  '
not believe that there is a single cause that   '
has not been identified yet.  You may well have '
a pediatrician that believes that the cause is  '
known and can show you research to prove it.    '
                                                '
What it does mean is that other researchers have'
found that it is caused by different things or  '
can point out problems with the research that   '
make their results questionnable.               '
                                                '
The research goes on to both rule out things and'
to identify all of the different things that can'
result in the child experiencing colic.         '
                                                '
                                                '
Even when a doctor believes that it is possible '
to know the cause of colic in your child's      '
case, their may be little to offer you in the   '
way of treatment except advice and support.     '
                                                '
You and your care is the best asset your child  '
has and even that may not be enough to make your'
child comfortable and eliminate colic.          '
                                                '
Often, the advice and support your pediatrician '
has is for your benefit as much as for your     '
child.  This does not mean that you are the     '
problem or the patient.  What it does mean is   '
your welfare is the best way to see that your   '
child gets the best care available.             '
                                                '
Changing the diet of a child often results in or'
eliminates the signs of colic.                  '
                                                '
Not only what a child eats but also how much and'
how a child is fed can make a difference.  Also,'
the timing of feeding and even the position the '
child is fed in can make a difference.          '
                                                '
If the child is breast fed, the diet of the     '
mother matters.  If bottle fed, the consistency '
of the formula and even the size of the hole in '
the nipple can make a difference.               '
                                                '
Many children cannot digest certain things and a'
feeling that allergy may play a part is common. '
                                                '
Preliminary research shows that some children   '
      have digestive systems that are           '
         not ready to digest food.              '
                                                '
Our digestive tracks require chemicals like     '
      enzymes are needed to break down          '
      food so that it can be digested.          '
                                                '
Further, digestion requires that the nervous    '
      systems send the right sort of signals    '
      at the right time for things to run well. '
                                                '
For children to avoid colic everything inside   '
has to be mature enough to work right and to    '
work together.                                  '
                                                '
The link between tension and stomach pain has   '
been noted by physicians for a long time.  The  '
similar notion that tension plays a part in     '
colic has been noted as well.                   '
                                                '
Physicians have also observed that some children'
have a predisposition to colic such that almost '
any discomfort can trigger an episode.  This    '
predisposition is assumed to be hereditary and  '
similarly assumed to be associated with the     '
central nervous system.                         '
                                                '
Clearly, tension can upset a stomach or make a  '
bad condition worse.  This is true whether an   '
adult or a child.  Calm and soothing is better. '
                                                '
A child's well being, particularly when very    '
young is a question of delicate balance.  Many  '
things can upset this delicate balance.  Some of'
these are internal and many others are external.'
                                                '
Each child has sort of a regulatory system that '
holds things in balance in the face of demands  '
for change.  The threshold over which things    '
start falling apart varies from child to child. '
                                                '
When the environment becomes too much to handle '
the child may well go tilt and a case of colic  '
may result.  This can happen from too much      '
happening or an abrupt change in what is going  '
on.  With a predisposition, colic can result.   '
                                                '
A cure attacks the cause and brings relief.  It '
can also assure that a problem does not come    '
back.                                           '
                                                '
Often, medicine does not have a cure but has    '
developed ways to treat the symptoms.  By keep- '
ing the body under control, the disease can run '
its course without the negative impact it might '
otherwise have.                                 '
                                                '
Management of a disorder can bring relief and   '
minimize the impact of the disorder without ever'
addressing the underlying causes.               '
                                                '
Many things parents can do to help manage colic.'
                                                '
Medicine has developed treatments for the sym-  '
 ptoms of colic that can bring some relief to   '
       both the child and the parents.          '
                                                '
These treatments are typically used as a last   '
resort or in extreme cases.                     '
                                                '
Many of these medicines have a tranquilizing    '
on the child and some address probable internal '
stress.                                         '
                                                '
It is even not unusual for the parents to re-   '
ceive tranquilizers, not because they are the   '
source of the problem but rather to better help '
them to manage their child.                     '
                                                '
A child does not have many ways to handle       '
               distress.                        '
                                                '
Distress or stomach pain can potentially come   '
        from a number of sources from           '
              gas to tension.                   '
                                                '
Regardless of the source of the discomfort, the '
        result is uncontrollable crying.        '
                                                '
Often, nothing can be done about the source of  '
   discomfort but the pain can be managed.      '
                                                '
Medical treatments address the symptoms and are '
typically used when more benign efforts fail.   '

system.  It is important to provide enough food ';
and to do it in a way that a child can benefit. ';
    The way nourishment is provided to a        ';
child can be as important as the content of it. ';

The consistency, how thick or thin the formula  ';

digested.                                       ';
                                                ';
Adding corn starch in small amounts or water in ';
small amounts can show alter the consistency to ';

                                                ';
When the mother seeks variety in her diet, the  ';
child gets variety as well.  Some of the variety';
the child receives may be more than a delicate  ';
system can handle.                              ';

Spicy foods, or foods that are difficult for the';

tion of the milk to alter radically in a short  ';
period of time.                                 ';
                                                ';
The mother's mature digestive system can handle ';
the changes well while the child may suffer.    ';
     Many types of food present the digestive   ';
system with challenges that produce by-products ';
with distructive results.  Some can even bring  ';
    on violent reactions or discomfort.         ';
                                                ';
Some types of foods like chocolate, nuts or     ';
shell fish are common producers of such allergic';
reactions.  Even if the nursing mother does not ';
have an allergic reaction, the child might from ';
her milk.  Formulas can produce reactions too.  ';
     The milk sugars and proteins in diary      ';
   products are often difficult for digestive   ';
              systems to manage.                ';
                                                ';
A nursing mother may have trouble digesting     ';
diary products and having her milk change as a  ';

Formulas based on diary products may be a source';
of discomfort that soy based formula would not. ';

                                                ';
Sugars impact on things other than taste.  While';
they may be included in foods or a formula in   ';
order to enhance taste, they also make things   ';
easier or more difficult to digest depending on ';
a child's system.  Look at packages for sugar   ';
content and then for formula with less sugar or ';
add small amounts of sugar to see if it helps.  ';
     Our digestive systems were designed to     ';
       process foods that occur naturally.      ';

Many of the foods and formulas that are avail-  ';
able are complex combinations of things that do ';
not occur naturally or are processed to alter   ';
their natural chemical composition.  Be sensi-  ';
tive to what you eat if you are nursing, and to ';
the ingredients in the formula that you feed    ';
your child-- if possible, natural is better.    ';

                  factor.                       ';
                                                ';
Lighting that is too bright or that causes a    ';
series of harsh shadows can overwhelm and con-  ';
fused a young mind and eyes that have a hard    ';
time focusing.                                  ';
                                                ';
Soft lighting, from a single source that pro-   ';
vides a predictable environment might help.     ';
      What happens in a child's world can       ';
       be either soothing or upsetting.         ';
                                                ';
Often the key to whether it is a source of com- ';
fort or alarm sets on how predictable or expect-';
ed the interaction is.                          ';
                                                ';
Constancy is the key to being able to handle the';
environment.  Unexpected noise or rapid changes ';
in the amount going on can be upsetting.        ';
       Things going on outside of the child's   ';
        direct line of sight are part of the    ';
           environment to be dealt with.        ';
                                                ';
Cutting down on what a child has to deal with by';
closing the door is one way to help make things ';
more manageable.                                ';
                                                ';
Isolation, in this way, is a way of helping     ';
rather than punishing.                          ';
       Stimulation can be exciting but only     ';
 when the child has the ability to control it.  ';
                                                ';
When more comes in than can be handled, the re- ';
sult is often a physical upset that triggers    ';
colic.                                          ';
                                                ';
Minimizing the amount of stimulation during the ';
time for colic can be one way of assuring that  ';
the child will be able to handle it.            ';
       Predictability, manageability and        ';
    constancy are the keys to keeping things    ';
         under control internally.              ';
                                                ';
Most families interact with a baby at times     ';
throughout the day.  This results in periods of ';
high stimulation, followed by times of no inter-';
action.  This is hard for some children to cope ';
with.  Scheduling interaction in a predictable  ';
way can help these children handle their world. ';
         Children, like most people,            ';
  respond to the subtle vibrations of music.    ';
                                                ';
It goes beyond liking or disliking a particular ';
piece of music.  Music sets up internal patterns';
that can help regulate many functions of a young';
system.                                         ';
                                                ';
Often, the music need not be loud or powerful to';
work-- quiet background music may be enough.    ';
        The powerful vibrations of some         ';
  music can take hold of the internal patterns  ';
        and help re-establish a balance.        ';
                                                ';
For some children, internal upset does not res- ';
pond to quiet background music.  For them, the  ';
response to music is still there but the music  ';
must be strong enough to make a difference.     ';
                                                ';
Loud should never hurt, but rather dominate.    ';
       Repetitious, monotonous sounds           ';
        can help reset or maintain an           ';
             internal clock.                    ';
                                                ';
The influence of external sound, particularly   ';
when there is not a lot of complexity to deal   ';
with can help smooth out the internal patterns. ';
                                                ';
The predictable pattern of a clock or a metro-  ';
nome can often provide this form of stimulation.';
   What is in a child's room can provide        ';
   opportunities for growth or overwhelm.       ';
                                                ';
Too busy an environment, even a large number of ';
different colors or textures as well as things  ';
can present more than a young child can manage. ';
                                                ';
Even the subtle vapors released by many man-made';
fabrics can be more than delicate systems can   ';
manage.  Often reducing what is there is enough.';
                                                ';

  A disease is an internal process that results '
    in symptoms.  A cold is a disease and the   '
     cough, running nose, etc. are symptoms.    '
                                                '
A disease usually has a cause that results in   '
something going wrong with the normal function- '
ing of the body.  This imbalance results in what'
we see as the symptoms.  The source of the im-  '
balance is the cause of the disease.  A virus,  '
for example, causes a cold.  The cold is the    '
disease that results in the symptoms we see.    '
                                                '
   A syndrome is a series of symptoms that      '
often appear to be unrelated but occur often    '
enough to show a set pattern without one cause. '
                                                '
When a child has colic there is a lot of pain.  '
                                                '
There are very few ways for a child to deal with'
or express pain or discomfort.  When something  '
hurts a child naturally cries.  This is almost  '
automatic.                                      '
                                                '
Feeling hurt is different than feeling upset.   '
                                                '
When you are feeling upset, you can be comfort- '
ed.  When you are feeling hurt, comforting will '
probably not remove the hurt.  As a result, the '
usual efforts to get the child to stop crying   '
may well prove fruitless, leaving the child     '
hurting and the parents feeling helpless.       '
                                                '
When an adult feels pain or physical discomfort '
       the tendency is to grin and bear it.     '
                                                '
When children, especially very young children,  '
feel pain they have little or no choice but to  '
      let the world know how they feel.         '
                                                '
This can lead to an escalating cycle of pain,   '
fear and tension.  The child cries, the parents '
attempt to comfort, the attempt fails, the      '
parents attempt to bear their discomfort but the'
result is tension and frustration.  The child   '
picks up this tension and gets frightened and   '
tense in return.  This results in even more cry-'
ing and more frustration on the parent's part.  '
                                                '
If you have ever had a bad case of heartburn or '
severe stomach cramps, you know how a child with'
colic feels.  The child's pain may not be as bad'
as the pains you had but the feeling is similar.'
                                                '
It is that internal feeling in the stomach that '
hurts but cannot be localized or easily removed '
like the pain of a pin sticking you.            '
                                                '
As you know, many things can result in an upset '
stomach, from not eating to eating too much or  '
too fast.  Also, how and what you eat and just  '
things going on that are unpleasant can tie your'
stomach into knots.                             '
                 It is the same with a child.   '
                                                '
Many explanations have been proposed for why    '
some children experience colic and others do    '
not.  It is common enough to have had a number  '
of myths grow up about it.  These myths or      '
simple explanations for its appearance are pass-'
ed from generation to generation. Unfortunately,'
just because an explanation is common, does not '
necessarily make it true.                       '
                                                '
When these explanations are examined closely,   '
they usually do not prove to be accurate at all.'
                                                '
Colic is one of those things that the simple    '
answers passed on usually prove to be not too   '
accurate or useful.                             '
                                                '
If you look closely at a child with colic, you  '
may feel the child is doing it on purpose or    '
simply refusing to be comforted.                '
                                                '
It may even be the case, that the child appears '
to be crying uncontrollably one moment and mere-'
ly fussing the next.  Sometimes they may stop   '
altogether.  You might think this means your    '
child could control things if the motivation    '
was there.                                      '
                                                '
When it hurts really bad, the child cries a lot.'
When it hurts less, the child cries less. When  '
it does not hurt, the child rests.  The pain    '
controls the child, the child cannot control it.'
                                                '
Colic is a term used for a set of symptoms that '
occur early in life.  It is interesting to see  '
that if a child is born prematurely, rarely is  '
colic developed until a week or two after the   '
full term date, rather than a week or two after '
birth.                                          '
                                                '
It's appearance is associated with the physical '
maturity of the child.  The bad thing about this'
is that it happens when the child is the most   '
helpless.                                       '
                                                '
The good thing about this is that when the child'
has matured enough, colic will vanish.  This    '
usually happens about 4 or 5 months of age.     '
                                                '
If the child has the system that is going to    '
result in colic, it usually will not happen     '
just once.                                      '
                                                '
   It can, and often does, occur over and over. '
   Even a bout of colic daily, regular as clock '
   work, is not unusual.                        '
                                                '
The child's system goes out of whack and then   '
something has to occur to bring it back into    '
balance.  This process varies from child to     '
child.  In one, it could take 15 mins, with     '
others, hours.                                  '
                                                '
What happens to help is often a mystery.        '
                                                '
Colic is the result of something going on in    '
the stomach of the child.  Almost anything can  '
set it off.                                     '
                                                '
This is particularly true if the digestive sys- '
tem and the nervous system that controls it is  '
not fully capable of maintaining the internal   '
balance.                                        '
                                                '
The pain can begin with a twinge & surprise the '
child or it can be a sudden pain.  The crying is'
the child's only way of relieving tension.  It  '
is a natural, positive thing.  It is also dis-  '
turbing as it tells the parent that something   '
is wrong that perhaps they cannot fix.          '
                                                '
Colic is something that about a third of all    '
parents must deal with.  It can result from a   '
number of different things that upset the nor-  '
mal digestive process of children.              '
                                                '
The pain a child feels is real but the cause of '
the pain is usually not serious.  The pain and  '
its causes can usually be managed but not stop- '
ped completely.                                 '
                                                '
It is associated with the maturity of the diges-'
tive system of the child and will go away when  '
the child matures.                              '
                  One of the keys to the man-   '
agement of colic is taking care of yourself.    '
                                                '

Program Title: PARENTS HOME COMPANION: MANAGING COLIC version 1.0
PC-SIG Version 1

    This installment from the multi-part PARENTS HOME COMPANION (PHC)
series is based on colic problem management in infants. The PHC series
provides parents and those responsible for childcare with expert assistance
in a range of commonly encountered problems.

    The need for documentation has been eliminated in the PHC series
through the program's structure. This structure is similar to the "expert
systems" commonly encountered in artificial intelligence applications, in
which the user is guided from screen to screen by his answers to questions.

Usage: Home Applications

System Requirements: 128K memory and one floppy disk drive.

How to Start: Type PHC (press enter).

The back and forth motion of a swing or the     ';
rhythmic motion of rocking has a soothing effect';
on the system of children.  It can distract     ';
attention from discomfort and urge on the inter-';
mechanisms that establish and maintain balance. ';

                                                ';
The digestive tract from the stomach to the     ';
colon have many smooth muscles that depend on   ';
complex nerve impulses to move food through the ';
system.  Vibrations help aid the food to pass   ';
through the system when the normal mechanisms   ';
do not do the job.  Movement, particularly the  ';
vibrations that come from a car ride may help.  ';
       Firm, warm, caring contact can           ';
 comfort a child and help to regain control.    ';
                                                ';
There is a power in touch, particularly when it ';
conveys a sense of reassurance, that actually   ';
reassures people, no matter how young.  This    ';
contact can eliminate the sense of upset or     ';
panic that may be making matters worst for the  ';
child.  The result is a psychological as well as';
physiological state of calm in many cases.      ';
      Warmth, familiar objects, things          ';
  that re-orient a child to the familiar        ';
    can help a child to regain a sense          ';
              of balance.                       ';
                                                ';
Whether it serves as a distraction away from the';
discomfort or give a child a soothing source of ';
comfort, it works for many of the children.     ';
                                                ';
The keys here are the warmth or the familiar.   ';
     The parents of a child are the focal       ';
   point of a child's comfort and security.     ';
                                                ';
The child quickly becomes attuned to the sound  ';
of their voices and, while it is impossible to  ';
to understand the words used, the emotional     ';
impact of the sounds can be recognized, in a    ';
sense, and responded to.                        ';
                                                ';

                           What is Colic?                       
                                                                
              Colic is not a disease!                           
                                                                
                   COLIC IS A SYMPTOM OR A SYNDROME             
                                                                
              A symptom is something a child shows that means   
                that something is wrong.                        
                                                                
               A syndrome is a set of symptoms with a pattern.   



              When a child is showing colic there is:           
                                                                
                 o A lot of crying
                     o  Pain and discomfort
                         o  Fussiness
                             o Inability to be comforted
   
               That can go on for four or five hours straight. 



              The problems that result in COLIC are usually
                NOT serious
                                 but
   
              They do cause a child a lot of discomfort and
                the constant crying can drive parents up the
                wall.
   


              Colic appears to be associated with eating and
                 with the process of digesting food.
   
              Anything that disturbs the eating and digestive
                process can result in a child showing colic.
   
              Even things you might not think of like rapid
                 changes or tension can result in colic.



                 About one-third of all children show colic.
   
              It has nothing to do with-
   
              RACE  COLOR  CREED  SEX  PREMATURITY BLOOD TYPE
   
              In particular, it has nothing to do with the
                quality of care a child receives.


è

              Colic is not the result of a high strung child
                being mean or fussy.
   
              A child who is showing COLIC is saying by the
                the uncontrollable crying that he/she has a
                really bad tummy ache.
   
               A child can not control COLIC!



              Colic usually begins in the first weeks of life.
   
                 It sometimes gets worse in the 4th to 6th
                    week of life.
   
              Colic usually tapers off after 3 months of age.
   
                 Colic rarely lasts past the 5th month of life.



              Colic is something that a child shows for
                periods of time:
   
                     o  Almost on a daily basis
                     o  Attacks lasting 15 mins to hours
                     o  Often gets worse between 5 and 10 p.m.
   



              A bout begins with discomfort or pain.
   
                A child attempts to relieve tension by crying.
   
                   The crying becomes screaming.
   
              The screaming and the physical signs of pain
                continue until the internal discomfort ends.




              Colic is symptom or syndrome rather than a
                 disease.
   
              It is the result of typically minor problems
                that result in painful things going on in the
                belly of an infant.
   
               An upsetting problem that goes away with time.

                       What causes Colic?
   
              The cause of colic is not known.
   
               COLIC IS PROBABLY CAUSED BY A NUMBER OF THINGS.
   
              Colic is a symptom that comes from discomfort.
   
                Many things going on in a young child can be
               the source of discomfort that results in colic.



              Even medical research has failed to reveal a
                single cause for colic.
   
              Everyone agrees that something causes it in
                a child but no one knows for sure which of
                many causes are responsible for colic in a
                particular child.



              The problems that result in COLIC are usually
                NOT serious and the child will outgrow them.
   
              Therefore, many pediatricians do not get overly
              upset about a child that has colic.  They may
              offer some support and suggestions but say there
              is little that can be done about it.



              Since it appears to be associated with eating
              and with the process of digesting food, most
              research has focused on things that interfere with
              this process.
   
              Many physicians feel that the problem rests with
              what and how a child eats and that colic is
              cured by changing the diet or how a child eats.




              Other physicians believe that colic results
              from the immature digestive systems of some
              children.
   
                 They believe that with more research, a
                 medicine may be developed that will make up
                 for what the child lacks in the system.




              A few doctors believe that some children are
                    born with a predisposition to colic.
   
              That the parents pass it on to the child thru
                the genes and the result is a high-strung
                   child born to high-strung parents.
   
              The result is a combination resulting in Colic.




              Still others believe that the environment that
              a child lives in may be too much for him/her to
              handle and that the over stimulation can result
                                in Colic.
   
              They feel that the best way to handle it would
                   be to insure a stable, calm environment.
   



              Almost everyone agrees that colic can not be
                  cured but that it can be managed.
   
                 Things can be done to enable a child to
                   be more comfortable until the child
                   outgrows the stage when colic occurs.
   
               Most are things parents can do with support.




              The medical treatments available treat only the
                             symptoms.
   
              They do not cure anything but help a child to
              digest food and make it less likely to cry.
   
              Many of these medicines are used only as a last
                resort or for particularly serious cases.




              Colic is likely to have a number of causes, in
                general, but a single cause in a particular
                child.
   
              The most likely sources of the discomfort are:
   
              DIET  FEEDING PRACTICES  ENVIRONMENT  TENSION
                 BIOLOGICAL PREDISPOSTION  IMMATURITY

    The digestion of food and the passage       ';
of air and gas can often be aided by the gentle ';
 massaging of a child's stomach after feeding.  ';
                                                ';
When things do not work as they ought to in an  ';
immature system, an external force, if applied  ';
gently, can help the digestive process along.   ';
                                                ';
Trapped air, swallowed along with the food or   ';
gas from digestion can cause discomfort.        ';
       The digestive tract is a convoluted      ';
  tangle of intestines that can make use of     ';
   gravity to keep the food flowing from        ';
      the  stomach to the rectum.               ';
                                                ';
Placing a child upright in a car seat or child  ';
carrier can help gravity and the immature diges-';
tive system to keep the food moving in the right';
direction as it is processed.  The smooth muscle';
of the digestive tract may not be able to do it.';
     Trapped gas in the intestines can lead     ';
       to a lot of pain and discomfort.         ';
                                                ';
The most common way that gas is released from   ';
the system is through burping.  Gas can also be ';
released from the other end of the child as     ';
well.                                           ';
                                                ';
Use a rectal thermometer covered with lubricant,';
gently inserted in the rectum, to release gas.  ';
        Sometimes the system of a child         ';
  is better prepared to digest food that at     ';
                other times.                    ';
                                                ';
Each child has a unique patterns.  Sometimes    ';
during the day, the digestive system works more ';
effectively than at other times.                ';
                                                ';
Finding out the best time to feed your child is ';
often an matter of trial and error.             ';
    The most common way for a child to be       ';
aided in the releasing of air taken in while    ';
    eating is by burping.  It can also aid      ';
in the release of any gas that is trapped in    ';
           the  stomach.                        ';
                                                ';
Be sure that you are correctly burping your     ';
child and then do more of it.  This may mean    ';
that you burp your child for longer periods of  ';
time after feeding or more often.               ';
      If you are using a bottle, the size       ';
  of the opening in the nipple can make a real  ';
difference in the mixture of the air and food   ';
    that a child receives during feeding.       ';
                                                ';
If using a bottle, try changing the nipple that ';
you are using on it.  You might also try en-    ';
larging the opening in the nipple that you are  ';
currently using.  The goal is to allow the child';
to eat with the minimum amount of air.          ';
     Even with a young child, eating has        ';
a social element.  The amount of noise or the   ';
interaction of the mother with the child can    ';
make a difference in how the food is received   ';
and digested.                                   ';
                                                ';
For a young child, eating should be a pleasant  ';
experience.  The interaction between the mother ';
and the child should be as warm, calm and       ';
supportive as possible.                         ';
       The pace and feeding habits of your      ';
child may not be the best possible for your     ';
                 child.                         ';
                                                ';
Some children attack the bottle or the breast,  ';
some slobber and take in very little at a time. ';
                                                ';
The child should be encouraged and supported in ';
taking in food at an even, measured pace.  The  ';
goal is to take in food at a moderate pace.     ';
     Calm, orderly, predictable feeding         ';
practices promote the sort of conditions needed ';
      to help a child grow and adjust.          ';
                                                ';
Planning what your child will eat, when it will ';
be eaten, how it will be eaten, under what con- ';
ditions it will be eaten, and what will happen  ';
after eating, will help you set up the condition';
that will enable your child to take in nourish- ';
ment in a way that can usually be handled.      ';
                                                ';
