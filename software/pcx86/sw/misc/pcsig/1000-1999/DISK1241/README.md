## Information about "MANDELBROT & JULIA SET GENERATOR (1076)"

    MANDEL generates and displays marvelously beautiful images based upon
    the recently developed area of mathematics called "fractal geometry."
    With this program, you can create an unlimited number of new images,
    change the colors of the images, and save the images to a disk file.
    Sample images are included, and on-line help suggests numerical values,
    making it easy to begin.
    
    The program has two outstanding features:  the assignment of color masks
    to create an unlimited range of color variations for each image, and the
    ability to zoom in and magnify selected portions of the screen.
    
    MANDEL is a comprehensive program that takes some time to create a new
    image, but once saved to disk the image can be displayed on the screen
    more quickly.  You can also generate Julia images, which are similar to
    the Mandelbrot images, but require different numerical values to create
    the image.  The documentation has suggested readings for more
    information on Mandelbrot and Julia set images.

Disk No: 1241
Program Title: MANDELBROT & JULIA SET GENERATOR for EGA/VGA (Disk 2 of 2)
PC-SIG version: 1.1

This disk adds additional patterns to the original program that allowed
you to generate detailed and colorful mathematical patterns called
fractals.  Patterns are based upon a recently developed part of
mathematics called "fractal geometry," which creates images in which
each smaller part of the image has the same pattern as the whole part of
the image.  With this program, you can generate an unlimited amount of
new images, change the colors of the images, and save the images to a
disk file.

MANDELBROT is a comprehensive program that takes some time to generate a
new image, but once saved to disk the image can be displayed on the screen
more quickly.  It lets you create "Mandelbrot set" images and "Julia set"
images.  The Julia images are similar to the Mandelbrot images, but require
different numerical values to be inputted to generate the image.  On-line
help displays suggest numerical values for both Mandelbrot and Julia
images.  Sample images are already included, and the documentation has
suggested readings for more information on Mandelbrot and Julia set images.

Usage:  Fractal Images/Mandelbrot and Julia Set Generator.

Special Requirements:  EGA or VGA graphics and monitor.

How to Start:  Insert disk #1076 and type GO (press enter).

Suggested Registration:  $20.00

File Descriptions:
