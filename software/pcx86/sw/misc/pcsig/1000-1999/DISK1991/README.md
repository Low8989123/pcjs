## Information about "GIFTBASE  DISK 1 OF 2 (1992 ALSO)"

    How do you efficiently manage the records of an organization, group, or
    club in which members either pay dues or make occasional contributions?
    GIFTBASE, an integrated database program that manages a list of givers,
    tracks multiple gifts per giver, produces reports, statements, mailmerge
    files, and labels, and runs on a single user machine or a network.
    
    GIFTBASE has two main parts, a master file for membership information
    and a gift file for contribution information which are linked through
    this relational database. All maintenance to the two files is done in
    the same program by zooming between master file and gift file with two
    keys. Membership information and donation/payment information is
    efficiently added to both files. For example, the addition of a
    donation in the gift file automatically updates the YTD total giving
    balance in the giver's Master File.
    
    There are several reports and labels programs, such as a master file
    gift statement, a gift report, phone directories, or master file Labels,
    with "query-by-example" and user-defined titles for almost unlimited
    flexibility in reporting. Full sort capabilities by any field (such as
    gift date) or within a range of records (such as within two dollar
    amounts) is supported.
    
    Other features include record capacities of 999,999 or more in nine
    different files, built-in security at the program level, storage of
    unlimited notes for each giver, online help screens, a "mini-editor" for
    field editing, batch programs for global updates of all or groups of
    records, importing and exporting capabilities, backup/restore from main
    menu, and network support -- Novell or generic DOS 3.1 LAN.
