## Information about "READY SET DRAW"

    Looking for a small paint program that does the basics without all the
    frills of a full-blown computer studio?  READY SET DRAW has the simple
    functions you want, and it works with or without a mouse.
    READY SET DRAW is a fun, easy drawing program with features like
    copy, paint, color, loading and saving pictures, and other basic
    operations.
    
    Once loaded you will find a small X in the middle of the screen --
    that's your drawing pen.  In the top left hand corner of the screen it
    has the pen status (up, down, erasing).  When the pen is down it will
    draw, when the pen is up it won't draw, and when the pen is erasing it
    will erase each dot in the middle of the X.  Eight direction keys, up,
    left, down, right, and diagonals, move the X the corresponding
    direction.
    
    From there, you can fill in enclosed areas, cut and paste portions of
    your drawing, automatically draw various sized circles and rectangles,
    even change the color of your pen -- all with simple key strokes.
