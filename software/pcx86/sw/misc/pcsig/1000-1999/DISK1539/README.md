## Information about "EISSENGER UTILITIES AND MORE"

    A passel of useful tools for Turbo Pascal programmers, as well as some
    batch utilities that do not require any programming language to use.
    Batch File Utilities:
    
    ~ PASTE -- Concatenates two files together line-by-line, butted together
    end-to-end.  A line from the second file is appended to the first file
    to make a longer line for the new file.
    
    ~ BLDBAT -- Creates a text file containing directory's filenames
    specified by a file masking parameter.  Similar to Unix's LS command to
    file.
    
    ~ MELD -- Merges two text files by interleaving lines of each file.  The
    new file receives a line from the first file, then a line from the
    second, then one from the first, etc..
    
    ~ PUTCURS -- Moves the cursor to a designated line on the screen.
    Extremely useful for batch file I/O.
    
    Pascal Utilities:
    
    ~ INDENT -- Reformats and standardizes PASCAL source files for indents
    and case.  Useful when two or more programmers with different writing
    styles work on code for a program.
    
    ~ EXTRACT -- Pulls out and prints the names of all procedures and
    functions along with all in-line comments from source files.  This is
    invaluable for documentation and cross-referencing.
    
    ~ SGCVERT -- For Screen Genie users, reveals how to take advantage of an
    undocumented feature in this popular window generator that permits the
    use of the Screen Genie work file as a screen in an object file or in a
    Turbo Pascal TPU unit.

Disk No: 1539
Program Title:  EISSENGER UTILITIES & More
PC-SIG version: 1

A passel of useful tools for turbo pascal programmers, as well as some
batch utilities that do not require any programming language to use.
Batch File Utilities:

PASTE - Concatonates two files together line-by-line, butted together
end-to-end.  A line from the second file is appended to the first file
to make a longer line for the new file.

BLDBAT - Creates a text file containing directory's filenames specified
by a file masking parameter.  Similar to Unix's LS command to file.

MELD - Merges two text files by interleaving lines of each file.  The
new file receives a line from the first file, then a line from the
second, then on from the first, etc..

PUTCURS - Moves the cursor to a designated line on the screen.
Extremely useful for batch file I/O.

Pascal Utilities:

INDENT - Reformats and standardizes PASCAL source files for indents and
case.  Useful when two or more programmers with different writing styles
work on code for a program.

EXTRACT - Pulls out and prints the names of all procedures and functions
along with all in-line comments from source files.  This is invaluable
for documentation and cross-referencing.

SGCVERT - For Screen Genie users, reveals how to take advantage of an
undocumented feature in this popular window generator that permits the
use of the Screen Genie work file as a screen in an object file or in a
Turbo Pascal TPU unit.

Usage:  Turbo Pascal Programming tools.

Special Requirements:  Turbo Pascal 4.0

How to Start:  Type GO (press enter).

Suggested Registration:  $25.00
