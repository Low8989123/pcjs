## Information about "FRIGATE"

    FRIGATE is a strategy game which pits you and your ship against a Soviet
    fleet of vessels. The object is to destroy as many of the opposing
    ships as possible while avoiding destruction of your own.
    
    Points are awarded for destroying your enemy while avoiding their
    missiles. Your ship, a nuclear-powered guided missile frigate, has many
    advantages over its Soviet counterparts but you are outnumbered by a
    large margin. Operating in an area of 1,000,000 square miles, you have
    radar, sonar, jamming equipment, anti-missile capabilities and three
    types of ordnance at your disposal.
    
    FRIGATE is played from three on-screen windows -- a main window which
    gives you an overview of your ship's status, an options window which
    changes in accordance with the commands you select and a command window
    from which you issue those commands. Your ship's status and position,
    and the location of the enemy are updated frequently. FRIGATE is a
    challenging and stimulating game that will provide many, many hours of
    entertainment.

Program Title:  FRIGATE version 1.1
PC-SIG version: 1

FRIGATE is a strategy game which pits you and your ship against the
Soviet fleet.  The object is to destroy as many of the opposing ships
as possible while avoiding destruction of your own.

Points are awarded for destroying your enemy while avoiding their
missiles.  Your ship, a nuclear-powered frigate, besides being armed
with guided missiles has many advantages over its Soviet counterparts
but you are outnumbered by a large margin.  Operating in an area of
1,000,000 square miles, you have radar, sonar, jamming equipment,
anti-missile capabilities and three types of ordinance at your
disposal.

FRIGATE is played from two on-screen windows, a Main window which gives
you an overview of your ship's status, and an Options window whose content
changes in accordance with the commands you select.  Your ship's informa-
tion and position are updated constantly while you give commands.  FRIGATE
is operated using a "turn" system.  This means that you can enter in as
many commands as the time in your "turn", referred to as the "Turn Time",
permits.  After this time expires the enemy and all weapon systems are
updated.  This allows for much faster playing time and more realistic
action.  FRIGATE is a challenging and stimulating game that will provide
many, many hours of entertainment.   Fun for ages 11 to adult.

Synopsis: It's you and your one ship against an entire Soviet fleet.
Can your wit and superior technology make the difference?  An
entertaining exercise in strategy.
