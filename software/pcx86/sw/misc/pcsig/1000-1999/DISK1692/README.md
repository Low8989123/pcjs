## Information about "BEGIN: A TACTICAL STARSHIP SIMULATION"

    This game is a battle simulation matching potential starship commanders
    against the computer.  The candidate can represent any one of four
    possible nations: the Federation, Klingon, Romulan, or Orion.  Several
    different ship classes with varying armament are available.  The
    simulation is complete including damage, casualty reports (from Dr.
    McCoy), engine temperatures (from Scotty), phaser recharging times
    (Chekov), and even the variables involved in navigating large as opposed
    to small ships (Sulu).  A player can command from one to a fleet of nine
    ships.
    
    The degree of difficulty is controlled by the size of the opposing
    fleets; a player can configure the odds in his favor or to the
    computer's advantage.  The computer strategy is quite effective; the
    novice captain probably will not win in a one-on-one confrontation.  The
    starship captain has a great deal of responsibility in a battle
    situation, and this simulation will truly test a candidate's ability to
    command.

    BEGIN, A Tactical Starship Simulation has been, or should be,
uploaded to this BBS.  It is the finest, most accurate Starship 
Simulation yet (or at least we hope it is).

    Unlike almost all other "Trek" games, Begin does not employ the
unrealistic "quadrant-sectors" or the "Mass Hoard of aliens" approach.
Instead, all ships are created equal with intelligent enemy strategy
being used to defeat the unsuspecting human player.  For the novice
player even a one-on-one scenario is quite a challenge.

    Begin also features four different nations, Federation, Klingon,
Romulan and Orion, with the human player becoming the nation of their
choice.  The program also provides for numerous ship classes of varying
design for each of the different nation.

    There are not any artificial "difficulty levels" in Begin. Instead
if a player wishes for an easier scenario, they may command a fleet of
up to seventeen ships against a smaller enemy force.  For a more 
difficult scenario, one-on-nine is a more likely challenge.

    Currently Begin will run on any video adapter including the IBM
monochrome adapter although we recommend a color display.

    We are currently planning Version 2.0 and are interested in your
ideas.  To make this exchange easier for all, we have set up the Micro
Foundry BBS. It is an open board giving all callers 60 minutes with no
uploads requirements.

If you are, or become, a Beginner, we hope to hear from you.
