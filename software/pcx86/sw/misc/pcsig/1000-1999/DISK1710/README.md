the same amount every month, such as gardeners, piano teachers, pool ser-
vices, membership organizations, etc. The program keeps track of the monthly
charge for each client, for up to three separate services, and also allows
insertion of "extra" charges outside the normal monthly fees. Designed for
the non-accountant, this simple, single-entry system posts the charges each
month, keeps track of each client's balance, prints statements and simple
reports. We expect to release this program in summer 1990. Registration fee
and system requirements not yet determined.

other commands necessary for troubleshooting sessions and customer support.
Unlike other "dot prompt" programs, this one works! Registered users may link
the OBJ file with their applications to simplify debugging and support.
(Program is not ARCed.) Registration is $49.00. Version 1.0 requires: DOS 2.0
or later, 400K RAM.

user, with an emphasis on assistance for beginners.

                            IMPORTANT INFORMATION

All our "Unusual Software" products are sold as shareware. This means you may
use the trial version of a program for a limited period of time to see if you
like it. If you do like the program, then you should register your use by
paying the registration fee. When you become a registered user, you receive
the most advanced version of the program, and your name is placed on a mai-
ling list to receive notices of future upgrades. Trial versions of our pro-
grams are distributed by most shareware distributors, who generally charge
between $1 and $8 per disk. (This fee is for the distribution service only;
it is not paid to us, and is not part of the registration fee.) You may also
obtain the trial version of any product by sending a double-sided, double-
density 5 1/4" diskette in a sturdy, reusable mailer with sufficient return
postage (enough postage for a four-ounce, first-class letter). (Send three
disks for Creativity Package, two for Poetry Generator; an extra stamp for
these programs.) If you don't want to bother with disks and postage, send
$5.00 for the trial version of one disk, $7.00 for two, $8.00 for three, and
$1.00 for each additional disk. The trial version is a fully-functioning
program, but in some cases may lack some of the extra features of the re-
gistered version. If you don't like the program, you are free to erase it,
throw it away, or pass it on to someone else to try. If you do like the pro-
gram and want to keep using it, send in the registration fee to get the
REGISTERED version. Of course, you are always more than welcome to order the
registered version without going through the trial version first. In a few
cases, there is no advanced version yet available, but you still must regi-
ster if you like the program. Registered users receive support by mail, a
newsletter, and future upgrade notification, as well as special discount and
bonus offers.

We also act as a distributor for a limited selection of shareware and public
domain programs from other authors. The fee paid to us for these "Bonus
Disks" is for the copying and distribution service we are providing. It is
not paid to the authors and is not part of the registration fee. See the
Bonus Disk section for details.

Before ordering any software, please read the description carefully, and pay
special attention to the system requirements. Some programs require a hard
disk, graphics capability, or additional memory that you may not have. As far
as we know, our software will run on most standard "IBM compatible" personal
computers (with the possible exception of some Tandy models). However, since
equipment options and configurations vary so greatly, we cannot guarantee
correct results for everyone. If you have a problem, please let us know. 

                               HOW TO ORDER:

REGISTRATION is $6.00 for Penname, $10.00 for Cliche Finder and Curses,
$19.00 for Crystal Ball. Registration for M-LABEL is $10 if you are a
registered MAILLIST user, $39.00 if you are not. WORKBASE registration is
$49.00, $29.00 for all others.

Take $5.00 off your registration if you send a double-sided, double-density
5 1/4" diskette in a sturdy, reusable mailer with sufficient return postage.
(For POETRY GENERATOR, send 2 disks). Postage should be the same amount
needed for a four-ounce, first-class letter. This discount does NOT apply to
CREATIVITY PACKAGE, MAILLIST, or programs with reigstration fee less than
$20.00.If you want the discount, please don't skimp on the stamps! Remember,
the mailer you use to send your disk is the same one we will use to return it
to you. If you are already a registered user of one or more products from our
"Unusual Software" catalog (not Bonus Disks), take $5.00 off your registra-
tion of any new program. This discount may not be combined with any other
discount, and does not apply TO MAILLIST, CREATIVITY PACKAGE, or programs
with registration under $20.00.)

MAILLIST and THUNDER THOUGHT (part of Creativity Package) registrations
include source code if requested. Source code is NOT provided for any other
programs. OBJ file is provided with WOKBASE registrtation. CURSES!
registration includes a free bonus disk.

BONUS DISKS: $3.00 for each disk. Add a $3.00 shipping fee to your total
order. (Shipping fee applies only when Bonus Disks are ordered.) This is not
a registration, just a copying fee. Registration goes to the individual
authors of the programs.

FOREIGN ORDERS: Please add $3.00 for special postage and handling. Unfortu-
nately, we are unable to handle foreign funds. Payment must be in U.S. dol-
lars, payable through a U.S. bank. Canadian postal money orders in U.S. funds
are acceptable. 

3 1/5" DISKS: We normally provide 5 1/4" disks. If you must have 3 /15"
disks, please include an extra $1.00 per disk. Under no circumstances will we
ship unregistered versions on 3 1/5" disks.

NOTE: Some programs are "ARCed". This means that in order to fit several
large files on a single disk, a special archiving and compressing process has
been used. The files must be un-arced before use. We provide the un-arcing
program. Some users have occasionally reported compatibility problems with
the utility used to un-arc our large files (this is rare). If you would
prefer to receive un-arced versions of the programs, enclose an extra $5.00
to cover special handling and materials.                               BONUS DISKS

We are not the authors of these programs, nor are we associated with the
authors in any way other than as a distributor of the programs in accordance
with the authors' terms of distribution. Some of these programs require a
shareware registration fee from satisfied users. Our $3.00 fee per disk is a
payment for copying and distributing the disks; it is not the registration
fee. Please direct shareware registration payments and specific questions
about these programs to the authors whose names appear in the documentation.

Most of the files on these disks have been archived in order to fit more
files on a single disk. Archiving creates a file with the extension ARC. The
ARC file may contain several related files. To use these files, you must
un-arc them. An un-archiving utility is included on each disk for your
convenience.

These programs have been tested, but due to the many possible hardware and
software configurations, we cannot guarantee that any program will run on any
particular system. We do not warrant these programs in any way. If we provide
you with an unreadable disk, you may return it for a replacement copy of the
same disk. Read the file descriptions carefully; some of these programs have
special requirements.

                              IMPORTANT NOTICE


The method of providing documentation and instructions for this program has
changed.

Instead of a text file which can be displayed and printed using DOS commands
or a word processor, the documentation is now in a special program file.

You can recognize the documentation program by its name, which includes the
extension COM. For example, if you have the program BY THE NUMBERS, the
documentation program is named NUMDOC.COM. To read the manual, you would
simply enter the command:    NUMDOC

When you are reading the documentation on screen, you can scroll through the
text using the up and down arrows or the page up and page down keys. You can
search for a word or phrase by pressing F and then entering the text you want
to find. You can print the document press pressing ALT-H.

## FIX.DOC

{% raw %}
```
In some cases, when you try to run a program, you may see
an error message something like this:

Proc TAROT line 0, Open Error DESC3.NTX (4)

This is NOT caused by a bug in the program! If you see a
message with the words "open error" and the number 4, it
is DOS's cryptic way of telling you that you need to make
an adjustment in the CONFIG.SYS file in your root directory.

The CONFIG.SYS file should contain the following two lines:

     files=20
     buffers=20

(Some programs may require even larger numbers, which is
okay.)

If you aren't familiar with the CONFIG.SYS file, your DOS
manual should contain an explanation.
