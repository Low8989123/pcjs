## Information about "HP DESKJET SOFT FONTS & UTILITIES"

    HP Deskjet owners rejoice!  Now a complete soft font package is
    available for the DeskJet.  ELFRING DESKJET SOFTFONT PACKAGE (EDSP) has
    25 different fonts and a lightning fast download program written
    especially for the DeskJet or DeskJet Plus with a 128K or 256K RAM
    cartridge.
    
    EDSP offers more fonts for the deskjet in more sizes than any other
    package (including HP's own).  The download program is fully-functional,
    loading fonts at nearly three times the speed of the HP package.  EDSP
    fonts are available in 6 to 30 point size ranges while HP fonts stop at
    12 points.  Included in this package is an unusual symbol font that
    permits the inclusion of character sized airplanes, umbrellas, trade
    marks, and more in documents.
    
    Soft fonts for the DeskJet are not compatible with LaserJet fonts, so
    many applications, such as MS-WINDOWS, do not support soft fonts for the
    DeskJet.  With some adjustments this package enables DeskJets to fully
    emulate LaserJets, making the DeskJet RAM cartridge worth the price.
    Printer drivers for WordPerfect 5.0 and 5.1, Word 5.0, and PC-Write are
    included.

            The Newsletter for HP DeskJet and DeskJet Plus Owners
       ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

About DeskNews.
DeskNews is quarterly publication that brings you the latest information about 
your DeskJet printer. DeskNews only reports on topics of interest to DeskJet and 
DeskJet Plus printer owners. Our subscribers don't have to hunt through every 
computer magazine just to find a small note about their printer. They have their 
own newsletter! DeskNews is published by Elfring Soft Fonts.

Neither the DeskNews newsletter or Elfring Soft Fonts is affiliated with Hewlett 
Packard in any way. Thus, we bring you unbiased information about your printer.

Previous issues of DeskNews covered: how to refill your used ink cartridges, a 
"secret" upgrade notice for DeskJet ink sled assemblies, landscape printing on 
a DeskJet, soft font tips and techniques, and soft font requirements. We have 
reviewed "permanent" inks, three LaserJet to DeskJet soft font convertoers, and 
detailed how to make Word Perfect printer drivers.

This newsletter is a small specialized publication. We will accept advertise-
ments for quality DeskJet related products- to help keep our readers informed. 
However, we rely on our subscribers to cover the cost of writing, producing, 
and mailing this newsletter.


Publishing Schedule.
DeskNews is published on a quarterly schedule. Each issue is printed on 8-1/2 x 
11 paper. A typical issue runs 12 - 15 pages. Hurry and subscribe now or you'll 
miss the next issue.


Future Topics.
Based on the reader feed back from our last issue we have a number of new topics 
to cover. Future issues of DeskNews will cover: product reviews, DeskJet up-
grades, add on products, and soft fonts. We will be adding a question and answer 
column to help subscribers out with their problems.

DeskNews will expand on its re-inking article with more tips, techniques, and 
common problems. This will include colored ink information. We will begin 
covering paper selection for the DeskJet too.

For soft font lovers we have three separate series of articles planned. One will 
cover desktop publishing with a DeskJet. The second series tells how to create 
printer drivers for popular word processors. Finally, the third series will 
discuss how to create soft fonts for the DeskJet.

Additional articles planned: DeskJet Shareware, DeskJet tips and techniques, 
printing labels, trouble shooting your DeskJet, and common DeskJet problems. We 
also intend to cover the troubles many of you experience with large soft fonts.  
Finally, we welcome suggestions from our subscribers for other topics.


Subscription Rates.
A one year subscription to DeskNews costs 20.00 for United States delivery. 
Subscriptions delivered to Canada and Mexico cost 24.00 per year. All other 
foreign subscriptions are $28.00 per year. You can order your subscription
