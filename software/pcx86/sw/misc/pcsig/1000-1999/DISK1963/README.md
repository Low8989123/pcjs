## Information about "TRACKSTAR I & CALENDAR PROGRAM BY SMALL"

    Print a year's worth of calendar, four months per 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of
    paper, for any year from 1990 through 1999.  The program was designed to
    print the output using the Epson or Epson-type printer codes.  The
    operating instructions are quite simple and prompts are available where
    needed.
    
    If you have regular appointments and your current calendar is making you
    enter each one separately, TRACKSTAR specializes in repetitive
    scheduling.  The repetition cycles can be defined by the number of days,
    the number of months, twice a month (15 days apart), or three special
    monthly cycles.  Great for reminding yourself of when your bills are to
    be paid each month.  You can even set an early reminder prompt for any
    number of days in advance.  Of course the calendar is just as effective
    with one-time appointments.

       Overview:
       ========
       TrackStar is a PC based utility, designed to assist the computer
       user in keeping track of dated events which may occur once or
       which are repetitive.  The repetition cycles can be defined by
       the number of days, the number of months, twice a month (15 days
       apart), or by three special monthly cycles.  TrackStar uses the
       operating system's clock/calendar to determine the current date,
       so DOS's DATE must be set properly either using the Dos command or
       by the utility provided with the battery backed-up time-of-day
       clock.

       Getting started:
       ===============
       If the system clock date has not been set, type DATE at the DOS
       prompt and enter the current date.  (Refer to your DOS manual for
       details.)  Copy 'TS.EXE' and 'TS.DOC' to the drive and
       subdirectory from which they will be used, either floppy or hard
       drive.  Then change to that drive and type 'TS'.  After a few
       questions, TrackStar will configure itself and display the opening
       screen.  This screen displays the registration and program use
       information.  Press any key to continue.  The next screen displays
       the current reminders which have been entered.  At the bottom of
       the screen all commands are displayed.

       'A'dd will add a new entry to the reminder list.
       'R'ename will allow changing information in the selected entry.
       'E'rase will remove the entry from the reminder list.
       'P'rint will send the entire list to the printer.
       'U'pdate will set the reminder date for the next reminder cycle.
       'Esc' key terminates the program.

       Setup:
       =====
       When TrackStar is run, it checks for the presence of the DOS file
       'TS.CFG'.  If it is not found, TrackStar will prompt the user as
       to the type of monitor to be used (color or monochrome).  Then it
       will ask for the sorting method, whether by due date or by
       reminder name.  Finally, it asks for the data path where 'TS.DAT'
       is to be kept.  When these questions are answered, it creates a
       new file 'TS.CFG'.  If you wish to reconfigure TrackStar in the
       future, delete this file and run TrackStar again.  The data is
       kept in 'TS.DAT'.  DO NOT delete this file as all the reminders
       will be lost!



       Adding a new reminder:
       =====================
       To create a new reminder, select the 'A' option.  A pop-up menu
       guides the user through each step.  In the event that a menu
       option is incorrectly entered, the entry method is circular so
       that each entry can be re-entered before the reminder is saved to
       the data file.

          Name:
          ----
          At this prompt, enter the reminder name to be displayed in the
          reminder list.

          Frequency:
          ---------
          Select the menu option which represents the repetition cycle of
          the reminder.  The seven options for this entry are described
          below.

            1) 'One time' will trigger a reminder once on the date
               selected.  When updated it will be removed from the data
               file.

            2) 'Every ???? days' will request the number of days in the
               cycle, and the date the cycle will end.  This option
               should be used for weekly events as well.

            3) 'Every ???? months' will request the number of months in
               the cycle, and the day of the month the cycle ends.  This
               option would be used to reminder the user of events taking
               place on the tenth of every month or the fifteenth of
               every yearly quarter.  It can be used for yearly reminders
               such as birthdays.

            4) 'Twice a month' is used for cycles which are timed from
               the first of the month, but repeat again after 15 days.
               An example would be of reminders for the first and the
               fifteenth, or the fifth and the twentieth.  The user is
               prompted for the starting date.

            5) 'Monthly - Type A' is used for events which repeat
               monthly, but which occur on a specific day of the week.
               For example, the second Tuesday or the third Saturday of
               the month would use this option.

            6) 'Monthly - Type B' is used specifically for credit card
               payment dates.  The user is prompted to enter the
               statement closing date and the number of days in the grace
               period.  The program will calculate the due date
               automatically each month and enter the reminder.

            7) 'Monthly - Type C' is similar in function to 'Monthly -
               Type B' except that any closing date which falls on a
               weekend is automatically advanced to the following Monday
               for that particular month.



          Notes on options 6 & 7:
          ----------------------
          All credit card accounts (that we know of) have a billing cycle
          based on the number of days in the month, ie: the cycle always
          ends on the fifth of every month or the twenty second of every
          month.  Some companies, also end the statement for that month
          on the date of the billing cycle.  Others choose to move the
          closing date to the Monday following the billing cycle if it
          ends on a weekend.  The grace period (typically 25 days) is
          added to the closing date to determine the due date.

          Highlight the option of choice using the up/down arrow keys and
          press 'ENTER'.

          Next scheduled date:
          -------------------
          The entry will reflect the type of reminder frequency selected.
          Enter either the starting date, closing date, or the day of the
          week and week of the month as prompted by the appropriate
          pop-up menu.  The date can be increased or decreased by
          pressing '+' or '-' keys.

          Days in advance to remind:
          -------------------------
          At this prompt, enter the days in advance of the due date to
          highlight the reminder.


          Change date to current date when updating:
          -----------------------------------------
          Answer "Y" to this option when the reminder cycle should be
          rescheduled to begin at the date of the update (current date)
          rather than due date.  If a reminder  has been created for an
          oil change in a vehicle on the fifteenth of every third month,
          but was not performed until the twentieth, this option would
          allow the system to reschedule the next oil change for the
          twentieth day in three months rather than holding to a
          shortened cycle to end on the fifteenth as before.




       Renaming reminders:
       ==================
       Selecting the 'R' option will allow the highlighted reminder to be
       completely redefined.  All the options described above in adding
       reminders apply when renaming a reminder.


       Erasing reminders:
       =================
       Selecting the 'E' option will erase the highlighted reminder from
       the reminder data file.


       Printing reminders:
       ==================
       Selecting the 'P' option will send the entire reminder list to the
       printer.


       Updating reminders:
       ==================
       Selecting the 'U' option will update the highlighted reminder.  If
       the reminder is a one time only reminder, it will be deleted.  If
       it is to be repeated, then the next due date will be calculated
       and the reminder will be updated and stored into the data file
       with the new due date.
