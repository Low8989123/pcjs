## Information about "FONE: RESIDENTAL"

    If you are a home computer user looking for a way to bring long
    distance
    telephone bills under control, FONE RESIDENTIAL can help you reduce and
    track telecommunications costs.  FONE is a mature telephone call
    pricing database program for point-to-point, voice, FAX, E-mail, and BBS
    calls.
    
    FONE will display the approximate prices for national interstate long
    distance calls.  Several major telecommunication vendors are
    represented (AT&T, ITT, MCI, US SPRINT, etc.), including many
    services for each vendor.  For each query, FONE(tm) will display the
    point of origination, time, point of destination (over 1200 cities are
    in the national database), approximate call BEFORE IT IS PLACED, the
    vendor ID, effective date of the rates, call billing periods, and
    applicable times for the lowest rates.
    
    At the press of a button, FONE(tm) will track the price of an ongoing
    call in real time.  Several user options, using F-keys, are available,
    including adjustment of sample call times, volume discount calculation,
    the ability to temporarily exit to DOS while the timer is running, plus
    many other features.  A personal directory with notepad, for tracking
    contacts, is provided, and the user can get a printed report for each
    call displayed on the rate screen.
    
    FONE is very easy to use, features hot menus, and an extensive help
    facility.

If you are a home or small business computer user looking for a way to  
bring long-distance telephone bills under control, you might be         
interested in FONE. FONE is a database program for keeping track of     
telephone numbers and addresses.  It compares the rates charged by      
different long-distance services between the area code of the user and  
that of the party being called, and, on a computer equipped with a      
modem, FONE will automatically dial a number in its directory.  It can  
be used to time calls and indicate the cost of the call based on the    
long-distance service used and rate structure for that time of day.  It 
also may be used to look up the correct area code for a particular city,
or to provide a list of cities within a particular area code.           
                                                                        
FONE comes in three versions, each on its own disk; one for business    
users, one for residential users, and a third for international callers.
The author provides quarterly updates of rate information to registered 
users.                                                                  
                                                                        
FONE combines features that will be familiar to users of communications 
and address or mailing list database programs, although the combination 
of features in a single program may be new.                             
                                                                        
Telephone services acknowledged in this program may not always be       
complete or applicable for other parts of the country.  For example, ACC
service, which is popular among residential and business users in many  
areas of upstate New York is not included.                              
                                                                        
FONE can be used easily by someone with little computer experience by   
following the menu prompts, so the lack of a manual is not a problem.   
Some users may, in fact, appreciate this as a convenience.
