This disk contains CompuShow Version 8.21a with all required files in two
formats, in two sub-directories:

 \BBS   CSHOWA.EXE is a self-extracting LhArc, for posting on a BBS.
        If space is available, the file description could include the
        instructions:

         "Download as CSHOWA.EXE and run CSHOWA to de-archive the files.
          Then run PRINTDOC to print the program documentation."

 \SHARE The files in this sub-directory are intended for distribution on
        ShareWare disks. Program documentation is provided in README.EXE,
        and a sample graphic file is included.

        To use CompuShow as a viewer on a disk of graphics, the sample
        GIF file may be omitted, but you must include README.EXE and
        *.DRV in addition to CSHOW.EXE.

File DESCRIBE.TXT in the root directory is a brief description of the
program for a ShareWare catalog listing, etc.
