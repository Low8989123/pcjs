## Information about "MANDELBROT & JULIA SET GENERATOR (1241)"

    MANDEL generates and displays marvelously beautiful images based upon
    the recently developed area of mathematics called "fractal geometry."
    With this program, you can create an unlimited number of new images,
    change the colors of the images, and save the images to a disk file.
    Sample images are included, and on-line help suggests numerical values,
    making it easy to begin.
    
    The program has two outstanding features:  the assignment of color masks
    to create an unlimited range of color variations for each image, and the
    ability to zoom in and magnify selected portions of the screen.
    
    MANDEL is a comprehensive program that takes some time to create a new
    image, but once saved to disk the image can be displayed on the screen
    more quickly.  You can also generate Julia images, which are similar to
    the Mandelbrot images, but require different numerical values to create
    the image.  The documentation has suggested readings for more
    information on Mandelbrot and Julia set images.

Disk No: 1076
Program Title: MANDELBROT & JULIA SET GENERATOR for EGA/VGA (Disk 1 of 2)
PC-SIG version: 1.1

This disk adds additional patterns to the original program that allowed
you to generate detailed and colorful mathematical patterns called
fractals.  Patterns are based upon a recently developed part of
mathematics called "fractal geometry," which creates images in which
each smaller part of the image has the same pattern as the whole part of
the image.  With this program, you can generate an unlimited amount of
new images, change the colors of the images, and save the images to a
disk file.

MANDELBROT is a comprehensive program that takes some time to generate a
new image, but once saved to disk the image can be displayed on the
screen more quickly.  It lets you create "Mandelbrot set" images and
"Julia set" images.  The Julia images are similar to the Mandelbrot
images, but require different numerical values to be inputted to
generate the image.  On-line help displays suggest numerical values for
both Mandelbrot and Julia images.  Sample images are already included,
and the documentation has suggested readings for more information on
Mandelbrot and Julia set images.

Usage:  Fractal Images/Mandelbrot and Julia Set Generator.

Special Requirements:  EGA or VGA graphics and monitor.

                                MANDEL
                             Version  3.0
                   MANDELBROT - JULIA SET GENERATOR 

    MANDEL is a comprehensive program that generates and displays 
Mandelbrot and Julia sets, using VGA or EGA graphics. MANDEL 
autodetects the graphics hardware available and initializes the 
software for either VGA or EGA. The images produced are 480 pixels 
square in VGA mode and 480 x 350 in EGA, with a choice of 16 different 
colors. Images are generated and then stored on disk and the colors 
for the various dwell values, assigned to each pixel, can be changed. 
Standard color masks can be assigned and stored on disk for each 
image. Image files are automatically stored in compressed format and 
decompressed on retrieval, thereby saving disk space and improving 
speed. Users not completely familiar with Mandelbrot and Julia sets 
are referred to the following publications: 

    Dewdney, A.K.  Computer Recreations column. Scientific American, 
August 1985. (This was the first major article on the Mandelbrot set
that caught the attention of the public.)

    Gleick, J.  Chaos, Making a New Science.  Viking, New York, 1987. 

    Peitgen, H.O. & Richter, P.H.  The Beauty of Fractals.  Springer-
Verlag, New York, 1985. 

    Peitgen, H.O. & Saupe, D.  The Science of Fractal Images. 
Springer-Verlag, New York, 1988. 

    To start the program simply type MANDEL at the DOS prompt. The 
main menu displays six small samples of Mandelbrot and Julia sets and 
the various commands that are available. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    M - Generate Mandelbrot set.

    This command produces a Mandelbrot set. The pixels in the array 
are both displayed and stored on a disk file as they are generated. 
Each pixel has a dwell value assigned to it which represents the size 
or magnitude associated with that point of the array. The image can be 
viewed later with the "D" command. The user is asked for a new file 
name, the center point of the array and the magnification. The 
magnification is defined as 2 divided by the image width. The values 

                              -1.7  0  8
    
represent an image centered at x = -1.7, y = 0 and a magnification of 
8. These values would generate the array from -1.825 to -1.575 in the 
x direction and -0.125 to 0.125 in the y direction. Note that spaces 
separate the numbers and that a leading zero must be put before the 
decimal point on decimal values. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    J - Generate Julia set.

    This command is similar to the "M" command except different values 
are input. A good value for the center point and magnification is 
always 

                               0  0  0.5 
    
although a slightly larger value for the magnification like 0.6 or 0.7 
will often enlarge the interesting part of the image slightly. A point 
in the plane must also be chosen, and should be from the boundary 
region of the Mandelbrot set, for example 0.32 0.043. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    P - Plot dwell values of a stored Mandelbrot or Julia set.

    This function has you type in the file name and then reads and 
sums all of the various dwell values of an image file. The sum for 
each value is then plotted in the colors assigned by the current color 
mask. This function is useful when trying to decide what colors should 
be assigned to the various ranges of dwell values that exist for a 
given image. Samples of the 16 different colors available and their 
numbers are also displayed. The maximum dwell value should be kept to 
511 when using this plot feature.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    D - Display Mandelbrot or Julia set.

    A previously generated Mandelbrot or Julia set can be displayed on 
the screen using this command. On startup a default color mask is loaded 
and unless changed will be used to determine the colors used for the 
various dwell values that were stored for each image file. The user 
chooses an image file to display by pressing the <Enter> key when the 
desired image file name is highlighted. The highlighted area can be 
moved with the arrow keys. If the user interrupts the generation of a 
Mandelbrot or Julia set, such that the image is only partially 
completed, the generation can be continued by simply displaying the 
partial image at which point the image will be completed. 

    Users can break out of the generation or display of a Mandelbrot 
or Julia set by simply pressing the <Esc> key. The program will halt 
and return to DOS after finishing the current line when generating an 
image; when displaying an image the <Esc> will return the program to the 
main menu.

    After an image has been displayed the following functions are 
available through the Alt toggle keys:

    Alt B - Blank Side Panels.

    This function simply blanks out the side panels with the XCent, 
YCent, Mag, etc. information and the Color Mask. This creates a cleaner 
display screen for those who wish to take photographs of the images. 
After the side panels have been blanked pressing any key will return the 
program to the main menu.

    Alt Z - The Zoom Function.

    This function makes the generation of new images at increased 
magnification very easy. After an image has been displayed using the D 
command, enter an Alt Z (hold down the Alt key and enter a letter Z). A 
small window with a center crosshair will appear in the center of the 
displayed image. This zoom window can be moved around with the following 
keys: 

          Arrow up    - moves the zoom window up one pixel
          Arrow down  - moves the zoom window down one pixel
          Arrow left  - moves the zoom window left one pixel
          Arrow right - moves the zoom window right one pixel
          Alt L       - inceases the size of the zoom window
          Alt S       - decreases the size of the zoom window

    After the zoom window has been placed such that it surrounds the 
area of the image to be magnified, enter an Alt G and the new image will 
be generated. To exit the Zoom Function without generating a new image
press the <Esc> key.
    Note that as the zoom window is moved about, the new values for X-
Center, Y-Center and Magnification which will be used for the magnified 
image, are updated and displayed in the upper left.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    S - Display, Load, Create a color mask or Set the maximum dwell 
        value (10 - 10,000).

    These are very useful functions that make a big difference in the 
appearance of the images that are displayed. 
    Choosing the "C" subcommand will prompt the user for a file name 
and an array of numbers that defines a color mask. Color mask names 
must have the extension .MSK, the default color mask being COLOR.MSK.
Each line input should consist of four numbers, separated by spaces (not 
commas). The four numbers are the low range dwell value, the high range 
dwell value, the color for odd dwell values and the color for even dwell 
values. The numbers 

                             10  19  1  2 
    
would mean color the odd dwell values between 10 and 19 with color 1 
(blue), and the even dwell values with color 2(green). If a solid 
color is desired the two color numbers should be the same. When the 
chosen number of lines has been input (maximum of 32), they are stored 
on disk as a color mask, which can be loaded later, replacing the 
default color mask. The default color mask is: 

                   LowRange HighRange Color1 Color2 
                   --------------------------------
                      0       19        1      1 
                     20       29       14      1 
                     30       34        4      4 
                     35       49       12     12 
                     50       99       14     14 
                    100      511        0      0 

    The color numbers are: 

                 0 - Black           8 - Dark Gray 
                 1 - Blue            9 - Light Blue 
                 2 - Green          10 - Light Green 
                 3 - Cyan           11 - Light Cyan 
                 4 - Red            12 - Light Red 
                 5 - Magenta        13 - Light Magenta
                 6 - Brown          14 - Yellow 
                 7 - Light Gray     15 - White 

    The "L" subcommand loads an existing color mask you have created 
from disk. Color mask files must have the extension .MSK. The 
highlighted color mask will be loaded when the <Enter> key is pressed. 
    The "D" subcommand displays the current color mask MANDEL will use 
while generating a new image or displaying a previously stored image. 
    The "S" subcommand allows the user to set the maximum dwell value. 
The default value is 511, and range of possible values the user can 
set is from 10 to 10,000. Simple plots of wide areas can use smaller 
values which will shorten the computation time for new images. Larger 
values are necessary if good detail is wanted on images that are 
highly magnified. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    H - The Help command.

    The Help command displays a screen of suggested input values and 
the default color mask. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Converting Version 1.0 files for use with versions 2.0 and higher.

    The file that contains an image is simply the named file without any 
extension. For example, if you generate an image TEST1 then the image 
itself is stored in a file named TEST1 and the initial input parameters 
are stored in TEST1.HDR. As it turns out, the TEST1 file will be 
identical in any version, ie. Ver. 1.0 and 2.0 produce the same 
compressed data file. The only reason you can't use your files created 
with Ver. 1.0 is that they lack a header (.HDR) file. This is a simple 
matter to fix. 

    To add the header files (those with extension .HDR) to files generated with 
Ver. 1.0 such that they can be used with higher numbered versions, assume you 
have a Ver. 1.0 image file called MAN01:

    1. Begin generation of a new image file for MAN01 using the same input 
       parameters. Use a temporary name for this image such as TEMP. Note that
       the values for XMin, YMin and Side will have to first be converted to 
       the new input values XCent, YCent and Mag used by Ver. 2.0 and higher.
       The equations to convert these values are as follows:

                            XCent = XMin+(Side*0.5)
                            YCent = YMin+(Side*0.5)
                            Mag   = 2/Side

    2. Once generation begins immediately press <Esc> and the program will quit 
       after one vertical line has been produced.
    
    3. At the DOS prompt erase the TEMP file by typing:

            ERASE TEMP

    4. Next rename the TEMP.HDR file to MAN01.HDR by typing the following at 
       the DOS prompt.

            RENAME TEMP.HDR MAN01.HDR

    At this point re-enter the MANDEL program and the MAN01 image file should 
be useable by Ver. 2.0 and higher.

    Some suggested parameters for Mandelbrot sets are: 

                         XCent     YCent     Mag

                   (8)  -0.7700834 0.1131875 200
     
    Suggested Julia set parameters are: 

                 XCent    YCent    Mag      A        B 
           -------------------------------------------------

    Any center point of an interesting Mandelbrot set makes a good 
choice for the A and B values for a Julia set.
