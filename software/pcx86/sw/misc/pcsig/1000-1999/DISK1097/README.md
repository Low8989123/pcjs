## Information about "RESUMEBEST (FORMGEN NOW ON #1561)"

    For most of us, the first contact a prospective employer has is not with
    us but with our resume.  This is truly a first impression and we should
    take care that it is the best we can present.  RESUMEBEST can help you
    create a good-looking, properly-prepared resume.
    
    RESUMEBEST presents several different formats.  You choose the one that
    best fits your past experience and the particular job you are seeking.
    Not only does it show what you should do for each resume section, but it
    also gives information concerning the proper order of
    presentation, the correct wording, the amount of copy you should write,
    the type of paper to use, how to make a cover letter, and more.

100 PRINT "     This section of your resume is your miscellaneous area
110 PRINT "     where you can place any information that didn't properly
120 PRINT "     fit into other categories.  It should always be the second
130 PRINT "     to the last category shown, just before the REFERENCE area.
140 PRINT "
150 INPUT "     PRESS YOUR RETURN OR ENTER KEY TO CONTINUE...";Z$
160 CLS
170 PRINT "
180 PRINT "     Keep in mind that you can lump all your additional infor-
190 PRINT "     mation into this category and just give it the title of
200 PRINT "     ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, or you can actually break off and
210 PRINT "     list certain categories separately if you so desire.
220 PRINT "
230 PRINT "     Some of the information that can be contained in this section
240 PRINT "     is:
250 PRINT "
260 PRINT "     PERSONAL INFORMATION
270 PRINT "     SALARY REQUIREMENTS
280 PRINT "     MILITARY
290 PRINT "     CIVIC ACTIVITIES
300 PRINT "     PROFESSIONAL AFFILIATIONS
310 PRINT "     HONORS AND AWARDS
320 PRINT "
330 PRINT "     Again, these can be listed all together under ADDITIONAL
340 PRINT "     INFORMATION, as one category, or broken off separately and
350 PRINT "     highlighted as a separate area.  Examples will follow at
360 PRINT "     the end of this section.
370 PRINT "
380 INPUT "     PRESS YOUR RETURN OR ENTER KEY TO CONTINUE...";Z$
390 CLS
400 PRINT "
410 PRINT "     Let's briefly discuss each category and then you can make
420 PRINT "     the decision as to whether you have enough pertinent infor-
430 PRINT "     mation in any one area to break it off or if you will just
440 PRINT "     combine it all under ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.
450 PRINT "
460 PRINT "     PERSONAL INFORMATION:
470 PRINT "
480 PRINT "     Included in this category can be personal statistics con-
490 PRINT "     cerning you and your life outside of the job.  This is not
500 PRINT "     a required section; in fact, it is against the law for a
510 PRINT "     prospective employer to ask  you any of these questions.
520 PRINT "     However, it is completely proper for you to volunteer this
530 PRINT "     information and you should if you feel like it will help
540 PRINT "     you appear in your best possible light to the interviewer.
550 PRINT "     You can include your marital status, number of children,
560 PRINT "     health information, hobbies and interests.  You can also
570 PRINT "     list if you would be willing to travel and/or willing to
580 PRINT "     relocate for a position.  Keep in mind that you want to
590 PRINT "     only list information that will help you.
591 PRINT "
592 INPUT "     PRESS YOUR RETURN OR ENTER KEY TO CONTINUE...";Z$
593 CLS
594 PRINT "
595 PRINT "     For example:
600 PRINT "     If you are a woman with several small children, you may not
610 PRINT "     want to list that you have children and their ages.  Some
620 PRINT "     potential employers may feel you will be home with sick
630 PRINT "     children or problems a lot.  Unfair, it's true, but the
640 PRINT "     resume is your opportunity to put yourself in the best
650 PRINT "     possible light, so don't list any information that may be
660 PRINT "     seen as negative in an interviewer's eyes--fair or unfair!
670 PRINT "
680 PRINT "     The following is an example of how you can show personal
690 PRINT "     information under an ADDITIONAL INFORMATION section:
700 PRINT "
710 PRINT "     ADDITIONAL     Marital Status:       Single
720 PRINT "     INFORMATION:   No. of Children:      None
730 PRINT "                    Health:               Excellent
740 PRINT "                    Willing to travel:    Yes
750 PRINT "                    Willing to relocate:  Yes
760 PRINT "
770 PRINT "     This is information that would probably help the applicant,
780 PRINT "     especially with a nationwide organization that might be
790 PRINT "     interested in transferring you.  You are single, with no
800 PRINT "     family responsibilities; in good health and willing to move.
810 PRINT "
820 INPUT "     PRESS YOUR RETURN OR ENTER KEY TO CONTINUE...";Z$
830 CLS
840 PRINT "
850 PRINT "     SALARY REQUIREMENTS:
860 PRINT "
870 PRINT "     While you are free to list any minimum beginning salary or
880 PRINT "     a salary range in this section, it is advisable to leave
890 PRINT "     yourself open and discuss this at interview time.  For
900 PRINT "     example, you may put down Minimum Starting Salary: $20,000/yr.
910 PRINT "     If the job started at $19,000, they may not interview you when
920 PRINT "     in fact you would have considered it due to the excellent
930 PRINT "     benefits, bonuses, advancement opportunities, etc.  It can
940 PRINT "     hurt you the other way too.  Perhaps the job started at $23,000,
950 PRINT "     but they see you are willing to accept $20,000 so they drop the
960 PRINT "     salary.  Unless you have an absolute minimum and want to weed
970 PRINT "     out any positions beneath that, the following is usually best:
980 PRINT "
990 PRINT "     SALARY          Negotiable;
995 PRINT "     REQUIREMENTS:   Will discuss at interview time.
996 PRINT "
997 INPUT "     PRESS YOUR RETURN OR ENTER KEY TO CONTINUE...";Z$
998 CLS
999 PRINT "
1000 PRINT "     MILITARY:
1020 PRINT "     Military can be shown as a separate section, mentioned in
1030 PRINT "     additional information only or listed in your EXPERIENCE
1040 PRINT "     section.  It depends on what space you have available on
1050 PRINT "     your resume and if it will help you to expand on this.
1070 PRINT "     Usually, mentioning that you have served your country is
1080 PRINT "     seen in a favorable light, and I recommend putting it
1090 PRINT "     somewhere on the resume.  The only time I recommend it
1100 PRINT "     detailed in length in the EXPERIENCE section is when the
1110 PRINT "     the experience you gained in the military and the positions
1120 PRINT "     you held are directly applicable to your objective.  For
1130 PRINT "     instance, if you were in a management or supervisory position
1140 PRINT "     in the service and seeking a management position in the
1150 PRINT "     civilian working world, then I would detail your military
1160 PRINT "     supervisory positions.  I recommend taking out any military
1170 PRINT "     terminology, however, and making it as civilian-oriented as
1180 PRINT "     possible.  Use the same format as you would for any other
1190 PRINT "     position listed in your EXPERIENCE section.
1210 PRINT "     The following is an example of how it can be briefly noted:
1230 PRINT "     MILITARY:     U.S. ARMY, 3 years, Honorable Discharge
1240 PRINT "
1250 INPUT "     PRESS YOUR RETURN OR ENTER KEY TO CONTINUE...";Z$
1260 CLS
1270 PRINT "
1280 PRINT "     CIVIC ACTIVITIES:
1300 PRINT "     Civic activities includes any community or volunteer work
1310 PRINT "     you may have performed, either in the present or the past.
1330 PRINT "     These can include organizations such as the boy scouts,
1340 PRINT "     telethons, political campaigns, little league, etc.  If
1350 PRINT "     you have been active in the community, this can sometimes
1360 PRINT "     help you on the resume.  It helps you to appear as a civic
1370 PRINT "     minded, community conscious individual and prospective
1380 PRINT "     employers like this type of integrity and moral character.
1400 PRINT "     If you have one or two activities, I would suggest just
1410 PRINT "     including it in the ADDITIONAL INFORMATION section.  If
1420 PRINT "     you have extensive activities, I would recommend a separate
1430 PRINT "     section where it will really stand out.  As an example:
1450 PRINT "     CIVIC          Currently active in Little League Baseball
1460 PRINT "     ACTIVITIES:    as a Coach and American Heart Association as
1470 PRINT "                    a Volunteer Collector.
1480 PRINT "                    Past activities include Board Member of
1490 PRINT "                    Opportunity Village, a non-profit organiza-
1500 PRINT "                    tion for employment of the handicapped.

1520 INPUT "     PRESS YOUR RETURN OR ENTER KEY TO CONTINUE...";Z$
1530 CLS
1540 PRINT "
1550 PRINT "     PROFESSIONAL AFFILIATIONS:
1560 PRINT "
1570 PRINT "     Memberships in any professional or business association,
1580 PRINT "     particularly if they are directly associated with your
1590 PRINT "     career field, can be included in the ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
1600 PRINT "     section or shown separately under PROFESSIONAL AFFILIATIONS
1610 PRINT "     or PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS or even PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES.
1620 PRINT "     If you have held offices, include those and also include if
1630 PRINT "     it is a present or a past activity/position.  Example:
1640 PRINT "
1650 PRINT "     PROFESSIONAL    Current member of:
1660 PRINT "     AFFILIATIONS:   Toastmasters, Local #131;
1670 PRINT "                     Personnel Directors Association.
1680 PRINT "                     Past President of:
1690 PRINT "                     Women Business Owners of America.

1730 PRINT "
1740 PRINT "     HONORS AND AWARDS (or SPECIAL ACHIEVEMENTS):
1750 PRINT "
1760 PRINT "     As mentioned with all other material in this section, honors
1770 PRINT "     and awards should be lumped in the ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
1780 PRINT "     section if brief and given its own category if extensive or
1790 PRINT "     important.
1800 PRINT "
1810 PRINT "     Information in this section can include any type of honor
1820 PRINT "     and award you have received, whether academic, sports,
1830 PRINT "     military, business or from your employers.  You can include
1840 PRINT "     such items as attending school on scholarship--academic or
1850 PRINT "     athletic; being employee of the month; receiving the United
1860 PRINT "     States Air Force Good Conduct Medal, being voted Mother of
1870 PRINT "     the year, etc.  Even awards that are not within your career
1880 PRINT "     field can still show you as an achiever and put you in a
1890 PRINT "     favorable light with prospective employers.  A brief example:
1900 PRINT "
1910 PRINT "     HONORS         Recipient, George A. Smith Scholarship Fund
1920 PRINT "                    Employee of the Year (entire nation),
1930 PRINT "                    TOWACORPORATION, 1985.
1940 PRINT "
1950 INPUT "     PRESS YOUR RETURN OR ENTER KEY TO CONTINUE...";Z$
1960 CLS
1970 PRINT "
1980 PRINT "     In conclusion, keep in mind this general principle of whether
1990 PRINT "     you should put all miscellaneous material into ADDITIONAL
2000 PRINT "     INFORMATION or break it off into its own category...
2010 PRINT "
2020 PRINT "     If the information is extensive...
2030 PRINT "     If it is extremely favorable towards you...
2040 PRINT "     If it directly applies to your career field...
2050 PRINT "     It it is something you are extremely proud of...
2060 PRINT "
2070 PRINT "     then you should probably make it a separate category.
2080 PRINT "
2090 PRINT "     This is usually not a problem on a two-page, but can be more
2100 PRINT "     more difficult on a one-page.  Just use your editing skills
2110 PRINT "     and keep cutting it down until it works for you!

120 PRINT "     A cover letter should be used to introduce your resume when
130 PRINT "     you are mailing out cold.  In other words, you decide you
140 PRINT "     might want to work for a particular company and decide to
150 PRINT "     send your resume, in case they have any openings in your
160 PRINT "     area or to keep on file for future possible openings.  You
170 PRINT "     do not need a cover letter when responding to advertised
180 PRINT "     openings or when the resume has been requested from you.
190 PRINT "     The purpose of the cover letter is to tell the organization
200 PRINT "     why they are getting the resume.  This does not have to be
210 PRINT "     explained when they are soliciting the resume themselves.
220 PRINT "
230 PRINT "     There can be exceptions to this rule.  For example, if you
240 PRINT "     are applying for a particular position and your resume does
250 PRINT "     not contain enough detail about your past experience as it
260 PRINT "     relates to this area, then you can use a cover letter to give

350 PRINT "     There are two types of cover letters...the individually

380 PRINT "     always best to go with a personalized, individually prepared
390 PRINT "     cover letter, written specifically to a company and/or
400 PRINT "     individual, concerning their needs only.  If time, money or
410 PRINT "     equipment presents a problem to you, you can do a generic
420 PRINT "     cover letter, using it for all jobs you apply for.  In that
430 PRINT "     case, you can't date it or address the letter individually;
440 PRINT "     just use the salutation DEAR SIR OR MADAM: or TO WHOM IT MAY
450 PRINT "     CONCERN.  Then prepare the body of the letter so it will fit
460 PRINT "     all possible jobs applied for or in other words, just make it
470 PRINT "     a general introduction to your resume.
490 PRINT "     If you do a specific letter, you can insert the proper company
500 PRINT "     name, individual's name, position advertised, etc., and tailor
510 PRINT "     all parts of the letter specifically for this job and company.
520 PRINT "     The cover letter should be neatly prepared; no spelling or
530 PRINT "     typographical errors and should be fairly brief, leaving a lot
540 PRINT "     of white space around the outside so the reader will feel he/she
550 PRINT "     can read it quickly.

860 PRINT "          chronologically by other education/training.
870 PRINT "
880 PRINT "     EDUCATION should always follow your OBJECTIVE or follow
890 PRINT "     the SUMMARY OF QUALIFICATIONS section if there is one.
900 PRINT "     The only exception is if your EXPERIENCE shows you in a

880 PRINT "     You will note that the targeted resume was obviously a person
890 PRINT "     interested in a legal secretarial position only.  However, this
900 PRINT "     particular person had been in and out of this profession for
910 PRINT "     20 years, trying other lines of work.  You can see it looked
920 PRINT "     much better to target and lump all 15 years of legal secretarial
930 PRINT "     work together and mention the other positions at the end instead
940 PRINT "     of showing it in chronological order: first a legal secre-
950 PRINT "     tarial position, then waitress, then back to legal secretarial,
960 PRINT "     then cashier, then back to legal secretarial, etc.  That chrono-

980 PRINT "     a job-hopper; someone who couldn't stick with something or
990 PRINT "     couldn't make up their mind.  Targeted, however, this looks like
991 PRINT "     a person with a lot of expertise!
992 PRINT "
993 PRINT "     The person in the accomplishment-type resume looks good, but
994 PRINT "     this was a person who had job-hopped and held a dozen manage-

996 PRINT "     light to merely pull out their major accomplishments and let the
997 PRINT "     reader see those, instead of the many different positions.

1090 PRINT "     do it, as your first impression to the employer is what counts.

1130 PRINT "     because the initial first impression was good.
1140 PRINT "
1150 PRINT "     The most commonly used format in the EXPERIENCE section is the
1160 PRINT "     chronological format.  You should list your most recent or

1180 PRINT "     employment (month/year preferable), company name, location,
1190 PRINT "     and a brief description of your major responsibilities.  There
1200 PRINT "     are many different formats for listing this.  I will show you
1210 PRINT "     several styles in the screens that follow.  You may also select

Program Title: RESUMEBEST & FORMGEN version 3.31
PC-SIG version: 1.4

Perhaps one of the most important factors in job interviews is not only
a first impression, but also what you give your prospective employers -
your resume.  It is a set of files that has valuable information on how
you can create the best possible resume.  Not only can you achieve a
better looking resume, but it is done at a much lower price than what
other services offer.  RESUMEBEST does not recommend that you slavishly
follow one particular format.  But it presents several different formats
so that you can choose the one that best fits your past experience and
the particular job you are looking for.  Not only does it show what you
should do for each resume section, but it also gives information
concerning the proper order of presentation, the correct wording, the
amount you should write, the type of paper that should be used, how to
make a cover sheet, and more.  The files on this disk include sample
resumes in different formats so that you can learn the proper order for
writing a resume.  Other files on this disk should be referred to as you
prepare your resume.  Everyone eventually has to write a resume, and
RESUMEBEST will help you review and prepare each of your resumes and
will give some important tips and pointers.  RESUMEBEST is a program
that has professional advice that you should not do without -- your
improved resume will give you a better chance to obtaining your next, or
even first job.

FORMGEN works like a word processor with added graphics features useful
for creating forms.  Horizontal and Vertical thin and thick lines are
among the most frequently used functions and are activated by pressing
Alt F1, F2 and Ctrl F1, F2.  Contents can be easily marked and copied,
or moved to other destinations in the document.  You can print a form by
pressing Alt F10, and options for Pica (10 cpi) or Elite (12 cpi) are
available.  The word processor has most standard functions plus easy
access to quick reference help (F10), quick display of files (Alt F),
and calling the operating system to load a secondary copy of DOS (Alt
O), allowing files to be copied, disks formatted, and other programs to
be run from within FormGen.  The program is easy to use and an effective
tool for making forms with graphics limited to the combinations of thin
and thick lines and two type fonts and sizes.

Usage:  Job Resumes/Forms Generation.

Special Requirements:  RESUMEBEST requires BASIC or GWBASIC.

How to Start:  Type GO (press enter).  For RESUMEBEST, you must first
load BASIC then load README.BAS for further instructions about the
program.

Suggested Registration:  $29.95 for RESUMEBEST, $35.00 for FORMGEN.

140 PRINT "    put all that knowledge into this RESUMEBEST disk for you!
150 PRINT "
160 PRINT "    At any time during this program you wish to print informa-

230 PRINT "    own resume that you are not only saving yourself anywhere
240 PRINT "    from $25.00 - $250.00, which is what a professional resume
250 PRINT "    service would charge you for a resume from scratch, but you
260 PRINT "    will probably get a better resume because not only do you

400 PRINT "                 * One Page   ***   Two Page *
410 PRINT "
420 PRINT "     Whenever possible, use a one-page resume.  We live in an
430 PRINT "     extremely rushed and busy society and if you can concisely
440 PRINT "     put your most important information on a one-page, do it.
450 PRINT "     If you have extensive experience, qualifications, education,
460 PRINT "     etc. and feel a one-page just won't do you justice, then go
470 PRINT "     to the second page.
480 PRINT "
490 PRINT "     A chronological resume is the most preferable form and it
500 PRINT "     means that all your experience and education is shown in
510 PRINT "     chronological order--from the most recent on back.  This is
520 PRINT "     what prospective employers expect to see and should always

610 PRINT "     A targeted resume is where you are specifically going for
620 PRINT "     one particular job, area of field.  It is very detailed
630 PRINT "     in one area only, even if you have other areas of expertise.
640 PRINT "
650 PRINT "     A accomplishment resume is best used when you don't want to
660 PRINT "     go chronological form due to gaps, short time on the job,
670 PRINT "     etc.  An accomplishment resume can disguise these factors
680 PRINT "     while showing the prospective employer what skills, talents
690 PRINT "     and experience you do have.
700 PRINT "
710 PRINT "     The forms to use for structuring your resume are shown in
720 PRINT "     the OUTLINE1 section for a one-page and OUTLINE2 section
730 PRINT "     for a two-page resume.  These basic structures can be used
740 PRINT "     whether you are doing a chronological, targeted or accomplish-
750 PRINT "     ment type resume.  The category names would remain the same;
760 PRINT "     you would change the content depending on which form you
770 PRINT "     select.

820 PRINT "     For example,  let's use the experience section to detail
830 PRINT "     this.  In a chronological resume, under EXPERIENCE, you
840 PRINT "     would put your most recent job first, with the dates
850 PRINT "     included.  In an accomplishment resume, you would not
860 PRINT "     even list your EXPERIENCE section by job or date, but by
870 PRINT "     a list of accomplishments, responsibilities, awards and
880 PRINT "     duties.  In a targeted resume, the EXPERIENCE section
890 PRINT "     might not start out with the most recent position if you
900 PRINT "     had another position in the past that was more applicable
910 PRINT "     to your current goal you were targeting the resume for.
920 PRINT "     You might not list dates either.
930 PRINT "
940 PRINT "     Don't worry too much about what kind of resume you have.
950 PRINT "     This is for your information only, to assist you in forming
960 PRINT "     a correct mental picture of your particular goals and back-
970 PRINT "     ground and which way to formulate and present it, to show
980 PRINT "     you in your best possible light so you can get the job you
990 PRINT "     want.  That is what RESUMEBEST is all about...to teach you
991 PRINT "     how to do your own resume, fine tuning it to present you

1010 PRINT "     The basic components in a resume include the sections
1020 PRINT "     listed in the README section or the directory of this
1030 PRINT "     disk.  Your one or two page resume can consist of the
1040 PRINT "     categories:  OBJECTIVE, SUMMARY OF QUALIFICATIONS,
1050 PRINT "     EDUCATION, EXPERIENCE, ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFERENCES.
1060 PRINT "     Your resume package can also consist of a COVER SHEET,
1070 PRINT "     A COVER LETTER, A REFERENCE SHEET AND A THANK YOU LETTER.
1080 PRINT "     What components you select will depend on your particular
1090 PRINT "     background.  Each section of this disk details a specific
1100 PRINT "     area to assist you in your selection.
1110 PRINT "
1120 PRINT "     As you study the OUTLINE1 and OUTLINE2 section, keep in
1130 PRINT "     mind that format and appearance are extremely important.
1140 PRINT "     This is the first impression a prospective employer will
1150 PRINT "     have of you.  That is why I recommend placing category
1160 PRINT "     titles to the left, bolded, leaving some white space so
1170 PRINT "     the page doesn't appear too full and crowded and the reader
1180 PRINT "     can easily pick out what he/she wants to read.  The quality
1190 PRINT "     of your paper should be good--thick, light colored paper
1200 PRINT "     such as gray parchment or beige linen is best.  Keep in
1210 PRINT "     mind that your resume on first impression should have a
1220 PRINT "     positive visual impact--before the content is even read!

1310 PRINT "     FREE...NO SPELLING/PUNCTUATION ERRORS AT ALL!  This is
1320 PRINT "     very important and if you aren't qualified to do that
1330 PRINT "     yourself, hire someone to do the final typing for you.
1340 PRINT "     NO STRIKEOVERS OR CORRECTIONS.  And either have original
1350 PRINT "     print-outs of the resume done, excellent copies or have
1360 PRINT "     the resume typeset.  The first visual impression of the
1370 PRINT "     resume is how the reader will view you, and if that
1380 PRINT "     impression is that you sloppily prepared your resume,
1390 PRINT "     the reader may feel you will sloppily handle a job.
1410 PRINT "     While you are writing and preparing the various sections,
1420 PRINT "     remember to stay in the THIRD PERSON at all times.  In
1430 PRINT "     other words, you never use the words I or MY.  When you
1440 PRINT "     use I or MY, it sounds as if you are saying all these
1450 PRINT "     wonderful things about yourself, and it is not as believ-
1460 PRINT "     able to the reader as if it is written in the third person
1470 PRINT "     and it sounds like someone else is saying all these wonder-
1480 PRINT "     ful things about you!  For example, you wouldn't say:

1550 PRINT "     While you are doing your creative writing in the various
1560 PRINT "     sections, use as many action verbs as possible.  Using
1570 PRINT "     action verbs shows you are a DOING or CAN DO person and
1580 PRINT "     gives the interviewer the impression you CAN GET THINGS
1590 PRINT "     DONE!  Action verbs include such words as:
1600 PRINT "        developed, created, implemented, initiated, handled,
1610 PRINT "        presented, solved, managed, coordinated, composed,
1620 PRINT "        controlled, motivated, administered, ETC.!

1650 PRINT "     the feeling that you are an ACTION person--a DOER!
1660 PRINT "
1670 PRINT "     Feel free to use some adjectives in your descriptions,
1680 PRINT "     particularly in the SUMMARY OF QUALIFICATIONS section,
1690 PRINT "     but don't get carried away.  Prospective employers don't
1700 PRINT "     want to read a novel...or read too many descriptive
1710 PRINT "     phrases as they are well aware that anything can be said
1720 PRINT "     on paper!  Some good adjectives include:
1730 PRINT "             excellent...successful...extensive...
1740 PRINT "
1750 PRINT "     If you have a word processor with a thesaurus, now is the

130 PRINT "     HOW YOU MAIL YOUR RESUME CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE!
140 PRINT "
150 PRINT "     The most important point is never fold your resume to fit
160 PRINT "     it inside an envelope.  Don't use the standard #10 business
170 PRINT "     envelope, even if you have matching ones to the color of
180 PRINT "     your resume paper.  When you fold your resume, it destroys
190 PRINT "     the clean, smooth look of the page.  The prospective employer
200 PRINT "     receives it, opens the envelope, takes it out and begins to
210 PRINT "     wrestle with it right away, trying to smooth out the folds
220 PRINT "     so he/she can read it.  Not only is this irritating and time
230 PRINT "     consuming, but during the smoothing out process, they can
240 PRINT "     actually rub off some of the print!  Think about it...you go
250 PRINT "     to a lot of time and often expense to print up a nice looking
260 PRINT "     resume, understanding that the first visual impression of
270 PRINT "     the resume, how it looks, the quality of paper, etc. is what
280 PRINT "     the prospective employer first sees about you...AND THEN YOU
290 PRINT "     GO AND FOLD IT AND RUIN IT!  Always mail your resume out flat.
300 PRINT "     Never fold it.  Buy the large manilla envelopes in tan or
310 PRINT "     white, 9x12 inches and insert your resume/materials in that.

380 PRINT "
390 PRINT "     Other considerations for proper mailing include:
400 PRINT "
410 PRINT "     Consider placing your resume between two stiff pieces of
420 PRINT "     cardboard to protect it from being bent or creased.
430 PRINT "
440 PRINT "     Shop your local office supply or stationary stores for the
450 PRINT "     purchase of a folder to place your resume in for protection
460 PRINT "     and a better appearance.  A variety of folders exist,
470 PRINT "     in different colors, wood grained or clear covers.
480 PRINT "
490 PRINT "     When addressing the envelope, try and find out the name of
500 PRINT "     individual to send it to, rather than just PERSONNEL DEPT.
510 PRINT "     or HUMAN RESOURCES DIVISION.  Then address it to this person
520 PRINT "     specifically and mark it PERSONAL & CONFIDENTIAL.  Your
530 PRINT "     resume will have a better chance of being read this way as
540 PRINT "     it is personalized.

640 PRINT "     If you are mailing your resume to a prospective employer who
650 PRINT "     has either requested it from you or you are responding to a
660 PRINT "     definite opening, then it is perfectly acceptable to just mail
670 PRINT "     the resume.  However, if you are mailing out without being
680 PRINT "     solicited or to a company who has not advertised any openings,
690 PRINT "     because you want your resume on file, then you should include a
700 PRINT "     cover letter with your resume, stating why they are recieving
710 PRINT "     your resume--otherwise, it can be confusing to the prospective
720 PRINT "     employer, presenting a slightly negative impression.  Please see
730 PRINT "     the COVLTR section of this disk for more information on when and
740 PRINT "     how to prepare and include a cover letter.
770 PRINT "     In conclusion, just use common sense in mailing your resume.
780 PRINT "     Remember that the first impression the prospective employer
790 PRINT "     will get of you is that first visual impression of your
800 PRINT "     resume, so you want it to be clean, neat, flat and totally
810 PRINT "     free of smudges, wrinkles, folds, tears, etc.  The way your
820 PRINT "     resume is first viewed is most likely the way you will be
830 PRINT "     viewed, so adhere to common sense and these basic mailing
840 PRINT "     tips; you'll increase your chances of a favorable impression!

760 PRINT "     ever is on your screen directly to your printer.
770 PRINT "
780 PRINT "     These are the four basic categories and the most important to
790 PRINT "     to include on a one-page.  However, if you have room, you can
800 PRINT "     add in other categories, under perhaps ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.
810 PRINT "     Whatever particular information you have in your background
820 PRINT "     that will show you in a positive light should be included on
830 PRINT "     the resume as long as the basic format/order is adhered to.
850 PRINT "     The resume should always begin with OBJECTIVE and end with
860 PRINT "     REFERENCES.  If a SUMMARY of SUMMARY OF QUALIFICATIONS section
870 PRINT "     is used, that follows the OBJECTIVE.  EDUCATION and/or EXPER-

1030 PRINT "     should do a one-page resume.  Some of the exceptions are:
1040 PRINT "
1050 PRINT "          You have 15+ years in the same field;
1060 PRINT "          You are going for a mid-level to top-level management
1070 PRINT "            position which requires extensive detail;
1080 PRINT "          You have numerous technical skills that need to be
1090 PRINT "            be defined in list form.
1100 PRINT "          Etc.!
1110 PRINT "
1120 PRINT "     I am sure you can make this determination yourself.  The
1130 PRINT "     common theme in going to a second page is when your back-
1140 PRINT "     ground is extensive and the salary compensation for the
1150 PRINT "     position is high; thus the second page is not only warranted,
1160 PRINT "     but will probably help you by providing the details.

210 PRINT "     You are seeking a mid- to upper-level management position;
220 PRINT "     You have extensive technical skills to be identified & listed.
230 PRINT "
240 PRINT "     If you fall into one of these three categories, then a two-page
250 PRINT "     resume will probably work to your advantage better than a one-
260 PRINT "     page.  A one-page resume, in your case, would probably be too

380 PRINT "

120 PRINT "
130 PRINT "     Your one or two page resume should always close with the
140 PRINT "     Reference section.  In this category, references should be
150 PRINT "     offered to the prospective employer.
160 PRINT "
170 PRINT "     You can list personal and/or business references by name
180 PRINT "     and contact point here, but it is usually recommended that
190 PRINT "     you merely state they are available and list your references
200 PRINT "     on a separate sheet, to be handed out at interview time.  If
210 PRINT "     your references are listed right on your resume, then every
220 PRINT "     time you are handing your resume out, these people may be
230 PRINT "     called.  This can become irritating for them to be receiving
240 PRINT "     multiple calls and perhaps for jobs you aren't being seriously
250 PRINT "     considered for or you don't want.  (See the REFSHT of this
260 PRINT "     disk for more information on your separate sheet preparation).
270 PRINT "
280 PRINT "     The reference section can be worded in several different ways.
290 PRINT "     The most important idea to get across is that you do have
300 PRINT "     references and you are ready and willing to supply them.

230 PRINT "   It is not a necessity to have a printed reference sheet.  The
240 PRINT "   resume itself usually states that references are available upon
250 PRINT "   request and when asked, your references can be provided to the
260 PRINT "   individual verbally or written on their application form.  How-
270 PRINT "   ever, it is both convenient and professional to have the refer-
280 PRINT "   ences already written down, ready to hand the personnel depart-
290 PRINT "   ment or interviewer upon request.
300 PRINT "
310 INPUT "   PUSH RETURN OR ENTER KEY...";Z$

330 PRINT "
340 PRINT "     It is best to provide both business and personal references.
350 PRINT "     Business references should be past or current supervisors or
360 PRINT "     can be other types of people you have worked with such as
370 PRINT "     customers, vendors or even fellow employees.  Personal refer-
380 PRINT "     ences are people who will vouch for your character.  They
390 PRINT "     should not be relatives and preferably should be people you
400 PRINT "     have known for some time and live in the area you are applying
410 PRINT "     for work in.  Be sure and contact the people you are using on
420 PRINT "     your reference sheet prior to typing up and handing the sheet
430 PRINT "     out.  This both asks their permission for their name to be
440 PRINT "     used and prepares them for any possible calls.
450 PRINT "
460 PRINT "     You should provide three names of each or a total of six
470 PRINT "     references.
480 PRINT "
490 PRINT "     The page should be set up attractively, with  your name and
500 PRINT "     address centered at the top and REFERENCES centered below.
510 PRINT "     The person's name should be listed and a contact address and
520 PRINT "     telephone number.  You can also separate the two types by
530 PRINT "     doing a centered heading BUSINESS and one called PERSONAL.
540 PRINT "     You should also identify the business references by their
550 PRINT "     company name and title.

620 PRINT "     want a lot of people calling and bothering your references,
630 PRINT "     for jobs you may not even want.  You want them ready and
640 PRINT "     willing to give you an excellent reference when the right
650 PRINT "     job comes along.  The only exception to this is if you are
660 PRINT "     answering a blind ad in the newspaper, you don't know who
670 PRINT "     the company is and no other details, except the job sounds
680 PRINT "     good and they ask you to include references...then go ahead.
690 PRINT "
700 PRINT "     It goes without saying that you want to select the people
710 PRINT "     who will without question give you a top recommenda-
