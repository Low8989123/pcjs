## Information about "MOE (NIFTY MOVED TO #1709)"

    A memory-resident datebook/desktop manager, MOE schedules events,
    reminds you of appointments, logs expenses and time, acts as a
    calculator, maintains and dials phone numbers, lets you establish lots
    of pop-up databases and lists, and offers an easy way to send printers
    new codes.
    
    MOE schedules upcoming events, allowing up to 20 daily memory prompts,
    with alarms.  It maintains up to 1,000 expense and time entries by
    project.  The pop-up calculator offers a 20-line tape and the ability to
    transfer results to your wordprocessor or text editor.  It does basic
    calculations, plus exponentials and inverse, and offers two memory keys.
    
    You get a pop-up phone directory that dials for you, helps you with
    communications, and even prints mailing labels.  You can establish
    numerous mini-databases, such as to-do lists and general ledger account
    numbers, and search them if needed.  Sending codes to change printers,
    fonts, or format is made easier.
