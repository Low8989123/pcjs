## Information about "EGA TREK & MAHJONGG"

    You have been put in command of the Constitution Class Heavy Cruiser
    U.S.S. ENTERPRISE, naval construction contract number NCC-1701.  Your
    mission as commander of the ENTERPRISE is to secure a 64 quadrant sector
    of the galaxy.
    
    Since the collapse of the Organian Peace Treaty of 3199.5, a Klingon
    invasion fleet has been sighted in parts of the Federation territory.
    You have been instructed to eliminate any Klingon cruiser, command
    vessel, or Klingon starbase found in your area.  Good luck, Captain!
    
    This is an impressive EGA version of an old favorite.
    
    MAH JONGG is based on an ancient Chinese game that has been around for
    centuries.  The object of the game is to remove as many matching tiles
    from the playing board as possible.  Sounds easy, huh?
    
    Not quite.  The board has five levels of tiles and the tile you may need
    might be at the bottom level, out of your reach.  There are 65,535
    different boards that can be played, which will keep you glued to your
    computer for many hours.
    
    The game supports Hercules graphics as well as EGA.  An UNDO
    facility, mouse support, and game statistics make it more interesting
    than ever.
