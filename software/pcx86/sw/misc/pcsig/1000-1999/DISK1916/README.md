                               INTRODUCTION


   ZULU LOG BOOK organizes your logbook in a easy to use electronic
database.  With the locator, you can instantly  find  the contact
your looking for. Help is available by pressing  <F1>.   A  report  can
be  printed   of   all contacts  by  pressing  the  hot key <F5> or just one
country's contacts by pressing <F7> (F6+F7 are only available when you
register). You can print all contacts with one call sign with <F6>.
You may enter multiline comments for each contact.   ZULU LOG BOOK  will
allow  unlimited  number of contacts to be input.   You  may  enter thousands
of contacts and locate the one you want almost instantly.  Customized versions
of ZULU LOG BOOK can be programmed for you for a fee.
   ZULU LOG BOOK is a fast program  using sophisticated state of the art
database and information processing techniques.  One of my goals was to
include an easy to understand user-interface with menus and windows.  Help is
available throughout the program by pressing the <F1> key.  This program has
a short learning curve and is fun to use.  You will be up and running in no
time.
  If you have a question first press F1 to activate the help facility.  If
you are still confused refer to this document.  For those that are really
stuck in the mud you may contact my by mail for technical assistance.
  ZULU LOG BOOK was written for the beginner to advanced computer user.
It provides a low cost alternative to powerful logbook management
and organization.  You don't have to know any programming or be a computer
whiz with a PhD.  That is not who this program has been written for.  It is
meant for the computer user who uses the computer as a tool.
  ZULU LOG BOOK requires an IBM PC or compatible with at least 512k memory,
DOS 2.0 or higher, any monitor. A printer is optional.  Before using this
program, you should be familiar with your computer and DOS.

                              GETTING STARTED

   Your program diskette should contain at least the following 3 files:

                                HAMLOG.EXE
                                HAMLOG.HLP
                                HAMLOG.DOC

If these files are not on your distribution diskette this program will not
operate correctly.  Contact your distributor from whom you purchased the
program.


INSTRUCTIONS

1.  install the distribution diskette in floppy drive a and close the door
2.  copy all files to the subdirectory you want or onto another floppy disk
    (eg. COPY A:*.* C:\HAMLOG)
3.  make a backup copy of the original distribution diskette
    (who ever does?)
4.  put in your CONFIG.SYS file (in the root directory) the following
      commands:
                  FILES=40
                  BUFFERS=40
5.  to run, type HAMLOG <enter>

That's all there is to it!  The rest of this manual is optional reference
material.  Most of your questions can be answered by the on-line help in
the program.  GOOD LUCK AND HAVE A NICE DAY!

                             THE HAMLOG TABLE

    The HAMLOG TABLE is a "table" listing the HAMLOG's country and other info.
The entries will be in alphabetical order.  Use the cursor keys to
go to the CALLSIGN/CONTACT you are interested in.  To get to a CONTACT
quickly I have provided a "CALLSIGN Locator" just below the title
"HAMLOG TABLE".  Just type one or more letters of the CALLSIGN'S name
and the program will automatically place the highlight bar on that entry.
    To  add  a contact to the table press <Ins>.  The Update Form will
appear with the message "Record will  be  added"  appearing  below  it.
After you have entered all the fields press <Ctrl Enter> to accept that
record.  If you decide you have made a mistake and want to  cancel,  press
<Ctrl  Escape>. That record WILL NOT BE ADDED.  Also, <Escape> will move you
back one field as  will  the  up and down cursor keys.  If you press <Escape>
while at the 1st field you will return to the "table" without any records
being added.
    To  delete  a contact,  place  the  highlight bar  on  that contact in the
"table" and press the <Delete> key.  You will be asked to confirm the
deletion.
    To view a record press <Enter> while on the contact in the "table".
    To print a report of all your contacts to  your  printer  (device  LPT1),
press <F5>.
    To print a report of all contacts of one country, place the highlight bar
on that country and press <F7>.  Note: using <F6 and F7> are only available
when you register.
    To print a report of all contacts of one callsign, place the highlight bar
on that callsign and press <F6>.  Note: using <F6 and F7> are only available
when you register.

    OVERALL, I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE A VERY COMPLICATED PROGRAM  AN  EASY  AND
USEFUL  TOOL  TO HAVE AROUND THE OFFICE OR HOME.   GETTING YOUR FEET WET BY
TRYING THE PROGRAM IS THE BEST WAY TO LEARN IT.
