## Information about "ANYANGLE"

    Pythagoras would be proud!  But if you don't know who Pythagoras is, you
    probably don't need this program.  Ancient Greeks notwithstanding, most
    people do not appreciate the mathematical beauty underlying the simple
    triangle.  If you yearn to become enlightened, though, this is the place
    to start!
    
    ANYANGLE takes the drudgery out of capitalizing on the mathematical
    elegance of the triangle.  If you provide a minimum amount of data about
    a triangle, this program computes the rest, solving for unknown angles
    or side lengths given what you have available.
    
    Even if you're not a surveyor or trigonometry buff, you could use this
    program to calculate the height of the trees in your yard, plan your
    next woodworking project more rationally, or even landscape in the Greek
    tradition (Thomas Jefferson did, the hard way!).
    
    Triangle aficionados will appreciate the analysis section of the
    program
    which provides such esoterica as area, perimeter, altitude, coordinates
    of vertices, and data about the inscribed circle and circumcircle.

                             ANYANGLE            Version 2.5
                             Copyright (C) 1990  Jim Preston

PROGRAM TITLE:      ANYANGLE

DETAILED PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:      ANYANGLE is an easy-to-
use, feature filled triangle solver with a built-in
scientific calculator.

INTENDED USER:      Engineers, machinists, surveyors,
carpenters, drafters, students or just about anyone at some
time or another.

UNIQUE FEATURES OF THE PROGRAM:    Very easy to use. The
program will solve any triangle when given the minimum
amount of information, and the known data about the triangle
can be entered in any order you wish.  ANYANGLE will prompt
you with the maximum and minimum value allowed at any entry
and the ANYANGLE program always knows when it has enough
data to solve the problem, and the answers are displayed
instantly.  You can then tinker with the solved triangle by
changing angles or sides, or sizing it to have a certain
altitude or fit exactly around a given circle, or exactly
inside one for that matter. The calculator with its 11
visible memory registers, one automatic and 10 user
controlled, makes this very easy, along with automatic flip
and rotate features.  You can get a scale view of the
triangle at the touch of a key. You can get a complete
analysis including area, perimeter, altitude, center of
gravity, coordinates of each vertex, and data about the
inscribed circle and circumcircle at the touch of another
key.  The data can be saved and printed also. Four formats
or styles of numeric display are available.  Context-
sensitive help screens are provided for the major features.
The CALCULATOR uses the algebraic entry system and has all
the major functions such as powers, roots, logarithms and
trigonometry as well as degree-minute-second conversion
operations. It can automatically call in any number
connected with the last triangle by keying in simple two-
letter codes, and, of course, it can work with all the
memories.  These codes work throughout the program for
numerical input.

PROGRAM CAPACITY/LIMITATIONS:      Each bank in the data
base is limited to 32,767 triangles, which is more than
adequate for the intended use.  Users can create as many
banks as desired.  Printout requires that the DOS GRAPHICS
utility be run.  The scale drawing will appear out-of-
proportion on most laptop computers with graphics
capabilities because of their long, narrow screens.
Triangle accuracy is excellent but, of course, limited to
that of Microsoft (R) QuickBASIC using double-precision
variables. (No warranty is expressed or implied for accuracy
of answers. Read the disclaimer on the main help screen).

SPECIAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:       CGA or Hercules (R)
monochrome graphics capability is the minimum needed if the
scale views are to be seen, but the program will run on any
IBM(R) or compatible computer.

STARTING THE PROGRAM:         Place the disk in an
appropriate drive,  type ANYANGLE, and <Enter>.  On systems
with Hercules graphics type ANYHERC <Enter>.

REGISTRATION FEE:        $19.50

MATERIALS / SERVICES PROVIDED WITH REGISTRATION:  Printed
instructions and the latest update of the registered version
which adds CURVE solution done in the same style and degree
of completeness as the triangle solution.  If you write the
words  "MYSTERY DISK" on a piece of paper and send it along
with your registration fee you will receive an interesting
program having to do with triangles either on a separate
disk or included with the updated ANYANGLE program.
