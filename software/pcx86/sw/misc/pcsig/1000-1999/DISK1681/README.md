## Information about "CAT 2 OF 2 (ALSO 1680)"

    Tomorrow's airplane mechanics, CAT SYSTEM (Computer Aided Teaching
    System) is software to help you study for the FAA aviation mechanic
    written examinations which lead toward receiving the FAA Powerplant or
    Airframe Mechanic licenses. These tests can be tricky, so it is
    important to get the feel for how questions are asked on the exams. The
    more practice you get the better. With CAT SYSTEM, your computer
    administers and scores mock exams of the same questions that may appear
    on the actual test. Your computer gives the test, so you can concentrate
    on the questions. The software is easy to use, even for the computer
    novice.
    
    The questions are drawn right from the the FAA "Aviation Mechanic
    Powerplant Question Book" FAA-T-8080-11B and the "Airframe & Powerplant
    Mechanics Powerplant Handbook" AC65-12A. Both are available from the
    FAA and other book resellers. Keep in mind that the FAA does not
    publish the correct answers, only the questions. CAT SYSTEM is your
    chance to get a working professional's insight into the best answers
    for these questions.
