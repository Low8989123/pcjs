change the level of complexity by making the PC-JIGSAW image pieces     
smaller or larger.  Your score appears on the top of the screen, when   
you have solved the puzzle.  The score is based how many pieces you     
swapped to get the puzzle solved.  The fewer pieces you swapped, the

   5.                           OPERATION

    GENERAL :  The program will detect your display card and will auto-
       adjust the graphics.  It will also sense if there is a mouse
       attached. If you plan to use the mouse, the mouse driver must be
       loaded before running JIG.  From time to time the program will
       display information at the bottom of the screen.

    MENUS :  When using the mouse, click on the LEFT button to select
       items , click on the RIGHT button to exit from the menu or to call
       the main menu.  When using the keyboard , use the arrow keys to
       move around, press the <SPACEBAR> or the <ENTER> key to select
       menu items , press <ESC> to exit from the menu or to call the menu.

     .......
  TO START :   At the DOS prompt type JIG followed by <ENTER>.
       Press any key or mouse button to start.
       **   Note that GRF Image files must be present at your current
       disk and directory.

    ........
    IMAGES :   Then select one GRF Image file from the IMAGES menu.
       Finally select START from main menu to begin playing the PC-JIGSAW
       After you assemble the puzzle, you can select another Image.
    .......
    PCX   :    The Registered version of PC-JIGSAW will read PCX files in
       any of the above mentioned graphics modes (see chapter 4 under
       OPTIONS).  The PCX option allows registered users to make up their
       own Jigsaw puzzles in the popular PCX graphics format by :
       A) creating pictures through PAINT or DESK-TOP programs
          supporting PCX files or
       B) creating pictures using a SCANNER or a VIDEO GRABBER supporting
          PCX files or
       C) by simply using existing PCX files.

    ........
    LEVEL  :   Changes the level of complexity by making the PC-JIGSAW
       pieces smaller or larger. Lowest mode is 3 X 3 = 9 pieces, highest
       mode is 9 X 9 = 81 pieces.
    ........
    HELP   :   There is on line help that reminds you of the basic
       commands of the PC-JIGSAW.  Just select HELP from the main menu.
    ........
    SOUND  :   Turns on or off the sound effects and music. When SOUND is
       on you will hear a sound every time a Jigsaw piece is moved in its
       correct position.

    ........
    MOUSE  :  Turns on or off the mouse. Use JIG K to disable mouse access.

    ........
    PRINT  :   PC-JIGSAW currently supports EPSON compatible printer in
      parallel ports LPT1 or LPT2.  It prints only the black outline of the
      image, therefore the printed results of your own PCX pictures may vary.
      Printed puzzles make nice coloring pictures for children. Make sure
      that your printer is ON and ON LINE when selecting the PRINT option.

                                 Page 3 of 5

    ........
    QUIT   :   Allows you to return to DOS.

    SCORE  :   Your score appears on the top of the screen, when you have
       solved the puzzle.  The score is based on how many pieces you
       swapped to get the puzzle solved.  The fewer pieces you swapped ,
       the better score you will get.  Also every time you VIEW the image,
       points are subtracted from your score, so VIEW only when needed.
       When the puzzle is solved the number of Moves ( swaps ) and the
       number of Views is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

    VIEW   :   At any time you may view the original Image by pressing
       the V key.  If you have a 3 button mouse press the middle button,
       or if you have a 2 button mouse press both buttons simultaneously
       to VIEW.

    MUSIC  :  When music is playing you may press any key or hold down a
       mouse button to cancel it.

                  Tips for children and novice IBM PC users.

    We created this program knowing that children as young as 3 years old
    will be using it.  The challenge was, how to create a simple to use
    program without sacrificing flexibility and options for more advanced
    PC users.  Here are two very simple rules for novice PC users.

     1) When using the mouse, use only the LEFT button to play and select
        from the menus.  If your mouse has 3 buttons, then use the middle
        one to view. If you have a 2 button mouse use the V key to view.

     2) When using the keyboard simply use the <spacebar> to play and
        select from the menus. Use the arrows to move around and finally
        use the V key to view the original puzzle.

    After novice users have become familiar with the above simple
    operation, they may try using the RIGHT mouse button or the <ESC> key
    to gain access to all of the PC-JIGSAW options.

   6.                 DOCUMENTATION  AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    If you have a printer, then please print out and read documentation
    file JIG.DOC.  This file can be printed out by simply typing :
    COPY JIG.DOC PRN  at the DOS prompt.

    The opening music theme is "The flight of the Bumble Bee" by Rimsky
    Korsakov.  The music playing after you solved the puzzle is
    "When Johnny comes Marching Home" by Patrick Sarsfield Gilmore.
    All of the new features and improvements in version 2 are the results
    of several suggestions by users of the older PC-JIGSAW versions.

   3.                        GETTING STARTED
      3.1                  Playing from  Floppy Disk
      To load the PC-JIGSAW program, insert the program disk in drive A
      and at the A prompt type JIG <return>.

      3.2                   Playing from a Hard Disk
      The installation on a Hard disk simply involves creating a directory
      and copying all files from the floppy disk to that directory of the
      Hard disk.  The following example assumes your Hard Disk is C and
      your Floppy is Drive A. Type the following :
       C:                         ( Change current drive to C     )
       MD C:\JIG                  ( Create JIG subdirectory       )
       CD C:\JIG                  ( Change directory              )
                                  ( Insert floppy disk in drive A )
       COPY A:\*.*  C:\JIG        ( Copy files to Hard disk       )

   4.                  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND OPTIONS

      DISPLAY  :  CGA or TANDY, MCGA, EGA/VGA color, EGA MONO and HERCULES

      OPTIONS :  Even though the program detects your system
      configuration and sets up the  program accordingly, you can still
      override this feature.  You do this by typing one of the following
      switches after you typed JIG :
                 C          CGA   320 x 200  Color  ( Default )

   5.                           OPERATION

    GENERAL :  The program will detect your display card and will auto-
       adjust the graphics.  It will also sense if there is a mouse
       attached. If you plan to use the mouse, the mouse driver must be
       loaded before running JIG.  From time to time the program will
       display information at the bottom of the screen.

    MENUS :  When using the mouse, click on the LEFT button to select
       items , click on the RIGHT button to exit from the menu or to call
       the main menu.  When using the keyboard , use the arrow keys to
       move around, press the <SPACEBAR> or the <ENTER> key to select
       menu items , press <ESC> to exit from the menu or to call the menu.

     .......
  TO START :   At the DOS prompt type JIG followed by <ENTER>.
       Press any key or mouse button to start.
       **   Note that GRF Image files must be present at your current
       disk and directory.

    ........
    IMAGES :   Then select one GRF Image file from the IMAGES menu.
       Finally select START from main menu to begin playing the PC-JIGSAW
       After you assemble the puzzle, you can select another Image.
    .......
    PCX   :    The Registered version of PC-JIGSAW will read PCX files in
       any of the above mentioned graphics modes (see chapter 4 under
       OPTIONS).  The PCX option allows registered users to make up their
       own Jigsaw puzzles in the popular PCX graphics format by :
       A) creating pictures through PAINT or DESK-TOP programs
          supporting PCX files or
       B) creating pictures using a SCANNER or a VIDEO GRABBER supporting
          PCX files or
       C) by simply using existing PCX files.

    ........
    LEVEL  :   Changes the level of complexity by making the PC-JIGSAW
       pieces smaller or larger. Lowest mode is 3 X 3 = 9 pieces, highest
       mode is 9 X 9 = 81 pieces.
    ........
    HELP   :   There is on line help that reminds you of the basic
       commands of the PC-JIGSAW.  Just select HELP from the main menu.
    ........
    SOUND  :   Turns on or off the sound effects and music. When SOUND is
       on you will hear a sound every time a Jigsaw piece is moved in its
       correct position.

    ........
    MOUSE  :  Turns on or off the mouse. Use JIG K to disable mouse access.

    ........
    PRINT  :   PC-JIGSAW currently supports EPSON compatible printer in
      parallel ports LPT1 or LPT2.  It prints only the black outline of the
      image, therefore the printed results of your own PCX pictures may vary.
      Printed puzzles make nice coloring pictures for children. Make sure
      that your printer is ON and ON LINE when selecting the PRINT option.

                                 Page 3 of 5

    ........
    QUIT   :   Allows you to return to DOS.

    SCORE  :   Your score appears on the top of the screen, when you have
       solved the puzzle.  The score is based on how many pieces you
       swapped to get the puzzle solved.  The fewer pieces you swapped ,
       the better score you will get.  Also every time you VIEW the image,
       points are subtracted from your score, so VIEW only when needed.
       When the puzzle is solved the number of Moves ( swaps ) and the
       number of Views is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

    VIEW   :   At any time you may view the original Image by pressing
       the V key.  If you have a 3 button mouse press the middle button,
       or if you have a 2 button mouse press both buttons simultaneously
       to VIEW.

    MUSIC  :  When music is playing you may press any key or hold down a
       mouse button to cancel it.

                  Tips for children and novice IBM PC users.

    We created this program knowing that children as young as 3 years old
    will be using it.  The challenge was, how to create a simple to use
    program without sacrificing flexibility and options for more advanced
    PC users.  Here are two very simple rules for novice PC users.

     1) When using the mouse, use only the LEFT button to play and select
        from the menus.  If your mouse has 3 buttons, then use the middle
        one to view. If you have a 2 button mouse use the V key to view.

     2) When using the keyboard simply use the <spacebar> to play and
        select from the menus. Use the arrows to move around and finally
        use the V key to view the original puzzle.

    After novice users have become familiar with the above simple
    operation, they may try using the RIGHT mouse button or the <ESC> key
    to gain access to all of the PC-JIGSAW options.

   6.                 DOCUMENTATION  AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    If you have a printer, then please print out and read documentation
    file JIG.DOC.  This file can be printed out by simply typing :
    COPY JIG.DOC PRN  at the DOS prompt.

    The opening music theme is "The flight of the Bumble Bee" by Rimsky
    Korsakov.  The music playing after you solved the puzzle is
    "When Johnny comes Marching Home" by Patrick Sarsfield Gilmore.
    All of the new features and improvements in version 2 are the results
    of several suggestions by users of the older PC-JIGSAW versions.

                            P C - J I G S A W   2

 The enclosed disks contain a new revision of the PC-JigSaw program.
 It was created after several users reported problems or proposed useful
 suggestions.

                          REVISION HISTORY

     PC-JigSaw 1.2  19-NOV-1989

  A) It fixes a problem associated with using a mouse in some systems.
  B) A new level for young children ( 3 X 3 pieces ).
  C) A minor program change in the scoring scheme allows the user to get
     higher scores more easily.
  D) Most laptops have 2 graphic cards. One LCD and one external RGB.
     The program detects only the external RGB and therefore it auto-
     switches to external.  So you have to toggle to LCD by using
     the control key combination provided by the manufacturer. ( eg:
     for DATAVUE's SPARK laptop use <CONTROL> <LEFT-SHIFT> <M> )

     PC-JIGSAW 2.0  6-FEB-1990

  A) Print support for EPSON compatible matrix printers.
  B) Lowest grade now is C.  It is fair to give a passing grade to
     those who finish the puzzle.  Program now displays number of moves
     and number of Views when puzzle is finished.
  C) After a picture is displayed on the screen, now you may cancel it,
     and select another one.
  D) If a piece is moved to its correct location a beep sound confirms it.
  E) Added one more Level of difficulty the MASTER Level ( 9 X 9 pieces )
  F) Improved visibility of the color cross, marking a selected piece.
  G) Added 2 music themes.
  H) Added PCX file support, available for registered users only. This
     allows the users to create their own pictures utilizing any PAINT
     program or SCANNER software supporting the PCX file format.

   Also several other minor changes were to implemented to make this
   program easier to use.

 The enclosed disks contain a new revision of the PC-JigSaw program.
 It was created after several users reported problems or proposed useful
 suggestions.

                          REVISION HISTORY

     PC-JigSaw 1.2  19-NOV-1989

  A) It fixes a problem associated with using a mouse in some systems.
  B) A new level for young children ( 3 X 3 pieces ).
  C) A minor program change in the scoring scheme allows the user to get
     higher scores more easily.
  D) Most laptops have 2 graphic cards. One LCD and one external RGB.
     The program detects only the external RGB and therefore it auto-
     switches to external.  So you have to toggle to LCD by using
     the control key combination provided by the manufacturer. ( eg:
     for DATAVUE's SPARK laptop use <CONTROL> <LEFT-SHIFT> <M> )

     PC-JIGSAW 2.0  6-FEB-1990

  A) Print support for EPSON compatible matrix printers.
  B) Lowest grade now is C.  It is fair to give a passing grade to
     those who finish the puzzle.  Program now displays number of moves
     and number of Views when puzzle is finished.
  C) After a picture is displayed on the screen, now you may cancel it,
     and select another one.
  D) If a piece is moved to its correct location a beep sound confirms it.
  E) Added one more Level of difficulty the MASTER Level ( 9 X 9 pieces )
  F) Improved visibility of the color cross, marking a selected piece.
  G) Added 2 music themes.
  H) Added PCX file support, available for registered users only. This
     allows the users to create their own pictures utilizing any PAINT
     program or SCANNER software supporting the PCX file format.

   Also several other minor changes were to implemented to make this
   program easier to use.
