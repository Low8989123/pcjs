## Information about "SHOWLOG"

    SHOWLOG is for all of us who record movies and soaps off the air, but
    then go crazy trying to keep track of them all!
    
    Here is a complete system that not only prints out labels for your
    collection of nameless black boxes but also helps you catalog them in a
    database for easy retrieval.
    
    Reports can be printed in a number of different sort orders containing
    information such as title, speed, show time, tape address, star of
    show, rating, category, producer, and more.  All information is
    maintained in database format with an index for each sort order, thus
    providing quick and easy retrieval.
