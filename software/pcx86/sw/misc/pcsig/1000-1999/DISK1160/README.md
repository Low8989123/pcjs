## Information about "FUTURE SYSTEMS 1 OF 2 (ALSO 1161)"

    FUTURE SYSTEMS is a book about systems and the direction that the
    author, Mark Nadir, believes they are headed.  Covering general computer
    systems and the future design vision of the author, FUTURE SYSTEMS
    describes
    several types of large and small systems such as communication systems,
    computational systems, control systems, broadcasting, business, etc.
    
    Calling his basic methodology ``Positional Transduction Methodology,''
    Mr. Nadir admits that the ``experts'' disagree with his conclusions.
    This is a controversial treatment of the subject for the serious reader.
