## Information about "TOUCH TYPE TUTOR"

    TOUCH TYPE TUTOR is going to make you the fastest typist in town.  Or if
    you don't know how to type, this program will teach you.
    
    The program has three teaching modes.  The first is for the person who
    knows how to type, but wants to be faster.  It provides four different
    letters on which you are tested.  After you have become proficient on
    these, you can add your own letters for variety.  The second mode is a
    graduated series of lessons that allow you to move along at your own
    pace.  The third mode is a game for the beginning typist that teaches
    the keyboard layout.

----------------------------[ 1.  SPECIFICATION ]----------------------------

	Teach Mode:
	Has eight graduated lessons and adapts itself automatically to the
	users skill level.

	Speed Mode:
	Is designed for typists and companies to measure typing speeds.

	Game Mode:
	Adapts itself to the typists skill, forcing the user to type faster
	and faster throughout the five skill levels.




-------------------------[ 2.  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS ]-------------------------

TOUCH TYPE TUTOR is designed for minimal system requirements and should be
runable on just about any IBM PC type or compatible.  A command parameter
allows the program to run on non-IBM or incompatible MS-DOS base machines.
In these cases invoke TOUCH TYPE TUTOR using the command:

				ttt -b

which causes it to use MS-DOS system calls instead of BIOS calls.  In this case
it is imperative that either the DOS ANSI.SYS device driver is included in the
CONFIG.SYS file, or that the machine accepts standard ANSI cursor codes.  Add
the line DEVICE=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS or similar (depending on where you keep your
DOS files) to the config.sys file.  TOUCH TYPE TUTOR uses no graphics display
modes and so is compatible with any type of color or black and white adapter.

The style files for the speed test are standard ASCII files which may be edited
should you wish to expand or modify them.  There is no limit to the length, they
will get split into 11-line screens automatically when the test is running.  As
supplied, they are 11 or fewer lines long as this has proved sufficient in
practice to accurately measure a typist's speed without wasting their time with
lengthy material.

-------------------------[ 6.  U S E R   G U I D E ]-------------------------




-------------------------[ 6.1  START-UP PROCEDURE ]-------------------------

From the DOS prompt type the following to start TOUCH TYPE TUTOR: ttt

There is an alternative method of starting TOUCH TYPE TUTOR which supplies the
name of the user from the command line.  This is the same name you would use
when running the tutor in teach-mode and allows an automatic way of starting
e.g. from a batch file, so that you do not need to type in your name every
time you run the program.  For example, if the name you use is "Fred" start
the program by typing: ttt -nFred

(The "-n" is a standard UNIX way of specifying switches).




--------------------------[ 6.2  OPTION SELECTION ]--------------------------

The program features menu boxes for ease of use.  Select the desired option
using the up and down arrow keys and then hit enter.  Select the QUIT option
to return one menu level back and finally to quit the program from the top
level.

Remember to use the online help provided if you are not sure which option to
select.




----------------------------[ 7.  SITE LICENSE ]-----------------------------

COMPANIES please note that only ONE USER at ONE LOCATION may use and operate
TOUCH TYPE TUTOR.

Additional computers, users and locations should be registered separately,
by volume, or by obtaining a site license.

DISCOUNT RATES are offered to companies registering for a site license or by
