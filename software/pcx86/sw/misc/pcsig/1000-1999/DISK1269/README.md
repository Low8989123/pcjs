## Information about "HOGBEAR ADVENTURE GAME"

    The next time you are walking, hear laughter, and notice a nearby
    mansion, run for your life.  If the HOGBEAR lures you in, you have to
    face him, a vampire, blue devils, killer bees, an ogre, a bear, pecking
    falcons and other perils.
    
    If you are swift, wiser than most, and persistent, you might even
    overcome the snake and spider as you roam about the huge mansion.  As in
    life, some games are unwinnable.  But there's hope.  This text
    adventure/graphics game moves quickly when you learn the knack of
    searching and gathering the tools and weapons you need.  Otherwise, you
    lurch about from room to darkened room, stumbling toward certain doom in
    an obscure mansion filled with deadly surprises.
    
    An update of the classic game Castle, HOGBEAR is fun for all ages.  It
    runs on both color and monochrome systems.

              Hogbear is an adventure game fashioned after the 
         game of CASTLE.  We have added what we feel are 
         interesting twists to the game.  The monsters can be 
         reincarneted at random.  If you quit the game without 
         saving it, when you restart the game all the treasures 
         and weapons needed to kill the monsters are relocated in 
         the rooms (the furniture is left, just the ARTICALS are 
         moved).  This can lead to an unwinnable game (Maybe), if 
         the weapon and monster end up in the same room.  If you 
         are fast enough you might win.  Then again you might 
         not.  
                Hogbear creates and destroys a file on the disk with 
         the extension of <.FIL> ie-<FILENAME.FIL>. Be sure to 
         install Hogbear on its own disk or sub-directory as any 
         files with the extension of .FIL on Hogbear's disk or 
         directory will be destroyed also. 

              We have tested the game for several months using 
         many testors.  We realize that try as we might we may 
         have left some unforseen anomolies in the game.  If you 
         find a strange or unusual occurence (BUG!!!) while 
         playing the game leave a message on COMPUSERV  
         73377,1345 or GENIE k.seal.  

         Please feel free to place this game , The file HOGBEAR.ARC,

        <FILENAME>.FIL---  IF YOU HAVE INSTALLED HOGBEAR IN A DIRECTORY
        OR ON A DISK WHICH HAS FILES WITH THIS EXTENSION, THEY WILL BE  
                          DESTROYED ALSO !!!!!                    
        INSTRUCTION FOR PLAY:

        The object of HOGBEAR is to find the "HOGBEAR", learn his secret, 
        and  discover  the secret of leaving the HOUSE of  HOGBEAR.   The 
        numeric  keypad is used to move throughout the house.  The  arrow 
        keys will move you in the direction they point (right, left,  up, 
        down).   The HOME, END, PgUp, PgDn keys will move you  diagonally 
        within the rooms.  As you progress through the various rooms  (38 
        at  last  reckoning) you need to look all around.  There  may  be 
        treasures, articals, or weapons hidden anywhere as well as hints, 
        which  are scattered around the house.  The function keys can  be 
        used  to collect the things you find in the house.   Be  careful, 
        you  are limited in how much you can carry.  If you  leave  
        something  in the house you may lose it. The F1 key will give  you  
        a reminder  of  the purpose of the keys, if you  forget.  Find  the 
        right object and you can easily carry twice as much.

        Some very nasty creatures have taken residence in HOGBEAR  MANOR.  
        They  can kill or maim you if you do not have the weapon to  
        dispatch  them.  If  you don't have any weapons, and  you  are  
        very quick,  you  can sometimes escape their clutches.  Some  of  
        them have  concocted  a vile potion which   allows them to  return  
        to life (and stop you dead in your tracks).  The only problem is  
        we don't know which ones or when they will reincarnate. 

        You can "SAVE" yourself, but if you "QUIT" and return things  may 
        not be as you remember them.  Not all games can be won, but  then 
        that's life.  Some parts of the manor may not be available to you 
        if  you  have  not registered with the HOGBEAR.   This  will  not 
        prevent  you from winning with the SHAREWARE VERSION.   Your  fun 
        will be greater if the HOGBEAR knows who you are.  

2
        A new feature we have added to HOGBEAR-2 is a SAVE as you play 
        mode.  With this feature you can save your status and continue 
        playing.  If you are killed at a later time, you do not have to 
        start at the beginning, but rather you start at the same place in 
        the game where you saved it.  If you restart the game after dying, 
        using this feature, and you are killed without saving the game 
        again, you will start at the beginning.  We feel it is a good idea 
        is to save your status periodically. 

        A second new feature is "SOUND OFF/ON".  With this feature you 
        can turn the sound off or on as you wish.  You simply type 
        SOUND OFF or SOUND ON, and it will mute or restore the game 
        sounds.
        
        The HOGBEAR has decided to take a more active role in your progress 
        through the manor.  From time to time he has the ability to take 
        away a weapon, or some other device, which could kill a monster.  
        He does not give any warning, and is totally unpredictable.  Good 
        luck, and save as you play.

        Some very nasty creatures have taken residence in HOGBEAR  MANOR.  
        They  can kill or maim you if you do not have the weapon to  
        dispatch  them.  If  you don't have any weapons, and  you  are  
        very quick,  you  can sometimes escape their clutches.  Some  of  
        them have  concocted  a vile potion which   allows them to  return  
        to life (and stop you dead in your tracks).  The only problem is  
        we don't know which ones or when they will reincarnate. 

        You can "SAVE" yourself, but if you "QUIT" and return things  may 
        not be as you remember them.  Not all games can be won, but  then 
        that's life.  Some parts of the manor may not be available to you 
        if  you  have  not registered with the HOGBEAR.   This  will  not 
        prevent  you from winning with the SHAREWARE VERSION.   Your  fun 
        will be greater if the HOGBEAR knows who you are.

        A new feature we have added to HOGBEAR-2 is a SAVE as you play 
        mode.  With this feature you can save your status and continue 
        playing.  If you are killed at a later time, you do not have to 
        start at the beginning, but rather you start at the same place in 
        the game where you saved it.  If you restart the game after dying, 
        using this feature, and you are killed without saving the game 
        again, you will start at the beginning.  We feel it is a good idea 
        is to save your status periodically. 

        A second new feature is "SOUND OFF/ON".  With this feature you 
        can turn the sound off or on as you wish.  You simply type 
        SOUND OFF or SOUND ON, and it will mute or restore the game 
        sounds.
        
        The HOGBEAR has decided to take a more active role in your progress 
        through the manor.  From time to time he has the ability to take 
        away a weapon, or some other device, which could kill a monster.  
        He does not give any warning, and is totally unpredictable.  Good 
        luck, and save as you play.
