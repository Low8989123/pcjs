## Information about "MASTERY LEARNING: GRAMMAR, DISK 3/4"

    MASTERY LEARNING:  GRAMMAR collection teaches principles of English
    grammar and provides tests to measure one's understanding of basic
    grammar.  These four disks cover a wide range of grammar issues all
    students should master.  Each lesson has two parts: (1) a tutorial which
    teaches with clarity and brevity, and (2) drills which reinforce the
    concepts taught by the tutorials.
    
    To generate more student interest and to make a more effective system,
    the disks are personalized.  It is expected that each student has his
    or her own software.  The first time a disk is used, the student enters
    information which is later used in the tutorial examples.
    
    Identifying subjects and verbs, reviewing parts of speech, and the five
    basic English sentence patterns are covered on the first disk.  The
    collection also explores clause types, sentence structures, punctuation,
    capitalization, pronoun case, metaphor and simile.  Additional study
    sections include prefix and affix study, vocabulary study, and verbals.
