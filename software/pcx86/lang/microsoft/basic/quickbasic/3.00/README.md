### README.DOC

                "README.DOC" File
        Release Notes for the MICROSOFT(R) QuickBASIC Compiler
                Version 3.0 for IBM(R) Personal Computers
                and Compatibles

            (C) Copyright Microsoft Corporation, 1987

    THIS FILE CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING VERSION 3.0 OF
    THE MICROSOFT(R) QUICKBASIC COMPILER.  PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE FILE
    VERY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING YOUR QUICKBASIC PRODUCT.

    This file is divided into three parts, as follows:

        PART	CONTENTS

        1 	Information about additions and changes to QuickBASIC
            made after the manual was printed.

        2 	Additions and corrections to the QuickBASIC Compiler
            Version 3.0 update document.

        3 	Additions and corrections to the QuickBASIC Compiler
            Version 2.0 manual.

    For information on corrections to the software from Version 2.0 to 3.0,
    please refer to the UPDATE.DOC file on this disk.

    ===<Part 1: Additional Information>=========================================

    1. Executing Command Buttons

    In QuickBASIC 2, pressing ENTER always executed the command button
    with the double outline (the default command), regardless of which
    button was highlighted. To execute the command in the highlighted
    button, you had to press SPACEBAR.

    In QuickBASIC 2.01 and 3, this is no longer the case: pressing either
    ENTER or SPACEBAR executes the highlighted button.

    2. The QB.INI Initialization File

    QB.INI is an initialization file that QuickBASIC uses to set both the
    Options settings in the View menu and the Autosave command settings
    in the File menu. Upon exiting QuickBASIC, if you have modified
    any of the Options settings or the state of the File menu's Autosave
    command, these changes are written to QB.INI. Note that QB.INI is
    not supplied on any of the product disks. It is created only when
    you change the Options or Autosave settings.	If you use only the
    default settings, QB.INI is never created.

    When QB.INI is created, it is placed in the current directory. When
    QuickBASIC starts, it looks for QB.INI in the current directory, then
    in the locations specified by the PATH environment variable.

    3. Source-File Line Termination

    QuickBASIC requires a CR-LF (carriage return-line feed) sequence at the
    end of each line. If only carriage returns are present, QuickBASIC reads
    the first 255 characters only, and continues without producing an error
    message. If only line feeds are present, QuickBASIC appears to read the
    file correctly, but will in fact overlook the last character of each line.
    If you use an editor that places only a CR or an LF at the end of a line,
    you need to modify your source files so they have the correct sequence at
    the end of each line. The following program examines the end of each line
    in a BASIC source file and inserts a carriage return, line feed, or both, if
    needed (the original contents are saved in a file with the extension ".BAK").

    ' Be sure to compile this program with the "On Error" (/e) and
    ' "Resume Next" (/x) options to turn on error trapping

    DEFINT A-Z
    CONST FALSE = 0, TRUE = NOT FALSE

    CarReturn$ = CHR$(13)
    LineFeed$  = CHR$(10)

    DO
        CLS
        INPUT "File (.BAS): ", InpFile$
        Extension = INSTR(InpFile$,".")
        IF Extension > 0 THEN
        InpFile$ = LEFT$(InpFile$,Extension-1)
        END IF
        ON ERROR GOTO Handler
        NAME InpFile$ + ".BAS" AS InpFile$ + ".BAK"
        OPEN InpFile$ + ".BAK" FOR INPUT AS #1
        ON ERROR GOTO 0
        OPEN InpFile$ + ".BAS" FOR OUTPUT AS #2
        PrevCarReturn = False
        DO UNTIL EOF(1)
        FileChar$ = INPUT$(1, #1)
        IF FileChar$ = CarReturn$ THEN
            IF PrevCarReturn THEN FileChar$ = LineFeed$ + FileChar$
            PrevCarReturn = True
        ELSEIF FileChar$ = LineFeed$ THEN
            IF NOT PrevCarReturn THEN FileChar$ = CarReturn$ + FileChar$
            PrevCarReturn = False
        ELSEIF PrevCarReturn THEN
            PrevCarReturn = False
            FileChar$ = LineFeed$ + FileChar$
        END IF
        PRINT #2, FileChar$;
        LOOP
        CLOSE
        PRINT "Another file (Y/N)?"
        More$ = INPUT$(1)
    LOOP WHILE More$ = "y" OR More$ = "Y"

    SYSTEM

    Handler:
        ErrNumber = ERR
        IF ErrNumber = 53 THEN
        CLS
        PRINT "No such file.	Enter new name."
        INPUT "File (.BAS): ", InpFile$
        RESUME
        ELSEIF ErrNumber = 58 THEN
        KILL InpFile$ + ".BAK"
        RESUME
        ELSE
        ON ERROR GOTO 0
        ERROR ErrNumber
        END IF

    4. Using CALL ABSOLUTE with In-Memory Compilation

    ABSOLUTE is considered an external subroutine by the QuickBASIC compiler.
    The assembly-language source for this subroutine is in the file
    ABSOLUTE.ASM, which can be found on either of the disks labeled Disk 1 in
    the QuickBASIC distribution package.	ABSOLUTE.OBJ, an assembled version of
    this subroutine suitable for inclusion in a user library with the BUILDLIB
    utility, can be found on either of the disks labeled Disk 2 in the QuickBASIC
    distribution package.

    5. Compilation Errors

    When an error is detected during compilation, code generation stops. This
    allows for faster compilation, but has the side effect that some errors may
    be reported that are not errors. When the original error is corrected,
    these side-effect errors go away. For example, the statements

    FOR I = 1
        .
        .
        .
    NEXT I

    generate two errors, "Missing TO" and "NEXT without FOR". When
    the FOR statement is changed to read "FOR I = 1 to 10", both errors
    are corrected.

    6. COMMAND.COM, the SHELL Statement and the Free Menu's Shell Command

    QuickBASIC requires COMMAND.COM before it can execute either a SHELL
    statement or the Shell command from the File menu. QuickBASIC looks
    for COMMAND.COM first in the directory specified in the COMSPEC
    environment variable, then in the current directory.

    7. Using the SHELL Statement in a Subroutine

    The SHELL statement does not compress memory. If not enough contiguous
    memory is available, (for example, if many CHAIN statements have been
    executed, or several dynamic arrays were allocated then erased), a SHELL
    statement may fail with an "Out of memory" error message.

    8. Using the SHELL Statement with DOS 2.X

    If you are using a 2.X version of DOS, programs that contain SHELL
    statements may not exit correctly. This is due to a known problem in DOS
    2.X. The problem occurs when DOS reloads the transient portion of the
    command processor into high memory.

    To exit QuickBASIC after executing an in-memory program that contains
    SHELL statements, when the program finishes running, choose Shell from the
    File menu, then type "exit" at the DOS prompt.

    When standalone executable programs exit, the message "Invalid COMMAND.COM"
    may appear. If so, you must restart your system. If you compile using
    BRUN30.EXE, in most cases the program exits properly.

    Another solution is to upgrade your DOS version to 3.X.

    9. Running Terminate-and-Stay-Resident Programs from the File Menu's
    Shell Command

    Do not run terminate-and-stay-resident programs while executing the Shell
    command from the File menu. When a Shell command is executed, QuickBASIC
    is compressed into the smallest memory possible. The terminate-and-stay-
    resident program occupies memory required by QuickBASIC, making it
    impossible to compile or run a program, or do anything that allocates
    memory.

    10. Changing Directories from the File Menu's Shell Command

    If you change directories after executing the Shell command from the File
    menu, this directory is the current directory when you return to QuickBASIC.
    Subsequent Load commands use this as the default directory, and when you
    quit QuickBASIC, you will be in this directory.

    11. Using BRUN30.EXE with User Libraries

    The run-time module BRUN30.EXE obtains the user library using the name
    the program module was compiled with. All independently compiled program
    modules to be linked together must be compiled with the same user library
    using the same name; othewise, an error occurs at run time.

    You cannot use BCOM30.LIB, the alternate run-time library, with user
    libraries.

    12. Using /l with Nonreferenced Libraries

    User libraries specified with the /l option are pulled into the
    executable file regardless of whether the program requires them.

    13. The User-Library Search Path

    If path information is provided with the qb command's /l option, as in

    qb progname /l \src\lib\mylib.exe

    no path search is performed. If the library is not in the specified location
    an error occurs. If no path information is provided, the current directory
    is searched, then the directory specified in the LIB environment variable.

    14. Graphics-Mode Statements

    A color-graphics adapter is required if you are using any of the following
    statements:

    CIRCLE				PMAP
    COLOR (screen modes 1-10)		POINT
    DRAW					PRESET
    GET (graphics)			PSET
    LINE					PUT (graphics)
    PAINT				SCREEN (screen modes 1-10)
    PALETTE				VIEW
    PCOPY				WINDOW

    15. EGA-Card Restrictions

    The EGA card does not support the COLOR statement's border parameter. Using
    the border parameter causes unpredictable results.

    16. Program Capacity

    Because the Debug option generates extra code, extremely large programs
    that are compiled with the Debug option may exceed the memory limits of
    your computer.

    17. Object-File Size

    Programs compiled with the Debug option (the default) create larger
    object files than programs compiled without the Debug option.

    18. Using the PEN Function When a Mouse Driver Is Present

    The mouse driver intercepts the PEN function's BIOS calls and redirects
    them to the mouse. If you don't want to use the mouse as a lightpen, call
    mouse function 14 to disable the mouse's lightpen-emulation flag, which is
    on by default. Mouse function 13 turns lightpen emulation back on. For
    example, the following code turns mouse lightpen emulation off:

    CALL MOUSE(14,0,0,0)

    See your mouse manual for more information.

    19. Editing Responses to the INPUT Statement

    The input editor supplied with QuickBASIC is a line editor only. This
    means you can move and edit only horizontally. Attempts to use the
    UP, DOWN, PGUP and PGDN cursor keys produce a beep.

    20. Disk-Error Messages

    Whenever you get a disk-error message, such as "Write protect violation",
    DO NOT change to a different disk before selecting "RETRY". If you want
    to retry with a different disk, select the "Cancel" button, replace the
    disk, and compile again.

    ===<Part 2: Corrections to the QuickBASIC Compiler Version 3.0 Update>=======

    Page		Correction
    ----		----------

    Update-25	The first sentence under "Viewing User-Library Source Code"
            should be changed to read as follows:

            QuickBASIC's debugger also lets you see the text of any BASIC
            source file used to build the user library, provided the
            source file was compiled with either the /d command-line option
            or the Debug option in the Compile... dialog box. If a source
            in the user library was compiled without these options, the
            debugger displays the following message if you try to view the
            file with the F6 command:

                *****  No Debug Information	*****

    Update-44	The following information on emulating the function of an
            8087/80287 math coprocessor should be added to Section 4.2:

            Programs using either the standard BRUN3087.LIB library
            or the alternate BCOM3087.LIB library automatically use an
            8087/80287 coprocessor at run time if one is installed.
            However, you can override the use of the coprocessor and force
            an application to emulate its function by setting the NO87
            environment variable.

            HOW TO SET THE NO87 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
            ----------------------------------------
                
                EXAMPLES
                --------

                SET NO87=Use of coprocessor suppressed
                    SET NO87=<one or more spaces>

                    Both of the preceding examples force software emulation of
                the 8087/80287 coprocessor, provided the application is
                using BRUN3087.LIB or BCOM3087.LIB linked with EMULATOR.OBJ
                (see the "COPROCESSOR/EMULATION USAGE TABLE" below for
                more information on when NO87 forces emulation). The first
                setting causes the message

                    Use of coprocessor suppressed

                to appear on the screen when a program that uses an 8087
                or 80287 is executed, and an 8087 or 80287 is present.
                The second setting does not display a message.

                To turn off forced emulation, set NO87 equal to a null, or
                empty, value.

                EXAMPLE
                -------

                    SET NO87=

                The preceding example turns off software emulation of
                the 8087/80287. Note: no spaces follow the "equal" (=)
                sign.

            COPROCESSOR/EMULATION USAGE TABLE
            ---------------------------------

            The following table shows the effects of setting the NO87
            variable on applications using QB87:

                +----------------------+-----------------------+

            NOTES ON TABLE:

            1) The entries under the "Math Coprocessor not Present"
            heading are valid regardless of whether or not the
            NO87 variable is set.

            2) If an 8087/80287 coprocessor is present and either one
            of the following conditions is true, the application
            always uses the coprocessor:

                a) The NO87 variable is not set.

                b) Forced emulation has been turned off by setting
                NO87 equal to a null value.

    Update-45	The text under the "Effect" heading for CLS 1 should
            be changed to read as follows:

                ...Previously, CLS 1 changed the screen only
                after a VIEW statement was executed.

            Also, add the following to the text for CLS 2:

                See the reference entry for VIEW PRINT in the
                Microsoft QuickBASIC Compiler manual for more
                information on creating a text window.

    ===<Part 3: Corrections to the QuickBASIC Compiler Version 2.0 Manual>=======

    Page	Correction
    ----	----------

    61-63	Significant enhancements have been made to QuickBASIC's debugging
        capabilities. See the discussion in Section 3, "Debugging Commands,"
        of the "Microsoft QuickBASIC Compiler Version 3.0 Update," which
        supersedes the discussion on pages 61-63 of the Version 2.0 manual.

    71	In the syntax line at the bottom of the page, the "c:buffersize"
        option should be preceded by a forward slash, as follows:

        /c:buffersize

    76	In the first paragraph after Figure 4.2, the sentence "If you
        are in a subdirectory..." should state that the entry ".."
        appears in the "upper-left corner", not the "upper-right".

    78	Binary files cannot be loaded into QuickBASIC. The note in the
        middle of the page should read:

        QuickBASIC accepts only ASCII files. If you attempt to load a
        binary file, you will get an error.

    78	BASICA ASCII files containing explicit extended ASCII characters,
        (graphics characters), are treated as binary files by QuickBASIC.

    93	In Section 4.4.3.11, "Exe," it should be noted that the executable
        files created using this method require the support of the BRUN30.EXE
        run-time module in order to execute.

    120	The first line of this example (DEFINT I-L) should be changed
        to DEFINT I-S so as to execute correctly.

    152	The stack is preset to 768 bytes, not 512.

    160	The list of nonexecutable statements should also include the
        CONST statement.

    161	In the example under Section 9.2.2, there should not be an underscore
        character (_) following the FIELD variable D$.

    162	String constants can be ASCII characters in the range 32 to 126.
        (127 is the DEL character)

    172	In the discussion of "Overflow" and "Division by zero" errors, the
        following paragraph should be added to item 1a:

            If you are running a program from the QuickBASIC
            user interface (editor) with the Debug option on,
            and one of these errors occurs, the program ends
            and the appropriate error message appears in the
            dialog box at the bottom of the screen.  You are
            then returned to the editor, with the cursor
            positioned on the line where the error occurred.

        The following should also be added to item 2:

            If you are running a program from the QuickBASIC
            interface with the Debug option off, the program
            still ends with the appropriate error message
            displayed; however, when you are returned to the
            editor, the cursor is positioned on the first line
            of the program, rather than the offending line.

    183	In Table 10.1, you should add the statements PEEK, POKE, and DEF SEG
        to the column "May Require Modifying Interpreter Programs," since
        the memory maps of the interpreter and the compiler are different.
        For example, programs that read from or write to memory locations in
        the RAM-resident portion of the interpreter do not work in the
        compiler environment since the interpreter is not present.

    188	In Section 10.3.2, the $INCLUDE metacommand, restriction 2) is in
        error.	Included files may contain END statements.

    193	In Table 10.6, you should add the statements PEEK, POKE, and
        DEF SEG, since the memory maps of the interpreter and the compiler
        are different. For example, programs that read from or write to memory
        locations in the RAM-resident portion of the interpreter do not work in
        the compiler environment since the interpreter is not present.

    200	In the Action section for the BLOAD command, it states that
        BLOAD can take input from "any input device." This is not true,
        as the BLOAD command does not take input from the "KYBD:" device.

    222	The EGA card does not support the COLOR statement's border parameter.
        If you have an EGA card installed on your system, using the border
        parameter causes unpredictable results.

    229	The list of nonexecutable statements should also include the
        CONST and DATA statements.

    232	The "VO1" variable in the third line from the bottom should be changed
        to read as follows:

            DENS=W/VOL

    235	The last line in the example should be "LOCATE Y,X" not
        "LOCATE X,Y".

    265	The syntax for the ERASE statement should have a comma between
        the array names, as shown here:

            ERASE arrayname [,arrayname...]

    275	In the FIELD statement's Example 2, the order of arguments is reversed
        for all string-manipulation functions. The affected section of the
        program should read as follows:

        .
        .
        .
        IF (ZCHECK$ > "85699" AND ZCHECK$ < "85801") THEN
            INFO$ = PLIST$
            PRINT LEFT$(INFO$,25)
            PRINT MID$(INFO$,16,25)
            PRINT RIGHT$(INFO$,17)
        END IF

        The FIELD statements in the two examples shown under Example 4 should
        be changed to read as follows:

            FIELD #1, RECLENGTH% AS OFFSET$, SIZE% AS A$(I%)

            and

            FIELD #1, 15 AS A$(1), 10 AS A$(2),..., 8 AS A$(14)

    280	Change the first sentence at the top of the page to read as
        follows:

            The body of a FOR...NEXT loop is executed at least
            once, unless one of the following conditions is true,
            in which case the loop is not executed:

            * Step size is positive, and <start> is greater
            than <end>.

            * Step size is negative, and <start> is less than
            <end>.

    283	In the FRE function example, the first line of the example should be
        a $DYNAMIC metacommand, as follows:

        '  $DYNAMIC
        PRINT "Before dimensioning arrays:   " FRE(""),FRE(0),FRE(-1)
        .
        .
        .

    286	There is a missing parenthesis in the formula for computing the GET
        graphics statement's array size. There should be three left parentheses
        after the INT keyword, as follows:

        4 + INT(((x2 - x1 +1) * bits-per-pixel + 7)/8) * ((y2 - y1) +1)

    297	The two examples comparing the single-line and block forms of the
        IF...THEN...ELSE statement should read as follows:

        Example 1:

        INPUT "Price = ",x
        IF (x >= 10000) THEN DISC! = x * .25! ELSE _

            IF (x < 10000) AND (x >= 5000) THEN DISC! = x * .2! ELSE _

            IF (x < 5000) AND (x >= 1000) THEN DISC! = x * .1! ELSE _

            DISC! = 0

        IF DISC! = 0 THEN PRINT "No discount" ELSE _

            PRINT "Discounted price = "; : PRINT USING "$$####.##";x - DISC!

        Example 2:

        INPUT "Price = ",x
        IF (x >= 10000) THEN
            DISC! = x * .25!
        ELSEIF (x < 10000) AND (x >= 5000) THEN
            DISC! = x * .2!
        ELSEIF (x < 5000) AND (x >= 1000) THEN
            DISC! = x * .1!
        ELSE DISC! = 0
        END IF
        IF DISC! = 0 THEN
            PRINT "No discount"
        ELSE
            PRINT "Discounted price = ";
            PRINT USING "$$####.##";x - DISC!
        END IF

    313	The last sentence of the description of Example 2, after
        the semicolon, should read: "The last line displays the new
        soft-key values."

    314	Since QB3 supports the Advanced 101-Key keyboard, the
        function keys F11 and F12 can now be trapped. Trapping
        of F11 can be controlled with KEY(30) {ON | OFF | STOP},
        while trapping of F12 can be controlled with
        KEY(31) {ON | OFF | STOP}.

    315	The table listed on this page is incomplete. In addition to
        the values listed, you must also take into account the state
        of the NUM LOCK and CAPS LOCK keys. For NUM LOCK active you
        should add the value &H20, and for CAPS LOCK active you should
        add the value &H40 to the keyboard flag.

    317	The second comment in the example program should read:

        ' DOWN key will now be trapped

        Also, note this program traps only the CTRL-s (lowercase s) key
        sequence. To trap CTRL-S (with a capital S), you need to deal with
        capital letters produced by holding down the SHIFT key, as well as
        capital letters produced when the CAPS-LOCK key is active, as shown
        here:

        KEY 16, CHR$(&H05) + CHR$(&H1F)	   ' Trap CTRL + SHIFT + s
        KEY 17, CHR$(&H44) + CHR$(&H1F)	   ' Trap CTRL + CAPS-LOCK + s

        KEY (16) ON
        KEY (17) ON

        ON KEY (16) GOSUB KEYTRAP
        ON KEY (17) GOSUB KEYTRAP

    325	The STEP option example requires a hyphen before the STEP keyword, as
        follows:

        LINE -STEP (10,5)

        The phrase following the example should read:

        "draws a line from (10,10) to the point with x-coordinate
        10+10 and y-coordinate 10+5, or (20,15)."

    327	The Action for LINE INPUT should read:

        Inputs an entire line (up to 255 characters) to a string variable...

    338	The Remark for LOF should read:

        When a file is opened in any mode, LOF returns the size of the file in
        bytes.

    348	In the description of the example it should be noted that line 100
        converts the single-precision variable AMT to a 4-byte string;
        therefore, the field variable D$ needs to be defined as only a
        4-byte string:

        FIELD #1, 4 AS D$, 20 AS N$

    353	Delete the last sentence on this page.

    369	Add the following note concerning the ACCESS clause:

        The ACCESS clause works in an OPEN statement only if you are using
        versions of DOS that support networking (3.0 or later). In addition,
        you must run the SHARE.EXE program (or the network startup program must
        run it) to perform any locking operation. Earlier versions of DOS
        return an "Advanced Feature" error if ACCESS is used with OPEN.

    375	The second sentence under the Action heading for the LF option should be
        changed to read:

        When LF is specified, a line-feed character (0AH) is automatically sent
        after each carriage-return character (0DH).

    388	The last sentence in the REMARKS section should be deleted. The
        argument to the PEEK statement should be a single-precision
        variable in the range 0-1,048,575.

    396	The variable in the first line of PLAY statement's Example 1 should be
        SCALE$, not SCALES$:

        SCALE$ = "CDEFGAB"

    410	In the example, all references to the file STORINVENT should be changed
        to INVENT.DAT. The file argument to both OPEN statements should be
        the same file, INVENT.DAT.

    418	The first entry in the "Arguments" column should be (x,y), not
        (x1,y1).

    420	Images cannot be scaled with the PUT graphics statement. Only one set
        of x,y coordinates can be specified as arguments to PUT. All text
        after "Because you can specify..." in the second paragraph, and all of
        the following paragraph, should be ignored.

    424	The second sentence in the Remarks section for the READ statement should
        be changed to read as follows:

        READ statements assign DATA-statement values to variables on a
        one-to-one basis.

    448	The text format for SCREEN 1 should be 40 X 25, and the text format
        for SCREEN 2 should be 80 X 25.

        The first line under the SCREEN 2 heading should be corrected to
        read as follows:

            * 640 x 200 pixel high-resolution graphics

    452	The color range listed for SCREEN 2 should be 0 - 15, not 0 - 1.

        Because the WIDTH statement in QuickBASIC 3 now lets you set the
        number of lines displayed on the screen as well as the number of
        columns, the information on legal video-page ranges in SCREEN 0
        shown in Table 11.6 should be updated as follows:

        WIDTH Statement 	Display/Adapter		Legal Video-Page
        Format			Hardware		Ranges
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        WIDTH 80,25		MDPA			0 only
                    CGA			0 - 3
                    EGA (64K)		0 - 3
                    EGA (128K - 256K)	0 - 7

        WIDTH 40,25		CGA, EGA		0 - 7

        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        WIDTH 80,43		EGA (64K)		0 - 1
                    EGA (128K - 256K)	0 - 3

        WIDTH 40,43		EGA (64K)		0 - 3
                    EGA (128K - 256K)	0 - 7
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        NOTE:	43-line mode is valid only with an EGA adapter with its
            switch set for an EGA display.

    474	The example for the STR$ function should read as follows:

        DEF FNNum$(X)
            X$ = STR$(X)
            LENGTH = LEN(X$)
            IF LEFT$(X$,1) <> "-" THEN LENGTH = LENGTH - 1
            FNNum$ = RIGHT$(X$,LENGTH)
        END DEF

        PRINT "Enter 0 to end."
        DO
            INPUT "Find cosine of: ",Num
            IF Num THEN PRINT "COS(" FNNum$(Num) ") = " COS(Num)
        LOOP WHILE Num <> 0

    482	In the example, the input to the prompt "Pattern to be searched
        for?" must be SUB (not "sub") in order to get the output shown.

    525	Add CASE, CONST, DEBUG, DO, ELSEIF, LOOP, OFF, RANDOM, and SELECT
        to the list of reserved words.

        Delete the dollar-sign ($) character at the end of GOTO.

    535	Batch files created for versions of QuickBASIC before 2.0 require
        modification. In older batch files, "bascom" should be "qb".

    536	If you are using a version of DOS earlier than 3.0, use the PATH command
        instead of the SET command to define the PATH variable. Using SET under
        earlier versions of DOS can cause the PATH variable to work incorrectly
        for some path specifications containing lowercase letters.

    546 &	The stack is preset to 768 bytes, not 512.
    547

    566	The third bulleted remark ("A USR function...") should be deleted.

    570	The explanation for the error message "Too many files" should read:

        This error most commonly occurs when an attempt is made to open a
        number of files that exceeds the limit set by the FILES= parameter in
        the CONFIG.SYS file. It also occurs when the per-directory file limit
        is exceeded by an attempt to create a new file with the SAVE or OPEN
        statement. Refer to your DOS manual for the number of files permitted
        in a directory.
