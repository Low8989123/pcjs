UPDATE: There are now two "Microsoft Adventure" disk images in the PCjs Disk Library.  The latest one is called
"Microsoft Adventure (Unmodified)", which recreates the original copy-protected diskette.  See the PCjs blog post
"[Adventures in Copy Protection](/blog/2019/06/13/)" for more information.

{% include machine.html id="ibm5150-adventure" %}

NOTE: The PCjs "Save" feature will not create a usable copy of a copy-protected diskette.  That feature
works only with standard disk formats.
