From [MobyGames](https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/leather-goddesses-of-phobos):

> The year is 1936, and suddenly the protagonist is abducted by the Leather Goddesses for the final testing in the plan which will enslave every man and woman on earth. These Leather Goddesses of Phobos are just finishing up their plans for the invasion of Earth. If the hero fails to escape and save humanity, the Leather Goddesses will turn the Earth into their pleasure dome.
  
> Leather Goddesses of Phobos is a text adventure with humorous overtones. The player uses standard commands in the text parser to observe his environment and pick up items. The game's 'naughtiness' level can be adjusted between Tame (G), Suggestive (PG), and Lewd (R).

NOTE: The PCjs "Save" feature will not create a usable copy of a copy-protected diskette.  That feature
works only with standard disk formats.
