### Help

Excerpt from the game's "Help!" screen:

    You can move Commander Keen with the joystick or keyboard.

    When you first start Keen, you will be in keyboard mode.
    Let's look at the keys you need to know to play the game.

    Arrows          Move Keen around
    Ctrl            Jump
    Alt             Use Pogo/Stop Pogo (if you have one)
    Ctrl and Alt    Fire raygun (if it has charges)

    You can redefine these keys by pressing F3.

    OTHER IMPORTANT KEYS

    Spacebar        Status screen
    F1              Help!
    F2              Sound on/off
    F3              Keyboard mode
    F4              Joystick mode
    F5              Save Game
    Esc             Quit

    When you are on the Mars map, you may be blocked by a city,
    shrine, or other obstacle.  You must enter the city (press Ctrl
    or button 1) and finish it before proceeding.

    When you enter a city, you can get things by simply running into them.

    If you cannot pass through a door, there may be a "keycard" that the
    door requires.  This keycard will be the same color as the door.
