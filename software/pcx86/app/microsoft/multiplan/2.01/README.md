NOTE: The Microsoft Multiplan 2.01 disks below are *not* original distribution disks.  They were obtained from
[VETUSWARE](https://vetusware.com/download/Multiplan%20Version%202/?id=5148).  Unlike older versions of Multiplan
found online, this copy *does* include installation files, so we have attempted to recreate the `INSTALL` and
`PROGRAM` as they originally existed.  However, this means that before you can run `MP.COM` on the `PROGRAM` disk,
you must run the installation program to properly "install" `MP.COM` for the machine currently being used.

The `PROGRAM` disk also includes [Microsoft Mouse 5.00](/software/pcx86/dev/mouse/microsoft/5.00/) driver files.
They match the 5.00 distribution files, even though they have been time-stamped with the same date as the Multiplan
files.
