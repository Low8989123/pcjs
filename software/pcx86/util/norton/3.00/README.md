[Norton Utilities 3.00 (1984-12-07)](#directory-of-norton-utilities-300-1984-12-07) is from the
[PCjs Software Archive](/software/pcjs/) and predates previously known copies of version 3.00.
Scans of the diskette and accompanying note from Peter Norton are provided [below](#diskette-photos).
Coincidentally, we acquired the diskette on December 7, 2018, exactly 34 years after the files were created.

One or both of the newer releases of version 3.00 were probably a response, at least in part, to the
[notice](#diskette-photos) that Peter Norton included with the original release:

    I'm sorry to intrude with a last-minute warning,
    but even after extensive testing, a significant
    problem has been discovered after the enclosed
    disk and documentation were prepared.

    We've received reports that one of the programs
    in this set, the Directory Sort program, called
    DS, has malfunctioned on a few hard disks.

    We've tested and used the DS program literally
    thousands of times on many different disk formats
    without encountering any problems.  Nevertheless,
    a few customers have reported difficulties.

    I would recommend that you exercise caution in
    using DS.

    Peter Norton

However, there are a number of other differences between the disks.  For example, the utilities
on the [first disk](#directory-of-norton-utilities-300-1985-12-07) have their traditional short names,
along with `LONG.BAT` and `SHORT.BAT` batch files to switch between long and short names, whereas the
[second disk](#directory-of-norton-utilities-300-1985-01-14) uses long names and no batch files,
and on the [third disk](#directory-of-norton-utilities-300-1985-01-21), the batch files reappear.

While it's possible that some files on these disks were removed or renamed at some point, `DEMO.BAT`
on the first disk assumes short names, while `DEMO.BAT` on the third disk assumes long names,
so it seems the file names as they presently exist are correct.
