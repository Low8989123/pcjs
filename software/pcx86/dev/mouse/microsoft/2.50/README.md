NOTE: The [MS Mouse 2.50 (Bus)](#directory-of-ms-mouse-250-bus) diskette is from a
"Microsoft Word with Microsoft Mouse combination package", and it appears to be a complete copy of the original diskette,
whereas the [MS Mouse 2.50 (Serial)](#directory-of-ms-mouse-250-serial) diskette is a custom diskette that contains only the
2.50 serial mouse drivers, perhaps from a different Microsoft Word bundle.  Since the serial drivers were not preserved inside
an original disk image, the difference in timestamps is not meaningful. All files were obtained from
[WinWorld](https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-mouse/2x).
