Microsoft MS-DOS Manager is a file manager shell that OEMs provided to be used with MS-DOS 3.X systems. It was bundled with OEM hardware from companies such as Zenith. This software didn't last long, as it was replaced and became the DOS Shell on MS-DOS 4.X.

Some of the features included is mouse support, drop-down windows similar to later Microsoft products, split screen file list, linking file types with other software that is installed and add programs quickly to a drop-down menu specifically for programs.
