The machine below is configured to automatically start TopView 1.10 on top of PC DOS 2.00.  No mouse driver is loaded,
so you must use TopView's "Keyboard Mouse" support: arrow keys move the cursor and **Home**, **PgUp**, and **Alt**
act as mouse buttons.

While TopView 1.01 ran with Keyboard support enabled "out of the box," TopView 1.10 appears to require some configuration,
which is why the `SETUP` batch file is run first.

NOTE: This disk image is from the PCjs disk collection.  Presumably, as in [TopView 1.01](../1.01/), there was a
second (Tutorial) disk, but we don't have a copy of it.
