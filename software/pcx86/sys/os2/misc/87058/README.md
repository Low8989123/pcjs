This disk contained a prototype version of OS/2 from February 1987, code-named **FOOTBALL**
(aka **PIGSKIN**).  It predated the completion of OS/2 1.0 by some eight months and was based on the
[SIZZLE](/software/pcx86/sys/os2/misc/87007/) fork, which started around November 1986.

On startup, FOOTBALL displays the following banner:

	CP-DOS version 1.0
	Copyright 1986,1987  Microsoft Corp.
	
	PIGSKIN Internal revision 7.68.17, 87/02/26

See [Booting FOOTBALL](#booting-football) for startup instructions, and the
[FOOTBALL Design Document](#football-design-document) for an internal description of the prototype.

Most of the work on this prototype occurred between December 1, 1986 and February 28, 1987, with the principal goal
of demonstrating multiple DOS applications running in V86-mode to BillG; that demo probably occurred in March 1987.
However, another underlying goal was to demonstrate to IBM that Microsoft was ahead of the curve on 32-bit design
considerations for OS/2.  Up to this point, all OS/2 design and development work had been 16-bit, since the
dominant state-of-the-art Intel CPU at the time was the 80286.

The FOOTBALL prototype was based on pre-1.0 OS/2 sources, and the only hardware it supported was the COMPAQ DeskPro
386-16.  The source code was later sent to IBM, who in early April 1987 was adapting it to run on the Model 80 PS/2.
 
After OS/2 1.0 was finished in October 1987, FOOTBALL changes were merged into a fresh set of 1.0 sources, which
initially was version 1.3 (also known as **PIGSKIN** and later **CRUISER**) but ultimately became version 2.0.

A directory listing of this disk is provided [below](#directory-of-os2-football-boot-disk-v76817).

Booting FOOTBALL
----------------

Click the "Run" button on the [COMPAQ DeskPro 386](/machines/pcx86/compaq/deskpro386/) above to the start
the machine and begin the boot process.

The OS/2 kernel debugger is built into the FOOTBALL kernel and automatically connects to COM2, which is captured by the
PCjs Debugger output window:

If you don't see the above output, including final `Symbols linked (IBMDOSD)` message, then something went wrong.
Otherwise, the version banner should appear on the machine's screen.  After any CONFIG.SYS messages, SHELL.EXE should
display:

  - Start A Protect Mode Program
  - Start A Real Mode Program

The first option will start CMD.EXE, and the second option will start COMMAND.COM.  To return to the SHELL, press the
`Sys Req` key.  Since modern keyboards don't have that key, you will need to click the `Keyboard` button to display the
PCjs soft keyboard, and then click the `Sys` key in the top right corner of that keyboard.

FOOTBALL Design Document
------------------------

From the PCjs Archives: the following text is from an email titled "3xBox Design Document" sent to the
Microsoft *football* alias on Saturday, February 28, 1987, at 5:02pm.

	Overview
	--------
	The goal for this research project was to demonstrate the feasability of
	supporting multiple virtual DOS 3.x machines on a 286DOS-based kernel running
	on an 386 personal computer.  Each "3xBox" would have its own virtual screen,
	keyboard, interrupt vectors, and address space.  Furthermore, well- behaved
	DOS 3.x applications that do text (as opposed to graphic) screen output would
	run in the background.
	
	In order to acheive this goal in a reasonable amount of time, we started from
	the 286DOS "sizzle" kernel and made the minimum amount of changes necessary,
	both in code and fundamental design.  The resulting DOS will be referred to
	as "386DOS" in this paper.
	
	386DOS provides up to four 3xBoxes, depending upon the available RAM.  More
	3xBoxes could be supported if a slight change is made to the method of
	allocating page tables.
	
	Well-behaved DOS 3.x applications (i.e., MS-Multiplan, MS-Word, Lotus 1-2-3)
	can run in the background, multi-tasking against one another and against the
	foreground screen group.  Lotus 1-2-3 (version 2.01) passes its floppy-based
	copy protection when in the foreground.
	
	It should be noted that 386DOS, while functional, is not an optimal design/
	implementation of multiple 3xBoxes.  In particular, interrupt management, the
	device driver model, and the existence of V86-mode kernel code should be
	modified before 386DOS is made a commercial product.
	
	Unless stated otherwise, most of the concepts extant in 286DOS apply to 386DOS.

	V86 Mode and the 386
	----------------------
	The 386 CPU has three distinct execution modes: REAL, PROT, and V86.  REAL
	and PROT modes are largely compatible with the corresponding modes of an 286.
	V86 modes is exactly the same as RING 3 PROT mode, with the following
	differences:
	
		o Memory Address Hierarchy
			A 386 has three levels of memory addresses:
			- Virtual (Intel refers to this as Logical)
				This is either the selector:offset or segment:offset address used
				by unprivledged machine language code.
			- Linear
				This is the 32-bit address arrived at either via a GDT/LDT
				selector lookup, or via the 8086-compatible (seg << 4 + offset).
			- Physical
				This is the 32-bit address arrived at by pushing a linear address
				through the paging mechanism.  This is the address that the CPU
				sends out on the bus to select physical memory.
	
			When in V86 mode, the CPU performs the 8086-compatible computation.
	
		o I/O instructions are NOT IOPL-sensitive
			Trapping of I/O is done using the IO Permission Map.
	
		o All instructions which modify or expose the Interrupt Flag ARE IOPL-
		  sensitive.
			This allows the OS to simulate the Interrupt Flag, if desired.

	V86 IRETD Frame
	---------------
	When any interrupt, trap, exception, or fault occurs in V86 mode, the CPU
	switches to PROT mode and switches to the TSS Ring 0 Stack and builds the
	following stack frame:
	
				(0) (old GS)
				(0) (old FS)
				(0) (old DS)
				(0) (old ES)
				(0) (old SS)
				   (old ESP)
				(old EFLAGS)
				(0) (old CS)
				   (old EIP) <- (SS:SP)

	CPU Mode Determination
	----------------------
	A new implementation of the WHATMODE macro was written in order to distinguish
	between the three CPU modes: REAL, PROT, and V86.  REAL mode is indicated by
	a 0 PE bit in CR0 (a.k.a. MSW on a 286).  If the PE bit is 1, then the mode
	may be either PROT or V86.  These two modes may be distinguished by attempting
	to change the IOPL bits in the FLAGS word.  At Ring 0 in PROT mode (the only
	place WHATMODE is used), the IOPL may be changed.  In V86 mode, IOPL cannot
	be changed.  So, we change IOPL and then check to see if it changed.  If so,
	PROT mode, else V86 mode.

	CPU Mode Switching
	------------------
	The 286DOS kernel relies extensively on switching inbetween REAL and PROT.
	This functionality is provided by the RealMode and ProtMode routines.
	In 386DOS, RealMode is no longer needed.  As soon as we switch to PROT mode
	during SysInit, the CPU only uses PROT and V86 modes.
	
	Two new routines, ProtToV86 and V86ToProt, that are analogous to RealMode and
	ProtMode.  ProtToV86 is quite straightforward.  We build a V86 IRETD frame
	on the stack with the VM bit set in the EFLAGS image.  We set the SS:SP
	image to be equivalent to the stack just above the V86 IRETD frame, and
	set the CS:IP image to instruction following an IRETD.  Then, we issue the
	IRETD and the CPU continues processing following the IRETD and in V86 mode.
	
	V86ToProt is a bit trickier.  The only way to get out of V86 mode is to
	trap or fault or issue a software interrupt.  We chose to use a software
	interrupt, 30h, which we call the V86 Services interrupt.  The INT 30h entry
	in the IDT is a ring 3 interrupt gate, so issuing an INT 30 from V86 mode
	causes a V86 IRETD frame to be built on the TSS Ring 0 stack and control
	transfers to the INT 30h vector.  The handler verifies that the INT 30h
	was issued by the V86ToProt routine (checks CS:IP on the stack).  If not,
	the interrupt is reflected back to the requesting 3xBox (See Interrupt
	Reflection).  If it was V86ToProt, we clean off the stack frame and return to
	the caller.  NOTE: V86 Services is also used for completing the 386 LOADALL
	used by PhysToVirt to map "high" memory in "REAL" mode.

	Stack Switching
	---------------
	In order to maintain the 286DOS mode switch and stack switch semantics
	when V86 mode is used, we have a new stack (the V86 Stack) in the 3xBox PTDA.

	286DOS Modes and Stacks
	-----------------------
	The RealMode and ProtMode procedures in 286DOS are the only ways to switch
	the CPU execution mode.  These routines both maintain SS:SP, allowing
	RealMode and ProtMode to be reentrant.  The TSS Ring 0 stack is always the
	current TCB stack in the current PTDA.  The only other stacks in the system
	are the Interrupt Stack and user stack(s).

	386DOS Modes and Stacks
	-----------------------
	In 386DOS, any interrupt or exception while in V86 mode causes a switch to
	PROT mode and the TSS Ring 0 Stack.  So we have a new way to mode switch with
	an incompatible stack semantic.  We had to fix this mode switch to make it
	compatible with 286DOS.

	Observation
	-----------
	In V86 mode, the current stack must not be the TSS Ring 0 Stack.  The CPU
	only leaves V86 mode via an interrupt/exception, which causes a stack switch
	to the TSS Ring 0 Stack.  If the current stack was the same as the TSS Ring 0
	Stack, then the stack might get corrupted.  In 286DOS, the Ring 0 Stack is
	the PTDA.  Since we run on this stack in V86 mode, we need a new Ring 0 stack
	when a 3xBox is running.

	Approach
	--------
	1)  When a PMBox is running, the TSS Ring 0 Stack is a PTDA TCB stack.
			+   This is consistent with the 286DOS model.
	
	2)  When a 3xBox is running, the TSS Ring 0 Stack is the "V86 Stack".
			+   The V86 Stack is allocated in the 3xBox PTDA.
			+   If the cause of the mode switch can be handled without enabling
				interrupts (e.g., interrupt reflection, IN/OUT trapping), we stay
				on the V86 stack.
			+   Otherwise, copy the V86 IRETD frame to the previous stack and
				switch back to the previous stack.

	Details
	-------
	1)  Leaving V86 mode
		a.  V86ToProt (analog of ProtMode)
			+   Issue special V86ToProt software interrupt.  If the interrupt
				gate is DPL=3 (and it must be a 386 Interrupt Gate), then the 386
				switches to Ring 0 (and the TSS Ring 0 stack) and transfers
				control to the handler.
			+   To ensure that 3xBox apps don't use this feature, the interrupt
				handler checks that CS=DosGroup and IP is in the correct range.
				If not, then the interrupt is reflected (see below).
			+   To make V86ToProt compatible with ProtMode, the interrupt handler
				switches to the old stack (we get SS:ESP from TSS Ring 0 stack,
				which is where we are running).
			+   Finally, V86ToProt restores saved registers and flags from the
				stack and returns to caller.
	
		b.  Software interrupt
			+   GP-Fault handler reflects to 3xBox IVT handler in V86 mode.
				o   Add IRET frame on old stack, taking IP, CS, FLAGS from
					TSS Ring 0 Stack.
				o   Look up handler in 3xBox IVT.
				o   Edit TSS Ring 0 Stack EIP and CS to point to IVT handler.
				o   IRETD
			+   IVT interrupt handler IRET uses IRET frame we built on old stack.
	
		c.  Hardware interrupt
			+   To make this operation compatible with 286Dos, the interrupt
				handler copies the V86 stack from the TSS Ring 0 stack to
				the old stack, then switches stacks to the newly modified old
				stack.  This allows the Interupt Manager to do an IRETD to
				get back to the correct mode.
	
		d.  Exception
			+   Remain on V86 stack, process exception, and IRETD.
	
	2)  Entering V86 mode
		a.  ProtToV86
			+   Build V86 IRETD frame on current stack and IRETD.
		b.  LinToVirtDM_HANDLE
			+   Execute 386 LOADALL with VM bit set in EFLAGS image in loadall
				buffer.

	Interrupt Management
	--------------------
	All software interrupts, hardware interrupts, and CPU traps and exceptions
	are vectored through a common IDT, regardless of whether the CPU is in PROT
	or V86 mode.
	
	NOTE: Background 3xBoxes get no hardware interrupts.  In the commercial 386DOS,
		  this restriction can be relaxed so that interrupts, other than for the
		  keyboard and mouse (since those are implicitly for the foreground box),
		  can be given to background 3xBoxes.

	Passing Hardware Interrupts to the Foreground 3xBox
	---------------------------------------------------
	In the interrupt manager:
	
	IF  a 3xBox is foreground       -AND-
	    the current mapped 3xBox is background
	THEN
	    MapIn foreground 3xBox;
	    Dispatch interrupt;
