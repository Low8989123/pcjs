Microsoft Windows 1.01, the first public version of Windows, was released on November 20, 1985.
It is shown here running on an IBM PC XT (Model 5160) with a CGA Display.  You can also run Windows 1.01
with an [EGA Display](/software/pcx86/sys/windows/1.01/ega/).

{% include machine.html id="ibm5160-cga-win101" %}

The above simulation is configured for a clock speed of 4.77Mhz, with 256Kb of RAM and a CGA Display,
using the original IBM PC Model 5160 ROM BIOS and CGA font ROM.  Even though the CGA was a "Color Graphics Adapter,"
the only CGA mode that Windows supported was the 640x200 2-color mode, hence its black-and-white appearance.

This PC XT configuration also includes a 10Mb hard disk with Windows 1.01 pre-installed.

NOTE: The Windows 1.01 mouse pointer can be controlled with your mouse, but only when your mouse is
within the "CGA Display" window. This is a restriction imposed by your web browser, not PCjs.
