First released in 1987 by COMPAQ Computer Corp, this version of MS-DOS displays the following messages on boot:

	The COMPAQ Personal Computer MS-DOS
	Version 3.31
	
	(C) Copyright Compaq Computer Corp. 1982, 1988
	(C) Copyright Microsoft Corp. 1981, 1987

This was the first version of DOS to support 32-bit logical sector numbers, enabling partitions larger than 32Mb
and partitions that extended beyond the first 32Mb of disk space.  These features were soon added to DOS 4.0 and
OS/2 1.1 as well.

An older version of COMPAQ MS-DOS 3.31 can be found on the
[COMPAQ Diagnostics 5.08](/software/pcx86/diag/compaq/5.08/) diskette, a 360Kb disk image from the PCjs Archives that
contains hidden MS-DOS 3.31 files dated September 1987.  The disk displays a different boot message:

    The COMPAQ Personal Computer MS-DOS 
    Version 3.31
                              
    (C) Copyright Compaq Computer Corp. 1982, 1987                             
    (C) Copyright Microsoft Corp. 1981, 1987   

making it clear that the diskette *is* a COMPAQ MS-DOS 3.31 diskette from 1987; all the other sources we've
checked only have disks from 1988 or later.

**UPDATE**: PCjs has since unearthed another diskette, [COMPAQ MS-DOS 3.31 (1987)](#directory-of-compaq-ms-dos-331-1987),
containing more 1987 binaries.

Later revisions of COMPAQ MS-DOS 3.31 were released as well.  We have archived three
"[Rev. G](#compaq-ms-dos-331-rev-g)" disks obtained from [WinWorld](https://winworldpc.com/product/ms-dos/331)
(see "Microsoft MS-DOS 3.31 [Compaq OEM Rev G] (3.5-720k)").  All the files on those disks are dated May 1990.

The `FASTART` program on Disk 1 expects a "USER PROGRAMS" disk.  For example, you could use the
"[COMPAQ User Programs (1989)](/software/pcx86/diag/compaq/1989/)" diskette, which was part of a later
COMPAQ MS-DOS 4.01 release, since COMPAQ states that the disk "supersedes earlier versions".

[Directory Listings](#directory-listings) of the distribution diskettes are provided below.

### Directory Listings

The following disk is from the [PCjs Software Archive](/software/pcjs/), and unfortunately, it is not an original
distribution disk, but it's included here because it's the only available copy of other COMPAQ MS-DOS 3.31 binaries
released in 1987.

It's safe to say the following binaries were not part of the original distribution:

- EXMM.SYS (ZSoft Extended Memory Manager)
- HIMEM.SYS (DOS XMS Driver, Version 2.04 - 8/17/88)
- SMARTDRV.SYS (Microsoft SMARTDrive Disk Cache v2.10)

but, in the interest of preserving all manner of historical curiosities, we have decided to leave the disk as-is.
