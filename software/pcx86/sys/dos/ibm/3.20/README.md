PC DOS 3.20 was first announced on March 18, 1986 and released April 1986.  Read the early
[PC Magazine Review](#pc-magazine-review) below.

A [Feature Summary](#feature-summary), along with [Directory Listings](#directory-of-pc-dos-320-disk-1) of the two
360Kb distribution diskettes, are provided below.  This version of PC DOS was also available on one [720Kb Diskette](#directory-of-pc-dos-320-720k).

### IBM PC DOS 3.21

Most copies of IBM PC DOS you'll find these days actually say "3.21" on the DOS diskette and "3.20" on the Supplemental
Programs diskette.  This is because shortly after 3.20 was released, a problem was discovered with IBM's newest keyboard.
The August 1986 issue of PC Magazine ("First Looks", p.54) explains:

> IBM Corp. released **PC DOS 3.21** in the form of a patch to DOS 3.2. Some users get an error when cursor keys
> on the new IBM keyboard (with 12 function keys) won't respond in BASICA edit mode. The patch fix is available free
> from dealers where users purchased DOS 3.2.

Even though the DOS diskette was labeled "3.21", the operating system version was not actually modified; the system still
reported itself as version 3.20.  However, since BASIC and BASICA had been updated, their displayed versions were changed
to "D3.21" and "A3.21", respectively.

IBM apparently decided to slip a few other last-minute changes into the same release, as you can see from the
file timestamps on the 360K diskette (the 720K diskette contains the original files).  The additional modifications
include:

- DISKCOPY.COM
- KEYBFR.COM
- KEYBGR.COM

Changes to KEYBFR.COM and KEYGR.COM are not surprising, since IBM's new 12-function-key keyboard
would have likely affected those programs as well.  However, the reasons for changing DISKCOPY.COM are unclear and
we're unaware of any public explanation from IBM.

### DOS GETS BETTER--AND MORE EXPENSIVE, TOO

*by Charles Petzold*

> #### DOS 3.2 adds new commands and a unique device driver and makes some minor changes.

> As usual with new PC-DOS versions, PC-DOS 3.2 has been released in conjunction with a new product (the PC
Convertible), but it can run on all previous members of the IBM PC family. PC-DOS 3.2 is available on either one
3-1/2 inch 720K-byte disk or two 5.25-inch 360K disks. These disks include everything in PC-DOS 3.1, plus three new
programs. At $95, PC-DOS 3.2 is the most expensive PC-DOS yet.

> The shining star of the new PC-DOS is XCOPY, a fast file-copy utility that combines features of COPY, BACKUP,
and RESTORE. XCOPY is fast because it reads as many files as possible into available memory and then writes them
out to the target. (COPY and BACKUP, on the other hand, have to continually alternate between the source and target
drives for each file they copy.)

> Like COPY, XCOPY has /V switch to verify all file writes. Like BACKUP, it has /M and /D switches to restrict copying
based on file modification of the file date. A /S flag lets XCOPY find files in nested subdirectories and create the
subdirectories on the target disk if they don't already exist. A /P switch prompts you with a "Y/N?" for each file,
and a /W switch lets you swap disks before XCOPY starts up.

> You can also use XCOPY as a backup utility. The advantage over BACKUP is that the copied files are directly usable.
On a Bernoulli Box attached to a PC, I XCOPYed over 1,200 files from one 10-megabyte cartridge to another in just under
15 minutes. The bonus, of course, is that the fi1es are unfragmented on the target cartridge. However, XCOPY's
usefulness for backing up hard disks is diminished by two problems: first, it does not recognize hidden files, which
are used by many copy-protection schemes, and second, it has no built-in provision for changing target disks when they
become full. (You can get around this second problem by using the /M switch and repeatedly running the same XCOPY
command for different target disks.)

> The second new program in PC-DOS 3.2 is REPLACE, yet another file copy utility. REPLACE can replace all copies
of a particular file (which may be located in various subdirectories of a hard disk) with a new version. Using a /A
switch adds the source files to the target without overwriting existing files. The manual recommends using REPLACE
after a SYS command when upgrading an existing machine to DOS 3.2.

> The third new program is DRIVER.SYS, a device driver that can be included in your CONFIG.SYS file. It lets you create
a new logical disk drive letter that references the same physical disk as an existing disk drive letter. This type of
thing happens automatically on a PC with only one disk drive: logical drive letters A and B both refer to the same
physical disk drive. DRIVER.SYS lets you do the same thing for another drive. This is most useful when installing the
external 720K-byte 3-inch disk in a PC, XT, or AT. By using DRIVER.SYS to give this disk drive a second drive letter,
you can XCOPY files from one 3-inch disk to another using the same physical drive.

> PC users who have been getting an "Out of environment space" message after executing a few too many SET commands
from batch files need no longer resort to patches or undocumented COMMAND.COM switches. If you specify COMMAND.COM
as a SHELL program in your CONFIG.SYS file, you can use the /E switch to specify your environment size up to 32K bytes.
Note that this is the same switch that worked (but was undocumented) in DOS 3.1, but the DOS 3.1 switch required a
16-byte paragraph environment size instead of bytes.

> Some smaller changes: FORMAT and DISKCOPY now support the 720K-byte 3.5-inch disk format (of course).
FORMAT 3.2 will not run unless you give it a drive letter parameter--an added barrier to accidently formating your
hard disk. ATTRIB 3.2 lets you manipulate the archive attribute of files as well as the read-only attribute.

> The elongated shape of the PC Convertible display may make printing graphics screens on the printer a problem.
You may want printed graphics to look the way they do on the Convertible display or as they would appear on a normal
display. The GRAPHICS 3.2 resident graphics screen print program lets you make this decision yourself.

> The disappointing aspects of PC-DOS 3.2 are its omissions. Although Microsoft has stated that future versions of
MS-DOS will support the Lotus/lntel/Microsoft Expanded Memory Specification, that support is not included with PC-DOS
3.2. ANSI.SYS 3.2 still does not support the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) in 43-line mode or for video pages other
than page 0. No changes at all have been made to ANSI.SYS.

> Although documentation for BASICA 3.2 did not reach the editorial offices of PC Magazine, some creative
DEBUGing and experimentation reveal five new BASICA commands. Three of these commands are EXTERR, LOCK, and UNLOCK,
corresponding to the extended error-handling and file-locking and unlocking functions of DOS 3.x. Another new BASICA
command is PCOPY, which lets you copy one video page to another.

> BASICA 3.2 also includes some support for the EGA, but this support is so minimal that it is likely to infuriate
BASIC users. The PALETTE command lets you manipulate the EGA palette registers so that you can map default colors to
other colors. This is particularly useful in medium-resolution mode because it means you're no longer stuck with the
same two sets of three colors.

> The PALETTE command is the extent of EGA support in BASICA 3.2. In fact, the SCREEN and PCOPY commands do not even
recognize the additonal video pages in the EGA's 80-column text mode. Support of the EGA graphics modes is nowhere to
be seen.

> PC-DOS 3.2 gives the PC user a couple of extra tools that would certainly be worth a $30 update charge.
Unfortunately, there is no update policy for DOS, so you'll be shelling out the full $95 for it. That's obviously too
much money. But for those who spend many hours at their PCs, keeping up with the latest DOS version comes with the
territory.
