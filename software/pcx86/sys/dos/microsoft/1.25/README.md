There was no MS-DOS 1.25 product *per se*.  Instead, there were OEM releases of MS-DOS based on version 1.25,
including:

* [COMPAQ MS-DOS 1.10](/software/pcx86/sys/dos/compaq/1.10/)
* [COMPAQ MS-DOS 1.11](/software/pcx86/sys/dos/compaq/1.11/)
* [COMPAQ MS-DOS 1.12](/software/pcx86/sys/dos/compaq/1.12/)
