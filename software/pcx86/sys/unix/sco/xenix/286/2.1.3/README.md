### SCO Xenix 286 Installation and Emulation Notes

The following notes are courtesy of the [OS/2 Museum](http://www.os2museum.com/):

> The serial number and activation key are needed for serializing the kernel as well as for the "Link Kit" (which is just
enough tools/libraries/objects to relink the kernel).

> To install, it should be enough to follow the on-screen prompts.  It's simplest to let it create a single partition, which
takes up the whole disk, no bad tracks, and no separate /u filesystem.  Use defaults when possible.
  
> The "N1" disk is always the boot disk.  Depending on the media type, there may be a "filesystem" disk, which is then "N2".

> Potential emulation issues:

> 1. The fixed disk parameter table (pointed to by INT 41h) must not be in RAM; whether itâ€™s in the EBDA or at 300:0
(typical modern choices), old XENIX versions zap it
> 2. The **INITIALIZE DEVICE PARAMETERS** disk command needs to take a millisecond or two to execute; it must not complete instantly
> 3. For some old XENIX versions, the **RECALIBRATE** command also needs to take non-zero time
> 4. Hard disk must use 1:1 logical/physical geometry (BIOS and ATA interface), limiting the size to about 500MB
