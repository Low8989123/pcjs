The IBM PC XT below originally booted from the "QNX 1.2 BOOT" diskette, but has since been upgraded with the
10mb hard disk image created by [Mihai Gaitos](https://hawk.ro/qnx12_pcjs/).
See [Reverse-engineering QNX 1.2 to boot from HDD](https://virtuallyfun.com/wordpress/2021/02/13/reverse-engineering-qnx-1-2-to-boot-from-hdd/)
