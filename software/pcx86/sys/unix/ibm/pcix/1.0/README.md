From [WinWorld](https://winworldpc.com/product/pc-ix):

> Interactive UNIX, also known as PC/IX, and 386/ix were UNIX System V derivatives created for the IBM PC in the
early 1980's.  PC/IX was the first UNIX sold directly from IBM, but not the first UNIX sold for the IBM PC (Venix/86
was the first).  The original PC/IX software sold was on 19 floppy disks and sold for 900 dollars.  In 1985,
386/ix was introduced, later named Interactive UNIX.  The last version released was 4.1.1 in July 1998 and was
supported up until 2006.
