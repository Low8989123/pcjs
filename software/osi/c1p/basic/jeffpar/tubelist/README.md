## [TUBELIST.BAS](#listing)

By {{ site.author }}

My dad used to have a large collection of vacuum tubes, and this program was a proof-of-concept for a simple inventory
program.  However, it wasn't very practical, because to update the "inventory", you had to edit the program and write it
back to cassette tape.  And if you just wanted to search for a tube, well, it was obviously much faster to simply look through
the actual collection than wait for this program to load from tape.

But, those were the early days of personal computing, where practicality was a secondary consideration (if it was a consideration at all).
I was just always looking for an excuse to write another program.
