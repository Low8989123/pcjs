NOTE: I suspect the dump of the tape containing this machine-language program is either damaged or incomplete, which is unfortunate, because these were a nice set of [Enhancements and Patches](1981-07-23--OSI_BASIC_Enhancement_Notes.pdf) that I had created around 1980-1981 for the Microsoft BASIC Interpreter that came with the OSI Challenger 1P.  Hopefully I'll find time to dig into this again and figure what the problem is.
