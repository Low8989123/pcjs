RK03 (or more precisely, RK03-KA) disks are single-platter cartridges with a capacity of 2.38Mb.
They are used in RK05 disk drives in conjunction with an [RK11 Disk Controller](/machines/dec/pdp11/rk11/).

RL01K and RL02K disks are single-platter cartridges with capacities of 5Mb and 10Mb, respectively,
They are used in RL01 and RL02 disk drives with an [RL11 Disk Controller](/machines/dec/pdp11/rl11/).

RX01 diskettes are single-sided, with 77 tracks per side, 26 sectors per track, and a sector size of 128 bytes,
for a total capacity of 250Kb (256,256 bytes).  They are used in RX01 disk drives in conjunction with an
[RX11 Disk Controller](/machines/dec/pdp11/rx11/).
